the holy grail seek by all government of whichever hue be economic growth i therefore think it important for we to look through the lens of economic growth and to think about whether the bill drive it i recall from my time in committee where i spend many hour listen to the oratory of   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith that we speak a great deal about productivity and whether it would be drive by the bill 
 i have speak about the possible impact of the bill to people in my community include representative of enlightened hr and alison bennett a human resource consultant for whom its destination be very welcome indeed we have hear from many other people who have be consult that the bill ’s destination and aspiration be correct and appropriate but it be a question of how we get there and whether the government have achieve the right balance between employer and employee that be important because the last thing we want the bill to do be have a chilling effect on the economy we be only too well aware that the national insurance contribution that be set to kick in next month be already have that negative impact and we do not want this well intend bill to echo that far 
 there be amendment before we at this late stage of the legislation the minister say that that be due to level of consultation and so forth and should be welcome and that we be trim our sail but if that be the case and if the minister be in such listen mode in committee why do the government accept no opposition amendment whatsoever i should welcome some reflection from the minister when he wind up the debate 
 as a liberal democrat and the liberal democrat spokesman for the department for work and pensions i can say that carer be at the front and centre of our world what be effectively the population of portsmouth—200,000 people a year or a day walk away from the employment market to take up caring occupation and in many instance support family member that have an £ annual impact on our economy which leave we less productive i hope that the government will give serious thought to our amendment to make leave for carer a pay opportunity because give they that flexibility and that breathe space would unlock more people for our employment market 
 our proposal to make care a protect characteristic be extremely important we have already hear about harassment and discrimination in connection with other part of the bill but this would help immensely to support carer double the pay of those take adoption leave be also important as be support for people who take caring role such as kinship care i hope that the ministers will take those family role into account 
 i be afraid i do not have time because i want to respond to the issue that the right hon member for belfast east raise 
 the right hon member rightly highlight that a number of trouble relate case have a cross border dimension include the kingsmill murder which be an appalling example of the pain and suffering inflict on civilian during the trouble it be right to acknowledge that the implementation of truly holistic legacy mechanism which can provide family across the uk and ireland with as much information as possible about the circumstance of their particular case will require the co operation of both the uk and irish government to facilitate the disclosure of information hold by authority in both jurisdiction this government consider the irish government to be an essential partner in the process of seek a way forward on legacy issue that be human right compliant and can command public confidence across community 
 turn to the omagh bombing inquiry last month ’s commemorative hearing be a painful reminder of the impact of cowardly terrorist action on community and family victim do not need hearing inquiry or commemorative day to know that they live with it every day the secretary of state have receive political assurance from the irish government on their full co operation with the uk inquiry that be important and should be welcome the irish government be currently work at pace to determine how to facilitate   that in practice through a memorandum of understanding the right hon gentleman ’s comment in the chamber today will not have go unnoticed the detail of those arrangement be ultimately a matter for the inquiry which rightly be independent of the government but i agree with he that they should provide for the great possible level of co operation from irish authority the government look forward to see those detail in due course in the meantime our focus remain on ensure that the uk inquiry that have be establish can successfully fulfil its term of reference 
 i close by remember all those who have be kill by cowardly terrorist act i pay tribute to everyone who be carry on not get over what happen but get on and work around the gap of the people they lose or of their own life that they have before despite the grief that can engulf they they be get up every day when it be not get easy remember people who should be here and be not they be not give up on get answer and justice for their relative family and friend in the memory of all who have die we will keep take action against terrorism and for peace and justice we will remember

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to use technology to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system 
 this government inherit an analogue justice system that have not keep pace with a digital world technology can and must transform the justice system since take office we have expand the use of tagging we be pilot new technology to automate manual work in the justice system and i have launch a new unit justice ai to far develop the use of artificial intelligence 
 the recent announcement of sit day be welcome but we need to use technology to streamline our justice system between and we see a reduction in case be conclude what plan do the government have to use emerge new tech to enhance court processing get fast justice for victim and help manage offender in the community include through ankle tag to enforce exclusion zone and drug and alcohol testing 
 my hon friend raise an incredibly important point we need to make sure that the whole justice system include what happen in our criminal court be as efficient as it can be that be why i have commission sir brian leveson to conduct an independent review of the criminal court he will consider how to improve the court efficiency and we will report on that later in the year there will be i believe a wide role for technology to play in tagging and monitoring of exclusion zone and curfew i want to make sure that the justice system be in the good possible position to make use of emerge technology so that we can keep our country safe 
 the lord chancellor will accept that the effective use of electronic tag will not only make the criminal justice system more efficient but mitigate the need for expensive prison place do she agree that thing be necessary for that effective use the tag must be technically reliable secondly official in her department must have   the commercial capacity to manage the contract efficiently if she agree what can be do to improve both those thing 
 the right hon and learn gentleman raise incredibly important point there will be a big role for current new and emerge technology in the future of our justice system particularly in expand the range of punishment available to we outside of prison i want to make sure that we be at the forefront of get the good use of our current technology and emerge tech he be absolutely right about make sure that any commercial contract be value for money and maintain public confidence i be ensure that across the department we have expertise available to we which be why the new unit that i have set up justice ai will be so crucial to our effort 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 under the justice secretary ’s leadership her department let out dozen of dangerous prisoner by mistake last year now we have uncover that criminal who be let out early by her department be not monitor for up to week as they be not fit with electronic tag it be another glaring error will the justice secretary clear up some confusion how many criminal do her department fail to tag be any offence commit while these criminal go unmonitored and who have be hold accountable for this gross incompetence 
 i be really concerned for the health of the shadow justice secretary because he appear to have amnesia he have forget who be in government just a few short month ago he appear to have entirely forget that it be the previous government who let the tagging contract to serco which i have inherit i have make it clear that the delay that we have see be totally unacceptable although the backlog have be significantly reduce serco ’s performance be still not good enough and although last year ’s backlog of outstanding visit have be substantially reduce it be down to normal level i will continue to hold it to account and will not hesitate to impose further financial penalty where necessary 
 we can all see that the justice secretary have no answer to my question if her department can not even tag prisoner properly why should the public have any confidence in her plan to use tag in place of short prison sentence the threshold for a prison sentence be already high often criminal have commit multiple offence before they be consider for prison which be why scrap short sentence will endanger the public and will serve as a green light for criminality will the justice secretary take this opportunity to reassure the public and rule out reduce sentence for burglary theft or shoplifting it be a simple question yes or no 
 the public will know that when the right hon gentleman ’s government leave office prison be on the point of collapse they can have confidence that this government will fix the mess that his party leave behind we will ensure that prison place be always available for everyone who need to be lock up to keep the public safe we will expand the range of   punishment outside prison and crucially we will ensure that those who enter the prison system can be help to turn their back on crime that be the good strategy for cut crime and that his party never choose 
 whether she plan to release land own by her department at springhill road to the springhill road residents association 
 as the hon member will know from his meeting with the minster for prisons in the other place currently there be no plan to release land at springhill road the ministry of justice be work closely with local representative to ensure that we bring benefit to the local community as part of the new prison build 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer and for the prisons minister ’s time last summer notwithstanding our local opposition to a new prison it be an absurdity that have be go on for year that the moj own the green the lamppost and the public lighting on the springhill road estate adjacent to hmp spring hill even though they be of no use to the moj and there be no benefit to the prison estate the resident association be willing to take those green and care for they so that kid can play on they and resident can use they will the minister look again at get the land transfer because it be of no benefit to he or his department 
 under the last government only prison place be create by contrast the last labour government deliver the lord chancellor have set out her ambition to deliver new place by almost of those will be provide by the new prison in the hon gentleman ’s constituency if he write to i about the specific concern of the resident association i will be happy to respond 
 what step she be take through the criminal justice system to help prevent defendant abscond before their trial 
 the decision to remand or bail an individual be solely a matter for the independent judiciary court be require to considered the likelihood of absconding as part of that decision the court have the power to impose a broad range of robust bail condition in the bail package include electronic monitoring exclusion zone and curfew this government be commit to ensure that criminal face justice and victim have peace of mind and closure 
 after the conviction of man for a string of horrendous child rape in my constituency i would like to be able to inform the secretary of state that all those man be now serve their just punishment however of they abscond from their trial and   be believe to be abroad their exact whereabouts be an open secret in keighley it be a shocking failure of the justice system that those man be still walk free do the minister agree that if a dual or foreign national be charge with disgusting child rape crime court should be require to put term on their bail that prevent they from leave the country during their trial so that they can not walk free after their horrendous heinous crime 
 i understand that the case to which the hon gentleman refer take place under the last government and the man he refer to be try in absentia the home secretary set out the step that the government be take to tackle the terrible crime of child sexual exploitation and abuse include group base child sexual exploitation through the crime and policing bill we be legislate to make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offence to ensure that it be properly reflect in the sentencing of perpetrator 
 what step she be take to reduce the cost of court transcript for victim 
 the government recognise just how important accessing transcript can be for certain victim that be why transcript of sentencing remark be available free of charge to the family of victim of fatal road offence murder and manslaughter it be also why this government be run a year pilot that offer free sentencing remark to victim of rape and sexual offence that be due to conclude in may we be also look in the round at how we lower the cost of obtain a court transcript through increase use of technology 
 the previous government launch a pilot scheme to provide free sentencing remark to victim of sexual violence however thousand of eligible survivor only find out about it month after it start poor communication mean that victim miss out on the opportunity for some closure will the justice secretary confirm whether the pilot have be properly evaluate whether its finding will be make public and what step will be take to improve awareness and accessibility for those who need to use the scheme 
 the hon member be absolutely right that initially there be not enough uptake the government act to drum up awareness of the scheme precisely because we want to test its effectiveness for victim of rape and serious sexual offence i reassure she that application number be up we be conduct the evaluation and once we have the result we will be able to test whether we can implement the scheme in the future 
 what step her department be take to help support victim of knife crime through the criminal justice system 
 the ministry of justice provide funding for victim support service to help victim recover from the impact of crime include knife crime the government have commit to the creation of a new programme young futures which will offer support to child who be at risk of be draw into crime in a more systemic way 
 do the minister agree that the support she have outline for the victim of knife   crime will continue to be essential in our justice system and that it be essential to work alongside devolve administration to raise awareness of the tragic   impact of knife crime on community across the uk community in glenrothes and mid fife feel particularly strongly about knife crime and about the sale of knife online follow deeply concern knife offence involve young people 
 i thank my hon friend for that really important question as a member of parliament represent a devolved nation i wholly agree it be important that we work across the board to tackle this issue which be not solely about england all of we must do well the government be take firm action and put in place strong consequence for carry a knife they be also crack down on the sale of dangerous knife and have announce ronan ’s law a range of measure that will include strict rule for online retailer sell knife 
 i welcome the step that the government be take to address knife crime and anything that can be do to reduce the number of young people who be draw into this type of violence how will the new offence of possess a knife with violent intent differ from exist legislation relate to possession of an article with a blade or point or possession of an offensive weapon how far will the law go when it come to prove intent will it refer only to the posture of the individual when arrest for example they may have be catch in the act of a machete style fight or will it have regard to other factor such as someone appear in a scoreboard video on social medium 
 i welcome that question my understanding be that the hon member be a member of the crime and policing bill committee that will be scrutinise the legislation 
 indicate dissent 
 be he not i will welcome engagement with he though and his scrutiny as the legislation progress through the house the government be increase penalty for illegal sale of knife and be fund a new online police co ordination hub which will take action against illegal knife and weapon content online we also intend to consult later this year on the registration scheme for the online selling of knife a lot of work be be do in this space and i look forward to engage with he far on it 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 i want to acknowledge something horrific that happen in my constituency over the weekend in talbot green my constituent joanne penney be tragically shoot and kill on sunday night i pay tribute to the police who take swift action and my thought be of course with the victim her friend and her family she will be mourn by our whole community her loss have be deeply feel 
 the government have make an unprecedented commitment to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade that be underpin by our new strategy which will be publish shortly we have introduce new offence of create deepfake intimate image and take intimate image without consent we have also launch a new domestic abuse protection order in select area include in cleveland just last week and we be determined to do more 
 i be sure that the thought of the whole house be with the minister ’s constituent joanne and i be sorry for that loss the scale of violence against woman and girl in my constituency of leeds north west and across the country be intolerable our manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl by the end of the decade which the minister mention be much need and ambitious how will her department contribute to deliver this critical commitment specifically what step do her department plan to take to reduce the backlog of domestic violence case and to support victim of domestic abuse 
 the government be determined to meet our ambitious target of halve violence against woman and girl over the course of a decade i proudly co chair our cross government working group with the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips to look at how we can bring every government department to the table this issue be not just for the ministry of justice or home office to tackle the onus be on all of we every department and all of society to do well if we be to reach the target 
 we have fund a record number of crown court sit day to hit the backlog and tackle it head on the majority of domestic abuse case be hear in the magistrate court and we be determined to do more to reach vulnerable victim 
 may i thank the minister for her answer and also extend my thought to joanne ’s family and friend 
 in recent year woman and girl have increasingly express distrust in the ability of the justice system to resolve case of violence and sexual harassment as so few of those event result in prosecution what step be the minister take to restore trust in the justice system so that my constituent in erewash know that they have somewhere to turn when they be target by such hate crime 
 as part of this government ’s safe street mission we have commit to improve confidence in the police and the criminal justice system we will introduce specialist rape and sexual offence team in every police force as well as domestic abuse expert in control room we will also give victim of adult rape access to an independent legal adviser to help they understand and uphold their right from day i want every victim whether in erewash or in pontypridd to know that they be hear and that this government support they 
 may i associate myself with colleague comment about the tragic event in the minister ’s constituency 
 back in a young woman in my constituency be the victim of an alleged assault even now in she advise that there have be no trial and she worry that she could run into the accuse around town what can be do to expedite such case in which violence be allege to well protect our citizen and ensure that our street be safe from crime 
 the government be commit to bear down on the caseload and bring wait time down for victim since july we have put more funding into crown court so that they will have their great capacity ever and we have double magistrate sentence power to free up time for the crown court so that they can hear the most serious case we have also commission sir brian leveson to recommend once in a generation reform to our criminal court and we look forward to receive his report in the spring 
 i recently meet a distressed constituent who escape a very abusive marriage only for the court to order a financial settlement that allow her ex husband to still exert financial control over she i be shock to discover that the financial remedy court rely on outdated legislation the matrimonial causes act which do not allow domestic abuse to be take into consideration in a settlement what consideration have the minister give to the law commission ’s recent scoping report on the issue which recommend significant reform 
 this government be determined to tackle all form of abuse include financial abuse i be aware of the report that the hon lady mention we be consider the finding closely and will report back soon 
 i go to visit a lady in ashfield who have be beat black and blue and then lock in a cupboard by her boyfriend he be arrest and she make a statement but because of his control behaviour in the relationship he be in   control of the finance and be also her employer she have he back when she finally have the courage to kick he out the police would not prosecute the man what can this government do to ensure that woman who be victim of these animal can go to the police at any time even when their partner have go 
 i apologise for the horrific circumstance that the hon gentleman ’s constituent find herself in that be intolerable and no victim in our country no woman or girl should ever feel that way if he want to write to i with the specific of the case i will gladly look into it more closely this government be determined to restore faith and justice in the criminal justice system as a whole in policing our court our probation service every element of it from the bottom up and the top down i look forward to hear more from the hon gentleman on that case 
 the impact of crown court delay on victim victim service and the wide criminal justice system be troubling to many of many affected wokingham resident be a survivor of domestic violence and sexual assault that begin decade ago she have have numerous court hearing adjourn will the minister tell my constituent how these injustice will be end 
 this government inherit a justice system in crisis with record crown court caseload that continue to rise that have have an impact on far too many victim include the hon gentleman ’s constituent since july we have put more funding into crown court so that they will have their great capacity ever and we have double magistrate sentence power so that crown court can focus specifically on serious crime we be committed to bear down on that caseload and bring wait time down while also protect victim funding and introduce domestic abuse protection order to protect victim in pilot area 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 on behalf of the liberal democrats i start by associate myself with the comment make at the beginning in relation to joanne so many victim and survivor rely on the victim contact scheme to know when their abuser be be release from prison or move to an open prison and to have input into the kind of condition that should exist when they be release however the system that we have inherit from the last government be such that only survivor whose abuser have be convict for more than month qualify for the scheme in the upcoming victim courts and public protection bill will the minister commit to scrap that threshold so that all victim and survivor can qualify for the scheme 
 we be look carefully at the victim notification scheme as part of any forthcoming legislation to ensure that victim right be take into full consideration and that victim be aware of the situation if that be deem appropriate i look forward to work with they closely and i have no doubt about how we should develop the good and strong possible law to support the victim of all crime in our country 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of ensure that all prison leaver receive resettlement support from mentor 
 the ministry of justice recognise the benefit of mentor in resettlement and be currently review our approach to peer mentoring to make sure it be consistent and effective there be many excellent organisation deliver a range of peer lead rehabilitation support include ingeus wizer and the wise group 
 at my surgery a couple of week ago i have fantastic volunteer show up from sutton night watch a local homeless charity they have be work with prisoner both before and after they leave their cell to help they reintegrate into the community they be do fantastic work but they now need to expand they need more space and more people can the minister explain what support be available to volunteer like they to help they to do their work with prisoner 
 i applaud the work that the hon member describe it be certainly the sort of work that need to continue overall the level of homelessness and rough sleeping that we have inherit be far too high we be work closely with the ministry of housing communities and local government to develop a long term strategy to put we back on track to end homelessness if he wish to write to i about that particular case i will follow it up 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 as part of the justice committee ’s work on rehabilitation i have come across some excellent project on prevent reoffende such as revolving doors peer support and key4life that use reform ex offender as mentor on a visit to wormwood scrubs prison last month i see the right course restaurant which get almost of its trainee into employment on release what be the government do to support and expand successful rehabilitation project like these 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his identification of these very good action that be go on within the prison estate the prison service be keen to encourage all this sort of activity and i will follow this up with my hon friend directly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the effort to help prison leaver to reintegrate but i be concerned that this government will soon be keep people out of prison who should be there as part of their proper punishment for offend the government commission a sentencing review run on that very premise and that review recently release its interim report can the minister point to anywhere in that entire page report that have anything to say about the evidence of what victim want 
 the sentencing review ’s interim report describe the situation at the moment and it be the stage of that independent review ’s address this long stand issue frankly this be something that the conservatives spend the last year avoid tackle that is—[interruption i will leave it there 
 the house will have hear very starkly that the minister do not offer i any clarity i can help he by tell he that there be not word anywhere on the expectation of victim of crime and their families—[interruption not word bad than that it cherry pick evidence from report to support a narrative that an ill inform public do not know what they want and do not understand do the minister agree that for that review to have any credibility whatsoever it must engage seriously with what victim and the public want when it come to the use of prison for the punishment of serious offender 
 we hear fully the commitment from the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones and the lord chancellor that victim be front and centre of our approach to fix the mess that the conservatives leave we there be a victim representative on the panel as the hon member well know victim be fully involve and engage in this i have sadly meet too many victim in this role and i have encourage all of they to contribute to the report and commit to they that they will be fully involve in the implementation of the report instead of carp from the sideline try to get cheap soundbite it be about time the conservatives roll their sleeve up and try to help we sort out their mess 
 what step her department plan to take to reduce the backlog of domestic violence case 
 the judiciary prioritise case involve vulnerable victim and witness which include those involve domestic abuse most domestic abuse case be hear in magistrate court where case tend to   be hear more quickly as i have already state the government have take action to address the outstanding caseload in the crown court fund record level of sit day in the upcoming financial year 
 the backlog in the court system harm effort to instil confidence in woman persist with domestic violence charge against their abuser violence against woman and girl be a national scandal and femicide be ongoing with countless woman lose their life to male violence sadly my region of merseyside be now the high region in the country for femicide do the department agree that any move to fast track case via the criminal or civil court to remove abuser from our street must involve appropriately severe sentence irrespective of the prison place crisis 
 i thank my hon friend for that important and timely question we take all form of homicide extremely seriously and our strategy which will be publish later this week look at tackle violence against woman and girl will cover all form of   violence and abuse that disproportionately impact woman include femicide we will of course prioritise tackle violence against woman and girl which be why we have fund record number of crown court sitting day we be extend the power of the victim commissioner and strengthen the victim code we have protect funding for victim service look at domestic abuse rape and sexual offence to ensure that victim be listen to and be put at the heart of the criminal justice system 
 for last week ’s international women ’s day the under secretary of state for the home department   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips   read out the name of the woman who be kill in the last year i be always conscious of the loss of life as i know the minister be if domestic violence today be the violence against woman and murder tomorrow what can be do to support woman and their child 
 we be do everything we can to support woman and their child we have declare this a national emergency and we have that ambition of target and halve violence against woman and girl over the course of a decade my personal ambition be that the name read out at this dispatch box next year be far few than the one read out this year 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of trend in the level of illegal drug use in prison 
 this government inherit prison in crisis overcrowded violent and rife with drug if we be to have regime that reduce reoffende and cut crime we have to crack down on drug in prison to do so we must address the supply of drug and prison use a range of tactic include x ray body scanner and baggage scanner we must also tackle demand over of our prison now have drug free wing 
 before less than of seize substance contain anabolic steroid in it be with anabolic steroid be the most prevalent drug class detect in scottish prison will the lord chancellor meet i and dr jayasena and dr grant who be national lead on the topic from imperial college to look at conduct research into the impact of steroid on offend and the prison population 
 i pay tribute to the hon member for his long record of campaign on this particular issue it be an important point and i will ensure that he can meet the prisons minister and look at what further research might be need in this area 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 the government ’s plan to support woman offender be clear and ambitious to reduce the number of woman go to prison our new woman ’s justice board will support the implementation of the plan this government have take immediate action to ensure that girl will never again be hold in youth offender institution follow the publication last week of susannah hancock ’s review into girl in the youth estate 
 self harm in prison be now at the high rate ever record in woman ’s prison the rate be time high than in man ’s prison shockingly in female prisoner have self harm do my hon friend share my deep concern about those figure and what be the department do to tackle that issue effectively 
 i certainly share my hon friend ’s deep concern about that issue which she be right to raise good relationship between staff and prisoner be essential in our effort to identify and manage the risk of suicide and self harm we be provide specialist support to establishment roll out tailor investment include specialised training for new officer recruit psychologist to support woman and pilot a compassion focus therapy group design for woman 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the independent sentencing review ’s interim report publish on february 
 i will not pre empt the final report of the sentencing review but let we remember the crisis that we be deal with the previous government ramp up sentence but add just cell throughout the entire time they be in office just today we have hear example of member who do not want any prison building in their area this government will build new prison place but even that will not be enough to get we out of the mess leave by the previous administration that be why i have ask the independent sentencing review to recommend sentencing policy that will ensure that we never again run out of space 
 the government will consider alternative to prison and early release but how be the public to have any confidence whatsoever when the government release prisoner early and leave they to roam the street for week before fix tag 
 as i say in answer to an early question we be hold serco to account and we ensure that the tagging backlog from the change to sds40 standard determinate sentence be clear as quickly as possible we have levy financial penalty against that company we continue to monitor performance and will not hesitate to take further action if we need to conservative members have to wake up to the reality of their own track record in government they fail to build the prison place that we need to keep up with the sentence that they keep impose which have leave we with an almighty mess to clear up we be get on with the job 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the independent sentencing review and the justice secretary have be take inspiration from texas when it come to reform our criminal justice system she might be aware that texas have a dedicated set of domestic abuse aggravate offence to help protect and respect survivor will she support i and liberal democrat colleague in introduce proposal to the crime and policing bill in order to make similar change to the law in england and wales 
 i have not yet see the hon gentleman ’s proposal which may be on their way but i will look at they carefully he will know that the picture be complex even jurisdiction with a catch all domestic abuse offence face issue ensure that it keep up with the type of behaviour that they be try to stamp out and that other offence do not fall off so there be technical issue in how such law work in practice i would be happy to have further such conversation with he i know this matter be of great interest to he and to member across the house 
 what step her department be take to help tackle intimate image abuse 
 we be determined to keep victim safe both offline and online in the crime and policing bill we have introduce offence to tackle the taking or recording of intimate image without consent and in the data use and access bill we be criminalise create or ask someone to create deepfake intimate image without consent together with exist offence on share intimate image those measure give law enforcement a comprehensive package to tackle all aspect of that degrading and abusive behaviour 
 i pay tribute to the minister for the work be do although that work be welcome we need to direct our attention towards ensure that police have the necessary technical tool to investigate report will she meet i to discuss what further action can be take to address and prevent intimate image abuse in all our community 
 i will happily meet my hon friend but let i reassure he we be launch within police our national centre for violence against woman and girl and public protection that include a £ funding settlement to target violence against woman and girl well include online and in november we launch our domestic abuse protection order in select area to improve protection for victim of all kind of domestic abuse include online the police be also able to use stalk protection order to protect victim of online abuse 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 this government inherit a prison system on the verge of collapse under the last government in year only prison place be produce under the last labour government there be a net increase of prison place in year we be redouble our effort to match that number 
 the prison capacity crisis that this government inherit have result in persistent offender not feel the deterrent effect of a custody option be realistically available can the minister tell we how this government ’s prison building plan will restore a level of deterrence to the system and ensure that capacity be available in time to remove active offender from the street 
 where they be block we be build build build hmp millsike the uk ’s all electric prison will open in just a few week and deliver place just last week the prisons minister   in the other place attend a groundbreaking at hmp highpoint and we have already secure full planning permission for a new prison in leicestershire and outline planning permission for a new prison in buckinghamshire we be get on with the job 
 the minister will know that the increase in prisoner number be often because of the logjam within the crown court system and there be too many on remand who be then convict and release with time serve with no opportunity for rehabilitation or mentoring will he confirm that that form part of the sentencing review or the leveson review 
 that be why we be do this big system relook the right hon member be right to draw attention to this we be go to tackle it and sort   it out 
 what support she have provide to prison that have receive an urgent notification since july 
 i thank the hon member for draw attention to the terrible legacy we inherit from the previous government the prisons minister in the other place have personally visit of the prison that have recently receive urgent notification wandsworth winchester and manchester and plan to visit the as soon as possible he have strengthen the un process and meet regularly with governor and senior official to challenge they and assure himself that sufficient progress be be make 
 i thank the minister for that answer prison officer do an important job and i thank every officer at downview prison in banstead it be extremely concern that the number of assault on staff at downview more than double between and what step be he take to ensure that officer be protect in their day to day job 
 as the hon member rightly say prison officer do an outstanding job the work of the prison service be to make sure they be properly support and protect in that role and that be what be go on 
 what step she be take to tackle backlog in the court 
 the last government leave a mess in every single corner of our justice system our criminal court and our civil court in the process they let down not just victim of crime but business employee employer and child in care every part of our system be leave in a complete mess that be what we be sort out with record crown court sitting day a commitment of sit day and run almost to a maximum across all jurisdiction to bring down the backlog we be sort out the mess that we be leave with 
 i agree with the minister ’s assessment of the previous conservative government however with more than case still in the backlog for magistrate have the government do an assessment of whether that will increase give the double sentencing power that have be pass down to those court 
 the magistrate court be be run in a sustainable way we extend the sentencing power in order to free up capacity in the crown court and that have be sustainable and we be increase capacity in our magistracy by recruit an additional magistrate from diverse background every year but that be why we be look at system reform whether in the magistrate court or the crown court we be go to need once in a generation reform and when sir brian leveson report back that be what we will get 
 shockingly just of rape and sexual offence report to derbyshire police in the last year result in a charge when offender be not prosecute victim understandably lose faith in our justice system what step have the minister take to reduce backlog in derbyshire court so that justice can be serve for these despicable crime 
 i be sorry to hear how long victim in my hon friend ’s constituency be wait that be why we be take urgent action to bear down on the crown court backlog not only by increase sitting day this year but by commit to record number of sit day next year of course that will not be sufficient to bring down the backlog and deliver swifter justice for victim and that be why we need to hear from sir brian leveson and implement reform in due course 
 what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog 
 this government be fund a record crown court sitting day which be more   than the previous government fund to bring down the backlog we must embrace reform and that be why i have launch an independent review into the efficiency of the criminal court lead by sir brian leveson this government will deliver swifter justice for victim 
 in case be dispose of conclude in the crown court that figure be never achieve again by the conservative party and by the figure be low conservative member like to blame covid for everything but there be problem in the system well before that there have be a systematic failure to modernise process in our court for year as we on the justice committee hear far too often what more can we do to use technology to make our court more efficient and most importantly ensure fast outcome for victim 
 my hon friend be right to note the issue of fall disposal in layman ’s term the number of case that be complete the rate of disposal have indeed fall in recent year which why i have ask sir brian leveson as part of his review to consider how we improve the efficiency of our court include further technical or ai relate reform that might assist case to move more quickly through the system we will need a pronged approach more funding which i have already deliver once in a generation reform which sir brian leveson be look at and go far and fast on productivity and efficiency in the system that be how we will get swifter justice for victim 
 the backlog in our criminal justice system mean that offender in my constituency be free to commit crime while wait for the judicial process i meet sussex police and resident last week and hear how the backlog be make the already hard job of the police even hard and resident live a misery how do the secretary of state plan on tackle those backlog which be lead to offender roam free and more crime be commit 
 we be already tackle those issue and as soon i come into office i increase the number of sit day by on what i inherit from the previous administration i have increase the sentencing power of magistrate court and increase funding for legal aid criminal legal aid underpin the whole system and for the next financial year we be fund a record crown court sitting day that combine with once in a generation reform of the court to deal with the demand come into the system and go far on productivity and efficiency be how we will deal with the problem that the hon member rightly note 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the government inherit prison on the point of collapse and a record and rise backlog in our court month into office the work of restore justice in this country be well under way since the last justice question i have announce record   investment in our court and next year crown court will sit for up to day which be the high allocation in record history i have also announce vital reform to the probation service increase its focus on medium and high risk offender alongside recruit new probation officer 
 i also visit texas where a tough and smart approach have reduce reoffende cut crime to its low level in the us since the 1960 and bring its prison population under control there be much that we will learn from that law and order state particularly how we get offender to turn their back on a life of crime through our plan for change the government be deliver swifter justice use punishment to cut crime and make our street safe 
 on average more than people every week across the uk die from drug relate cause that be more than family and home devaste each year by that tragic loss of life include more than in northern ireland alone will the secretary of state commit to work with each of the devolved administrations to prioritise prevention and review enforcement against the use of all illegal substance 
 the hon gentleman make an incredibly important point fix the problem that he note require work by not just the ministry of justice but the devolve administrations and the home office i will ensure that he can engage with the relevant ministers on the issue he raise 
 last year assault on prison staff be up by and serious assault be up by yet the pensionable age of prison officer be still it be simply too late can the minister update the house on any discussion he may have have with official regard that industrial injustice and say when these loyal public servant might expect to see this long stand issue correct 
 we recognise the unique and challenging role that prison officer play in protect the public and reduce reoffende the lord chancellor have request advice from official on the pension age of prison officer and we will continue to engage with trade union as we work through this complex issue while consider the wide fiscal context i be meet   the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan   to discuss this important issue next week and i be very happy for my hon friend to join that meeting if he wish 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 yesterday the sentencing council issue a letter correct the justice secretary it make it clear that the new sentencing guideline be not the same as the draft guidance under the last government and explain that her department support the new tier guidance her representative be at the meeting and it be approve on   january her official be even give a walkthrough on   march a dummy ’s guide to tier justice after i bring that to her attention last wednesday her team brief the   paper that she be incandescent be she incandescent at her official or at her own failure to read her paper and do her job properly 
 the shadow lord chancellor ’s amnesia continue because he clearly have not do his homework he have forget that his government be consult extensively on this guidance it also appear that he can not read because the letter state very clearly all the consultation that take place under his government it show that they be consult numerous time on the new guidance and welcome it i notice that he do not refer to that he know full well that the change he refer to be a minor change because the reference to race ethnicity and cultural background have be retain in the time his government see it and the change that occur so he can not hide behind that the last few day have therefore be an expert lesson from the right hon gentleman he have teach we all how to throw the shadow transport secretary under a bus 
 as a lawyer herself i would have think that the justice secretary would know the difference between the last set of guidance and the new i say as a lawyer but in this cabinet we never really know who be a real lawyer and who be just pretend to be in day time by the justice secretary ’s own admission we will have tier justice her plan to fix that will not come into effect for a year and that be unacceptable as she have be too lazy to do her job i will do it for she today i be present a bill to block these tier sentencing guideline and fix her mess it be here and ready to go will she support it will she stand with we on the conservative benches for equality under the law or will it be tier justice with she and tier keir 
 the whole house can see that the only pretence at a job be the that the shadow lord chancellor be make because he be pretend to be the leader of the opposition we all know exactly what he be about my reaction to what have happen in relation to the sentencing council ’s guideline be very clear when i make the oral statement last week in this house we will never stand for a tier approach to sentencing i be actually get on with fix the problem rather than look for a bandwagon to jump on which be why i have already write to the sentencing council i will be meet it later this week and i have make it very clear that i will consider its role and its power if i need to legislate i will do so but i will ensure that whatever change i bring forward be workable and deliver the fair justice system that we all need and deserve that his government do not deliver 
 the principle of equality before the law be integral to our justice system but the new guideline from the sentencing council which be welcome by the previous government have put that principle at risk do the lord chancellor agree that conservative members have a lot of explain to do 
 i notice that in all his reference to letter the shadow lord chancellor do not refer to the letter from the previous sentencing minister now the shadow transport secretary who welcome those   guideline he know full well that that be a reference to the guideline around race ethnicity and cultural background 
 the government ’s statistic on woman in the criminal justice system show that woman be more often prosecute for much more minor offence and suffer from short prison sentence which have huge social and emotional effect on their child and increase their likelihood of be take into care what step be the department take to continue deliver the female offender strategy delivery plan for to and to reach beyond it think about the negative impact on the child of offender 
 the hon lady raise an important point that be why i set up the women ’s justice board specifically to make recommendation i believe that these be policy choice that be properly make by directly elect politician we will make progress on the situation of woman in our prison particularly those who be mother because we know that the harm pass down generation and we be determined to stop it 
 victim of rape have be consistently fail by our justice system under the tories of victim drop out of their case due to long waiting time and in my own area of bournemouth the charge rate be only give the outrage we have hear from conservative members about the court backlog and the state of our system which be leave to we by their own government can the lord chancellor please tell we what we be do to fix the problem and put victim 
 i thank my hon friend for that very important question as part of our manifesto we commit to fast track rape case through the system we be carefully consider the good way to do so and we will be able to say more about our plan shortly we be also create independent legal adviser for adult rape victim who will be able to access that support at any point from report to trial so that they know their right and their right be protect 
 the government say that foreign national offender make up of the prison population can the secretary of state tell i when that number will be 
 what i can tell the hon gentleman be that this government have make fast progress than the previous government on the deportation of foreign national offender from our prison with number that be over high than the same time last year and we will keep move forward 
 a constituent of mine age just tragically die after access pro suicide online forum that not only encourage self harm but advertise how to get lethal drug and how to exploit loophole that allow this the substance use in her death can still be buy on amazon today what step will the minister take to   close those loophole for those who enable criminality and ensure that the law be actively keep our young people safe 
 i be sorry to hear about that tragic case in my hon friend ’s constituency encourage or assist suicide be an offence under the suicide act and send communication that encourage or assist serious self harm be an offence under the online safety act but we be go to tighten up the law to address the situation that my hon friend have describe of course this be about not just the law but the enforcement of the law as well 
 we all agree that the court backlog must be clear as justice for victim be essential however be the government heed the law society ’s advice to not waste precious time and resource on an intermediate court and what engagement have they have with the law society on that 
 as the lord chancellor have say our priority be deliver swifter justice for victim and bear down on the crown court backlog that be why we have ask sir brian leveson to consider all option which have to include reclassification of offence and the intermediate court we have to have a whole system reform but i fear that if we be to exclude those option we would not be grip the problem 
 a significant proportion of those who experience homelessness be ex offender i have previously raise concern that the drive to alleviate the prison place crisis must not add to the homelessness emergency the deputy prime minister be in the process of establish an inter ministerial group on tackle homelessness will my right hon friend ’s department play a full and active role in that inter ministerial group and ensure that ministers and official from the ministry of justice be adequately represent 
 my hon friend make a very good point and the ministry of justice will play a full part in the inter ministerial group 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s attempt to prevent the sentencing council from change the sentencing process which would lead to a tier justice system if however the council will not budge as appear to be the case a tier justice system will arrive in just day contradict the key principle of the legal system that everyone should be equal before the law without discrimination will the secretary of state introduce legislation immediately to ensure that that tier justice system do not come about 
 i have already set out exactly what i be go to do i have write to the sentencing council use the power that i have to do so and i will be meet it later this week i have make it very clear that i will consider its role and power and if i need to legislate i will not hesitate to do so 
 of my constituent have endure prolong financial abuse due to draw out divorce financial order proceeding which largely ignore domestic abuse except in rare case will the minister commit to review financial settlement proceeding guidance to ensure that the impact of domestic abuse be properly consider and to prevent the legal system from be use as a tool of continue coercion and control 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question and my thought be with his constituent as she navigate this difficulty the government will consider carefully the report on financial provision on divorce in which the law commission look into the specific issue of domestic abuse as a factor later this year the government will consult on the delivery of our manifesto commitment to strengthen the right and protection of cohabit couple because all abuse be abuse financial or otherwise 
 when someone enter this country illegally from another country to which we be not allow to deport they and when they have previously express support for terrorism and terrorist organisation but not in this jurisdiction be the secretary of state content that the government have enough power to protect the community from such a person walk free in our society 
 the right hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point i be discuss with the home secretary the full range of power that we need to have at our disposal and she have already make it clear that we will not hesitate to act far if we need to however it be important that we be able to deport offender who pose a risk to our country 
 last week at a justice committee hearing it be confirm that an effective probation service be essential to the rehabilitation of offender and to prevent reoffending however over the year the service have be under immense strain owe to increase demand what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that probation officer have manageable caseload and that support be provide for their mental health and wellbee to avoid high level of stress and burnout and also to help with the recruitment and retention of staff 
 let i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the probation service my hon friend be right to draw attention to the chaotic running of the service under the last government we be actively monitor the effectiveness of the probation reset policy and assess its impact on workload capacity the time save and the increase focus on individual pose the high risk to public safety we recognise the significant pressure that probation officer have be under which be why comprehensive wellbeing support model have be put in place across our service include dedicated wellbeing lead for both prison and probation service 
 what work be the secretary of state do with the victim commissioner to ensure that the family of british citizen who be murder abroad have the same right as the family of homicide victim in the united kingdom 
 i regularly meet both the victim commissioner for england and wales and the london victims commissioner to consider all issue affect victim and their family we be strengthen the power of the victim commissioner through legislation we will be strengthen the victim code and we will of course consider any other measure that be need to protect victim and their family wherever they may be 
 on several occasion i have meet my constituent beverley whose son suffer a horrific murder he be stab more than time she have be desperately attempt to get hold of the court transcript but to no avail will minister please meet i to help this still grieve mum 
 i be really horrified to hear of that case of course as i mention early the transcript of sentencing remark should have be make available free of charge but i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss how transcript of trial more broadly can be make available 
 on radio ’s today programme last week matthew ryder kc who sit as a judge praise the extreme helpfulness of pre sentencing report for pass effective sentence will the secretary of state do as he ask and endorse the importance value and independence of the sentencing council 
 we all agree across the house i hope that pre sentencing report play a vital role in ensure that whoever be pass a sentence have all the relevant fact at their disposal i do not believe that access to such report or whether a sentencer ask for they should be dictate by race or ethnic background they should be make available and i would like to see more use of pre sentencing report across the board for every type of offender 
 manchester metropolitan university estimate that over people be convict under joint enterprise each year cost the taxpayer £ do the minister agree that we need to amend the law on joint enterprise to free up space in our prison 
 the law on joint enterprise have already develop somewhat since the previous court of appeal decision i know that the director of public prosecutions be keep under review how prosecute decision be make at this point we have no plan to go far but i be happy to ensure that my hon friend can meet the relevant minister 
 across the united kingdom inquest be define as be for the purpose of find out who the decease be and how when and where they die they be not trial and they be not about assign blame even when they be extend into article investigation yet in northern ireland we have have finding of blame in respect of sas soldier kill active terrorist do the minister agree that the crime and policing bill afford an opportunity through suitable amendment to bring uniformity to the operation of inquest across the united kingdom 
 the hon and learn gentleman be right to confirm that an inquest should be an inquisitorial process it should not be adversarial either i will raise the issue that he have mention with the secretary of state for northern ireland but what be deem to be in scope of legislation be a matter for the house authority and the leader of the house 
 prison maintenance privatisation have be a complete and utter disaster when will it be take back in house 
 we be invest approximately £ over year in prison and probation service maintenance to improve condition across our estate but it be fair to say we have inherit a system in serious need of repair the estimate cost of bring the prison estate to a fair condition and maintain it till the end of the decade be £ the programme be now under way and we hope that we will make as much progress as possible 
 rise 
 if member keep stand it make it easy for i 
 of the key objective of the sentencing council be to ensure that there be parity of sentence up and down the country it be a know fact that people from ethnic minority sometimes get tough custodial sentence than their white counterpart for similar offence give that do the lord chancellor regret her attempt to discredit the consider and evidence base conclusion of some of the most esteemed member of our judiciary when they publish the guideline on pre sentencing report 
 what i be shocked about be that we can see a disparity in the overall cohort sentencing outcome everybody accept that we be not quite sure why it be happen and there have not be sufficient curiosity over the last few year to work out why that be the case my view be that if we can see a problem or think we have we need to get to the bottom of what be actually go on before we start come up with broad policy solution to fix that problem i also think that some of these broad policy decision be well make by ministers because we be directly elect individual who will pay the price for the consequence of our choice that be a conversation that i will pick up with the sentencing council when we meet later this week 
 in lorraine cox be brutally murder in exeter her murderer dismember her body and as a result her family have never be able to fully lay lorraine to rest her father tony cox have be campaign for the implementation of helen ’s law mean that desecrate or conceal a body would become a separate criminal offence will the minister meet i to discuss whether the implementation of helen ’s law be possible 
 i will happily meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 what be this government do to crack down on unqualified people represent themselves as solicitor 
 as the hon member well know the solicitor profession be highly regulated we have the solicitors regulation authority which itself be regulate by the legal services board all our professional whether they be practise in criminal or civil law be highly respected and highly regulated and we be indebted to they 
 i be shocked to read the sentencing council ’s response to the secretary of state last night with its arrogant tone as she have say this parliament be sovereign and the fact be that we have give too much power away to these unelected body in recent year can i reassure she of my support and can she reassure i that she will not rest until we retain equality before the law 
 i thank my hon friend i be very much look forward to my meeting with the sentencing council later this week as i have make clear i be look into the role and power of the council and i will not hesitate to legislate if i need to do so 
 the tier sentencing guideline take effect on   april if the lord chancellor be sincere about have a justice system that treat everyone equally will she not support our bill to block the guideline 
 i have already make my position clear i have write to the sentencing council and i will be meet it later this week i be review the role and power of the council and i will not hesitate to legislate if i need to do so 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last month the justice committee hear evidence from governor of prison with some of the high drug use rate in the country from detect drone to body scanner and physical barrier they all feel under resource in technology and investment what be the secretary of state do to well equip prison staff to keep drug out of prison 
 we have already press ahead with further measure on x ray and baggage scanner and we be take action to deal with the problem of drone my hon friend will be aware that for security consideration i be not go to give the detail of some of those mitigation and of our proposal for tackle drone because they be use by those involve in serious organise crime however i can assure he that i ministers and all official include those work across the prison estate be seize of this matter and we be determined to crack down on drone bring drug into our prison 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on the collision that occur between vessel off the east coast of yorkshire yesterday i want to begin by offer my sincere thank to all those who be respond on the frontline from his majesty ’s coastguard to local emergency service this be a challenging situation and i know that i speak for everyone in this house when i say that the responder ongoing effort be both brave and hugely appreciate i also want to thank our international partner for their many offer of assistance to the uk and for the support from the maritime community 
 this be a fast move situation so let i set out the fact as i currently have they at am on   monday march the vessel mv solong sail under the flag of madeira collide in the north sea with the anchor vessel mv stena immaculate a fuel tanker sailing under the flag of the united states and operate by the us navy the collision occur approximately nautical mile off the coast fire immediately break out on both vessel and after initial firefighting attempt be overwhelm by the size and nature of the fire both crew abandon ship firefighting and search and rescue operation co ordinated by his majesty ’s coastguard continue throughout the day yesterday pause in the evening once darkness fall firefighting activity restart this morning and i be pleased to say the fire on the stena immaculate appear to be extinguish but the solong continue to burn 
 although they become attach to each other during the collision the solong break free of the stena immaculate late last night and begin drift southward modelling suggest that should the solong remain afloat it will remain clear of land for the next few hour the assessment of hm coastguard be however that it be unlikely the vessel will remain afloat tugboat be in the vicinity to ensure that the solong remain away from the coast and to respond as the situation develop i want to be clear that while metre temporary exclusion zone have be establish around both vessel maritime traffic through the humber estuary be continue 
 the full crew of on the mv stena immaculate be account for and on shore sailor be treat at the scene but decline any further medical assistance of the sailor of the mv solong be account for search and rescue operation for the miss sailor continue throughout yesterday but be call off yesterday evening at the point at which the chance of their survival have unfortunately significantly diminish our working assumption be very sadly that the sailor be deceased the coastguard have inform the company and it have be advise to inform the next of kin our thought be with the sailor ’s love one at this time 
 regard the cargo on the vessel the mv stena be carry barrel of jet fuel which be the source of the fire the maritime and coastguard agency be work at pace to determine exactly what cargo the solong be carry i be aware of medium report about potential hazardous material on board but we be unable to confirm that at this time however counter pollution measure and asset be already in place and both vessel be be closely monitor for structural integrity 
 a tactical co ordination group have be establish through the humber and lincolnshire local resilience forum the marine accident investigation branch have deploy to the site and begin its investigation the mca be rapidly develop a plan to salvage the vessel once it be safe to do so the department for transport will continue work closely with the cabinet office other government agency and the resilience forum on the response 
 colleague across the house will appreciate that the situation be still unfold as i speak i will try to answer question from hon member with as much detail as possible and with the late information i have at my disposal i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 yesterday morning shortly before am the container ship mv solong collide with the oil tanker mv stena immaculate which be at anchor in the north sea off the coast of yorkshire the stena immaculate be on a short term charter to the us navy ’s military sealift command and be carry barrel of jet fuel the minister have not formally confirm the cargo of the solong a madeira flagged vessel but it have be widely report that it be carry container of toxic sodium cyanide i listen to the statement carefully but can the minister confirm that that be now not his understanding 
 the collision and the result spill be deeply concern however before question the minister on the government ’s response i join he in pay tribute to hm coastguard the royal national lifeboat institution the emergency service and all other who help to respond to the incident as the minister note the emergency service be on the scene swiftly and their action save many life approach fiercely burn vessel with a risk of explosion take enormous bravery and we all commend they 
 i be grateful for the confirmation that all mariner from the stena immaculate have be recover without injury and that of the crew member from the solong have be bring safely ashore our thought and prayer be with the family and colleague of the miss member of that crew i understand that the search for life have conclude but can the minister update the house on the effort be make to recover that mariner 
 turn to the collision itself the minister confirm that early investigation do not point to foul play but will he commit to remain vigilant to ensure that any indication of foul play be carefully investigate additionally will he inform the house of the impact on the investigative process of the involvement of ship register in both the us and madeira have the government contact the respective government to ensure their close co operation 
 the minister will be aware of the deep concern over the effect of the oil spill on the surround marine environment environmental organisation have warn of potentially devastating impact of pollution from the tanker on the habitat and specie in the area include threaten seabird colony grey seal and fish and   nature rich site such as the humber estuary where conservationist have be restore seagrass and oyster could be devastate by this emergency have he be brief by the environment agency on its response and could he give we more detail on it 
 the minister make reference to the drift of the solong and the risk of it run aground without intervention can he update the house on the step that will be take to ensure that that do not happen i understand that the marine accident investigation branch have begin a preliminary investigation into the emergency and i be pleased that the minister be work closely with the maritime and coastguard agency as it conduct an assessment on the counter pollution response that may be require over the come day however i seek assurance that the government will engage closely with local community who will be concern about the impact of the collision on their environment 
 the incident involve multiple departments span emergency response environmental protection maritime safety defence and chemical transport regulation and effective cross government co ordination be therefore crucial will the minister assure the house that such co ordination be take place and that parliament will receive regular update it be of course too early to draw significant conclusion at this stage but it be clear that something go terribly wrong in the handling of these vessel we will support the minister in whatever action be need to ensure the high standard of safety on the high sea 
 the shadow minister be exactly right something do go terribly wrong my thought and prayer be with the miss sailor ’s family the company have be inform and his next of kin be be inform 
 in response to the series of question the shadow minister ask we know for sure that the immaculate be carry barrel of jet a-1 fuel but we be yet to establish the cargo of the solong as soon as i know i will make that information available to the house 
 we will do everything to recover the body of the mariner in a recent debate on emergency response service we hear that though life be lose at sea some succour and comfort be give by the rescue service who often bring people ’s love one back to they for a proper funeral and burial 
 whether there be foul play be i think speculation there be no evidence to suggest that at the moment through the mca we be in contact with our american and portuguese counterpart and have liaise with they on the counter pollution measure that the shadow minister mention the mca be stand by with marine and aerial counter pollution measure which it will use at the necessary time however the immediate concern be to put out the fire on the solong 
 the shadow minister mention the issue of drift the immaculate remain anchored so we be safe there it be the solong that be drift at nautical mile per hour it be currently be shadow by tugboat and the order will be give by sosrep or the mca to intervene as and when necessary to protect life onshore 
 the shadow minister be right about the marine accident investigation branch we have deploy those asset to the scene they be currently work with the local resilience forum and i want to pass on my thank to the humberside resilience forum at this time i can assure he that government agency be work together effectively and have be give ministers and the secretary of state regular update through situation report as the night go on and the day continue 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 i endorse the minister ’s thank to the frontline worker who have be involve and his concern for and condolence to the miss mariner ’s family while we wait for the report on how this appalling tragedy happen which will have to be do will the minister confirm how route be be manage while the solong be drift and whether further protection of route will be need because of pollution in order not to delay further movement of ship in these busy water and to protect the welfare of seafarer in other ship 
 i thank the chair of the transport committee for that question it be an incredibly busy sea highway as we all know i have the great honour of visit the command and control post of the humber estuary on what be almost my last visit as shadow maritime minister just before the general election and i pay tribute to the worker there for their hard work in deal with this situation i want to assure the chair of the transport committee that the immaculate be anchor it be the solong that be drift there be a metre exclusion zone around both vessel other asset be currently allow to traverse the humber estuary if that change i will make that information available during the day 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the scene we have all witness in news report be very concerning and our thought be with all those affected and with the family of the crew member who remain unaccounted for 
 this event remind we of the risk and danger face by those who work in the maritime sector these man and woman often work long challenging hour keep our country and economy go with little if any recognition and we be hugely grateful to they we be also indebted to the emergency service the royal national lifeboat institution and the coastguard for their tireless work through the night i know they be do all they can to limit the damage and the environmental impact and have do so much to minimise the loss of life while it will take time to establish what have take place it be clear that the government need to take urgent step to limit the damage and reassure local community i welcome the government ’s formation of the tactical co ordination group and the work it be do with other agency 
 i appreciate that the situation be still unfold and that many question can not be answer at this stage however will the minister say what immediate step the government be take to protect the environment along the east coast secondly what be he do to keep    shipping route open and safe thirdly what be the government ’s plan to support fishing and other business that rely on water that might now be contaminate 
 i join the hon gentleman in pay tribute to maritime worker just as they keep we feed fuel and supply all the way through covid they keep our nation feed fuel and supply every day of every week i can not commend they highly enough 
 i also join with he in pay tribute to the emergency service this be difficult hard work and they be do an exceptional job in the circumstance as i have say the mca be stand by with marine and aerial counter pollution measure in place once we get the fire on the solong out we will begin to assess the situation and deploy they it be vital that we keep ship lane in the humber estuary open as well we can as this continue which be why we have place a metre exclusion zone around both ship outside that maritime vessel can operate normally as normally as be possible in this circumstance 
 i thank the minister for his communication with i through this unfold situation and everybody who have be involve in it the situation be evolve minute by minute and i pay tribute to the local rnli coastguard and emergency service for their rapid rescue response and to the local community who have be heavily involve in ready themselves for any potential ecological or environmental fallout from this incident 
 as the minister may be aware ernst russ which own the solong have now put out a statement say that it have be misreporte that the hazardous chemical be on board the solong and that 
 there be empty container that have previously contain the hazardous chemical 
 which it will continue to monitor i wonder whether the minister have have any success in track down the manifest for the solong so that we can reassure my constituent and put their mind at ease as to exactly what be on that vessel i would also like to know when the minister be expect the initial report from the marine accident investigation branch so that we can understand what on earth happen in this most extraordinary of event 
 i thank my hon friend for keep in contact with i throughout the night and this morning just before the election we both visit the command and control centre in her constituency to see the excellent facility in place i pay tribute to the humberside local resilience forum which be make up of the police the fire and rescue team local authority the red cross the nhs the ministry of housing communities and local government the clinical commissioning group the royal navy police and crime commissioner the ambulance service border force environmental agency the ministry of defence abp humber ports the met office and the uk health security agency those team be all work at pace to assess any risk to local people that may occur 
 there have be many press report on the manifest but the fact be the fact there be barrel of a1 jet fuel on the immaculate and the mca be work at pace to establish the cargo on the solong which   sail from grangemouth hopefully as soon as we have that information from the manifest we will make it available to the house 
 i join the minister in salute the heroic rescuer and mourn the loss of the seaman mr speaker you may share some of my frustration at the lack of communication with member of this house regard yesterday ’s maritime disaster off the holderness coast in my constituency apart from a brief phone call follow my reach out to the secretary of state for transport i speak to the leader of east riding of yorkshire council the police and crime commissioner and local councillor all be struggle to get information as to what be go on just mile off the coast my constituent from kilsney easington withernsea aldborough and beyond deserve well 
 i must ask the minister why it take so long for the local resilience forum to be set up be he confident that we have the proper structure of governance in place when a disaster such as this happen how can we ensure that communication be improve what work be be do to protect the puffin wildlife and beach in our area and how can we ensure that the agency responsible be hold to account perhaps the minister can comment on why he be miss in action yesterday we would have love to have hear not just from hour rolling medium but from a member of our own elect government about what be happen with this terrible disaster 
 mr speaker i be deal with the situation—[hon member hear hear the secretary of state make a statement we stand up the maritime and coastguard agency and within minute a response be ongoing the right hon member have a call from a member of staff of the secretary of state within an hour or of the incident he be keep fully inform the local humberside resilience forum be establish we deploy asset for marine protection at the site i be not sure what he be ask for but i be very proud of our agency both local and national that have work at pace to get we to where we be currently 
 i welcome the minister ’s timely statement and would like to associate myself with his praise for the swift response of the emergency service and the rnli volunteer over recent year fisherman along the east coast of yorkshire include scarborough and whitby have battle to keep go against the background of the effect of the crustacean die off they be naturally extremely concerned by report of jet fuel possibly leak into the sea i do appreciate that this be a fast move situation but can my hon friend tell the house more about the counter pollution measure that be in place and also how predict weather condition will affect the ongoing operation 
 i thank my hon friend for her question yes i know that member on the north east coast from both side of this house have be worry over a number of year about the crustacean die off there be a concern that jet oil could well be leak into the sea but every resource be be deploy by the mca and other agency to assess the extent of the pollution and every resource will be deploy to clean up that pollution   i happen to be meet fisherman organisation later in the week for separate reason so i hope to be able to update they with further information about their valuable trade at that time 
 i have be in communication with liberal democrat councillor in the east riding of yorkshire and also the liberal democrat administration in hull yesterday the leader of the council mike ross raise the call for a rapid response from government and i really push the minister to provide clarity on what exactly we should be see from a tactical co ordination group and whether there be government commitment to cover any environmental or economic impact moreover what more support will we see down the line if there be long term consequence as a result of the pollution 
 it be standard procedure to bring on board local resilience forum in any situation such as this that have be do the forum be up and run i be grateful to all elect member across the party and hard work councillor who will be involve in make sure that the good interest of the people of the humber region be protect we have currently deploy on site all the resource that be need to contain the fire and to assess the environmental damage of any spillage we will continue to make decision in conjunction with the local resilience forum through the day and i believe for the rest of the week 
 i wish to add my voice to the call make by my hon friend   the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume   give the very perilous position of the teesside and north yorkshire marine ecosystem follow the environmental disaster we suffer in i ask the minister to ensure that the response be not only around the humber estuary but that he review the environmental impact for the entire east coast as well 
 as i have say the mca ’s counter pollution asset be be deploy at the scene the rnli search and rescue and aviation have all be on site although search and rescue have be stand down both vessel be also carry marine heavy fuel oil that be a present pollution risk should either vessel sink or break apart 
 i thank the minister for his statement today and echo his comment about the miss sailor i also add my thank to all those who have be involve in the rescue operation particularly those at the rnli station in bridlington my constituent be rightly concerned about the potential environmental and ecological impact not least because we have the big bird colony in mainland britain bempton and flamborough in bridlington have the large shellfish land port in the uk and we have around visitor to the area every year enjoy the beach from bridlington down to hornsea have the minister yet have any assessment of the direction of any potential pollution and the role that current and wind direction will play in where that pollution might eventually end up
