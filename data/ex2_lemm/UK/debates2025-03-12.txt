 we have have another excellent debate we might have to deal with a few misconception but i be conscious that we need to move on to reading so i apologise if i do not address every single contribution we have hear today i will start with the chair of the select committee my right hon friend   the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne and his new clause the bill already require the secretary of state to produce an annual report for employment right enforcement as well as an enforcement strategy every year both document   will be lay before parliament allow for parliamentary scrutiny we be commit to give the fair work agency the resource it need to do its job effectively i agree with he that the number of prosecution for minimum wage violation have be pitifully small in recent year we should never tolerate lawbreaker in the business world we should ensure that responsible and well perform business be never allow to be undercut by minimum wage violation 
 my right hon friend ’s amendment would include digital mean of communication with worker in union right of access to workplace i appreciate the good intention behind the amendment but the government be already commit to modernise working practice and move away from a reliance on ad hoc access arrangement we recognise the importance of provide for a digital right of access in addition to the physical access for which the bill already provide that be why we have amend the bill to expand access right allow for access agreement to include communication with worker other than by mean of physical access to a workplace such as digital mean 
 my hon friend   the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald   talk about procurement his new clause would amend the procurement act to place a duty on the secretary of state to ensure that any contract enter into by either a government department an executive agency of government a non departmental public body or a non ministerial department must comply with certain requirement relate to the recognition of trade union we recognise that the recognition of trade union for collective bargaining be an important feature of the previous tier code on workforce matter the bill contain power to reinstate and strengthen the code by way of regulation and a statutory code so i assure the house that the government be commit to strengthen trade union recognition and collective bargaining right 
 new clause in the name of   the hon member for dundee central chris law would result in a change to the scotland act by remove employment law from the list of reserved matter thereby bring it within the competence of the scottish parliament while his perseverance on this issue be not unnoticed it would come as no surprise to he be he here that the government have no intention of devolve employment law to the scottish parliament previous scotland acts have already create of the most powerful devolve parliaments in the world when there be considerably more snp members here during the last parliament there be a minute rule bill on this very subject and the snp could not even get a majority of its own member to support it so why on earth would we support such a measure now i do not know 
 i will turn to the amendment from my right hon friend   the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell   on prison officer right to strike i thank he for his persistence and his active engagement on behalf of prison officer as he say prison officer be prevent from take industrial action under current legislation their pay be govern by the independent prison service pay review body process which act as a compensatory mechanism for that restriction there be limited contingency to deal with industrial action and during such incident the reliance be on a narrow pool of operational manager with some potential for very limited support from the   police and army in limited circumstance that create operational risk and be not sustainable for any period of time 
 my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington refer to what he class as disrespect to prison officer during that debate in committee i just put on record that there be certainly no disrespect show by those on the government benches we value and respect the work that prison officer do i know that he will continue to pursue this matter and i suggest that he contact the ministry of justice which have the remit i hope it will be able to engage on the matter in future 
 let i now deal with some of the liberal democrat new clause and amendment   the hon member for st albans daisy cooper   speak about new clause which would give the secretary of state the power to set out and define in regulation the professional body that could represent employee at disciplinary meeting it be unclear to we where the demand for that would come from and i would expect it to benefit some business that have raise the prospect with successive government what be clear however be that expand the type of organisation that could be involve in represent worker at such meeting could lead to hearing require legal representation for both the worker and the employer that would increase the cost of hold a hearing would escalate matter and would potentially decrease the chance of an amicable resolution as both party become entrenched in dispute we believe that trade union be well place to represent employee in disciplinary and grievance hearing in the workplace and statutory provision be already in place to enable they to do that 
 the hon member for st albans also table new clause which relate to legal aid for employment dispute i be committed to ensure that worker be able to enforce their employment right and we be work closely with the ministry of justice to ensure that happen look into what further improvement we can make to the way in which acas and employment tribunal operate a key benefit of move enforcement to the fair work agency be that it will make it easy and quick for worker to secure justice without the need for additional legal representation or legal aid i hope that give the hon lady some reassurance that we be look seriously at the issue 
 new clause also table by the hon member for st albans 
 would require the secretary of state to publish a review on the impact of part of the bill on sme within month of the passage of this act 
 in the impact assessment the government have set out our initial plan for monitor an evaluation of the impact of the bill as well as some secondary legislation i say this with the great respect to the hon lady she have express concern about the burden on business but if we have accept all her party ’s amendment yesterday that would have add several pound to the cost of business the liberal democrats will have to decide ideally tonight whether they be in favour of worker right or not 
 let i now deal with some of the amendment from the official opposition amendment seek to 
 increase from to day the notice period that trade union be require to adhere to when notify employer that they plan to take industrial action 
 our consultation on the creation of a modern framework for industrial relation seek view on what an appropriate notice period would be recognise that the repeal of the trade union act would reduce the notice period from to day the government have listen carefully to the concern express by respondent to the consultation who fear that a day notice period would not provide enough time for union to prepare for industrial action in some important sector such as transport healthcare and education with possible knock on impact on other service the government believe that employer should be give enough time to mitigate the most severe effect of industrial action and acknowledge response to the consultation argue that day notice be insufficient 
 of course we do have day notice between and under the tory government the tories lack of understanding of the bill be clear from the number of time we hear that it would take we back to the 1970 whereas in fact it will take we back to when an early version of the bill be introduce the government ’s view be that day provide the appropriate balance in enable employer to mitigate the impact of industrial action and reduce disruption and the knock on impact of strike while also respect the right to strike 
 amendment seek to remove clause which deal with political fund and which i think prompt the most heated debate it be notable that when it come to reduce tory red tape it be only trade union that do not receive the same benefit as everyone else there have i think be a fundamental misunderstanding of what a trade union be it be a member base democratic organisation design to protect those who be part of it comparison with netflix subscription and insurance contract be bogus because they be not the same thing at all membership of a trade union and a political fund be not a subscription that people sign up to for a fix period it be membership of a democratically organised and independent trade union which they be free to leave at any time member have control of the organisation because it be democratically organise and they can decide as a union whether to have a political fund at all people can not email the chief executive of netflix and demand that it make a programme star their favourite actor but if people be unhappy with a trade union they have the opportunity to get involve and change it 
 it should be note that in the year that we have have political fund ballot no union have disaffiliate from the labour party there have be no closure of political fund so it be very clear that this be simply red tape of course it be not all about fund the labour party because nearly half of all union that have a political fund be not affiliate with the labour party if conservative member be not satisfied with that they should read the bill that be before they because the clause that they want to remove clause set out in subsection how member can opt out of a political fund it even set out the way they can do so by post email or electronic mean some of the patronising comment we have hear about people be trap into something that they do not wish to be in do not reflect the reality of the situation or the ability of trade union member to make up their own mind and exercise   their democratic right have any conservative members ever be member of a trade union they would understand that 
 the repeat insinuation from conservative members that i or any anyone else on the labour benches have bring forward this bill because we have be pay by the trade union to do so be offensive and wrong in equal measure they might think money buy you the chance to write the law but that say far more about their approach to legislation than it do about ours on the labour benches we do these thing because we believe in they we believe that everyone deserve fair treatment at work and this bill deliver that it be deliver on our value 
 in conclusion the bill represent a generational shift in protection a long overdue reinforcement of worker right in this country and tangible proof of how a labour government can bring meaningful benefit to people ’s life for many of we it be fundamental to why we be in the labour party so now be not the time to shy away from our effort now be not the time to talk about what might have be it be the time to be bold to be loud and to be proud that this labour government be deliver by put fairness dignity and security back into the workplace
