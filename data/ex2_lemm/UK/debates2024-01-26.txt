i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 the access to telecommunications networks bill seek to ensure that wherever someone live they can choose which operator their mobile phone will connect to we have a westminster hall debate on this on wednesday so there be an inevitable element of repetition but if something be worth say once it be probably worth say twice and there be good cross party support for improve and speed up the roll out of the share rural network 
 the network be the government ’s scheme to increase g coverage from to of the uk land mass by and it be welcome as be the government ’s investment of half a pound on new mast for total notspot where no signal be available however the roll out be not progress as quickly as we would like so this bill seek to improve or speed up the rate at which people in place in my constituency such as cockshutt woore or west felton get a usable phone signal from more than provider wherever they travel in the local area 
 improve rural coverage be really important for all sort of reason most importantly to i it be of the top issue raise by my constituent i have a series of open meeting over the summer where it come up time and again as something that people find frustrating in their daily life and if it be their issue it be my issue that be of the reason why i have be so keen to pursue it in this place 
 accord to a survey for the country land and business association of rural business owner say that improved connectivity would make the single large improvement to their business that be partly because they struggle to recruit which be link to poor public transport but it be also important for the people they might want to employ to be able to access a wide range of job opportunity and to work flexibly from home in a way that be not always currently available to people in rural area 
 mobile phone have be cite as the default back up option in a power cut once the copper landline network be switch off in the next couple of year i emphasise how concern that be particularly to elderly constituent who might be a little less familiar with voice over internet technology as well as everybody in the area who be worried about what happen when a big power cut occur because we be rural our power be not put back online as quickly as in some urban area and while back up battery for router will last for to hour we be sometimes off for much long than that someone at home on their own in the dark and frightened might want to be able to call someone other than the emergency service in the event of a power cut it be really important that people can access their mobile provider whoever that might be when the power be down 
 respondent to a survey recently conduct by building digital uk cite poor mobile coverage as a major factor exacerbate poor outcome from agricultural injury i do not wish to dwell on disaster but a couple   of year ago we see a number of combine harvest fire across my constituency if such people be in a partial notspot they can already ring from their phone but in that situation they might want to call all sort of other people to help they 
 it be not just call that be need just over a year ago i do a shift with an ambulance crew where the crew use a mobile signal to download patient datum on to their tablet to help with patient condition we visit an elderly lady near ellesmere who be very poorly and although we be quite close to the town centre the crew could not download her medical record so her care be necessarily compromise compare with what somebody in an urban area might expect 
 finally improve rural coverage would reduce digital inequality which be talk about a lot in this place many people do not feel that comfortable on a full broadband connect computer but have learn how to use a phone it be part of everyday life and if they can not use it as they move around on their daily routine they be leave out to a great extent 
 we all understand that there be technical challenge to building mast in rural area not least in get a power supply out there and that that be why there be a disparity between rural and urban area that be a fact of life when live in a rural area i think people do understand that but north shropshire be of the bad serve area in the country less than of premise have coverage indoor from all operator when the average for the whole of the uk be once we move away from the town and into the village less than in can choose which operator they have in their home 
 as we know we have talk about this at length and the minister acknowledge it in oral question recently the coverage datum be very optimistic and do not always reflect what be happen on the ground for example in north shropshire i have be to talk to people in trefonen where some map say they should have coverage but that be not the live experience there be also a capacity issue whereby the coverage might be there but call might drop out regularly because other people be link up to that mast at the same time the datum we use to assess the success of the roll out be therefore very important 
 as i mention the share rural network have involve the mobile network operator spend half a pound to end partial notspot because ee already have an extensive network of mobile mast it have already meet its obligation even though the deadline be june it be month ahead but accord to report in the daily telegraph the other provider have request a delay that be down to a number of reason some of which be difficult to overcome such as lack of planning resource the logistical challenge i mention early and issue over access to land those be impact the delivery of the share rural network it be interesting that not a single mast that will be deliver by the government for the total notspot have be build yet accord to the house of commons library briefing 
 there be challenge that be difficult to overcome but part of the problem be that ee have not share its mast because it have fail to reach agreement with the other mobile network operator that be a commercial issue and be part of the commercial negotiation so   whether ee be ask for too high a rate or whether the other mobile operator be offer too low a rate be a matter of perspective but the reality be that we could have achieve well coverage without blight the countryside with load of additional mast if those operator have share their network equipment effectively that be where this bill come in because it would ensure that operator share their equipment wherever possible and would penalise they where they do not the rate at which they would share it would be determine by ofcom to help ease the commercial discussion along 
 sometimes share be not possible sometimes a big wide strong mast be need and that might not be possible and that bring i to the solution of rural roaming which be strongly oppose by the industry the industry argue that it cause shorten battery life people might drop call it do not deal with total notspot and perhaps most importantly it would undermine future investment presumably because competitive advantage would be undermine however an environment food and rural affairs committee report in say that it would achieve an equivalent result to the share rural network and be achievable in around month an ofcom report in say that the cost do not appear disproportionate 
 since those report the share rural network agreement have be sign but there be significant concern about the speed of roll out the quality of the datum we be use to judge success and the fact that this be yesterday ’s technology and we be not yet there in the countryside while the rest of the country be hop to get g or stand alone g in the near future the bill would address those shortfall by require the secretary of state to improve rural roam by incentivise company to engage in that work 
 in conclusion i can not emphasise enough separately from the mechanism of this bill the importance of have well datum so that when the shared rural network be assess against its objective we can see what people be experience on the ground we know that rural roaming will not happen unless we force the company to do it because they have already show such strong resistance and the government have acknowledge that 
 this bill would work alongside the share rural network by take step to improve the infrastructure sharing and encourage rural roam wherever possible people might be with an operator that work at their home and they could be out and about in their day when their mum fall over at home she might call an ambulance but she can not get hold of that person to tell they that be problematic in the modern age we need to ensure that people in rural area be connect wherever they go not just when they be in their home or place of work 
 matt rodda reading east lab i will address a number of issue when respond for the official opposition and i take this opportunity to underline the importance of increase access to broadband and the wide need for great connectivity 
 the bill of   the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan   would have effect as i understand it it would require mobile network operator to   share their network infrastructure for a reasonable price secondly it would incentivise operator to allow customer of other company to roam on to their network as she mention this be know as rural roaming and it be similar to what happen when travel abroad these measure be intend to tackle partial notspot but it be worth note that the bill would not address total notspot area that do not receive any coverage from any mobile network operator 
 turn to the of those effect there be occasional concern about telecom network have infrastructure access as i understand it of the main issue be in area such as the city of hull where there be a monopoly company in that case kcom or in situation across the rest of the country where openreach be the monopoly provider across the country there have be repeat issue with the use of telecom infrastructure in particular the repeat digging up of road there be legitimate question 
 jack brereton stoke on trent south con we be see this issue in my constituency at the moment with road be dig up virgin media be create absolute chaos across the constituency by dig up the road and the work it be do to put thing back to how they be be an utter disgrace do the hon gentleman

 neale hanvey kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath alba last night be burns night and i find myself reflect over a couplet from the bard ’s timeless a man ’s a man for a that 
 the honest man tho e’er sae poor be king o man for a that 
 i open this debate in a spirit of honesty truth and transparency a trinity that have be lack in most of my exchange thus far with the ministry of defence over mount concern about the uk ’s nuclear trident programme the spiral cost of the programme be they financial or human demand an earnest response from minister something that have hitherto elude the mod but i be hop for candour and honesty today or in write in the forthcoming week 
 the economic of the trident programme be more straightforward as per the house of commons library the total acquisition expenditure on the vanguard class submarine house the trident missile be £ which equate to approximately £ in today ’s money additionally annual in service cost be currently estimate at of the defence budget base on current plan expenditure that be another £ for 
 far the cost of the design and manufacture of the new dreadnought class submarine be estimate at £ include inflation over the life of the programme a £ contingency have also be set aside make the current potential total for replacement £ in service cost be expect to continue at approximately of defence expenditure the national audit office have raise concern about the impact of the mod ’s nuclear programme base on the affordability of the department ’s overall equipment plan but these astronomical figure continue to be spend 
 that bring i to the press concern surround the trident programme that i will set out for the minister today the of which be the danger of radiation exposure and the issue of nuclear safety in scotland secondly base on those incident there be grow scepticism about the overall preparedness of the exist vanguard fleet in the light of its allegedly dangerous and rot state reference by dominic cummings the former senior adviser to the former prime minister thirdly as a consequence of the nuclear exposure hazard that the uk have impose on the population of scotland and a lack of transparency concern the programme as a whole i will set out why the nation of scotland have much to gain by remove that nuclear arsenal from its water 
 and foremost i would like to provide a factual context to this debate i be contact by a whistleblower at the coulport armament depot who tell i that there have be an emergency evacuation at the site due to a radiation leak i raise this matter directly with the defence secretary who then write to i on   january in that letter the defence secretary deny that there have be any serious radiation breach at faslane or coulport he write 
 i can confirm that the allege radiation incident refer to during defence question in the commons do not occur 
 however public concern remain about the relocation of staff from build at rnad coulport to build the mod have fail to confirm the date on which the staff at coulport building be inform that they be be move to build the defence secretary also state 
 no serious radiation breach have occur at his majesty ’s naval base clyde or rnad coulport 
 however that response imply there be a threshold for report radiation leak 
 as i say at the time the defence secretary ’s response raise more question than it answer it suggest that there be radiation breach but they fall below an unqualified serious threshold what be that threshold how be it define and what be the risk from non serious radiation breach in response to a parliamentary write question about serious radiation breach at the clyde and coulport port the minister acknowledge 
 there have be historical event with minor radiological consequence at both his majesty ’s naval base clyde and the royal naval armaments depot rnad coulport 
 that reveal record radiation leak at coulport and a further at faslane in alone although the mod insist that none be consider serious surely further detail of each of these event and the risk they do or do not present to the immediate vicinity be necessary will the minister commit to provide that information 
 will the uk government continue in their attempt to minimise the number and scale of such event by refer we to obscure code and categorisation to obfuscate risk or by invoke national security as both an excuse and a smokescreen the latter be deploy month ago when the alba party submit a freedom of information request ask how many convoy there have be each year for the last year carry material from atomic weapons establishment aldermaston to royal naval armaments depot coulport section on national security and section on defence of the freedom of information act be invoke to withhold that information from scotland and our people the very people who be frequently place at risk of exposure to radiation be to be keep in the dark 
 formulaic test of public information versus national interest be simply not good enough i would like to pointedly ask the minister approximately how much nuclear material have be transport between aldermaston and coulport in the last month and in the past year how many convoy be use and what be the frequency of such transport how many worker be sufficiently close to be impact by even low level nuclear exposure we need answer and the people deserve the most basic of information even the detail of potentially catastrophic incident that have receive media coverage be routinely deny to right hon and hon member of the house and the public alike on the spurious ground that the ministry do not comment on operational matter in respect of submarine 
 it be recently report that a royal navy nuclear submarine plunge towards its crush depth due to a concern malfunction of its main depth gauge it be finally report last november but the incident take place a year before that we still have no specific about where it take place despite my personal request for information from the ministry 
 turn to the preparedness of the vanguard fleet itself in september of the vanguard class submarine return from a patrol of more than month defence commentator note that it be double the month mission previously complete additionally navy lookout report that the return submarine seem to be miss exterior tile and be cover in marine growth to an extent that have not be see before as of this year the life expectancy of the current vanguard fleet be repeatedly be extend despite only of the vessel currently be seaworthy i would like to credit the national newspaper in scotland for its persistent and thorough reportage of the nuclear predicament in scotland 
 if it be the case that submarine be fail in seaworthiness and labour under increase operational pressure as be indicate by the malfunctioning of vital component extended period of deployment and miss exterior tile while radiation leak be be under report i ask the minister in good faith how be the people of scotland or right hon and hon member to place any trust in this government specifically how be the dreadnought class to avoid exactly the same fate and most critically what additional safeguard be be take to mitigate civilian exposure to nuclear contamination give this shocking evidence 
 give that the chief adviser to an erstwhile prime minister have refer to the uk ’s nuclear fleet as a horror show i would hope that the minister would come through with some degree of information and transparency and not rely merely on obfuscation that bring i to my and final concern the deficit in trust be of the many reason why the people of scotland would benefit from become an independent state in lieu of be hold in this union against our will 
 bairns not bomb be of the galvanise message of the independence movement in the run up to the referendum that slogan embody a persist sentiment against nuclear weapon of mass destruction and their dangerous and corrosive impact on our country and the planet opinion poll after opinion poll show that the majority of scottish people oppose wmd be host in scotland whenever independence be mention to the uk government their immediate reaction be to attempt to assert that the scottish economy be well serve as part of the united kingdom within the realm of defence manufacturing such an argument be as far as from reality as possible in october the government sign contract total £ to design and manufacture the world ’s most advanced submarine however much i disagree in principle with the so call nuclear deterrent it illustrate perfectly the fact that scotland receive few of the manufacture job which be locate in barrow in furness raynesway and derby the job the growth and the capital be yet again direct anywhere but scotland meanwhile the rotting hulk of dreadnought sub retire in the 1980s have be rust away at rosyth long than they be in service the people of scotland have a precarious future in which key economic infrastructure such as the grangemouth oil refinery be threaten with closure 
 while the current situation be bleak i would not like to end my speech on a pessimistic note instead i look towards the future with hope a future where an independent scotland can build on and benefit from its vast renewable energy potential rather than host nuclear weapon   a future where there be a safe feasible and practicable way to ensure that an independent scotland will begin its life as a nuclear and wmd free state from day of independence a future where the government and the people of scotland be no long keep in the dark about the danger place in their midst by a remote arrogant london administration 
 may i thank   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   for bring the bill before the house and all the other hon member who have speak on this important matter today he have be incredibly constructive and pragmatic in our   deliberation on what we should do in this area and i thank he for that it be always a pleasure to work with he on this issue and we have work together on a number of issue over the year 
 i would like to express my wholehearte agreement with the intent behind the hon member ’s bill his speech be incredibly touching and he speak passionately about the need for the bill but also about the devastating impact on individual his point about the future plan of ’s life suddenly go to ash be incredibly powerful and i express my sympathy for mr thorpe whom he refer to in his speech 
 it be always a great pleasure to take forward legislation that make a meaningful difference i be lucky enough to take through parliament private member ’s bills prior to become a minister be on parental bereavement leave and people ask why do this not exist in the place when people say that to we as i be sure they have say to the hon member about his bill we know we be on the right track in my experience we normally do not do these thing on our own we do they jointly and his work with my hon friend   the member for broxtowe darren henry   have be really important in bring the bill forward 
 it be clear that we should look at what more we can do to support employ parent who lose their partner around the time of their child ’s birth and who do not currently qualify for statutory leave entitlement because they do not meet continuity of service requirement that is they have not be in the job for the require length of time to qualify the principle of this bill have support across the house and i be pleased to hear that reflect in the debate 
 again i thank my hon friend the member for broxtowe who have long campaign on this issue we meet his constituent in my early day as a minister and i thank he for bring it to the house ’s attention we be always keen to do something when we could and i be delighted to say that we now have the right time and space to do this it be a pleasure to meet he and his constituent mr horsey who be in the gallery today in the department the year before last i be sure the whole house will join i in express our condolence to mr horsey for the loss of his wife bernadette and in send our good wish to he and their son tim 
 i will take the time to address some of the point raise by hon member today but i will put on the record why the government support the intent behind this legislation lose a partner be a truly devastating experience for anyone the combination of the terrible grief and as my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce   say loneliness in these situation the shadow minister   the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas call it unimaginable which be an apt description with the challenge of care for a new baby must be incredibly hard my deep sympathy go out to anyone who find themselves in this terrible position 
 the united kingdom have a generous range of entitlement and protection design to support parent to balance their family and work commitment and maintain their place in the labour market while raise their child for example maternity leave and pay paternity leave and pay and share parental leave and pay among other maternity leave be rightly available   from the day of a woman ’s employment recognise the special circumstance of pregnant woman and new mother 
 parental leave and share parental leave be not day leave entitlement for mother father and partner all parent must meet continuity of service requirement as such if a mother die in the year of a child ’s life a father or partner who have not meet continuity of service requirement for paternity leave or share parental leave will not have the statutory right to take leave so that they can care for the child in those tragic but thankfully rare circumstance they will need to rely on the compassion of their employer to provide they with adequate leave and job security as the hon member for ogmore say though some of these people be fall through the crack 
 the intent of the bill be to provide more support for the grieve and survive parent when their spouse or partner have tragically pass away the legislation will support people in those terrible circumstance to take time away from work to care for their new baby without the risk and associated stress of be make to return to work before they be ready to do so i be delighted that the government be able to support this positive development in the parental leave and pay system 
 however as be the case with any legislation it be crucial to ensure that it be not only well intentione but practical and effective in achieve its intended effect it be therefore important that i set out to the house today as i have previously discuss with the hon member for ogmore the government ’s view that the bill will require amendment in committee to fully achieve its intended change and operate effectively alongside exist parental leave legislation i be delighted that the hon member have agree to work with i to do that and that we have a share understanding of the need to create a legislative framework that not only support family in their time of need but do so in a way that be clear fair and effective committee stage provide we with the opportunity to fine tune the detail of the bill and address any potential gap issue or inconsistency to ensure that it achieve its intended purpose i will of course provide more information on the necessary change ahead of committee stage but i will take a moment to highlight some of the area in which we be consider amendment 
 we will need to consider what type of parental leave good meet the intention of the bill secondly we will need to analyse whether it be right to confine its scope to the death of the mother or whether it should make broad provision for the death of other parent thirdly we need to make sure that the change we make integrate well into the wide framework of parental leave legislation finally we intend to remove the pay element from this entitlement i will explain why shortly the hon member for ogmore and i be in agreement on the removal of the pay element as member will have see the text of his bill do not refer to pay although i hear and understand his clear ambition to include it at a future stage i concur with his point though that we should never let the perfect be the enemy of the good 
 all the uk ’s statutory parental pay entitlement have a continuity of service requirement include statutory maternity pay statutory paternity pay statutory share parental pay and statutory adoption pay they be design to ensure that a parent have make a reasonable   contribution towards their employer ’s business before that employer be require to administer statutory parental payment continuity of service requirement be design to achieve a balance between the need of employer and those of work parent 
 i will be able to give more detail in committee on the change we intend to make to the bill in the spirit of collaboration i encourage all member to engage constructively in committee our priority be to work together to deliver a piece of legislation that meet the need of bereaved family provide they with the support they require during of life ’s most challenging chapter 
 in response to the shadow minister ’s point about worker right the government be commit to support the participation and progression of parent in the labour market to ensure that it be fair and work for parent our manifesto pledge change to enhance worker right and support people to stay in work the government have deliver on those commitment by support a package of private member bill help new parent unpaid carer and hospitality worker give all employee easy access to flexible working and give worker a right to request a more predictable working pattern we have be pleased with the successful progress of that legislation through parliament where it have receive cross party support result in act successfully receive royal assent the government have already make good progress on lay secondary legislation in due course to implement those new act 
 the employment relations flexible working act for example will give all employee with week continuous service the right to request flexible working empower employee to ask for a working arrangement that suit they and their unique circumstance 
 i take the point raise by my hon friend   the member for bury north james daly   about homeworke flexible working do not necessarily mean homeworke it can mean different working time to suit people ’s parental responsibility for example different time during holiday and it do not necessarily mean that people have to work from home he be right to say that worker should work where they be most effective and where employer require they to be 
 the protections from redundancy pregnancy and family leave act will provide great protection to woman who be on maternity leave or an employee who be on adoption or share parental leave in a redundancy situation that legislation will help to clamp down on poor or inappropriate practice such as discriminate against pregnant woman or new mother or wait for a woman to return from maternity leave and when the current protect period end make her redundant 
 the employment allocations of tips act will make it unlawful for business to hold back tip gratuity and service charge from employee ensure that staff receive the tip they have earn this package of legislation will increase workforce participation protect vulnerable worker and level the playing field ensure that unscrupulous business do not have a competitive advantage the legislation build on the strength of our flexible and dynamic labour market and give    business the confidence to create job and invest in their workforce allow they to generate long term prosperity and economic growth 
 protect and enhance worker right while support business to grow remain a priority for this government we be determined to build a high skilled high productivity high wage economy a key part of the uk ’s economic resilience be our strong flexible and dynamic labour market it be a labour market that give business the confidence to create job and invest in their workforce and allow they to generate long term prosperity and economic growth it be a labour market that rightly bear down on unscrupulous employer and protect those keep to good working practice promote more competition in uk market to build a high skilled high productivity high wage economy

 my hon friend have great experience and it be great to hear from people with experience at the sharp end of business it be not an easy place to be i have a fairly long business career myself for year before politic and we know that people be our most precious asset it be good business to look after our workforce not only because of the individual concern and the loyalty that bring but because of the loyalty of other member of the team when they see how someone be treat their staff it be important to recognise that what we be legislate for be not a ceiling but a floor it be a minimum period of leave that people can be offer and of course the minimum level of pay clearly an employer can pay more than that expect by law and i know that many employer do so i understand that mr horsey be well treat by his employer that illustrate that most employer be good employer and we in the house should always recognise that when we be legislate we want a labour market that promote competition and choice so that consumer have confidence in market and business compete on a level playing field 
 turn to the specific point the hon member for ogmore raise a point about the number of people affect maternal death the number of people who pass away during pregnancy or within day of that be around as he say some will have continuity of service requirement we therefore think that this legislation will benefit just under people a year that be our good guesstimate because there be so many different move part but that be the kind of number we be talk about that be not a huge number but the legislation be very important to those affect by it 
 i note the hon member ’s point principally about pay it be a step on the road but it be a very important step and future government of whatever colour they may be may go far he also raise the complexity and take up of share parental leave take up be in line with estimate and have double over the past few year in july the share parental leave tool be deploy   the tool enable parent to check their eligibility and plan their leave and it have be well receive i think that also cover the point raise by the shadow minister the hon member for harrow west 
 the hon member for ogmore also ask why parent with other employment status such as the self employ be not entitle to this support the government ’s support be focus on employ parent as they do not generally have the same level of flexibility and autonomy over how and when they work as self employ parent employee have a contractual requirement to work regular hour and have an employer who have control over when they work where they work and how their work be do due to that employee have the great level of employment protection to balance the lack of flexibility that their employment type provide in other way 
 my hon friend the member for bury north talk in his intervention and his speech about the burden on business obviously all legislation should include an impact assessment include a financial impact assessment on business the impact assessment result be de minimis i think that be below £ which be not a significant impact we therefore do not think that the change will create a significant burden on business we have engage with business representative organisation and payroll professional throughout the policy development of these change they have respond positively and understand how the change will increase flexibility for family we be work with his majesty ’s revenue and customs to plan communication with business to ensure that they fully understand the new arrangement and we will continue to engage with they while we finalise guidance to ensure the smooth introduction of these change 
 my hon friend the member for congleton rightly talk about the uk commission on bereavement and the important work that it do she also refer to a cross departmental bereavement strategy which may include bereavement counselling for people in key situation that be a little outside my remit but she may continue to press for that across government 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 on a point of order mr speaker i understand that overnight ministers have brief out that they be pause negotiation with canada over an update free trade agreement while there may be good negotiating reason and particularly good agricultural reason for do so there be implication if the pause in negotiation mean that there be no agreement to roll over an exist agreement on rule of origin on manufacture good for export to canada that could for example make british car and other manufacture good more expensive in canadian market 
 give that the government ’s record on economic growth be so poor and their record on trade negotiation be also poor can the speaker tell the house whether ministers be go to make a statement to set out urgently why that pause be take place and how the cliff edge on rule of origin will be handle 
 i be very grateful to the hon member for his point of order and for give notice of it i have have no indication from the government that they intend to make a statement on this matter but i be sure the occupant of the treasury bench have note the hon member ’s remark i will say that it be amazing how quickly the government come to give good news i just hope that they will reflect on briefing matter out overnight as i say i always believe this house should hear it be a very clear message but unfortunately it be not get through let we hope it do this time 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 when i discover that i have be successful in the ballot as other member have be during this session i receive request from organisation and group on all manner of worthy issue yet my override thought be that i hop to take through legislation that would achieve meaningful change for individual and family on a day to day basis and make their life that little bit less difficult i put on record my thank to organisation such as gingerbread and the fawcett society which have offer invaluable support and guidance in aid the development of this bill 
 in the tradition of the house work at its good when it work cross party i place on the record my thank to the minister his official and   the hon member for castle point rebecca harris who be often forget and never thank for the invaluable work she do in support member in the passing of private member bill i sincerely thank the minister and his official for the constructive and open way in which they have engage in find consensus to reach this point 
 i be confident that within the political dna of all member of this place be an aim to almost always undertake work that have the big impact work that bring about the most meaningful change for the large group of people in society we can reach in do so however we often miss the group in society who be forget or who fall through the legislative crack of loophole in our law i be pleased to say that this bill will not impact ten of thousand of people across the united kingdom because nobody in this house or in wide society would want it to as its title state it be fundamentally about the loss of a partner wife or mother in childbirth and about ensure that more of those leave behind have a right to leave in those most horrendous of circumstance 
 the house rightly have an annual debate on child loss which impact too many people year after year to i it be an unimaginable grief yet like so many issue life event and tragedy it can be leave unsaid and undebated if it be not raise by a member as a husband and a parent i can not comprehend lose a partner in childbirth or indeed what it be like for a child to lose either of their parent before their birth the phrase it would make anyone ’s blood run cold be probably a grave understatement the trauma be unimaginable yet every year a proportion of family must endure that most tragic of circumstance the unimaginable joy of become a parent but face the devastating grief of lose the person you have plan the next part of your life with and now have to somehow raise a child alone 
 like many colleague across the house my party have be commit to boost and safeguard employment and parental right in recent decade in recent year bills have be pass on neonatal care support people with baby loss and of course share parental leave but there be always much more to do the bill i have table seek to give a day right to leave for parent in the most tragic of circumstance who do not meet current continuity of service requirement so that they have a guarantee leave entitlement to process the grief and change in personal circumstance along with a job to return to when they be able to do so 
 i want to mention   the hon member for broxtowe darren henry who lead the charge on this issue when he introduce his minute rule bill in respect of his constituent aaron i will leave he to speak of those circumstance but i pay tribute to he for the tenacious way that he have lobby on this issue over the past year equally in mention he i confess that this bill be a little different or perhaps a lot from his original bill but for i this be about make progress on the issue my sincere genuine hope be that the bill will be the start of a process and debate about make change to a specific area of law in the month and year to come i be pleased that the labour party if give the privilege to serve our country follow the general    election whenever it come have a plan to improve employment right include those of new parent so i hope i can lobby labour ministers in the year ahead 
 the number behind this issue be concern and i be sorry to say that they be go in the wrong direction datum release only a few week ago by mbrrace which monitor the cause of maternal death stillbirth and infant death highlight how the number of woman die each year during pregnancy or soon after have increase to its high level in year with death per woman even more troubling be that black asian and minority ethnic woman and those in economically deprive area be more severely affected woman from ethnic background remain time more likely to die during or after pregnancy and those from asian background be twice as likely to die compare with caucasian woman those be figure not see since the early 2000s 
 the uk government ’s state ambition be to halve maternal mortality rate between and yet the number clearly paint a different picture it be clear that with maternal death rise more partner and spouse be be leave in the unenviable and heart wrench circumstance of bring up a newborn plan a funeral and adjust to life without their significant other when deal with such a trio of issue the last thing many will want to be think and worry about be leave from their employment parental leave be something we should be proud of in this country but it be by no mean perfect make it easy and more accessible for individual in what can be incredibly difficult circumstance be something i be sure colleague across the house will support 
 when do a deep dive into the issue of leave i be shock at just how low the take up of share parental leave be in this country only of eligible employee mother at a time when maternal mortality right be rise and only of eligible employee take up any share parental leave accord to the parental right survey of for many even the process of get set up on the scheme be too arduous with nearly of eligible mother and father state that it be too complex to set up and manage furthermore due to the strict eligibility criterion for spl approximately of working father be leave without any leave entitlement that include but be not limit to father whose partner be not work or not entitle to maternity leave father who be in insecure work father who change job after their partner become pregnant and those father who be on low income 
 the childhood bereavement network have make the important point that parent of baby may be particularly at risk of financial strain because they be young their partner who they have lose in childbirth may have have less time to build up earning make mortgage payment or contribute to pension scheme and be less likely to have plan future finance dad who be currently not entitle to slp because of their own or their partner ’s insecure employment prior to death may therefore be among the most vulnerable financially 
 we have hear a lot about the stat and figure    behind this issue but it be important to name and understand the live experience behind those figure i want to read    in his own word what happen to simon thorpe his live experience mean that now as an employer himself he support this change in the law 
 my wife and i have our child in august and month later my wife be diagnose with terminal cancer i work for a medium sized charity in the north west as general manager and i immediately ask my chairman to go part time and work flexibly so i could help out with childcare and hospital appointment work flexibly have become the new normal during covid anyway my chairman and board agree and to be honest they do not have a choice but i expect many other employer would not have be able to be so flexible 
 after month it become clear i could not carry on work in such a responsible position and manage the childcare and hospital treatment requirement of my wife so i resign and leave work in october and become a full time carer and parent fortunately my wife be receive full sick pay from her employer so i could afford to give up work 
 my wife die in august and by not have a job i be in a well position to immediately deal with the aftermath especially the childcare look after my year old son be the single most important task however as an employer myself if of my staff have be in my position of lose a partner i would have be able to offer our standard to day compassionate leave i now know hand that this would be totally inadequate and would not even allow time to hold a funeral it ’ true that after the funeral be when bereavement often hit hard i ’m sure some employer would be as flexible as possible and offer a period of unpaid leave to day might be fine for a distant relative sibling or even a parent but for loss of a spouse or even a child it be completely unthinkable that a person could return usefully to the workplace the only other option would be to be sign off sick by a gp 
 i do not think any legislation can fix bereavement and every person respond to bereavement in a different way there be no prescribable timescale for overcome a significant loss and be ready to return to work however provide a statutory basis for leave follow loss of a spouse particularly in the case where there be a dependent child seem a positive step after all there be week statutory paternity leave on birth of a child but it be equally significant should a parent die that the survive parent be able to be present at home in the immediate aftermath it ’ not just the emotional impact it ’ the practical aspect of organise a funeral the deathocracy paperwork that go on and on probate will liaise with school or preschool and so on in these moment think about work be the last thing on ’s mind but of course for many there will be a financial pressure although bereavement support payment have be a most unexpected source of income for i 
 the bill set out the following change it would make share parental leave and pay for a father or partner where the mother of the child have die a day employment right while i recognise that there be already provision in law for share parental leave in the case of bereavement that be subject to a strict continuity of employment test as the minister know as it stand for a mother ’s partner to take share parental leave they must have be work for at least week of the week before the baby be due and they must have earn at least £ in total across any of the week the partner must also have be employ continuously by the same employer for at least week by the end of the week before the due date they must also stay with the same employer until they start their leave period 
 in short that be a lot of fix condition in a world where people change job and career more frequently than in previous generation the bill would allow the secretary of state to remove that test through regulation that would effectively close the loophole that for example result in the constituent of the hon member for broxtowe not be entitle to share parental leave 
 accord to research carry out by the childhood bereavement network a child ’s need for stability follow a parent ’s death make it vital for the survive parent to be able to respond flexibly to they the child ’s adjustment be often closely associate with the parent ’s capacity to care for they include be physically available to they 
 we know that thankfully only a small percentage of family each year find themselves in such a position therefore after discussion with the minister and his official it be envisage that the bill would not require a money resolution due to the relatively small financial cost incur by the government as it link to leave only however as i stress early in my speech this be a step i have learn throughout my time in this place to not let the perfect get in the way of the good 
 while the bill aim to give a day right to leave to those in insecure work i hope it will open a broad debate on the employment right of not just those who work in secure role but the grow number of constituent who work in insecure role accord to a report publish by the tuc the number of people in insecure work have increase from in to last year furthermore there have be a startling increase in absolute term of black asian and minority ethnic person in insecure work over the space of a decade that figure have jump from in to we also know that maternal mortality rate have be rise among the bame community dad in insecure work such as agency work and hour contract be not eligible for leave and those who be self employ have little to no protection should they find themselves in such a situation 
 i recognise that the bill focus on those in insecure work but it be important to have a broad debate on paternity and maternity right that be especially so when the figure be as clear as day in highlight the rapid rise in insecure work and mortality rate among pregnant woman i hope that if the bill pass its reading it will open up that important debate 
 at present there be a loophole in legislation that be leave some parent and guardian without sufficient time to grieve plan and adjust to life without the mother of their child i urge colleague to give due consideration to the bill ’s pass at reading as i have state the bill would make a massive difference to a small number of case each year where family experience life change circumstance those be circumstance that none of we would want for anyone thankfully many never face they whether it be aaron and his young son or anyone who face this tapestry of grief and joy star at a life never plan i believe it be this place ’s job to make life that little bit easy i would argue that that be the very least we could do 
 i pay tribute to the cross party effort lead by my hon friend   the member for broxtowe darren henry   and   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   to correct an injustice for parent deal with the challenge of lose their partner and gain a child and then not qualify for child leave or pay they may even risk lose their livelihood i pay particular tribute to individual campaigner such as the constituent of my hon friend the member for broxtowe aaron horsey who have the courage and conviction to   take up the cause on behalf of other while have to deal with the loss of bernadette and bring up his son tim 
 the backdrop to this important bill how we as a society handle bereavement need some attention death and grief be too often taboo that society struggle to handle but all our life will be affect by bereavement at some point whatever our age background religion or belief we must do more to provide support for those who be bereaved and indeed those who be face bereavement 
 as a christian i recall zechariah 7:10 in the bible 
 oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor 
 much debate attention and action be direct to help support the poor the stranger and the fatherless but perhaps less attention and action be give to the widow or the widower i recall a number of young widower know to i such as guy hordern who have have to face bereavement while raise small child without their wife and the mother alongside they and then also have to face insecurity of employment 
 i also pay tribute to the uk commission on bereavement and its report bereavement be everyone ’s business bishop be not always in politician good book as the debate in the other place this week have demonstrate but there be time for praise and i want to praise the noble lord bishop of london the chair of the commission she say 
 all of we will experience grief through the course of our life it be a truly universal human experience part and parcel of be mortal and as with every aspect of life we all experience it differently 
 she continue 
 the pandemic have a profound effect on how those affect have experience bereavement many people have be unable to see family and friend and have limit access to formal support after their love die feel alone in their grief due to lockdown or have to shield or self isolate have have a devastating impact at the same time the pandemic have also spotlight this universal human experience and present an important opportunity to consider how well equipped we be 
 or perhaps be not 
 to support people through a bereavement and how we should work together to improve that support both now and in the future 
 in that context the uk commission on bereavement be found bring together commissioner and an advisory group 
 through the commission ’s work take detail write and oral evidence from well over people it have conduct of the large ever consultation of bereaved people and professional work with they the commission see time and again that we need to do more 
 as a whole society to support all those affect by bereavement 
 however ongoing taboo around grief and uncertainty about how to help inhibit support throughout our community in school college and workplace even among those whose job put they in contact with bereaved people every day 
 the report state 
 for those who need it there be significant challenge to access formal emotional support there ’ not enough of it it ’ not accessible to all who need it and certain group in society be particularly poorly serve however in addition to significant shortcoming in the provision of emotional support people affect by bereavement often find it hard to get the support that   they need with the practical challenge they face day to day from register a death to access adequate financial support overall many people be not get the right support at the right time with potentially serious consequence in all area from health and wellbee to education and employment and even long term economic outcome we must seize the opportunity to change this for the well 
 this bill be such an opportunity 
 we must not lose sight of the fact that all our life will be touch by bereavement it be incumbent upon we all to work together to improve the experience of bereaved people the commission ’s report set out clear recommendation for achieve that the uk government should establish and deliver a cross departmental strategy for bereavement as i believe the commission recommend 
 by make grief taboo fear it and lock it away we make it all the hard to comprehend and to support each other through it we make it hard for people to access the help they need be it simple flexibility from an employer help with funeral cost or access to specialist bereavement support service it be important that we do all we can to support those who suffer in this way 
 much in that report be not directly relate to the bill so i will not test mr speaker ’s patience far bereavement can often trigger financial insecurity and poverty many people who experience bereavement be at particular risk of financial hardship and change to their material circumstance and living condition that be especially the case for bereaved parent or spouse where the bereavement commonly result in the loss of household income and sometimes even in the bereaved person or family lose their home such pressure add significantly to the stress already experience overall people be not get the right support they need a parent need particular support in the early day week and month with their child and even more so when they have lose a partner 
 the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   make an incredibly touching speech i think everyone in the house support the bill my hon friend have be a leader in small business on the fairly make point by the hon member for ogmore on share parental leave how do my hon friend think small employer should approach these issue 
 for many year in my previous life i be a probate solicitor so many bereaved people come to see i there be real room for compassion when employer be face with someone who have recently be bereaved we all need to look at what we can do to support they other employee be probably more than willing to chip in and give the support that they can which would be especially need in a small business that be also why for many year i have champion family hub i be delighted that department for education family hub and start for life funding have enable family hub to open and provide vital service for family with young child we need to ensure the hub enable bereavement counselling and emotional and relational support for widow parent especially after tragic and traumatic loss in childbirth 
 when enact the bill will plug a vital gap in share parental leave and pay for those who have not complete the month of continuous service with an employer necessary to qualify hon member on both side of   the house have serve their constituent and we well by shin a light on this issue and make it our business to sort it out this bill send a wide message that bereavement be everyone ’s business 
 i be grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate and to support   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore the only thing i wrestle with before make this contribution be make sure that i say the hon member for ogmore not the hon member for elmore i have achieve my purpose and i be pleased to support he 
 the hon gentleman rightly encapsulate the benefit of these friday debate and the process for consider private member bill with which i have not have an awful lot of engagement during my time in parliament i will come on to that this morning we can consider bills of constitutional import and of infrastructural import for stoke on trent south as well as a bill on the theological pursuit of freedom of belief and justice which be introduce by   the hon member for congleton fiona bruce and a bill with practical and meaningful import introduce by the hon member for ogmore who be right to suggest that it will not affect the mass however mass of people in our country should be greatly appreciative of the fact that he have take a step this morning so that should sorrow or tragedy strike their family this issue have be consider he be lay the foundation stone to ensure that support will be there in such difficult circumstance 
 we should not have to stand here and reflect on the regressive fact that he have share with we the statistic over the past year have get bad for mother in childbirth who have need the state to respond appropriately so i be glad that he be take action and have introduce the bill as a northern ireland member however i reflect on the extent of the bill as it stand it appropriately enable ministers to make regulation that will amend act that apply to england scotland and wales i say gently at this stage that i can imagine that that be because our right in northern ireland which mirror entirely the employment right of an act of parliament apply to england scotland and wales be proceed with through an order in council it might be worth consider if indeed it be procedurally possible whether the bill if it complete reading could be amend to include orders in council the order in council in northern ireland and the relevant act in england scotland and wales be exactly the same with appropriate process for legislative consent there would be no barrier in my mind to anyone from northern ireland seek to introduce the provision in the bill there would be no political reason or rationale for not do so i make that point gently and constructively i hope that when the bill receive further consideration a very slight augmentation may provide for inclusion across this united kingdom of such an important measure 
 i should like to begin by give my heartfelt thank to   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   for secure a reading for the bill i have be campaign to make this change in law since the issue be bring to my   attention by a constituent in february so i be delighted to find out that the hon member have introduce a bill to do that 
 as have be evident in previous debate include on my minute rule bill on this topic in which we receive support from member from every major political party this be a measure that party can get behind this be truly a cross party bill there be support for this issue right across the house it be not divisive or controversial it simply seek to allow individual who have lose their partner in childbirth the right to have time to spend with their new bear child without the need to have be previously employ for the week requirement 
 i have tell aaron ’s story in the house on various occasion but will continue to do so until the change be enact in law in february aaron who be in the public gallery today come to my constituency surgery in stapleford in broxtowe in his arm be tim his week old son tim ’s mother bernadette have tragically pass away during childbirth aaron however have not be employ by his company for the week require by law to access share parental leave and pay i have since that meeting feel that it be my purpose in this house as well as represent my constituency to right this wrong 
 in our modern society people should not be force to choose between their family and their job provide the security that allow a parent to take time off with their new bear child know they will return to their job be essential that be no less important for the sole survive parent than it would be for the birthing partner as a father i can not imagine be in the same situation as aaron we must do more to ensure that as much support as possible be in place for parent who find themselves in that incredibly difficult position 
 aaron be lucky because his company be kind enough to allow he the time he need but other may not be in that position instead of sit back quietly however aaron be determined to make a change so that other do not find themselves unable to take leave he have campaign alongside i for this change in law for year and i thank he for the bravery and determination he continue to show 
 this bill be fairly unique in that it give something we can not often grant as members of parliament time specifically it give time to spend with a newborn follow tragic circumstance it be time that if miss can not be regain research show that baby undergo huge growth brain development and neuron prune in the year of their life the brain development of infant include their social emotional and cognitive development often depend on a love bond or attachment relationship with a primary caregiver usually a parent researcher also find increase evidence in field such as neurobiology and development psychology study that a lack of consistency in parental presence such as if the remain parent be unable to take leave from work can lead to long term mental health problem and to reduce overall potential and happiness 
 the evidence be clear that individual who have lose their partner in childbirth be able to take leave be a necessity for themselves and their child we have a duty to ensure that that right be write in law and not leave up to the good will of individual company the negative impact on business that employ individual in these circumstance have be raise as a concern in this area   some may have trepidation that such a change in law would cripple small business that can not afford this type of leave to that point i say that an incredibly small quantity of people and business would be affect this be not an issue that affect thousand furthermore if such leave be not allow business could face lose a value employee a situation that many would seek to avoid i hope that the effect a change would have on business would be small in comparison to the benefit that would be gain by the individual receiving leave 
 i be incredibly grateful that thank to   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore we have the parliamentary time for today ’s vital debate i also thank the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who have be incredibly helpful in bring the bill to this stage however i must briefly put on the record my disappointment that this bill will not include pay 
 the bill go some way to ensure that support be in place for the small amount of people who find themselves in this situation but it could go far it be my hope that we do get to a stage where leave and pay be grant to those who find themselves in situation such as aaron ’s and it be regrettable that pay be not include today leave whether that be maternity leave paternity leave or share parental leave be create to allow a new parent to spend essential time with their new bear child in case such as this it seem that the people for whom these type of leave be create to help be often the one miss out 
 when face with a life altering set of circumstance aaron be affront by have to cope with the challenge of be a new parent the prospect of a new job insecurity and all while in the midst of extraordinary grief that be more than many of we could handle this bill be not controversial it simply seek to allow individual the right under circumstance beyond their control to take leave to be with their child as i have mention previously it be also not a bill that will affect the vast amount of our population it affect a small number in our society who need the help of this government and their employer if an individual fall through this gap they could find themselves face with the choice of lose their job or lose spending time with their new bear child not a choice anybody should have to make 
 to summarise we have a gap in our law it do not affect a huge amount of people in the uk but those that it do affect feel the impact the bill will ensure that individual who lose their partner in childbirth have the assurance that they will have leave no matter how long they have be employ by their company to take that crucial time to be with their child the alternative may be company lose value employee and new father become unemployed during of the hard moment of their life we have the opportunity to change that today 
 i will wind up my remark today by thank all those who have get we to this point the hon member for ogmore the official the under secretary of state for business and trade my parliamentary team lillie grant and joshua stefan all those who have contribute today and lastly and most importantly aaron thank you 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests i commend   the hon member for   ogmore chris elmore   for introduce this important bill as well as my hon friend   the member for broxtowe darren henry who i understand have also attempt to introduce a similar bill previously 
 it be difficult for we to imagine the impact and trauma a family must go through on the loss of a mother during childbirth besides all the emotional impact of that loss of a love the parent that remain have all the pressure of care for the newly arrive baby and any other child without their other half at a time when the family will be go through huge distress and the challenge of keep the family go it be only right that the father and other parent figure can be give all the support possible to get through such challenging circumstance 
 as a parent myself with young child i would certainly find it near on impossible to cope with the loss of my wife and all that she do i be sure member across the house would agree that our other half take on a huge amount so to lose in such a tragic circumstance be impossible to imagine though it be difficult for we to think about those who lose their partner in childbirth must find a way of continue life without they and manage without much thought for themselves for the sake of their child and raise a newly bear baby alone 
 in those challenging circumstance it be clear to i as it will be to member across the house that time off work will be need to sort out a number of issue and most importantly to care for and look after the newly arrive baby as the father of child i know the round the clock attention new baby need from a parent such parent should have an equal right to be grant the same parental leave the baby should be at the top of the list of priority without their parent have to worry about how they can juggle everything cope alone and fight for time off work 
 as the hon member for ogmore say to qualify for leave currently an individual must be continuously employ by the same employer for at least week by the end of the week before the baby ’s due date for someone to be deny this leave simply because of the length of time they have work for an employer be totally outrageous the bill be likely to be of benefit to only a small number of people each year as have be mention but it be necessary to address the injustice of their exclusion from the parental leave they so desperately need although i recognise the potential impact of this change on employer it be far outweigh by the impact on those family who find themselves in this circumstance 
 this flexibility be also potentially beneficial for employer as it enable they to retain an employee in the workforce without that supportive approach a parent may find themselves in the impossible situation of have no choice but to give up work to look after their new baby 
 i fully support the bill where a mother have die remove the continuity of employment condition for the father or partner will ensure that family who have be through such difficult trauma get the basic entitlement that they deserve and can bring up their new baby as a parent should i hope the bill have a successful passage through the house and the other place 
 i suspect the population of the united kingdom be not grip by parliament tv at the moment but i wish they be because debate such as this show the humanity of member of the house this whole discussion be base on humanity and it say a lot about   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   that he have take on a bill that my hon friend   the member for broxtowe darren henry   have work on to bring about positive change when i become a member of parliament i think how difficult it be to change the life of thousand of people in go but if we can change the life of person in a positive way even if it be in very tragic circumstance it be a worthwhile thing for we to do so i be pleased to take part in this debate 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be a practise solicitor and partner in a firm of solicitor people have different view on whether that be a good or a bad thing but i would like to think that i work hard as an mp when we talk about employment right even in the most tragic of circumstance i sometimes feel that the view of small employer the backbone of our economy be not represent and i will give a few thought on that today as my hon friend the member for broxtowe have rightly say some of the commentary on the bill have be about how employer would react to such circumstance when i come down here to be a member of parliament include on a friday i be very lucky that i have a wife who run a business look after child look after a dog look after a family and do literally everything in respect of that she have the pressure of life on she and she maintain a business in challenging circumstance we employ approximately people she be my template when i think what she would make of the bill we be a business that do not make vast fortune of money we rely on treasured and important employee be able to create income so that we can pay wage none the less i do not believe unless my hon friend have be tell something different that a small business even in the most challenging circumstance would seek to terminate the employment of somebody who have go through such a bereavement we must have faith not only in the word that we say in this place but in the humanity of the people we represent face with these circumstance the small business that i know up and down the country would i think rise to the challenge and support in exactly the way that my hon friend have describe 
 it be sometimes difficult to talk in this chamber about thing of which we have no personal experience but as aaron be in the public gallery today i can say that both he and tim can be very proud and please that good will come from tragic circumstance 
 on the wide issue both party share a commitment to share parental leave and employment right i would like to say that it be not a political issue but it be important to note that we have see development under this government such as carer leave and flexible working to try to respond to the challenge many of which come from covid those development ensure that the nuance of people ’s everyday life be recognise and that they be support because they have much to contribute to our economy in the circumstance we have hear about today it be not anyone ’s fault that a person be put in that   position but we can not through prejudice hinder people who have so much to offer and so much to support local business with 
 with regard to bereavement the pandemic bring that very much to the fore for many of we i have child alexander and teddy we all take the opportunity to mention our child ’s name i can not imagine no it be too much to think about i lose my dad during the pandemic my dad who be a very rumbustious lively man be a big part of my life when he pass away sadly the covid regulation be in place so we be perhaps unable to come to term with his death or to celebrate his life and speak to his friend and wide family in the way we would have like 
 bereavement in its wide sense affect people in different way in the workplace and i think there be an ongoing debate my friend the hon member for ogmore say that this be a starting point for the debate and the issue of how bereavement impact people be very important my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce   also make a valid point on that subject 
 do my hon friend agree that what be propose would actually benefit the employer who provide that because they would retain the employee in the workforce in the long term rather than lose they which would have a negative impact on their business 
 i completely agree the great challenge in the modern economy be productivity i can not express how difficult it be to recruit good staff who be productive it be genuinely incredibly difficult that take i back to the point that employer will do just about anything to retain productive staff which be what we want to see 
 i be here last friday when the house be debate a different subject and the question often ask be why we should legislate on such matter it be important that this house and through it our democratic will guide employer on what we feel be matter of importance and priority and this be another example of a bill that do that make employer aware that this be an issue that our democratically elect parliament feel be important be incredibly important 
 do my hon friend agree that business also need to consider leave and pay if they be to retain good staff 
 that be absolutely correct obviously there be bad employer but the colleague i know who run their own business who value their employee would certainly not resile from their responsibility to those employee i appreciate the point about legislation but we must have faith that employer will rise to the challenge i think very few employer i be sure there be some bad example would resile from that challenge 
 before we we have a bill that state parliament ’s clear view that a grave injustice must be remedie it be an honest bill that say it be the start of a journey a discussion not only about how we can build on the bill but how flexible working and other employment legislation can develop and respond to the modern economy i have severe concern about flexible working from home my local authority tell i that a lot of people be no long work in the town centre which be have a hugely detrimental impact on the high street the bill be   part of sensible and pragmatic employment legislation and part of an ongoing response to the modern economy and modern need that understand the nuance and difference in people ’s life 
 any bill that touch a person ’s life in a positive way should be fight for and this be a good bill i encourage the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake to think about the point our hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce   make about bereavement counselling there be in my constituency a wonderful charity that deal with the consequence for parent of suicide and support parent and carer in those circumstance in this ongoing debate we need to think about how the state can invest in service that give people the good chance to come to term with horrific event we be a good parliament our be a good country and this debate show that it show humanity and reflect our belief that employer will rise to the challenge the bill set i think aaron and tim will forever be proud of what have happen here today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for bury north james daly who make some important point to which i will return at the outset of my speech however i will take the opportunity to praise my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore he already have a reputation as an impressive and skilful operator in the house and the way he present his bill today will only add to that reputation labour members want his bill to make progress today and perhaps to open up a broad debate about employment right
