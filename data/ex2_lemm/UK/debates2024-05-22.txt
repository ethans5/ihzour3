 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent step her department have take to improve internet connectivity 
 what recent step her department have take to improve internet connectivity 
 what recent step her department have take to improve internet connectivity 
 more than of uk premise can now access gigabit capable broadband up from just in january the national infrastructure commission recently report that we be on track to meet our target of gigabit coverage by through project gigabit we have already sign contract with another this week to bring fast reliable connectivity to hard to reach community across the uk we have also create an attractive pro competition environment to build network in this country investment in fix network increase by in real term from to with more than provider roll out gigabit broadband across the uk 
 i very much welcome the minister ’s response but do she agree that we need to ensure that we do not create a new digital divide where only part of certain community be upgrade depend on where they be situate and where they be connect to the telecom box this be cause a lot of concern in my constituency where a continue digital divide be be create 
 make sure that we do not have a digital divide be at the heart of project gigabit by the time the programme be over of premise in our country will have gigabit capable coverage but during the roll out process some will get that coverage soon than other we just have a new contract sign for yorkshire which will cover premise in my hon friend ’s constituency he be right that we must ensure that premise between the commercial roll out and the contract roll out from project gigabit be not leave out 
 fast internet connection be just as important in rural area such as broadland and fakenham as they be in the rest of the country i welcome the government ’s gigabit project in norfolk it be roll out new connection and unlock another from the commercial sector but will the minister explain why it be take so long and how we can accelerate the project even more 
 we be roll out gigabit network fast than any eu country i understand that the east of england have have particular connectivity challenge which be why contract be be roll out across that part of the country as my hon friend say there be premise in norfolk of which will be in his constituency 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on broadband and digital communication i be pleased that the number of premise with access to gigabit capable broadband in my constituency have increase from in to as of march what more can my hon friend do to address the shortfall in coverage in the hard to reach area and to expedite those await a type c procurement contract to ensure that we promote universal coverage across the uk 
 my hon friend have probably be of the strong and tough broadband champion in this house i think of she and my hon friend   the member for banff and buchan david duguid   always when i have meeting with building digital uk let i reassure she that we be make very good progress on type c. we have name a preferred supplier for that contract and we hope to have a lot more news on that soon which will be of interest to people across the country particularly those in her constituency 
 hull already have high superfast broadband and although we welcome competition we do not welcome broadband pole be put up all across the constituency what can the minister do to force company to share their infrastructure and stop the blight of ever increase number of pole appear up and down our street 
 i have meet the hon lady about this issue and i have make representation to kcom and connexin the company involve in her neck of the wood i believe that productive talk be under way between they oversee by ofcom we hope that a lot more progress will be make and that network roll out will be pause when there seem to be overbuild 
 in wellingborough and rushden organisation such as serve and the teamwork trust offer digital support for the exclude but for low income household access to the internet through library and school be a key tool for employment and betterment in rural town such as mine what be the department do to ensure that low income household have access to digital service 
 i thank the hon lady for her interest she be right that it be important to ensure that every person in the country can be connect that be why we have encourage social tariff which have be roll   out by a large number of operator constituent of hers who be on benefit will be able to access those they cost from £ a month bring cheap connectivity to everybody 
 i call the shadow minister 
 for rural business internet connectivity be essential as we move into the summer that will be the case for many tourism business sale can be lose and repeat business not return if till and card machine do not work because of unreliable g and the internet go down very often business suffer and do not see many sale the national audit office recently say that the government ’s share rural network programme be like everything else behind schedule what message do the minister have for business that will struggle to keep go this summer with no internet connection or poor broadband speed 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question but that be not a true representation of what the nao say about the share rural network we be make very good progress and hope soon to be able to share very good coverage map show the progress make on the roll out of gigabit he may be interested to know that the welsh government make representation to we about bring it in house because we be make much well progress in england than they be in wales i be very pleased to say that ever since we take it in house we have have amazing progress on gigabit roll out in wales 
 what step her department be take to help increase diversity and inclusion in the stem workforce 
 what step her department be take to help increase diversity and inclusion in the stem workforce 
 the science and technology framework set out our commitment to expand stem science technology engineering and math opportunity to the most diverse range of people possible we have act swiftly to identify and dismantle any barrier to entry as a result we have see major improvement in recent year although there be always more to do 
 today be national numeracy day in my constituency which be of the poor all ward fall into the low numeracy rank in the uk what be the minister do to ensure that people in constituency like mine be not lock out of job in stem by a skill gap that do not recognise the disadvantage they face 
 the hon lady raise a very important point on national numeracy day while we must not be complacent the government have make outstanding progress on equality for all i hope she will join i in congratulate teacher in her constituency and up and   down the country on the fact that last year under this government girl make up 52%—a majority of all science entry at a level 
 the institute of cancer research have make positive step on diversify representation in stem through its apprenticeship scheme can the minister say what if any lesson he be take from that very positive initiative in particular to increase representation in respect of ethnic diversity 
 i congratulate the institute of cancer research on that progress i would be delighted to meet the institute and hear what development it be make as would my hon friend this government have increase the number of apprenticeship unfortunately under the opposition ’s proposal the number of apprenticeship would halve 
 inclusion and diversity in stem will be greatly increase and help by the £ that sir james dyson have recently give to malmesbury primary school in my constituency as well as by the stem college he have locally he have make it plain that it be available to all and that he intend to make sure that everyone in the town of malmesbury and the surround area benefit from it 
 i commend my hon friend and sir james dyson for that initiative it would be wonderful to see many more such initiative across the whole country my colleague and i would be delighted to work with any philanthropist seek to do something similar 
 on national numeracy day will my hon friend take the opportunity to praise the work of university such as the university of birmingham imperial college london and loughborough university that go out of their way to attract woman on to engineering course 
 we be enormously bless in this country with the quality of our university so many of which together with the firm that sponsor undergraduate and postgraduate research be make magnificent effort in the important area of diversity in stem 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state say she want to ensure that 
 brilliant people can contribute and succeed irrespective of their background 
 that be only right but give that only of practise engineer be woman it be like try to play premiership football with half our player bar from the pitch can the minister explain why not of his major science strategy the life science vision the national ai strategy and the uk science and technology framework feature an equality impact assessment we have no idea whether those strategy be help to break down barrier or not the secretary of state ’s war on woke have so far cost the taxpayer ten of thousand of pound and deliver only damage limitation why can the minister not fight for our scientist and engineer instead 
 as the hon lady well know diversity stem education and skill be at the heart of the uk science and technology framework and we will be publish skill framework for each of its priority area 
 what step her department be take to support the life science manufacturing sector 
 the government could not be more committed to support our value life science sector which in the financial year end contribute well over £ in turnover to the uk economy and employ more than people 
 as the minister will know there be a shortage of laboratory space and clinical trial in the uk and company such as precision health technologies accelerator in birmingham lead by the excellent professor gino martini want to be part of the solution to the problem what help can the government give business of that kind so that we can increase the number of clinical trial to help the advancement of lifesave medicine 
 my hon friend be right such be the growth of this important sector that we need more lab space quickly i personally benefit from the advice of professor martini in the life science real estate working group precision health technologies accelerator do some amazing work in my hon friend ’s constituency to knock down barrier to building many of which be sadly the fault of labour council 
 dementia and alzheimer ’s disease remain the large cause of death in the united kingdom the government pledge in to fund dementia research what more be the minister do to ensure that we have early diagnosis access to trial and support for life science to transform dementia outcome 
 dementia be a crippling disease for so many people and will touch so many people ’s life the health secretary and i recently host the head of the dementia mission at no downing street to announce more funding and i should be happy to meet the hon member and any representative of dementia organisation in his constituency 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 a facility that would allow the production of good manufacturing practice phage would be an asset to many company work in the field and would play a key part in tackle antimicrobial resistance what consideration have be give to repurpose the rosalind franklin institute as a gmp facility for phage production rather than sell it off 
 the hon lady have make some important point my official and i have meet representative of the institute and have consider a number of option for it of which they and i believe she will be aware 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that government fund research be use to help increase level of productivity 
 the government be provide record level of taxpayer funding for research and my right hon friend be right to highlight the opportunity to improve productivity a priority for research council be to focus on not just discovery but innovation so that british taxpayer feel the benefit of fast economic growth rise living standard and well health outcome 
 as i see during a recent visit to chase farm hospital well digital system can dramatically improve nhs productivity and artificial intelligence can contribute to that as well will the government use their science and research budget to increase nhs output improve outcome for patient and get waiting list down 
 that be exactly what we be do on monday the prime minister announce £ to roll out artificial intelligence radiotherapy that locate cancer cell and a half time more quickly help to reduce those anxious day for patient and their family who be await a diagnosis that be affordable only thank to the fact that our plan for the economy be work labour have no plan and would end up have to cut the research budget 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 through project gigabit we have sign contract to bring lightning fast broadband to a further rural home and business across our country gigabit capable connection be already be make in barrow and furness through our investment in cumbria and the share rural network have already deliver substantial improvement in mobile coverage 
 i thank the minister for her answer i be delighted to see that project gigabit be deliver for barrow and furness we have fibrus deliver to the procured area and company such as voneus now deliver to walney and there be healthy competition what consideration have she give to roll out truly technology agnostic solution to make the final mile well connect 
 i thank my hon friend for his role as rural connectivity champion i discuss that role yesterday with the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member   for keighley robbie moore i be pleased to see that he recently attend a visit to see how the supplier voneus be invest in a wide solution for premise on walney island i assure he that we already take a technology agnostic approach to our contract with some supplier use wireless connectivity and explore fix wireless access and low earth orbit satellite 
 what step her department be take to help tackle digital exclusion 
 the government have be absolutely clear that no should be leave behind in the digital age digital inclusion be a cross cutting issue span many different area i chair the cross whitehall ministerial group for digital inclusion to drive progress and accountability across government and we have increase the frequency of our meeting that be how important we see this issue as be i regularly meet relevant organisation include by attend the centre for social justice ’s digital exclusion roundtable and the upcoming meeting of the digital inclusion appg 
 digital inclusion work only when people trust website link my constituent let i know that by click on a dodgy link he be trick into make an investment of over £ which turn out to be a scam the government ’s late digital inclusion strategy be write year ago do the minister accept that there be good reason why many old people want to be able to look somebody in the eye when make investment or do their banking 
 choice be important which be why our digital inclusion approach cut across many departments i be sorry to hear the case of the hon gentleman ’s constituent i be happy for he to write to i and i can talk to he about our national fraud strategy as well 
 the impact of the digital world on our life be grow every day but we do not yet know enough about the consequence for society democracy or indeed our child because the datum hold by tech company be not visible to the government regulator researcher or the public will my hon friend update the house on measure to open up access to this data and will he commit government support for the amendment to the data protection and digital information bill table in the other place by lord bethell which would introduce a datum for researcher scheme 
 i thank my hon friend for all her campaign on this and other online safety relate issue we have have a number of engagement the government say very clearly that we would explore the issue of datum access for researcher into online safety during the passage of the online safety act we be aware of the amendment table to the dpdi bill and i encourage my hon friend to watch this space as we will be report in due course 
 what step her department be take to help reduce the use of animal testing in research 
 the day when we be able to eliminate animal testing can not come quickly enough though we be not there yet we be commit to support the strategy to replace reduce and refine the use of animal in research and since take office i have double the investment in non animal method of research to £ this year 
 the reduction and ultimate ending of the need to use animal for testing purpose be an important policy objective of my animal love constituent in romford do the minister agree that animal be not laboratory tool but sentient creature and that the policy of replacement reduction and refinement must be at the core of government policy go forward 
 i know that this be an issue close to my hon friend ’s heart he be a great animal lover and i recall his past work as shadow minister for animal welfare this summer we will publish a plan together with colleague in the home office to accelerate the uptake of non animal method of research 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this government have a plan to ensure that technology work for our people not against they right now the secretary of state be in south korea for the ai seoul summit she be build on the progress we have make and on the uk ’s leadership at bletchley park last year to tackle the risk of artificial intelligence whether it be ai quantum life science or the next generation of advanced telecommunication we be make the uk a science and tech superpower back by the high ever level of spend on research and development our plan be work and our scientist and entrepreneur can not afford to go back to square with labour 
 the uk research and innovation chief executive have announce that they be step down in june next year the recruitment process normally last month yet the government be speed up that process be that because they be worried about the outcome of a general election 
 this government be focus on delivery every single day and i make no apology for crack on with the process of make sure that our brilliant research institution have the fine leadership that the good and bright in the world deserve 
 in recent year government policy lead by the minister for data and digital infrastructure have result in a big improvement in broadband and mobile   connectivity on the welsh border both in my constituency of clwyd south and across the border in neighbour north shropshire but there be still some poor area of connectivity could the minister outline what further step she be take to ensure that all home and business on both side of the welsh border see well broadband and mobile connectivity 
 i thank my hon friend for his brilliant work on connectivity in the border areas—[applause 
 as you know we do not allow clapping but this be an exception 
 please allow i to say welcome back to my hon friend   the member for south thanet craig mackinlay what an appropriate way for the new bionic mp to walk in on science question 
 to answer the question about broadband my hon friend   the member for clwyd south simon baynes   have be a fantastic champion for connectivity on the border there will be contract cover north shropshire and part of wales as we get the type c off the ground so i hope for well connectivity very soon for his constituent 
 i call shadow minister matt rodda 
 it be good to see the hon member for south thanet back in his place 
 last year the uk host the ai safety summit and set up the ai safety institute however since then developer of frontier ai have refuse to share information with the safety institute leave it toothless labour have repeatedly call for bind regulation to support safety with the secretary of state discuss the future of ai this week be it not high time for the government to finally agree to bind regulation 
 i do not agree with that categorisation the truth be that the bletchley summit be a world lead summit we take a front foot approach and we be co host the seoul summit which be bring together ai nation ai company and top expert in academia and civil society we have always be clear that we will ensure that our regulator do the job that they need to do and of course at some point we will legislate we have a plan and our plan be work the labour party can not tell we what it would legislate for it do not have a plan 
 do the minister agree that the large sum of taxpayer money channel to organisation such as the arts and humanities research council for woke drive project should be spend on other high tech project such as for example the tagging of illegal migrant in this country so that we can quickly locate and deport they start in dudley 
 funding council must be accountable for their own individual decision my hon friend no doubt reflect the concern of his constituent who expect in return for our record expenditure on research   the discovery of life save medicine or groundbreake technology that be what they expect in return for hard earn taxpayer money 
 a representative of the world economic forum tell the audience at davos that we own the science what step be the government take to ensure that scientific research in the uk be impartial objective and ethical regardless of who be fund it 
 that be absolutely right it be intrinsic to the scientific method that research be impartial and that it be challenge public transparent and open that be always our commitment but it be also to fully fund research and to turn this country into the science and technology superpower that it deserve to be 
 before we begin prime minister ’s question i be sure the whole house would like to join i in welcome back our colleague and friend the inspirational hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay 
 craig it be so good to have you back among we you be the man of the moment i meet your daughter whose birthday be tomorrow i say to you and your family that you be an inspiration to the people in this country who have suffer with sepsis you have show we the way forward thank you for everything—[applause that be the only time i allow clapping

 i too welcome   the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay   back to the house and wish he well in his duty i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark 
 the association of dental groups in its may report identify my wellingborough constituency as of england ’s dental desert i welcome the prime minister ’s grand scheme to send dental van to constituency like mine but month on he be have to u turn because there be not enough van why can he not address this issue seriously 
 that be not right actually thank to our dental recovery plan we be deliver more dental appointment there be a new patient premium and new provision for remote community and we know the plan be now deliver because since it be announce in january over more dental practice be now accept new patient i also point out to the hon lady that compare with her party ’s plan we be produce more than twice the number of extra appointment to get people the treatment they need 
 today ’s news on inflation be good news not just for consumer in carshalton and wallington but for capital project such as the investment in st helier hospital and in build a hospital in my constituency protect a&e and maternity service locally 
 give the good news on the economy will the prime minister recommit today to work with the nhs in my area to build that hospital and improve st helier hospital and do he agree that we can only underpin a strong nhs with a strong economy 
 we be invest in well healthcare right across our country and i be delighted to see that epsom and st helier university hospitals nhs trust be recently allocate over £ to upgrade a&e and will benefit from a new specialist emergency care hospital in sutton as part of the programme 
 as my hon friend say that be possible only because of the difficult decision we have take to bring inflation back to normal and grow the economy today ’s figure show that the plan be work and i be sure the whole house perhaps include the leader of the opposition will welcome the news that inflation be now back to normal 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i will begin by say a few word to   the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay thank you for meet i privately this morning with your wife and daughter so i could personally convey my good wish to all of you secondly on some occasion there be not many this house genuinely come together as and we do so today to pay tribute to your courage and determination in not only come through an awful ordeal but be here with we today in this chamber thirdly i want to acknowledge your deep sense of service i think politics be about service and resume your duty as an mp and be here today be an example to all of we of your deep sense of service and we thank you for it 
 i also welcome figen murray who be up in the gallery who lose her son martyn year ago today in the manchester arena attack we remember everybody   who be lose in that awful attack she be campaign for martyn ’s law which we must make a reality as soon as possible 
 the infected blood scandal reflect a profound failure across almost every part of the british state in our apology on monday and on the question of compensation yesterday this house be unite however we have too many time hear similar sentiment from that dispatch box and this there be many hard yard to go do the prime minister agree that we will make real progress only if we finally tackle the lack of openness transparency and candour that sir brian langstaff identify as have prolong the victim suffer for decade 
 the inquiry be establish to get to the truth and provide answer and this week ’s report represent a hugely significant moment for the community this be an appalling scandal i be sure the whole house be grateful for the diligent work of all those who have support sir brian langstaff and the work of the inquiry i also pay tribute to the bravery of every individual who have come forward and tell their story in their fight for justice their voice have finally be hear i agree with the right hon and learn gentleman we will listen to they and ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again 
 the infected blood scandal be truly shocking but it be not unique the story be familiar concern raise but ignore report write but not act on victim and their family campaign for year just to be hear if i may i want to focus on the duty of candour or lack of it that have be a failing in scandal after scandal and injustice after injustice from grenfell to horizon hillsborough and now the infected blood scandal i have read that the government have call for evidence on the duty of candour in health but i can not think of a single example where that duty of candour should not apply to all public servant across the board i do not think it be possible for any of we to stand at these dispatch boxes and honestly say never again unless we address that do the prime minister agree that the time have now come for the duty of candour to be clearly enshrine in law across the board 
 i be of course aware of the recommendation make by sir brian langstaff in the final report of the inquiry on the duty of candour and accountability indeed my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care previously introduce the duty of candour to the health service it be important that the government take the time to fully digest the gravity of the report ’s finding the wrong that have be commit be devastating and life altering for so many and ensure that nothing like this ever happen again be a priority we be sympathetic to that and be go through the recommendation in detail at the moment before provide a comprehensive response of course give the situation and the gravity of the finding it be a recommendation for which there be an enormous amount of sympathy 
 i understand that the prime minister want to look at the recommendation in detail and to come back to they in due course but we can not look   away on this duty of candour can i ask the prime minister at least to expand the call for evidence on the duty of candour beyond health we owe it to the victim of hillsborough and horizon to work across the house to establish a far reach and bind duty of candour as quickly as possible 
 the right hon and learn gentleman will remember that on monday i say very specifically that the pattern of behaviour we have see in this appalling tragedy have be replicate in other and i mention hillsborough specifically so i be very aware that there be structural and behavioural cultural problem that we need to fix there be an enormous amount of support and sympathy for the principle of the duty of candour he will understand that we be digest the full content of the report but of course we want to right the wrong of the past and crucially ensure that nothing like this happen ever again 
 in his report sir brian identify a number of individual failure even cover up but alongside that he also find equally important and hard to reach institutional and cultural failing include in the nhs a defensive attitude that refuse to acknowledge problem the silencing of those who raise concern and a total failure of leadership when face with the truth the nhs do a remarkable job every day but those failing be indefensible do the prime minister agree that the very culture of the nhs need to change 
 yes mr speaker i discuss this issue on monday in my response to the question ask by my right hon friend   the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid the nhs provide lifesave care to so many people every single day for which we be enormously grateful but the report make it crystal clear that there be significant failing the nhs fail it fail people and it let they down it be right that the nhs be hold accountable for that and learn the lesson there clearly have be improvement and change in medical practice since that time but go forward we need to go through the full recommendation of sir brian langstaff ’s report and hold the nhs to account for bring through the change that be necessary 
 we need reform we need change i see at hand how important reform be during my time run the crown prosecution service but i also see how hard it be particularly on cultural issue it require brave and difficult decision year ago as health secretary the now chancellor say 
 the era of gag nhs staff from raise their real worry about patient care must come to an end 
 year on from that and month on from the lucy letby case there be still clear example of nhs manager still gag staff and then be move on instead of be move out will the prime minister now commit to ensure that those who gag and silence whistleblower will no long be able to work in the nhs 
 of course the behaviour that the right hon and learn gentleman describe be wrong and i believe already illegal under our law but we will ensure people have the ability to raise concern thing that i know have give many of those who have be impact by the scandal some reassurance be the   appointment of sir robert francis to be chair of the inquiry obviously he be someone who do not just have a wealth of experience deal with this particular set of issue but have a long track record of work with the nhs on the issue that the right hon and learn gentleman raise 
 sir brian ’s report be a victory for all those campaigner and victim who fight so hard for this moment include my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson but it be also of profound pain anger and sadness for so many there be a chance for we to make real progress on this issue and we must do that with victim in mind give the degree of cross party consensus that we have already see on apology and compensation and give the government ’s promise to ensure compensation by the end of the year will the prime minister also now promise to deliver on all the recommendation in the same timeframe by the end of the year 
 of course we want to deliver on the recommendation as quickly as practically possible indeed our expectation be that we can do that before the end of the year as i say sir robert ’s appointment will bring a wealth of experience it be crucial that the chair have the knowledge expertise and familiarity with the issue his support for deliver the scheme and ensure that compensation can be pay by the end of the year will be invaluable 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about the community over the next few week sir robert will seek view from the infected blood community specifically on the propose scheme to ensure the scheme will well serve those it be intend for our shared priority be deliver compensation to all those infected and affect with absolutely minimum delay and begin bring justice to all of those impact 
 in the public vote in what they be tell would be a sort of continuity conservative government the same policy but with different face instead what they get be record immigration constitutional vandalism and a broken economy do the prime minister agree that with the economy now roar back to life under a conservative government the last thing we need be a return to the fail labour recipe of high taxis open border and employment law that destroy job 
 my hon friend give a superb and passionate economic diagnosis he be right inflation be now back to normal and indeed low than that of france germany and the united states inflation be at its low level in year our economy be grow fast and wage be rise which be why we need to stick to the plan that be work he be right to point out the risk of what the labour party propose new law new law labour have cave in to its union paymaster and what do that mean it mean that it will cost job and damage our economic recovery 
 i call the snp leader 
 may i begin by also welcome   the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay   back to the chamber he be indeed an inspiration to all of we 
 mr speaker speculation be rife so i think the public deserve a clear answer to a simple question do the prime minister intend to call a summer general election or be he feart 
 as i have say repeatedly to the right hon gentleman there be spoiler alert go to be a general election in the half of this year at that moment the british people will in fact see the truth about   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer because that will be the choice at the next election it will be a party that be not able to say to the country what it would do a party that would put at risk our hard earn economic stability or the conservatives who be deliver a secure future for our united kingdom 
 the prime minister continue to play game with the public so while he do that let we get back to some serious matter i be take aback this week when a former prime minister speak some sense alas it be indeed david cameron what he say in relation to graduate route visa be that if any restriction be implement it would lead to job loss university closure and a reduction in research university scotland outline that £ of economic value be at risk so may i ask the prime minister do he agree with the foreign secretary 
 the foreign secretary also say that the level of legal migration to this country be too high that be what i also believe which be why it be right that we be take decisive action to bring down the number and that plan be work in the month of this year the visa issue be down by and migration be on its way to be return to more sustainable level i appreciate that that be a point of difference between the right hon gentleman ’s party and indeed the labour party and we we believe that that level of migration need to come down to more sustainable level so that we ease the pressure on public service everyone who come to our country must contribute economically that be the migration system that we will deliver 
 on the welsh border we be incredibly proud of the veterans orthopaedic centre at the robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital in north shropshire which treat veteran not only locally include from my constituency of clwyd south but from across britain as it be the large hospital base veteran service in the uk will the prime minister help resolve the centre ’s current funding crisis cause by change in the nhs funding formula last year give the fantastic treatment provide by lieutenant colonel carl meyer and his team for our amazing veteran community across the uk 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important issue we be committed to make the uk the good place in the world to be a veteran and to ensure that they have access to the appropriate physical and mental health support that they deserve that be why we have roll out operation restore op courage and op nova nhs england have be introduce a suite of health service to work more closely with   orthopaedic service i know that my hon friend have raise this issue of funding with the minister for veterans affairs who will be write back to he with an update in due course 
 i join other in welcome back to the house   the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay we admire his courage and send our good wish to he and his family i also join other in remember all the victim of the bombing at the manchester arena 
 amanda claim carer ’s allowance when care for her mother but the department for work and pensions be now hound she to pay back £ karina whose daughter require round the clock care have be hit by a bill for £ victoria be be force to pay back £ a month they be just some of the ten of thousand of carer who be victim of the dwp ’s flawed system punish harshly for go sometimes just a few pound over the arbitrary earning limit family carer do a remarkable job they should not be penalise for working or for the dwp ’s own failure do the prime minister agree that the government should be support carer not persecute they 
 the government recognise the contribution and sacrifice that carer up and down the country so often make to care for other that be why we have increase carer ’s allowance by almost £ since it be why we introduce carer ’s leave and it be why the well care fund fund respite care break for carer which i know have be warmly welcome and use in the rare number of case where individual have not appropriately inform the dwp about a change in their circumstance the dwp have then rightly seek to recover overpayment as it would be expect to in order to ensure the integrity of the system and protect the taxpayer but of course it will work with anyone who be struggle with their repayment term and will always look to negotiate an affordable repayment plan 
 i too welcome back my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay 
 the £ make available by the government for the repair of road and pothole be very welcome however some local authority such as cambridgeshire county council and peterborough city council which serve my constituency sometimes use inferior material so the work need to be do again in a few month time that be an issue that apply to many constituency across the country so will the prime minister use his influence to ensure that there be tough quality specification so that the repair can last much long 
 i be proud that we have announce an additional £ for road resurface over the next decade money make available through the reallocation of hs2 funding that will mean few pothole and smooth safe road across our country but i agree with my right hon friend that it be of the utmost importance that these repair be complete with high quality material i join he in call on cambridgeshire county council and peterborough city council to make sure that they deliver that for his resident 
 in the wee small hour of saturday morning i receive an email i apologise for the language mr speaker call i a fucking parasite a rat and a piece of shit this come in response to my challenge the appropriateness of a us citizen michael franzese do a tour in the uk as part of which he be advocate publicly for the self proclaim misogynist influencer andrew and tristan tate who be encourage toxic attitude among young man in this country the prime minister have speak about ban hate preacher from enter the uk will he extend that to misogynist 
 those who seek to divide we undermine our value and indeed intimidate and threaten other have no place in our society and we will not hesitate to use not just the full force of the law but our immigration regime to make sure that we have security and cohesion in this country 
 the population of maldon be rise rapidly and for over year my constituent have be promise a new hospital yet the mid and south essex integrate care board be propose to close the exist st peter ’s hospital without any replacement leave my constituent and those of my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel have to travel up to mile for some treatment will the prime minister ask ministers to tell the icb to withdraw this proposal and to commission an independent assessment of how good to provide the quality local health service that my constituent and those of my right hon friend the member for witham deserve 
 i commend my right hon friend for his commitment to his constituent i know that he and my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   meet both the minister for health and secondary care and the minister for social care recently to discuss this issue i understand that the icb have extend its consultation by week to ensure that more consideration can be give and voice can be hear but i will ensure that the relevant minister keep my right hon friend update on the progress of this 
 my constituent have recently apply to move from her council home because she can no long walk up the stair and be in constant pain she have be wait for an knee operation for more than year and have become progressively bad she feel forget and neglect do the prime minister agree that his government be fail and that this country be wait for a labour government to bring down nhs waiting list 
 of course i be sorry to hear about the experience of the hon lady ’s constituent we be put in more money and roll out more elective surgical hub to bring the waiting list down she talk about the difference that the labour party would make to the nhs her constituent can just look to wales to see what be happen when it come the nhs a quarter of the welsh population on a waiting list the bad emergency care performance in great britain people on long waiting list time more than they be in   england and on average people wait long for treatment that be the reality of labour and the nhs fail 
 year ago mrs thatcher describe high inflation as a 
 destroyer of industry of job of saving 
 do my right hon friend agree that that sentiment be as true today as it be then what assessment do he make of today ’s announcement for my gedle constituent who want to be able to save get a good job and enjoy a reasonable standard and cost of living 
 my hon friend be right that today mark a major moment for the economy not only have we halve inflation but it have return back to normal thank to the collective hard work sacrifice and resilience of people up and down the country that be further proof that our plan be work mortgage rate have come down energy bill have come down taxis be be cut and inflation be now back to normal that show that when we stick to the plan we can look forward to a bright future but he be right to point out the alternative the labour party impose £ of tax rise that be what would put the country ’s stability at risk 
 england ’s chief medical officer say that reduce sewage in river and sea be a public health priority highlight the problem that dump untreated sewage cause even the treat sewage that be continuously discharge into river and sea contain faecal matter water firm be now ask for bill to go up by up to when they have pay out billion to shareholder and neglect pipework and infrastructure can the prime minister tell i why his government be allow those company to destroy our waterway and make obscene level of profit while make people ill 
 the level of overflow we have see be unacceptable but we have go far than any other government monitor of overflow up from only under labour investing record amount in our water infrastructure enshrine in law strict target and introduce unlimited fine for water company to hold they to account but when it come to this house the labour party could not even vote for its own policy that be because there be only party with a plan to protect the environment the conservative party 
 our nhs need to be at the cutting edge of innovation and transformation so i very much welcome the recent announcement on artificial intelligence in the delivery of radiotherapy will my right hon friend commit to go far and fast in the roll out and realise the potential of ai and the late most innovative medtech across our nhs benefit not only patient but clinician 
 i agree with my hon friend that we need to ensure that our nhs be a world leader in medical innovation that be why yesterday we announce funding to roll out game change ai to radiotherapy department in england the benefit be clear because   that technology can locate cancer cell and a half time quick than doctor alone but we will not stop there we recognise the huge potential that be why the productivity plan announce in the spring budget will modernise the nhs and ensure that our patient get the care they deserve 
 in recent day the trussell trust have reveal that its network have hand out more than emergency food parcel in the past year that be the most it have ever distribute and nearly double the number of year ago absolute poverty among child in this country have rise by its high rate in year and a quarter of all child live below the poverty line third of uk child in poverty live in family in which at least parent work my streatham constituency be of the worst affected do the prime minister have any plan to restore the child poverty unit address the call for universal free school meal or report on any government plan aim at tackle child poverty at all 
 nobody want to see any child grow up in poverty and that be why i be pleased that the record of this and previous government have reduce not just the number of people live in poverty but the number of child live in poverty thank to our measure to strengthen the economy when it come to food support for vulnerable child we have extend the holiday activity and food programme with £ of funding and we be invest £ in our national school breakfast programme which will now run until the end of the summer term 
 the good way to help people with the cost of living be to cut their taxis keep unemployment low and get inflation down thing that this government be do what be the prime minister ’s assessment of how the very welcome news of today ’s reduction in inflation will help business and family with the cost that they face 
 my hon friend be exactly right in his analysis of how to help work family and our country thank to the difficult decision that we have take inflation today be back to normal which be a very welcome moment of course there be more work to do and people be only just start to feel the benefit but it be clear that the plan be work and that be why we have also be able to deliver significant tax cut worth £ to the average worker in our country that be all progress that would absolutely be put at risk by the labour party 
 harland wolff be an iconic cornerstone of the uk ’s future shipbuilding defence and energy capability it have save shipyard from administration have invest million and it now employ worker across england scotland and northern ireland many of whom be my constituent approval for the company ’s export development guarantee be crucial to consolidate that progress will the prime minister ensure that that be achieve 
 the government be commit to support the uk shipbuilding sector right across the nation i have see at hand what company such as harland wolff do and the role that they play in the economy although as the hon gentleman will understand i can not comment specifically on the detail of any individual case due to commercial sensitivity i can assure he that we be work closely with harland wolff in its request for a uk export finance guarantee loan that be under consideration i also pay tribute to   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   for all his strong advocacy for that company 
 the smart new £ accident and emergency unit at huddersfield royal infirmary open in the early hour of this morning will the prime minister join i in thank the team at hri and welcome the new doctor and nurse who have be recruit for the a&e unit and do he agree that alongside the new teaching block at greenhead college the west yorkshire investment zone and the trans pennine rail upgrade it show that we be deliver for my constituent in the holme and colne valley and lindley 
 i congratulate my hon friend and his constituent on their brand new a&e unit at the huddersfield royal infirmary which be as he say a real game changer for resident it be not the only piece of delivery in his area he mention the trans pennine rail upgrade deliver fast journey but there be also level up project such as huddersfield open market and the new teaching block at greenhead college they show that it be the conservatives who be deliver on the priority of his local community 
 the international criminal court ’s chief prosecutor be seek arrest warrant for israeli and hamas leader for war crime and crime against humanity this house do not aid and abet hamas but it do aid and abet israel through the sale of arm such as component for israeli f-35s know as the most lethal fighter jet on earth which be rain down hell on gaza will the prime minister uphold international law drop the nonsense about the most robust licensing system in the world and end arm sale to israel if the icc issue arrest warrant will he comply by ensure that those individual be arrest if they enter the uk 
 it be always nice to see the change labour party in action when it come to the icc this be a deeply unhelpful development which of course be still subject to a final decision there be no moral equivalence between a democratically elect government exercise their lawful right to self defence and the action of a terrorist group and the action of the icc do absolutely nothing to get a pause in the fighting or to get the hostage out or aid in

 pm 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on the impact on public safety of the request to chief constable to reduce arrest in response to the prison capacity crisis 
 i be delighted to have the opportunity to talk about public safety about the record number of police officer in this country—3,000 more than under the last labour government and about the fact that accord to the crime survey there be less than half the crime today than there be under the last labour government there be homicide in the last year of the last labour government compare with in the last year i be delighted to talk about all those excellent criminal justice result 
 i believe this urgent question be prompt by a letter circulate about a week ago by chief constable rob nixon in his capacity as criminal justice lead for the national police chiefs council in which he refer to short term prison place pressure over a period of day expire tomorrow i have speak to chief constable rob nixon in the last half an hour and he have confirm to i that the contingency refer to in the letter be not require he say the contingency be not require because the prison place situation in practice do not merit it he say there have be no delay to arrest that he be aware of and he have say that while a small number of people be convey to court in police car and there be a small number of delay to arrival at court no who should have get to court do not do so i be delighted to confirm to the house that the contingency reference in the letter do not materialise and that the short term fluctuation reference in the letter will be over tomorrow 
 i have to say that the minister ’s response be shocking tell people they have never have it so good when face with this crisis in the criminal justice system show just how out of touch he be the state of crisis in the criminal justice system after year of conservative government be now so dire that police chief be ask to arrest few people because the system could not cope at the operation safeguard silver update they be ask to consider pause any plan operation where large number of arrest might take place to ease the pressure within the criminal justice system because this tory government in power for year have so catastrophically fail to manage the criminal justice system or build the basic prison place promise 
 last week alone there be prisoner in police cell overnight we have get early release massively expand start tomorrow include for domestic abuser and now this serious impact on public safety of operation early dawn tell the prisoner escort service not to collect prisoner from police station to take they to court because there be not enough place with police force have to pick up the piece instead the npcc say in its letter in the strong term that that be unsustainable and that it risk public safety 
 will the minister tell we what assessment he do when these letter go out and when the crisis reach this point of the scale of the challenge who in these circumstance do he think it be acceptable not to send to court because of his government ’s abject failure on law and order violent criminal domestic abuser repeat shoplifter and which big operation involve lot of arrest do he think should be pause in these situation crackdown on drug ring or grooming gang swoop on people smuggler and when should they be pause until 
 where be the government plan arrest have already halve since the tories come to power and charge rate have already drop through the floor the legacy of year of tory government on law and order be more criminal let off more victim let down britain deserve well 
 the right hon lady like to pontificate in an animate fashion but the fact be that accord to the crime survey crime have halve since the government of which she be a part left office she feign indignation about the early custody release scheme but she forget to mention that under the last labour government it run for year and see people release early 
 the right hon lady reference the letter from last week i have a message here from chief constable rob nixon send to i about minute ago update i on the actual situation so let i just read out to the house what it say the national police chiefs council criminal justice lead say there have be no delay to arrest he say there have be some minor delay in get people to court but everyone who need to got there a small number be convey by police but there be limited operational impact he say there have be no compromise to public safety and the contingency of delaying arrest be not activate as it be not necessary that be from the national police chiefs council send minute ago those be the fact and i suggest the right hon lady stick to they interruption 
 i call sir robert neill and i hope there will be more calm 
 do my right hon friend agree that this important debate which touch upon not only public safety but the whole way in which our justice system operate be well deal with in a calm fashion it be perfectly reasonable to adopt contingency measure which we hope be often not need but the most important thing be to ensure that all party in this house commit to a consistent and sustained investment in all aspect of the criminal justice system because we can not decouple police from the court prison and the whole of the process that be the sensible debate that the country need to have 
 my hon and learn friend as always put it very well he be quite right that investment be important that be why there be record number of police officer it be why prison place be in the course of be construct of which be currently operational and of which will be operational by the end of next year it be why more money be be put into the crown prosecution service it be why my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor who be   here on the front bench be ensure that legal aid be properly resource as be the criminal bar those be all extremely important initiative to ensure that the public be protect the ultimate measure of public protection of course be the overall level of criminality which as i have say once or twice before have halve since the labour party leave office 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 obviously public safety be paramount in all of this and i do want to say to the minister that the fact that contingency plan be be draw up be itself worry i accept what the chair of the justice committee   the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill say about this be a sensible step to take but it be indeed very worrying that we have to have contingency in place if in the future these contingency plan be activate what happen if the police decide not to prioritise an arrest and in the meantime that person go on to harm someone i be think of non contact sexual offence and in particular retail crime which the home affairs committee have be look at recently 
 the right hon lady be right to say that arrest of offender of the kind she describe be extremely important and at no point would i ever expect even in the contingency outline in fact it never come to pass as i have set out that offender of the kind she reference would not continue to be arrest that be critically important the ecsl measure end of custody supervise licence for up to day which come into effect tomorrow be design to ensure that such scenario never come about because as policing minister i want to make sure that we never see the situation she describe 
 will my right hon friend accept that the action by the leader of the national police chiefs council be against the separation of power principle we make the law in this house and we expect it to be implement and administer without fear or favour what seem to be happen be that unelected chief such as the npcc leader be interfere with the administration of justice do my right hon friend agree that thing would be a lot well if the criminal justice board have not fail to meet for year which be apparently what have happen will he accept that we need to start put thing right the times today describe it as a failure of administration 
 i be happy to confirm that the criminal justice board chair by my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor meet very frequently indeed i attend its most recent meeting just or week ago with the lord chancellor other ministers police lead senior member of the judiciary and the crown prosecution service and many other so i can categorically confirm that it do exist and it meet regularly 
 on my hon friend ’s question about the police the police be rightly operationally independent it be not for minister to direct how they discharge their duty they discharge their duty appropriately with their   professional standard and professional judgment and we support they in do so operational independence for the police be important as i be sure everyone on both side of the house respect 
 it be obvious from the minister ’s demeanour that he do not like to be call to account but he should reflect on the fact that the mere fact such a letter be write and in the circumstance in which it be write be a cause for concern which he should be take seriously it be symptomatic of a wide malaise in the english and welsh criminal justice system last year burglary go unsolved across england and wales an average of a day be that not something the minister should be address rather than get a little bit work up with the shadow home secretary 
 i may have get work up because the allegation be make be in my view unfounded and unsupported by the fact i be simply try to put across the fact both the number and also the quote from the relevant policing lead which flatly contradict the dystopian picture that the shadow home secretary characteristically be seek to paint to answer the right hon gentleman ’s question we of course take such matter seriously the lord chancellor be work night and day to increase prison capacity both by build new prison expeditiously and by pull every lever at his disposal to build more capacity within the exist estate the prison be pretty full because the police have do a good job at identify catch and incarcerate dangerous criminal a thoughtful approach of the kind call for by the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill have be take that be why with the implementation of the end of custody supervise licence tomorrow the issue and contingency provide for in the letter of last week will no long be require it be an day period and thankfully those contingency be not in fact require 
 it be reassuring to hear from the minister that the contingency be not require but also interesting to see that the letter be actually issue give his reaction here today to that what process have he put in place to ensure that he be consult before any such instruction or suggestion be issue 
 as a former home office minister my hon friend have a great deal of experience in this area the police be operationally independent but we liaise closely with they and the national police chiefs council i have regular discussion with gavin stephens who chair the npcc and in relation to this matter with chief constable rob nixon who be the criminal justice lead and with deputy chief constable nev kemp of surrey who be the lead for custody i will take this opportunity to place on the record my thank to police up and down the country for their careful management over the past day which have ensure that our fellow citizen have be keep safe 
 north yorkshire and west yorkshire police have just arrest people in a county line operation they seize sword a machete and a crossbow and take kg of cannabis crack   cocaine and heroin off the street alongside the misery and violence that characterise county line gang i be so grateful to they for that work but be the government suggest that they should have allow it to continue until further notice under these contingency plan all because the government have so mismanage the criminal justice system and the collapse in prison place 
 prison place have not collapse i think there be more prison place now than in the recent past i congratulate north yorkshire and west yorkshire police on that operation which the hon lady say lead to arrest of dangerous criminal as i have say none of the contingency reference be activate and there be never any question of dangerous criminal of that kind not be arrest that be exactly the kind of operation we like to see i be speak from memory but i think we have close down something like county line in the past year i be delighted to see such operation successfully put dangerous criminal where they belong behind bar 
 i be glad to hear that the contingency contain in the letter be not require we can tell how tough this government be be on crime and criminal by the very heavy population in our prison estate the long term solution be to build more prison can the minister update we on when he estimate the prison building programme will catch up with the prison population 
 the justice secretary and the prisons minister my right hon friend   the member for charnwood edward argar who be also here be build prison capacity rapidly by the end of next year they will have add prison place include at site such as hmp millsike which will be open shortly we be embark on a huge prison construction programme which be on top of the fact that we already have record number of prison place the fact that we have fill those up with criminal serve typically long sentence be testament to the successful approach to law and order that this government have take 
 last friday i attend a community meeting in my constituency with a group of resident our local safe neighbourhood team and some of our elect councillor it be in response to a fatal shooting of a young year old the resident speak about have the reassurance of know that the suspect have already be arrest thank to the work of the local police what be the minister ’s message to my constituent and many other across the country where suspect will now not be arrest as a result of this guidance 
 i pay tribute to the hon lady ’s local police for the work they have do i gently refer she to my previous answer there have be no arrest that ought to have take place but do not as a result of this contingency the way she frame her question completely ignore the answer i have previously give the contingency refer to in the letter be not in fact require so her constituent and everybody else ’s can be assure that the police be continue to do their job of arrest dangerous criminal 
 i thank my right hon friend for the update to the house in london we have the challenge of the metropolitan police fail to meet their recruitment target the police be under incredible pressure at weekend police hate march and other demonstration in central london police be be draw in from outside london to carry that out now that the mayoral election be over what action be my right hon friend take with the mayor of london to ensure that the met police meet their recruitment target and that the police be train properly and can get on with the job of catch criminal 
 my hon friend be right to raise the question of police number in london whereas across england and wales as a whole we have record police number and of the police force meet their recruitment target there be that do not the metropolitan police under sadiq khan in fact its number unfortunately have shrink in the past year rather than grow i therefore attend the police performance oversight group which be the special measure group chair by the chief inspector just a few day ago attend by the commissioner and the deputy mayor sophie linden unfortunately sadiq khan do not see fit to show up to that meeting of the point i make forcefully be the importance of grow police number in london it be the only force in the country to miss its target and that must be turn around 
 let i get this right the government be boast that they appoint extra policeman and woman to prevent crime and protect the public criminal create and undertake crime and an instruction be give to the police not to arrest they because the prison be full the government ’s defence be it ’ all right the instruction be never act upon can the public have any confidence if it be possible for the police to give instruction today and maybe again next week not to arrest criminal can we really believe that crime be be take seriously in this country 
 crime be take very seriously which why it have fall by in the past year and since the right hon gentleman refer to a period of just day when a contingency be consider but not use the lord chancellor rightly and in a thoughtful and measured manner have take step that will take effect tomorrow to ensure that such a contingency be not require in future that be a responsible way of handle the situation 
 the minister have stand in front of we today and say it would never be any of the kind of crime you ’re talk about the prime minister say last week at prime minister ’s question 
 no would be put on the scheme 
 the early release scheme 
 if they be deem a threat to public safety ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 the minister be basically say the same today yet my inbox be full of case of where perpetrator of domestic violence rape sexual violence and child abuse against multiple victim be be release early from prison do he think that someone who have rap someone go to prison come out and do it again be not deem a threat to the public 
 i can answer the hon lady ’s question specifically the early release scheme that the lord chancellor establish expressly exclude serious violence and sexual offender include rapist there be an additional safeguard which do not exist in the previous labour government ’s equivalent scheme a governor ’s veto of early release if they believe there be a threat to public safety 
 i be glad that the minister have bring the lord chancellor and the prisons minister with he as they can explain how day early release operation early dawn mean that criminal either will not be lock up or be be let out early be the truth not that he be preside over operational failure in policing the court and the prison system and be respond to they with ad hoc panic measure 
 the police be successfully reduce crime for which i thank they in the last calendar year the most recent year for which figure be available there be more successful outcome which typically mean a prosecution than the previous year the court and prison system in england and wales as in scotland and around the world be under pressure candidly speak largely as a result of the post covid environment and delay that build up in the system during covid which have not yet clear that be not unique to this jurisdiction those people release accord to the criterion that i mention be closely supervise under licence and subject to recall should they breach that licence 
 my constituent johnny wood ’s sister jackie be tragically kill by man drive a steal lorry in they be convict of dangerous driving but of they have be release from prison have serve only half his sentence just year he be report to have break his ban order from the local area while under supervision from the probation service johnny and his family have be let down by every part of the system over the last year what be the minister ’s message to johnny and what specifically can he do to help in this case 
 i have every sympathy for victim such as the hon lady ’s constituent and the truly tragic case that she outline if she would like i to look into particular policing aspect of that case i would be happy to help if it be a prison probation or sentencing relate issue my right hon friend from the ministry of justice stand ready to help she and her constituent 
 in relation to automatic release on to licence under the last labour government all offender end up get automatically release at the halfway point this government have substantially reduce that include for offence such as rape i recall in a bill committee a couple of year ago that labour mp vote against a measure to keep rapist in prison for long 
 over the weekend i be almost in tear read a letter from a local primary school of an account of of their young mum who feel so intimidate by antisocial behaviour on her estate that she be unable to walk her young son to school in the morning the school try to   provide a social worker to escort she but they also feel intimidate what message do it send to the school the mum and her child about the safety of our street when chief constable feel it necessary to deprioritise arrest on the minister ’s watch 
 case of the kind that the hon lady describe would not have be in the scope of the contingency outline in the letter of a week ago the antisocial behaviour that she describe be completely unacceptable i be sure that many member be parent and would want their own child to go to and from school safely the government have launch an antisocial action plan of the element of which be a fund scheme for antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol that start just a few week ago so i would urge the hon lady to speak to her local police and crime commissioner i think a newly elect in northumbria if memory serve i correctly and to ask that of the fund hotspot patrol be set up in the vicinity of that school to try to tackle the issue that she describe because no parent should have to face that 
 figure publish last month show that bedfordshire police have the slow response time to call because of understaffing do the minister realise how ridiculous it sound to ask the police not to police and to arrest few people because his government have break the justice system and be allow criminal to get away scot free 
 that be a completely inaccurate characterisation of the situation the day period provide for a contingency that be not require i have read to the house an assurance from the relevant national police chiefs council lead that arrest be not forgo or cancel as a result of the contingency more widely as i have say we have record police number and low crime than year ago and i would have think that we would all welcome that 
 the issue with prison capacity be partly a crisis of reoffende dartmoor prison be subject to an inspection last year and be award only out of because of inadequate education and work opportunity hmp dartmoor hold a large number of people convict of sexual offence but the report say that there be no accredited programme for rehabilitation sexual offence in devon and cornwall rise by in the year to do the minister accept that the prison capacity crisis be partly about reoffende and what be he do about it 
 the justice secretary have assure i that dartmoor be a well run and well regard prison of the reason why my colleague in the ministry of justice here on the benches be preside over such a large increase in prison capacity be to ensure that prisoner be well rehabilitate in the prison estate the hon gentleman rightly mention reoffende prevent reoffende be critical much offending be connect with drug addiction some estimate suggest nearly half so get more people into treatment be important both in the court system and in the prison estate it be critical that as people leave prison and re enter the community the drug treatment they receive in prison continue in the community we call it continuity of   care and it have increase quite dramatically recently i would like it increase even more that be of the way that we will reduce reoffending which as he say be an important policy objective 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i wonder if you could help i to get some answer the minister say during the urgent question that certain criminal who be a risk to the public would not be release unlike charlie taylor the inspector of prison who say that high risk prisoner be be release under the scheme 
 i have hear of a case where it take the court month to hold a sentencing hearing on actual bodily harm against different people as part of a domestic abuse situation the prisoner be sentence to year and be deem to be such a risk because of previous sexual violence conviction that he be put on remand on the day of the sentencing hearing he be release immediately because he have be identify as suitable for early release yet the minister tell i today that no with a history of sexual offending who be a risk to the public or who have commit domestic abuse would be release that be just of many case i wonder whether the prime minister or the minister have mislead the house could you advise i how i could take that up 
 i thank the hon lady for her point of order i be sure she mean to say that she be indicate that any misleading of the house would be inadvertent i be not   responsible obviously for response from ministers but the minister who be still here will have hear her comment as will have those on the treasury bench do the minister wish to speak far to that point of order 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the hon lady raise an individual case and i be sure the lord chancellor would be happy to look at an individual case for she she mention someone release on sentencing of course the court or the probation service will look at time serve on remand already so a prisoner may have be on remand for quite a long time at the point that they come to a sentencing hearing 
 to repeat the more general rule which be ministry of justice policy the release under licence up to day prior to the ordinary release point do not apply to any prisoner serve a sentence of more than year it do not apply to any prisoner serve a sentence for serious sexual or violent offence and the prison governor can veto the release of a prisoner consider to be a danger those be the safeguard but if the hon lady want to debate the matter in more detail i be sure my colleague the lord chancellor would be very happy to do that 
 i thank the minister for state his position i suggest that perhaps the offer of a further discussion with the lord chancellor would be appropriate i be sure the hon lady will come back after that if she feel there be further point she wish to make she be very experienced in know how to make her view know in the house so i be sure that that be probably the good way forward for now 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i would like to make a statement on the economy follow the release of inflation datum by the office for national statistics this morning and the conclusion of the international monetary fund ’s annual article iv mission to the uk on tuesday 
 the ons datum release today show that consumer price index inflation have fall to 2.3%—a return to normal level last see before the pandemic and russia ’s invasion of ukraine early this week the imf say that the uk economy be approach a soft landing it upgrade its forecast for uk growth in have see low inflation accompany by strong than expect growth in the quarter these development be proof that the government ’s plan be work the difficult decision we have take be pay off and the uk economy really be begin to turn the corner 
 let i start with the inflation figure when the prime minister come to office less than year ago inflation be over the fall to mean that we have see the fast fall in inflation in nearly half a century the uk now have a low inflation rate than the united states france and germany food inflation be at its low level since november have fall for consecutive month and staple such as milk cheese and egg be now cheap than they be this time last year although there be more to do energy bill have also come down with the price cap for the typical annual bill now over low than a year ago although they be still above where they be in 
 the fall in inflation have not happen by accident the government have have to make difficult decision to get we to this point as well as support the bank of england as it have act to bring down inflation sustainably we have reduce borrowing which be now forecast to fall in every year to and we be act to boost growth without generate inflation we have freeze fuel and alcohol duty which the office for budget responsibility estimate will reduce inflation by in this financial year moreover in the face of widespread pressure we have reach fair pay deal for public sector worker instead of do what the labour party would have do cave in to inflation bust pay demand we must always remain vigilant when it come to inflation but today ’s number show the benefit of stick to our plan we know that recent year have not be easy for people but with wage have now grow fast than inflation for month in a row family around the country will start to see their money go far 
 and we be do more because on this side of the house we recognise that while the tax rise of recent year may have be necessary at that time of crisis they should not be permanent we will do the hard work to bring taxis back down because we know that to do so will lead to more growth for our economy my right hon friend the chancellor have already deliver tax cut worth £ for the average worker since the effective tax pay by somebody on an average salary have fall under conservative government from to combine with national living wage increase that mean the after tax income of somebody on the low legally payable wage have go up by in the   same period labour ’s approach be different all labour government since the 1970 have increase the tax burden in both good time and bad give the fiscal rule labour have set the only way for it to pay for its spending commitment would be to raise taxis by considerably more than the £ of tax increase they have already outline 
 i will now turn to the imf ’s annual article iv mission to the uk and what it say about the government ’s other economic priority beyond inflation to deliver growth and opportunity for the whole united kingdom the imf ’s message be overall a positive we have see growth of in the quarter of this year that be strong and more broad base than many independent forecaster expect and no other g7 country have grow fast in the quarter on a quarter by quarter basis the imf have upgrade its forecast for the whole of this year from to and in april say that the uk be expect to see the fast cumulative growth of any major european economy over the next year that be partly the result of our focus on area that the imf say be critical to deliver sustainable economic growth boost job boost the labour supply and increase business investment 
 we already have a proud record on job the president of the cbi recently describe the uk as a job create factory that be because over the last year we have build of the most flexible dynamic labour market in europe but we can not take that for grant and we can not let the labour party impose new burden on employer which would turn a job create factory into a french style inflexible labour market unemployment in france as it so happen be nearly double that of the united kingdom indeed not far off where it be in the uk under the last labour government we must not turn the clock back the obr estimate that cut in national insurance will bring the equivalent of more people into the workforce enough to fill nearly a quarter of the vacancy in our economy 
 we be reform welfare labour have say it be against welfare sanction fair enough that be its position but that will mean more people on our welfare roll not less the reform of the secretary of state for work and pensions will help people move from welfare into work at a cost of £ meanwhile the introduction of full expensing the big business tax cut in decade will boost business investment by £ in the come year and give this country the most generous capital allowance in the oecd 
 there be more to do and the imf be right to point out that further bold reform will be need and that boost growth and productivity be the key challenge for the united kingdom however in the word of the imf ’s managing director the uk be in a good place inflation be back to more normal level growth be pick up wage be rise and we be cut taxis the plan be work and the difficult decision that have be take by the government be start to pay off now be not the time to change course because give labour ’s policy on job welfare reform and tax we know that the difference if it be elect will be profound and damage for every family in the country 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 of course it be welcome that the rate of inflation be finally slow after year of the government miss every single target but the tone deaf victory lap we be see from the government today will feel like a slap in the face to the british people who after long year of conservative chaos be still significantly bad off while conservative ministers be pop champagne cork over the rate of food price rise the cost of the typical family shop have go up by nearly £ since so those family will not be celebrate and while the chancellor and the prime minister gaslight ordinary british family by suggest that the cost of living crisis be over the cost for a earner household be more than £ a week high than they be before the last election
