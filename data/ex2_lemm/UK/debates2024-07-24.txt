 the new prime minister use the word service throughout the election campaign and he have use it in this chamber in fact the leader of the opposition even use it in his opening remark on the humble address harlow be a constituency that demand and deserve the utmost service from its member of parliament and in my direct predecessor robert halfon it have an mp who constantly champion and work hard for the constituency i genuinely thank he for his service likewise his predecessor bill rammell who be a good friend and a mentor of mine be still remember fondly on the doorstep by resident he have support both of they have show how to persevere in the face of obstacle and beat the odd although my story be far more humble i hope i can live up to the high expectation that they have both set i also thank bill ’s predecessor jerry hayes who believe in the importance of public scrutiny 
 finally i pay tribute to the late stan newens i get to know stan quite well in his later year because all our co operative party meeting be hold at his house if anyone enjoy a trip back in time through literature i would recommend a visit at the end of every co op meeting stan would come over to i and whisper into my ear you ’ll be an mp day stan i do not believe it at the time but it turn out that you be right 
 my background be of service i spend year as a secondary school math teacher and more recently i work for a charity in harlow call streets2homes which support homeless people and for action for family carers which support unpaid carer particularly those who be young a while ago i have a conversation with the leader of the liberal democrats   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey about his excellent contribution to the report on young carer i also pay tribute to razed roof a wonderful charity of which i be a trustee it be an inclusive theatre company and i have to say a big hello to simon 
 like many member my experience have shape my politic and my interest in politic but my priority be also shape by the constituency of harlow many member will know that harlow be a post war new town design by sir frederick gibberd sir frederick design harlow to be a place of community every community have its own shopping area playground and green space a local historian describe harlow as be design excuse i for this madam deputy speaker on socialist principle it be a place where people can see a barbara hepworth or a rodin while just walk down the street 
 that sense of community be put to the test during the pandemic when we see dark time not only in this country but across the entire world i be proud to report to everybody in this house that during those dark time harlow ’s community step up they pass the test they support the most vulnerable people across our town and community perhaps that be no surprise give that our town invent the fibre optic cable and be the home of harlow college and the birthplace of rupert grint i have no idea why i put those thing in that order apparently harlow have the low density of pub per head of population that be okay though because there be minute staggering distance from my house 
 it be the convention to talk about a non controversial issue in ’s maiden speech that be tricky when you find yourself in a room with people with oppose view i think that i might talk about football but i be a leeds supporter and my hon friend the members for southampton itchen darren paffey and for derby north catherine atkinson go before i so i think i shall leave the subject alone but i be sure this house will join i in congratulate the mighty harlow town on their league cup victory last season let we not worry about what league it be 
 instead i decide to talk about young carer a subject very close to my heart as i have say i be a secondary school math teacher for year in school i have a boy in my form i shall call he george but that be not his real name he be a lovely lad every friday it be my job to check that pupil have get their homework planner sign by their parent so that we know that the pupil be do their homework and record it properly but george never get his planner sign   anyone who know i as a teacher would say that i be a bit of a softie so i let it go but over time i have to keep he back at break time and lunch time because his planner be not get sign he never argue he just turn up do his minute detention and go on his way it be only at parent evening that i find out that both george ’s parent be severely physically disabled and that george and his sister be young carer i feel terrible it be probably that experience that inspire i to become more involved in support young carer 
 the solution to george ’s issue be really easy george like many young carer do not want to be treat differently what we do be say your sister can sign your planner for you as long as your sister get it sign there be no problem lo and behold he get it sign by his sister he get a detention if he do not he be happy with that i be pleased to say that that story be about year old i think we have progress quite well in our recognition and understanding of young carer i thank member from across the house the leader of the liberal democrats and my own prime minister for bring their experience to this house 
 in a recent school census of school say that they do not have any young carer i can tell members that from my experience of support young carer that can not be correct it be predict that there be more than young carer in essex alone essex county council have identify roughly of they so there be a huge number of young carer whom we have not identify let alone get the resource in place for 
 i would like to end my maiden speech on a positive i ask the house to join i in thank all the young carer i have work with and all young carer across great britain and northern ireland for the incredible job that they do many of they do not even think of themselves as be young carer because it be just what they do they help a love but i want to put it on record that to i they be absolute hero 
 thank you madam deputy speaker may i start by congratulate you on your election and on take up the chair today may i also congratulate those on the government front bench on take up the burden of ministerial office i wish they the good of success with that 
 it be with no little pride and a great sense of honour that i rise to give my maiden speech in this house i be indebted to my constituent for send i to this place and i will do my utmost to ensure that i repay the faith that they have put in i it be a particular pleasure to follow so many excellent maiden speech over the last few day i would like to commend   the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton   for his magnificent speech his constituency be a place that i hold to dear to i have train at the royal military academy and i wish he well in his stewardship of it i think he will make a great contribution to this house 
 my constituency be solihull west and shirley like many other it be newly create follow the boundary review while it be very much base on the old solihull seat the ward of silhill and elmdon have move into the new meriden and solihull east constituency in return blythe ward have move into mine join olton lyndon st alphege and shirleys west south and east therefore i have not but technically predecessor as i have allude to blythe ward be represent in the last parliament by my hon friend   the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti i be delighted to join he in this place and i thank he for his support and help over the last few week 
 julian knight serve as the member of parliament for solihull for year he give particular service as chair of the culture media and sport committee i be sure that hon member on all side of the house will join i in wish the whole knight family the very good for the future 
 i also pay tribute to julian ’s predecessor in this place lorely burt be still hold in great affection by resident who remember she as a proactive constituency member of parliament the late john taylor an avuncular man be solihull through and through and he be fondly remember for his dedication to public service his widow ann be still a stalwart of the local community before john come a fellow member of the bar percy grieve qc famously percy once have the campaign slogan grieve for solihull i be delighted to tell the house that there be no need to grieve for solihull any long 
 for those hon and right hon member who have not have the good fortune of visit solihull west and shirley we may be compact be a mere sq km   in area but we pack a good punch we be a diverse community welcome to all we benefit from our confluence of culture which serve to create a great societal bond together we be great than the sum of our part i be particularly proud that several hong kong british national overseas have choose to make the area their home 
 the land now form solihull west and shirley be once cover by the ancient forest of arden on the bank of the river blythe the early settlement in the area can be date back to the iron age the density of the forest of arden be such that even the romans find it impenetrable for throughout the roman occupation of these isle it be hold that no roman road pass through it by the time of the anglo saxons the forest of arden be part of the kingdom of mercia a clearing in the wood be establish and the settlement of the manor of ulverlei be found it be here that the town of shirley now sit the name shirley mean a bright clearing the town of solihull be think to take its name from the site of the stunning arden church of saint alphege which can be date back to the century and be build on a mound of marl this soily hill give rise to the name solihull 
 of course over the year the town have change somewhat they be a bustling centre for business and enterprise we be the home of the touchwood centre we have fantastic business such as gymshark and nearby jaguar land rover remain a significant employer for many of my constituent and a major economic driver for the local area we be bless with good and outstanding school provide our young people with the skill and opportunity to succeed in life through the enterprise and leadership of the local council and the former west midlands mayor andy street there have be an ambitious brownfield housing policy deliver sustainable home for the future while protect the green belt however while many will associate solihull west and shirley with prosperity there be pocket of deprivation and i will therefore work tirelessly to ensure that those part of the constituency have the investment and opportunity to shine in the year to come 
 when you enter this place it be impossible not to be strike by the history that come before you it make you reflect upon your own place in the annal of time there have be many doctor who have enter this house before there be several of we in this new intake alone there have be a number of soldier who have stand up and serve again indeed there be almost a platoon of we enter the house for the time and as for lawyer well frankly we could be an extension of the inns of court however it strike i the time i enter this place that there be a chance that i might be the member to have do all and that rather flatter the ego well how wrong could i have be like the bubble burst in the back garden by my young son george my illusion be quickly burst a former member for wimbledon charles goodson wickes have do all this before and he add be chairman of the countryside alliance to boot so alas my place in the history book will have to wait for the time be 
 i do hope however that my professional experience will allow i to contribute effectively to this place on behalf of the people of solihull west and shirley by be a critical friend on the issue of health and social care so   that we improve patient outcome by protect the rule of law and ensure access to justice and by uphold the military covenant and continue the commendable work of the former member for plymouth moor view who be sadly no long in this place and other to ensure that britain be the good place in the world to be a veteran 
 i be painfully aware of the good fortune and opportunity i have have in life i have benefit from a love family and be provide with the opportunity to fulfil my potential sadly that be not the case for all so during the course of my time in this house i will seek to champion the early year agenda so that we give young people the good chance in life i will also seek to work with member from across the house to improve send provision in this country so that we can move the conversation away from the level of disability and focus instead on the level of intervention and ensure that every child can access the curriculum and achieve their potential irrespective of the hurdle they face because it be only by invest in our young people that we invest in our society 
 those of we who choose to enter the political arena have a duty to conduct ourselves with tolerance dignity and respect these be the value that the public rightly expect of we and in this my maiden speech i make a promise to my constituent that these be the value that i will uphold for as long as they be gracious enough to send i to this place 
 i congratulate you madam deputy speaker on be elevate to the position of deputy chairman of ways and means those of we who know you be very pleased to see you in that position i believe that you will be impartial and fair to everyone as you always be i look forward to you call i to speak and intervene in debate on many occasion 
 what a pleasure it be to see the ministers in their place the secretary of state be here early and the minister of state   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell be here now i look forward to she sum up the contribution of the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds be also excellent 
 we have have wonderful maiden speech today from conservative liberal democrat and labour members the house have be enrich by the combination of contribution include the intervention of   the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood who will make her maiden speech at a later stage as other member from northern ireland have i especially thank   the hon member for harlow chris vince whose story about young carer resonate with i in particular   as i have have an interest in this area over the year i think it resonate with everyone to be truthful but it resonate with i because i know young carer in my constituency perhaps they be not the good student but they have reason for it the story that he tell may be year old but it be still relevant today and i thank he for it 
 it be so important that we have debate on education i have say in this place so many time that our young people truly be the future to ensure that they have the tool need to succeed we have to make difficult decision education be devolve in northern ireland so ministers here do not have respond on it they do not have to take any notice and they do not need to say to themselves i must reply to the hon member they might wish to say something but they do not have any responsibility for our education however i want to give a northern ireland perspective as i always do and make point 
 there be so many opportunity out there for young people some may know what route they want to take in life and for those who do not there be other option education may not be everybody ’s option as the hon member for harlow say but there be other thing that we need to do through education as well minister will no doubt take that on board whether in employment further education or apprenticeship there be opportunity for people to avail themselves of furthermore i be a big supporter of work experience and the prospect that it can bring for young people especially in their education and future employment it can give young people a taste for work and the possibility that it can lead they to i try to offer it every year in my office as i do when i be a member of the legislative assembly and when i have my own business 
 of my young staff member aged and age both do their work experience in my office back in and the other in we never realise that they would day end up work for i they go and do another job in between but end up come back to i whether they think i be a soft touch or what it be i be not quite sure i be sure that they do not think that the fact be that they love what we do in the office like other elect to this house my whole life have be about help people and make their life well that be our job it do not matter what political party we be in we have to try to do that in every part of life year later an opportunity come up for new staff and know the skillset that those people be able to bring through their work experience they be able to come into the job like they have always be there that stick in my mind 
 whether it be in aerospace healthcare science technology engineering and math government law medium trade such as mechanic or plumbing and so on the list be endless it be no secret that more need to be do on funding for the devolved nation it be reveal last year that northern ireland student number be reduce with funding cut indeed it have be indicate that the teaching grant for northern ireland ’s university will be reduce by to save around £ it be also plan that funding for further education college would be cut by to save an additional £ 
 in the limited time that i have leave i want briefly to discuss the opportunity that apprenticeship provide for young people i mention early that not every person can have a civil service job or be in university or another form of education but they can have opportunity out there in society our university be incredible but there be young people out there who do not see university as a path for they to go down the number of people age to pursue an apprenticeship have be increase consistently since showcase how the world of work can provide opportunity for young people who perhaps do not want to go to university apprenticeship be provide in so many industry there be always something that can be find to give young people the good start on their employment path 
 the issue always lie with funding and that be why it be so important that these issue be represent northern ireland have suffer for too long from ill think out budget and lack of funding it be time for our word to be listen to and for budget to be reconsider for the betterment of young people and their future i believe as everybody participate in this debate do that our young people be the future and i want they to get many more opportunity than i get we be responsible for ensure that education and employment opportunity be available to all young people across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland because as you know madam deputy speaker we be always well together 
 thank you madam deputy speaker and llongyfarchiadau as we say in wales it be wonderful to have you preside over my maiden speech i also thank   the hon member for strangford jim shannon it be a pleasure to follow he i congratulate member on the amazing maiden speech we have hear this afternoon i particularly enjoy the story of such an inspirational math teacher from my hon friend   the member for harlow chris vince 
 i be really pleased to speak in this debate about education which be so important i be a governor at my son ’s primary school in monmouthshire cross ash as well as at his secondary school it be so important as we come to the end of term to say thank you to all the governor teacher and headteacher at all the school in monmouthshire 
 i think i be the of the new welsh mp to make their maiden speech so i hope i do our country proud i want to give more congratulation to eluned morgan ms who have just be announce as our new welsh labour leader another strong woman lead we in the labour party 
 i have the honour to represent the beautiful glorious county of monmouthshire and i be its ever woman mp as former chief executive of the women ’s equality network wales where i campaign to get more woman into politic i can finally boast that i be practise what i preach 
 i would like to pay tribute not to predecessor or to but to david t. c. davies the former monmouth constituency mp serve in parliament despite our fundamental political difference we have thing in common our child go to the same   fabulous school monmouth comprehensive i say diolch yn fawr iawn to david for his dedication to public service and to his constituent 
 with the redrawn boundary monmouthshire have inherit part of the newport east constituency caldicot magor rogiet and undy that mean that i owe a huge debt of thank to my hon friend   the member for newport east jessica morden   for her legacy of service to those community and for the exceptional generosity and support that she and her team have give i both during the campaign and as i start my journey in this place she be a brilliant mp and if i become half the mp she be i know i will be do exceptionally well 
 technically i have a predecessor because monmouthshire be a constituency many year ago and its last mp be john rolls a local man who take his seat in my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson   mention rolls royce early and i will mention it too rolls be father not only to charles rolls of rolls royce fame but to eleanor shelley rolls a founder of the women ’s engineering society an early campaigner for the electrification of britain and founder year ago of the atlanta company an engineering business with a real difference it only employ woman that combination of the technological cutting edge and socially progressive view still represent some of the good of monmouthshire today 
 monmouthshire particularly the magor technology corridor be in many way a century economy we be also proud of our agricultural and farming tradition some of the land in monmouthshire be dedicate to farming much of it carry out on small family farm as a smallholder and a farmer ’s daughter i know the joy and the huge challenge of rural life as well as the vital role play in food production and environmental stewardship by our skilled farming family 
 monmouthshire be also a haven for tourist home to the renowned abergavenny food festival the wye valley national landscape part of the bannau brycheiniog national park and the offa ’s dyke long distance path not to mention our incredible historic border castle i say to member please come and visit in the summer holiday we have raglan castle grosmont castle and many more 
 monmouthshire have a proud history of fight for democracy as home to the chartist movement of the 1830s the chartists make shocking and radical demand how very dare they demand universal suffrage secret ballot salary for mps?—so that ordinary people not just the super rich could enter parliament those be now the pillar on which our democracy be base the same spirit be alive and kick in a constituency where in i be proud to say turnout be high than the uk average 
 as a border county monmouthshire be instinctively a place of welcome of the early action in of our incoming labour run county council on which i have be proud to serve be a formal application to become a county of sanctuary welcome and celebrate the contribution of refugee and asylum seeker perhaps it be not entirely a coincidence that many of our leader in monmouthshire be woman from our inspirational council leader another female to the woman who bring such tenacity and passion to run our chamber of commerce in monmouth chepstow and abergavenny

 talk of the drive for equality i be only here because of the incredible woman who come before i and because of the support i have have from far too many individual woman to mention i must shout out about the work of mentor programme such as the fabian women ’s network mentoring programme the labour women ’s network and organisation such as elect her and 50:50 parliament it be thank to they that we now have a house in which of mp be woman we still have a long way to get to and true equality so i pledge as my priority to continue my work to ensure that we do get an equal parliament i will work with every single relevant secretary of state and every parliamentarian across the house to ensure that we reduce all the inequality that woman face from end the gender pay gap to halve violence against woman and push forward the menopause mandate campaign

 i start by thank my family for their love and forbearance in recent month my labour and other friend for their support and the people of rugby and the village for give i the honour of represent my constituency which have be my home for the last year as the mp represent the only seat with a sport name after it i hope that the house will indulge i the occasional rugby analogy 
 the rugby ball have be pass to i notwithstanding a couple of minor maul during the election campaign which i overcame i want to pay tribute to mark pawsey my predecessor who run with the ball literally and metaphorically as a member of the commons and lords rugby team mark be an honourable decent and kind man who serve the house with distinction work tirelessly for his constituent and promote the game of rugby internationally i also put on record my respect for the former labour member andy king whose distinguished service continue to inspire i 
 rugby be a market town that have grow rapidly in recent year surround by many small village too numerous to mention by set in the beautiful warwickshire countryside to the north of the constituency be bulkington which some say be of the large village in england although my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson   may disagree 
 rugby ’s population balloon when the oxford canal be construct in the 1770s and the railway hastened industrialisation i say to any front benchers listen that be on the west coast main line can very much hasten any ministerial visit that they may or may not want to make interruption no stop at rugby the confluence of the m1 the m6 and the m45 near rugby place we firmly in the logistic golden triangle 
 notwithstanding this logistical good fortune rugby ’s potential lie primarily with its people we have be bless and still be by people who innovate challenge norm and think creatively let we take sport a plaque at rugby school record that in the legendary local schoolboy william webb ellis 
 with a fine disregard for the rule of football take the ball in his arm and run with it 
 although my connection with the game of rugby as a player be i confess somewhat underwhelming i be proud to say that my dad who be in the gallery play for england as a schoolboy 
 i will not join the house rugby team but i might join a reform house rock band i be acutely aware of how dangerous such statement can be give that yesterday i wander innocently into a meeting of an all party parliamentary group and wander out slightly bewildered as vice chair as a classically train violinist and semi retired rock musician i be glad to represent a constituency fill to the brim with talented people i will bang the drum and strum a chord for they rugby be the birthplace of the poet rupert brooke whose word 
 that there ’s some corner of a foreign field that be forever england 
 epitomise a quiet contemplative english patriotism 
 we have spawn famous rock band and musician from spacemen to james morrison the creative art scene be thrive with fantastic local band of all genre an orchestra dance school rugby theatre for amateur dramatic gallery and much more the sporting scene be vibrant with several rugby football and football team and a plethora of club in the town and village where selfless volunteer offer pretty much every sport to the community 
 rugby also have a proud track record of technological innovation as hon member get on a jet plane this week they should think of rugby as the prototype of the jet engine be build by sir frank whittle at the british thomson houston work in the town in at the same site a decade later a young hungarian refugee dennis gabor invent holography i live in hope that holographic technology advance so far that day mp can be beam into multiple location to assist with our busy diary until recently dozen of giant mast form part of the world ’s most powerful radio transmitter in the site be instrumental in the transatlantic telephone call i believe in maintain the strong possible transatlantic alliance so i be proud that rugby play its part in deepen the tie between our great nation 
 that pioneer industrial and scientific prowess persist today ge vernova build world lead advanced generator include for royal navy vessel at ansty park we have the manufacturing technology centre the london electric vehicle company which make the electric cab in which many of we newbie may have be move around in recent day and fanuc uk when i visit the mtc recently with my right hon friend the deputy prime minister and the west midlands mayor it strike i that in order to unleash potential we need partnership between business the education and skill sector local and national government trade union and much more we meet apprentice beam with pride at their achievement and in anticipation of a bright future 
 we also need investment most importantly in education i be therefore delighted that the king ’s speech include measure to raise standard in education reform the apprenticeship levy and establish skills england have visit so many of our excellent state secondary school and the brilliant local college i be confident that the people of our area will do the modern day equivalent of invent a sport design an engine or write an immortal poem 
 rugby be a place that be at ease with itself we be a very diverse town and that be unequivocally a huge strength we learn from another celebrate another ’s tradition break down barrier and focus on our common interest something epitomise by the late dr james shera mbe a mentor of mine who be sadly miss across the constituency 
 our charitable sector be strong i will take the liberty of mention local charity that inspire i the our jay foundation which install defibrillator and back and forth mens mental health an issue close to my heart the church temple and faith group be at the heart of our community the street pastors who i shadow on a late night shift show kindness in action kindness be a much underrated virtue 
 the people of rugby and the village be compassionate they warmly welcome refugee from ukraine i pay tribute to the thriving rugby ukrainian community   its ukrainian member bravely forge their new life away from home and all from the constituency who be help they the benn partnership ’s meet and eat on fridays cater for by recent immigrant who not only cook the food but be learn english there show our cohesion our community invest in our young people with fabulous youth centre such as hill street and the bradby club there be too many voluntary group and organisation for i to mention i simply salute they all 
 we thrive more when we work together and when the government be truly an enabler i want to put on record my appreciation as a councillor of the work of council officer and all public servant in serve our community in difficult circumstance i campaign to become a labour candidate use the phrase together we can i believe that be the only approach that will truly unleash the potential of the constituency we now have a brilliantly lead labour council a labour mp and a labour government commit to empower place with a strong vision 
 i will do all i can to bring together people in this constituency urban or rural factory or farm worker whatever their background to tackle the problem we face whether the lack of infrastructure such as gp surgery the need for more service at the superb hospital of st cross insufficient affordable and social home town centre regeneration or the need to make our street safe in do this i be inspire by the late great ann clwyd for whom i work and the late great frank field with whom i work 
 the hon member ’s experience of be a professor will be very helpful to this place 
 my hon friend   the member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst   have significant experience of separate career and i know he will be a strong advocate for his community i applaud his focus on early year 
 i now come to   the hon member for harlow chris vince i be a councillor in the neighbouring area before i come to this place so i know your patch well your experience as a teacher—[interruption the hon member ’s experience as a teacher will be extremely helpful he highlight the important issue of young carer that be probably below the radar for many of we as constituency member and we all need to spend a bit more time focus on it to ensure that our community be support properly 
 i now come to   the hon member for monmouthshire catherine fookes i applaud her ambition to have 50:50 in this place when i speak to my niece and indeed my nephew it be always a disappointment to we that while of our great country consist of woman only about a of my colleague be woman although the proportion be probably great now and similarly many boardroom throughout the country be still very male dominate 
 the hon member for derby south baggy shanker   talk about great british railways as my in law continually say derby remain the centre of the united kingdom geographically and i be surprised that neither of the new derby members mention that as for   the hon member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan his filipino heritage be a matter of passion and importance when i be grow up and look at parliament tv well i do not really but let we suppose that i do this place do not reflect what i think the country do and today it do we be on a journey towards get well in that regard and with his help and hopefully subsequent general election and by election and also hopefully with a few more member elect to my side this place will become truly reflective 
 the hon member for dartford jim dickson   speak about the rolling stones music be a strong theme in parliament he will figure that out in the bar and the all party parliamentary group his significant experience in local government will be very helpful 
 i offer   the hon member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden   my sincere condolence about his mother we realise that we be all human share that personal background with this place humanise we and make sure that we all have more in common all of we will have have a difficult general election and i hope that the tone of politic return to what i think it be mean to be about year ago when politician be hold in high esteem when i speak to individual member of my community they still seem to consider politician to be public servant but unfortunately social medium may not always reflect that and unfortunately you will all experience that so make sure you communicate with colleague because they will all be go through it as well 
 the hon member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith   speak about roald dahl i have the poem if on my wall at home and i read it every single day we have a really rich heritage in our great country and when member talk about thing that inspire they it will only inspire the next generation to be inquisitive i hope that stoke mandeville will be improve because it be a hospital that i will have to use if and when necessary 
 i be conscious of the time and that the minister will need to say a few word so i be go to wrap up my comment on maiden speech i know that i have not address every single but i will buy member a drink at the bar in the next few day week and year please do enjoy this job it be the good job in the world and you really be life change on that note i welcome those on the government front bench to what be a phenomenal brief and i look forward to support they where they be change people ’s life for the well 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i warmly welcome you to your place in the chair and i warmly welcome   the hon member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra   to his place i also welcome the shadow secretary of state whom i previously shadow 
 i thank hon member who have make contribution to this afternoon ’s debate and pay tribute to those who have make their maiden speech today they do themselves and their community proud i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan the member of filipino heritage to stand in this chamber my hon friend   the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling the young member of the house who speak about his education which be fairly recent my hon friend   the member for birmingham selly oak al carns who have rightly be recognise in this place for his experience and my hon friend   the member for rugby john slinger who be forgive for all his rugby analogy after make an excellent speech 
 in this house we come together with a common goal to give every child the good start in life and equip they with an education that set they up for their life we be the department for opportunity at the department for education we be bring education back to the centre of national life again and we will work tirelessly to spread opportunity across our country so that every child can thrive in a school with high and rise standard and with a broad and rich curriculum that they can enjoy like every parent i want that for my child and i be so pleased that we have a labour government who be ready to deliver it 
 i know what a brilliant school and education can mean unlike my hon friend   the member for southampton itchen darren paffey who make an excellent maiden speech today i be not of darrens but i be a sacred heart girl and i be not the only in this parliament the parliamentary labour party boast alumnus of my old school sacred heart catholic high school in newcastle my hon friend the members for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon and for cramlington and killingworth emma foody go there too my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson who make an outstanding maiden speech today also attend a sacred heart school it mean that there be now as many state educate sacred heart girl in the house of commons as there be old etonian boy a tangible demonstration of the radical redistribution of opportunity that this labour government represent 
 my hon friend   the member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter   give an account of her school trip to parliament which remind i of my own trip at the age of when i get in trouble for sit down on these bench clearly such trip work to break down barrier to opportunity 
 the journey start in a child ’s early year when their development and education begin under successive conservative government however the attainment gap have widen it be now some year since i serve on the treasury committee but i still recall our inquiry into childcare as a part of national infrastructure it be ground breaking at the time and acknowledge that childcare be a fundamental service to our economy it be not a nice to have it be fundamental to allow parent to work long hour to provide for their family and it be fundamental to people ’s life chance that be why this government will deliver more primary school base nursery make they widely accessible to parent and unlock opportunity for our young in answer to the shadow secretary of state ’s question early that will be deliver in partnership with the sector to ensure that it meet the need of child and parent 
 we know that childcare need do not end when school start when a child move up to primary school in england they will benefit from the roll out of free breakfast club in every primary school in england this will drive up attainment improve behaviour and attendance and enable parent to start work on time and support their family it will set child up for the day and set they up to achieve because it be as much about the club as it be about the breakfast be in the classroom at the start of the day matter 
 school have a unique power to open up enormous opportunity for their pupil with teacher and support staff who make a mark on every child ’s life that include support child with special educational need   and disability to flourish but across that system we have to acknowledge the many challenge that we face our building be substandard our child be too often unhappy in school and our support staff feel underappreciated we have to do well 
 so many member today have touch on the crisis in support for those with special educational need and disability include my hon friend   the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who i know have work tirelessly on this issue for many year and my hon friend   the member for dartford jim dickson who also speak passionately today this government will help school to take a community wide approach to send improve their capability to accommodate pupil in mainstream setting and support they to flourish 
 last week i visit the brilliant croftway academy in northumberland it demonstrate how child of different ability and need can have the high standard of education in a mainstream setting but we also need to ensure that special school can cater for those with the most complex need for those struggle with the pressure of school life this labour government will fund mental health support in every secondary school and in every community so that they can access support before problem escalate i know that mental health be a priority for many in this place as be powerfully describe by my hon friend   the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith   in her speech 
 as shadow schools minister i hear many story of decision be take about our school that just do not factor in the need of community there be delay that turn to disappointment and frustration i have see this in my own constituency with a lack of proper planning cause chaos to school admission in gosforth this year and countless story of failure be replicate across the country so under labour school will need to co operate with their local authority on school admission on send inclusion and on place planning no more of the chaos that we have see over the last few year 
 we want child to leave school with the skill and knowledge to set they up for life that mean a broad and balanced curriculum that encourage they to try new thing ask question express themselves and be creative while also gain an excellent foundation in reading writing and math so we be establish an expert lead review on the curriculum and will collaborate with the sector to allow school teacher parent and student to contribute and to plan ahead 
 on the question of remove exemption for private school which have be raise this change will enable vital investment in more teacher and improve nursery provision i commend the contribution from my hon friend   the member for harlow chris vince a former math teacher while we be delighted that he be in his place we need to ensure that we have more math teacher in our state school my hon friend   the member for monmouthshire catherine fookes   speak about be a school governor and we need more of those too my hon friend   the member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden   give a powerful testimony to his dear late mother we share his grief and we share her pride 
 ultimately education be about prepare child and young people for life and give they the skill they need to get on but these opportunity do not end at the   school gate for too long post-16 education have be poorly match to the ambition of young people and the need of business and employer allow talent to go untapped and the economy to flag that be why early this week we announce skills england a transformative new body to match post-16 education to the need of the economy by deploy skill investment strategically we will bring employment opportunity to the part of the country where young people need a break and business need their skilled labour 
 my hon friend   the member for derby south baggy shanker   speak powerfully about his apprenticeship and his passion for ensure those opportunity for other my hon friend   the member for milton keynes central emily darlington   speak about the need to not have to leave the place you love to get on in life my hon friend   the member for gravesham dr sullivan   want to see a curriculum for life my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak have rightly be recognise as i mention early 
 all of this work will require a partnership approach none of the challenge we face can be address by person or body alone that be why we be reset the relationship between government and the sector we be listen to professional we be learn from good practice we be work to improve standard across the board it be also why i want to take this opportunity today to pay tribute to all those who work in our school to thank they and to wish they a restful and restorative summer break 
 under this labour government neither a person ’s place of birth nor the income of their parent will determine what they can achieve how they find fulfilment how they discover their skill and talent or how they grow in confidence because break down the barrier to opportunity be labour ’s guiding focus it be the job of this government and it be that we be commit to deliver 
 question put and agree to 
 resolve 
 that this house have consider education and opportunity 
 i thank the shadow minister for his speech 
 mr speaker thank you very much for give i this opportunity to speak it appear that for once my sense of timing have be impeccable have complete year and month of service in the royal air force i have arrive on time uniquely place as the only person who could sequence their maiden speech in amongst a debate about military aircraft unfortunately as my hon friend   the member for bootle peter dowd   suggest in his riposte to the king ’s speech i will not be wear a silk smoking jacket 
 it be a life of service to this house that also characterise my predecessor ’s career a loved politician john cryer give year of service to the constituency of leyton and wanstead and year as member for hornchurch before that he be a fine parliamentarian and more importantly a fine socialist like his mother and father before he his incredible commitment to the parliamentary labour party as its chair for the past year be instrumental in help we get to where we be today while he now move on to the other place i be certain that his child and his family ’s legacy will follow in his footstep in year to come 
 this sentiment of service be something that resonate deeply with i service be fundamental to who i be and it be fundamental to the government and to my commitment to the wonderful constituency of leyton and wanstead i be here because my constituent place their trust in i a trust for which i be grateful and will repay with service and a commitment to ensure they be represent in this place to the full of my ability 
 at the centre of my constituency be leytonstone at the heart of which be our beloved whipps cross hospital whipp have serve our constituency for year during which time its nhs staff quiet professional have give selflessly for those in need within our community yet this hospital be emblematic of year of fail tory commitment and lack of investment its rebuilding be central to my tenure as an mp 
 leytonstone be also a cradle for talent have be home to notable figure such as my namesake david bailey and cartrain and sport star jo fenn andros townsend and david beckham leytonstone be the   home of raf pedigree of douglas webb dfm the front gunner in the famous dam buster raid and more lately of james sjoberg officer commanding squadron leverage this rich heritage to inspire our youth and give they pathway to success be a personal commitment of mine opportunity like these be scarce for young people like i create similar pathway for our youth will be central to my service 
 leytonstone be also home to of the most financially deprive area in the country but it be a spirited community that seek to heal itself community leadership from cann hall mosque ensure the provision to all local people of a much need food bank and a youth group similarly at st margaret with st columba other gather to preserve a sense of community despite their obvious hardship 
 community spirit be also strong in south woodford and wanstead if whipps be the heart of our constituency wanstead park be its lung and the river rode its vein wanstead park be part of our historic epping forest which be save by campaigner such as octavia hill founder of the national trust and the spirit of activism and preservation continue in the wanstead community gardeners the south woodford society and the ever popular wanstead fringe festival 
 to the south be leyton home of leyton orient football club the o ’s and their trust embody the good of our community from their sacrifice in the pal regiment in the world war to their work with waltham forest age uk they support our vulnerable veteran the club be also proud to celebrate our diverse community epitomise by laurie cunningham the club ’s black player his legacy continue to inspire as do the leadership of omar beckles in improve representation in football such leadership be reflective of the club ’s leadership in the establishment of governance for our footballe world 
 effort such as these be key to i visible role model and leadership be essential for diverse community without these inspirational character young black people like i will not see themselves in place of power i reflect on the very low number of black man in our politic despite an increase in representation across all ethnic group address this be key to fix the inequality that face young people particularly in the area of knife crime 
 a pivotal moment in my upbringing be the murder of stephen lawrence while we be aware of the continue failure to provide justice to my friend stuart ’s family we all know of the institutional failing that have lead to this i want to point all member to a number of thing surround this that be formative for i the absence of representation inhibit our ability to hear voice and understand the challenge face by other like we i reflect during the campaign that when i be young i carry a knife not because i wish to attack anyone but because i be scared and feel that the fate that have befall my friend ’s brother could happen to i and other like i mistakenly i assume that i could look after myself similarly but sadly we know that be not the case and that those who carry knife be more likely to be kill themselves we need people like i to translate those experience into policy 
 secondly and in some way most importantly i look back with great upset and anger on how this matter be politicise by extreme group our anger and upset be channel by populist who manipulate we for their own political end those voice be present in our house and vocal in our politic and we must challenge they openly to prevent those actor from foster anger hate and division within our community i fear it be our great threat to democracy and we must be fundamental in our moderation we must challenge those behaviour without fear openly separate they from the underlying issue 
 finally what see i through that period in my life and through a highly decorate fly career in the royal air force be the thing i value most my friend and secondly my family my mother and father instill in i the value and virtue of service and humanity my sister shape i and help i to see the world through the eye of a woman my friend shepherd i through school college and university and through every difficult challenge in my life but it be my wife who have support i steadfastly through a military career and grow our wonderful family i love she deeply and will never be able to thank she enough 
 the reason i be here be my service not just as a member of this house but to our nation in the raf i have choose to speak in this debate because as a young engineering student i recall learning of the failing of the duncan sandys defence review which do deep and lasting damage to our aerospace industry and industrial base already we have hear voice state that our commitment to this programme be a fallacy but acceptance of that be merely acceptance of a failure to manage defence programme and the company contract to deliver they it be not gcap that be a fallacy but the way we contract and manage such programme our interaction with defence prime must change we must encourage risk taking because without it there be no innovation we must not allow the customer to set the demand for technology that the customer itself can not conceive 
 we must be a government who well understand science and we need an industry that be incentivise with accountability we have the large defence budget in the world we must get our money ’s worth and we must make sure that our money lead to our security and not to excess corporate bonus for that reason the remark by the minister for the armed forces about the sanctity of the defence review be key we can not allow defence simply to be buy out of its overspend this be an exciting programme with close and value partner and the government ’s defence review be critical to it 
 i congratulate   the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey   on his maiden speech this be my maiden speech madam deputy speaker and i must tell you that i arrive in this place fire with enthusiasm so much so that my whip have warn i that i need to be careful that that be not how i end up leave this place fire with enthusiasm 
 i be new woman represent a new constituency chester south and eddisbury it be without doubt of the most beautiful extraordinary and inspiring part of the united kingdom encompass the southern ward of the great city of chester those below the river dee and many and varied village in the heart of cheshire audlem bunbury wybunbury wrenbury weaverham lache handbridge christleton and huntington tarporley tattenhall tarvin kelsall cuddington farndon malpas those be just some of the very special place with which you madam deputy speaker and this house be go to become quite familiar in the come year i hope 
 much of my constituency be rural which be reason why i find the king ’s speech so disappointing this government profess an ambition for growth if so it be simply extraordinary that there be no mention of the contribution of farming to our national economy food be fundamental the contribution of the countryside to our country be incalculable and a government who be so metropolitan in their outlook that they fail to understand that and reflect it in their agenda be to use the context of today ’s debate both miss an opportunity and in need of an education my constituency be both urban and rural as be our country understand the importance of both and the necessary balance between the be key to our country ’s future economic and societal success 
 the joy of my constituency be that it include a rich range of dynamic village community and a swathe of of the great historic city in europe the matchless city of chester it be a business and tourism hub that face challenge of course from basic connectivity to burdensome business rate yet boast many success among they the major employer in the chester business park and the university of chester whose business school fall within my constituency and at which no few than commonwealth country be represent among its staff and student in the international barometer survey the university be name in the top nationally in category include a top placing and top category placing chester ’s potential be unlimited and i shall seek to ensure that this government give it the full chance to bloom 
 there be also fantastic school in chester south and eddisbury some of which i have already have the pleasure of visit and many more that i look forward to go to over the come month alongside our excellent state school we have independent school educate over pupil include nearly student with send support who do not have education health and care plan those student will face vat under the government ’s current plan plan that will reduce   choice for parent and increase pressure on the state school system with no clear benefit to any of our young people 
 chester south and eddisbury have much to offer from the glory of delamere forest which welcome more than visitor each year to the excitement of oulton park racetrack and peckforton castle the home of civil wedding in england i say that advisedly because it be the then owner of peckforton castle who inspire a former member of parliament for the city of chester to introduce a private member ’s bill that become the marriage act for the time that act allow civil wedding in this country to take place in venue other than registry office include castle historic house hotel and chester zoo some might argue that that single piece of legislation have contribute more to happiness in england than any other legislation of its type 
 the former member who introduce that legislation who i know quite well in fact i have know he since i be bear remind i regularly that his act illustrate how in this place an ordinary back bencher can make a difference i hope to make a difference in the year to come not only by badger the government about deliver local bus service and improve mobile phone and broadband connectivity and demand that they back our farmer and ensure the investment and infrastructure our village and city need to thrive but perhaps by introduce legislation of my own in the fullness of time 
 i draw inspiration from my constituency and from my predecessor not only my father who be the member for city of chester in the 1990 mr speaker will know both how marvellous and sometimes how irritate it can be to have a parent who be themselves a member but the newly elect hon member for chester north and neston samantha dixon who sit on the government benches and who previously represent the city of chester i look forward to work with she on matter of mutual benefit to our constituent i particularly share with my predecessor in eddisbury edward timpson his inspiring passion for education and his concern for the care and development of young people 
 another of my distinguished predecessor from whom i have learn be stephen o’brien in his maiden speech a quarter of a century ago he say something that i as someone who serve in the civil service for more than a decade and go on to run a small business can wholeheartedly echo as i visit the many small and medium sized business in my constituency 
 the prosperity of those business be primarily dependent on less government less tax less interference and above all a release from the stranglehold of regulation choke as they do a business ’s ability to compete and an entrepreneur ’s incentive to take the risk”.—[official report   october vol c. 
 with such a constituency and such predecessor i know that i stand on the shoulder of giant with much to do and prove 
 the house of commons library which i have to say i be already find invaluable have advise i that i be the member of parliament in its entire history to have the forename aphra i be name after aphra behn the century playwright poet and author   who be the british woman to earn she living as a writer the great century novelist virginia woolf say of she 
 all woman together ought to let flower fall upon the tomb of aphra behn for it be she who earn they the right to speak their mind 
 what a privilege it be to be in this place in the century able to speak my mind on behalf of my constituent across chester south and eddisbury 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for allow i to make my maiden speech today may i congratulate you on your election it be a privilege to follow my hon friend   the member for derby south baggy shanker he speak about his constituency with eloquence and passion and i congratulate he on his speech 
 i pay tribute to my predecessor damian collins who serve as the member of parliament for folkestone and hythe for the last year he work tirelessly here in parliament most notably as the chair of the digital culture media and sport committee which he lead for several year up to he spearhead several significant inquiry into press issue include doping in sport football governance combat homophobia in sport tackle online disinformation and examine addictive technology as a father of boy i be well aware of the parenting challenge that be pose by online gaming and social medium so i know that the work damian do to hold tech company to account perform a vital public service for which we be all grateful recognise his expertise and contribution in this area damian be   appoint the parliamentary under secretary of state for tech and the digital economy in and that appointment follow parliamentary private secretary role in the northern ireland office and the foreign office i be sure the whole house will join i in wish damian all the good for his future endeavour 
 i would also like to acknowledge my predecessor michael howard lord howard who represent the constituency for some year he remain a much respected figure locally and many voter talk of he fondly on the doorstep during the short campaign 
 it be the honour of my life to be elect as folkestone and hythe ’s member of parliament i thank the member and volunteer of folkestone and hythe labour party who move heaven and earth to get i elect without their effort i simply would not be here i also want to thank my wife and my family who have be behind i all the way
