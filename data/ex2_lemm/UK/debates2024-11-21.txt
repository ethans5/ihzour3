 we continue to work collaboratively with city hall transport for london and other mayor on long term transport plan provide last benefit for the public and the economy 
 i join the minister in express my sympathy to the family of john prescott he will be dearly miss across the house and in the other place 
 the previous conservative government allocate £ to subsidise the work of transport for london particularly to subsidise the fare box during the pandemic i understand from the budget that the chancellor allocate £ to tfl but the figure may include £ already announce to finance elizabeth line train if that be discount that leave £ can the minister confirm that the position be that the government have suspend the de facto   right of the mayor of london to freeze fare and that they be require an inflation bust rise in fare in london 
 this be a devolved matter as the hon member say at the budget we announce £ in capital funding for transport for london shortly afterwards the local transport minister my hon friend   the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood and the deputy mayor meet to discuss that it be a matter for transport for london i be sure the hon member have a class relationship with the mayor and i be sure he will press he on it 
 what step she be take to improve the accessibility of aviation for disabled people 
 may i take this opportunity to pay my tribute to the former deputy prime minister and my predecessor as transport secretary a merchant navy steward who become deputy prime minister a visionary transport secretary and an icon of the new labour government he be an inspiration to working class boy and girl across our country for what our labour movement can achieve our thought be with pauline his family and everyone who love he in our whole labour family 
 the government be commit to ensure that aviation be accessible to all i be proud that we have establish the aviation accessibility task and finish group bring together industry and consumer advocate with hand experience to improve aviation accessibility 
 i associate myself with the tribute to lord prescott as a sponsor of the aviation accessibility bill introduce by my hon friend   the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis i welcome the secretary of state ’s announcement of the new expert group to break down the barrier to air travel that be still experience by far too many disabled people do she agree that ensure all disabled people have the ability to travel on flight safely and with dignity must now be a priority for the whole aviation industry 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend and pay tribute to he and my hon friend   the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis   for their minute rule bill on this important issue the human impact for too many people with accessibility issue when fly be severe and that be why it be this government ’s priority to set up the accessibility task and finish group we be require the industry to match our ambition 
 for regional and island airport accessibility equipment can carry significant cost in proportion to the number of passenger use the facility however it remain vital that disabled passenger access be support what action be the secretary of state take to support small airport in this regard 
 airport be represent in the accessibility task and finish group through their trade association airportsuk and both large and small airport be   represent individually as well we will work closely with the industry to look at what voluntary measure can be adopt as we also consider enforcement power for the civil aviation authority 
 what recent estimate she have make of when electrification of the midland main line will be complete 
 the electrification of the remainder of the route to nottingham and sheffield via derby the midland main line electrification programme be in development and currently it be plan to be complete by the early 2030s subject to business case approval and wide affordability consideration 
 it be marvellous that we now have the electric line energise up through market harborough to wigston and we be look forward to our electric train arrive next year even well we have spion kop bridge stay open will the rail minister meet i to ensure that we avoid any risk that future electrification work lead to a further withdrawal of late and early service to market harborough the last train back from london be already far too early so we need to avoid the work have any further damaging impact 
 we be all concerned about the impact of work on service i know that the rail minister be aware of that and would welcome the opportunity to visit alongside network rail to see the work be do to mitigate the impact on the hon gentleman ’s constituent as that work continue 
 whether she be take step to support the participation of small and medium sized local bus operator in bus franchising scheme 
 this government be empower every community to take back control of their local bus service legislation on bus franchising require local authority to consider small and medium sized enterprise as part of the franchising process we be work with those interested in pursue franchising to develop different model include small scale model which require less financial commitment and provide more opportunity for small and medium sized bus operator to participate 
 i be pleased to hear that this be part of the consultation on update the bus franchising guidance we have some strong local sme in falmouth that provide a knowledgeable local and flexible bus service along with community bus service too will the minister please confirm that she will be supportive of that kind of model when go through the guidance 
 my hon friend be a great champion for business in her constituency we recognise the important role that small local bus operator can   provide in deliver high quality bus service they know their customer and their community in addition to the requirement to consider sme as part of the franchising process this government ’s reform to the bus system be design to give more option to local community to deliver local bus service our transformative bus bill will seek to give local area the choice of pursue bus franchising high quality partnership with the private sector or local authority own bus company and once in law will provide more opportunity for all operator include sme 
 i thank the minister for that answer which be incredibly helpful to support the participation of small and medium sized local bus company in bus franchising scheme they also want to be energy efficient that enable they to apply for the franchise and do well how can the minister help those small and medium sized bus company to be energy efficient with hydrogen bus for example and thereby gain the franchise and contract 
 transport matter be devolve in the hon gentleman ’s constituency of course but put bus at the heart of our policy and want to increase ridership provide brilliant opportunity for local manufacturer of bus to take part and support local manufacturer and operator 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on behalf of the opposition front bench i too offer my sincere sympathy to the family of the late lord prescott on his passing 
 on monday in her statement on bus funding the secretary of state say that a formula be be use to allocate funding she say that the formula will allocate funding 
 base on local need population the distance that bus travel and level of deprivation this formula and the funding allocate be a fair arrangement ensure that every area of the country get the service level it needs”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 the formula include the weighting give to the various factor by the right hon lady have not be publish when will it be 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his question we be proud of the work that we have do to ensure that every part of the country benefit from additional funding for their bus and we will publish that late today.[official report   november vol c. 10wc correction 
 the secretary of state also say in her statement 
 council such as leicester the isle of wight torbay and cambridgeshire will see unprecedented level of funding for service ”—[official report   november vol c. 
 what level of subsidy do she believe that bus service in those area will require 
 it be incredibly important that decision about local service be take by those who be operate they that be why not only have we provide substantial level of funding—£1 announce in the budget   and the allocation set out on monday but we be provide local transport authority with the power they need to provide the service that local community want and deserve 
 if she will make an assessment of the effectiveness of local bus service in enable child ’s travel to school 
 the government know how important local bus service be in provide access to education we have set out an ambitious programme of reform to empower local leader to improve service for passenger include through the introduction of the bus bill to ensure that they well reflect the need of local community 
 i too associate myself with the remark about lord prescott 
 in my constituency of tunbridge wells a group of parent have tell i about the difficulty that their child have in get to skinners kent academy the child can get either the no or the no the get they to school minute early so they have to wait by the side of a busy road in the cold and the dark and the latter get they there minute late over a school year that be hour of education kent be give £ for bus service beyond give the money what will the department for transport be do to ensure that the money will increase the frequency of service so that child can get to school on time 
 i think an adjournment debate may be need 
 well mr speaker i do not know the particular detail of the no or the no 297—[interruption forgive i as the hon member have point out kent county council have be give £ as part of our £ package for bus we be right a lot of wrong over the underfunding of rural service in particular over the year and we expect to see a much well bus service across our whole country in the future 
 may i too associate myself with the tribute pay to john prescott 
 over the past few week a number of parent have contact i to ask whether school transport can be bring into the scope of the bus fare cap will the minister agree to look at that 
 service from participate operator that serve school be open to member of the public and run all year round and will be eligible for inclusion in the scheme the current fare cap do not allow for the inclusion of closed school service at the moment that be for logistic reason i understand 
 in the statement on bus service on monday i ask the secretary of state about extend concessionary travel to child and young people her response be to suggest that mps should talk to our individual local   authority about this but that be not the approach that we take to concessionary travel for pensioner i have just be contact by somebody age over who can not afford to go to college because it would cost £ a year and her family just can not afford that be it not the case that concessionary bus travel for child and young people should be extend on a national basis rather than have this postcode lottery 
 as a former schoolteacher i know how important get child to education be and those bus service provide vital line that be why we have put £ into our bus service network i suggest that local service such as mine in the bee network in greater manchester have use their resource to improve access to education for young people 
 rural community in town and village such as holwell in my constituency which i visit last week often depend on bus for their day to day life and for get their child to school but all too often the reliability of these service make it increasingly hard for family to depend on they what new power and funding will this government be give transport authority such as hertfordshire and central bedfordshire to ensure that they can get bus for my community back on track 
 like our rail user bus user depend on punctuality our bus service have not be up to scratch with vast underfunding over the past few year we be hop that the £ investment in our bus will give local community the power they need to hold operator to account on the punctuality of those bus so that our young people can get to their college and school on time 
 what step she be take to improve transport infrastructure 
 what step she be take to improve transport infrastructure

 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important issue i have receive several representation about its impact on driver who use the dartford crossing it be essential that when error occur they be clear up quickly and with compassion for those affect i expect national highways to work with its service provider at the dartford crossing to ensure that that happen and my hon friend the minister for the future of road have be hold national highways to account my official be continue to work with national highways to drive down incorrect penalty charge notice and provide much well support to customer 
 the labour mayor andy burnham and richard parker be develop proposal for a new rail link between birmingham and manchester what engagement have the department have with the mayor and investor in relation to this project and do my right hon friend agree that as a key transport hub crewe must be at the heart of any future rail infrastructure connect the north and the midland

 i thank the secretary of state for agree to meet i and   the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron   about the a66 while there be a strong economic case for dualle the road safety consideration concern i most as she will know people tragically lose their life on the road last week i recently meet constituent in ravensworth who live near of the single carriageway section of the road they live daily with those fear will she reassure they that she and her team will keep road safety consideration uppermost in their mind as they think about the future of the a66

 bath ’s council be consult on create km of cycle road the recent £ increase to the active travel fund be welcome but council need long term funding will the secretary of state commit to long term funding of the active travel plan 
 the hon lady be absolutely right and we be pleased to overturn the previous government ’s cut to active travel england ensure that it can help authority such as bath scale up their capability and capacity and deliver those important active travel route as we look towards the phase of the spending review the ambition be absolutely to move to multi- year settlement deliver that important consistency and sustainability for local authority

 as the hon gentleman will be aware the minister have already ask national highways to meet the hon gentleman and his colleague to discuss those important issue we will place statutory duty and stretch freight target on great british railways to encourage freight off the road and on to the railway but we be absolutely consider the specific congestion issue in the south west as we look towards the road investment strategy 
 an increase amount of transport for london ’s funding come from punitive taxis on motorist include those in my constituency of bromley and biggin hill there be report that the mayor of london be actively plan to charge driver up to 60p a mile to drive will the secretary of state take the opportunity to discourage the mayor from introduce pay per mile road user charge across greater london 
 i be sure that the hon gentleman be fully aware that the mayor have repeatedly make it clear that he have no plan to act on road user charging 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we will all miss john prescott he be a titan of our politic and a man not afraid to come out swing for what he believe in 
 the figure show that capital spending on transport be not rise under labour it will fall by in real term next year we have huge tax rise and a more than £ increase in tax labour ’s black hole myth have be debunk by the office for budget responsibility the financial times and the institute for fiscal studies all real economist so why the cut in capital spending the secretary of state be out of her depth when she negotiate a £ pay rise for aslef train driver with nothing in return be she out of her depth when she negotiate with her own chancellor 
 this budget deliver £ funding for local bus service and transformational capital investment in infrastructure project such as the trans pennine route upgrade the a57 and of course east west rail this government be commit to investing investing invest in transport transport transport 
 what step she be take to simplify railway ticketing 
 this government be commit to review the over complicate fare system to simplify it we only have to look on social medium any day of the week to see example of people be confused and wrongly prosecute because of the confusing nature of the rail system my official   be explore how ticket innovation such as digital pay as you go and digital season ticket can be roll out more widely as quickly as possible 
 i associate myself with the tribute pay to john prescott radio merseyside have feature many story about passenger who be fin because they buy train ticket in good faith only to find out that they be the wrong one some of my knowsley constituent find themselves be fin or deny travel by merseytravel for buy ticket legitimately online what step be the secretary of state take to work with our mayor steve rotherham and with merseyrail and other operator to ensure that passenger be not unfairly penalise and to create a clear and fair ticketing system that be easy for everyone to use 
 we be work with the mayor as we look to establish great british railways i have ask the office of rail and road to conduct an independent review of rail operator revenue protection practice that launch today and will involve devolved operator where appropriate address fare evasion be a priority but we must always treat passenger fairly and appropriately 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i join other in express my party ’s sympathy for the family friend colleague and former constituent of john prescott he be a tower figure 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s comment on simplify ticketing that will doubtless help to get people back on to the railway affordability be also critical to increase the use of public transport alongside her hike in bus fare the chancellor bury on page of the budget an above inflation rail fare increase of that kick in from march just when we expect public ownership of the railroad to begin 
 ahem 
 now that the railway be come under her guardianship will the secretary of state assure the house that that will be the last above inflation rail fare increase in this parliament 
 order question should be a bit short i do not know who be do your briefing well i suspect i do but short question would be helpful 
 of course a priority for this government be to keep public transport affordable but our absolute priority be to fix the mess in the railway that we inherit after year of under investment decline and put passenger last in a broken system 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 the government be determined to improve the condition of local road we have a manifesto commitment to support council in fix up to more pothole per year we be go above and beyond that manifesto commitment last month ’s budget confirm an increase of £ for next financial year to fix britain ’s crumble road 
 i pay tribute to lord prescott i welcome the secretary of state ’s announcement of this vital funding will she comment on the excellent work carry out by read borough council which have start resurface large section of road that not only create a smoother surface for driver but have be prove to save money in the long run 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the excellent practice be undertake by read borough council that be the kind of innovation that we need to see across the country not just fix and repair pothole but ensure that we prevent they and improve the quality and lifespan of our local road 
 people live near the concrete section of the m25 in my constituency be besiege by motorway noise in fact some school and home can not open window such be the noise nuisance do the secretary of state agree that that be an absolute disgrace and will she support my campaign to scrap the concrete section of the m25 motorway 
 i believe the hon gentleman meet the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend hon member for nottingham south lilian greenwood last week on exactly that issue she will follow up on it as will national highways 
 i associate myself with the comment about lord prescott i be grateful for the secretary of state ’s answer on local road the road in leeds south west and morley be in a dire state asquith avenue have be compare to the surface of the moon commuter in farnley wortley morley and tingley have to dodge pothole every day and even the more rural area of my constituency such as ardsley and robin hood be suffer the same fate what reassurance can the secretary of state give my constituent that those road will be improve and when can they expect those improvement 
 my hon friend be absolutely right pothole and poor road condition be a menace that make our road less safe and have saddle driver with costly repair the £ uplift will be available in and we will announce the allocation shortly include those for west yorkshire 
 i also pay tribute to lord prescott nearly of my constituent work in the vital freight and logistic sector yet the industry continue to pick   up the bill for the failure of warwickshire county council to fix my constituent pothole riddle road now that the government have provide a £ increase to fix pothole do the secretary of state agree that the council must take action to tackle the scourge of pothole which be cause untold damage to my constituent car truck and lorry 
 my hon friend be absolutely right local authority be responsible for the state of their local road but with this significant uplift for we expect they to ensure that that be a priority and to tackle the state of the local road which be affect my hon friend ’s constituent so badly 
 john prescott be a tower figure in the politic of the humber region and i associate myself with the word of sympathy to his family road in my constituency be under great pressure because traffic from the a180 be continually be transfer on to they while it be be patch up early this month   the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn   and i meet national highways and it be perfectly obvious that the a180 will be in its present state for many year to come will the secretary of state meet i and the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes to discuss this and other transport issue in the area 
 you be run out of road 
 i be sure that the minister with responsibility for road my hon friend   the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood would be very happy to meet the hon gentleman and my hon friend   the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn 
 the safety and condition of our road be hugely dependent on those who drive on they but too many vehicle illegally use our road without tax without register their detail with the driver and vehicle licensing agency and without their mot i thank jamie from sisters garage for sort my mot out last week will the secretary of state meet industry expert such as eastbourne ’s very own alan wood of the national persistent evader database to discuss their solution to tackle this problem and make our road safe 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for that important point i have meet the driver and vehicle standards agency to talk about its important enforcement work in this area measure of that kind will absolutely be consider in the development of our road safety strategy and we will work closely with stakeholder exactly as the minister with responsibility for road mention 
 i associate myself with the tribute pay to lord prescott talk of pothole repair and road resurfacing the director of the rac steve gooding say 
 the long term solution be a long term funding settlement for council so they can finally get on top of what have be a perennial problem 
 but councils—[laughter hon member might laugh but our council which have to do the work of repair our road do not know how much money they will get from the much trumpet £ when will our council actually get their allocation 
 as i have say the £ be available for and those allocation will be announce shortly the brass neck on opposition members never cease to amaze 
 i be just try to get answer for our council of course it be the previous government who commit £ to road repair use money from the rightly cancel section of high speed back in may when it be in opposition labour try to claim a backlog of more than £ in road repair but now it just trumpet funding of £ that be not enough be it 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for recognise the appalling state of our local road and the appalling backlog that we inherit the significant uplift allocate for next year will start to turn the page on year of decline but of course that can not be achieve overnight 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of bus service in rural area 
 year of decline in local bus service under the previous administration have hit community across the country hard especially in rural area this government know that bus be a lifeline and through our upcoming bus bill we will give all local leader the power that they need to design network that meet the need of their community include measure to ensure that vital service for passenger remain run 
 many of my thornbury and yate constituent have be impact by the loss of the bus i be tell that funding be make more difficult because that bus be a cross border service between gloucestershire and the west of england do the minister agree that the rule need clarify so that they do not get in the way of ensure that we keep important bus service run 
 i absolutely recognise the concern that arise when vital bus service be lose which the hon lady mention that be why in the forthcoming bus bill we will explore a local network management measure that will give local transport authority the power to ensure that cut to local network be make only when absolutely necessary thus protect people like her constituent who rely on that vital bus service 
 i call chris bloore 
 thank you mr speaker for recognise my half bob my thought be with lord prescott ’s family he be of the politician i meet as a young student and he certainly make an impression 
 may i congratulate the secretary of state and the minister on the £ investment in bus in worcestershire i represent a rural constituency where people have not be able to get to work access health service or stay connected with friend and family this investment may well make a real difference to their life 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to speak up for his constituent in worcestershire and about the difference that will be make by the funding that this government be provide it will ensure that his constituent have the connection that be cut off for too long under the previous government 
 what step she be take to improve the accessibility of railway station for disabled people 
 ensure that rail service and facility be accessible to all be a core principle of our plan to fix britain ’s break rail system the department be carefully consider the good approach to station accessibility and recognise the huge social and economic benefit it bring to community mp and stakeholder will be update in due course 
 after northwich station collapse in an access for all application be submit with the support of local partner to add step free access to the chester bind platform unfortunately that opportunity be miss by the last government and the station have be rebuild without those accessibility improvement i welcome the inclusion of improve accessibility in great british railways mandate but what step can be take to ensure that station such as northwich see improvement while we wait for gbr to get up and run 
 i thank my hon friend for pick up the baton on northwich station we all remember the terrible situation when the canopy collapse this government be commit to improve the accessibility of the railway and recognise its huge social and economic benefit the access for all programme will deliver step free station this financial year the most since that programme start anyone unable to use a station in the meantime can book alternative transport with the operator at no additional cost 
 if she will take step to help reduce overcrowding on chiltern railways service 
 the secretary of state for transport lord hendy and official continue to work closely with chiltern railways to support delivery of an improved passenger experience to reduce crowding chiltern periodically adjust its timetable respond to passenger demand it be explore option for procure additional train in order to relieve crowding while ensure value for money for the taxpayer

 i wish to update the house on my engagement at cop and the g20 we live in a dangerous and volatile world we all wish that that be not the case but it be and it mean that global problem be reach into the life of our constituent more and more climate change cause extreme weather such as the terrible flood that we see in september and drive down economic growth conflict drive up the price of fuel food and energy and threaten our stability and security and both be driver of migration to serve the british people we must tackle these problem head on because they do not stop at our border and that be the fundamental point at every meeting i have at cop and the g20 and in every agreement i enter into my focus be on tackle these problem to deliver growth and security for the british people 
 at cop i make the case that we must act on climate change and nature loss as some of the great long term threat we face and in do so we must seize the opportunity of the low carbon economy for investment for uk business and for british worker at cop i be proud to announce the uk ’s new nationally determine contribution with a target to reduce all greenhouse gas emission by at least on level i call on other country to match that ambition to limit global temperature rise to ° and i make the investment case for the transformation that we be lead here in the united kingdom 
 by launch gb energy create the national wealth fund to build new energy infrastructure and set a path to clean power by we will not just boost our energy security and protect bill payer but put britain in pole position to claim the clean energy job of the future that be why at cop i be able to announce a £ wind turbine investment that will support local job around hull something of which john would have be very proud and produce enough clean energy to power home that be in addition to the recent investment in carbon capture in teesside and merseyside which will create job and the investment announce by my right hon friend the chancellor for new green hydrogen project across britain 
 tackle climate change be of course a global effort so at the g20 together with brazil and other country i launch our global clean power alliance to speed up the international roll out of clean power accelerate investment and cut emission around the world 
 we come together at the g20 to meet other challenge as well i be pleased to join president lula ’s global alliance against hunger and poverty to bring an end to the lost decade in that fight because this be also an investment in stability and in tackle the factor that force people to leave their home and make long journey that too often end with criminal gang exploit they and put their life at risk in the english channel we will smash those gang i be sure the house will welcome last week ’s news from the netherlands where the national crime agency operate with european partner arrest a man suspect of be a major supplier of small boat equipment we will hit these organise criminal with the full force of the law but we will also work with our partner to address the root cause of the problem 
 the g20 represent of global gdp so we have a share interest in drive up growth and investment i hold productive bilateral meeting with many g20 leader to that end brazil japan italy south africa the republic of korea and other i also meet representative of italy and japan to take forward the global combat air programme which will build the next generation of fighter jet create high skilled job and strengthen our national security for the long term 
 i have a good discussion with prime minister modi about deepen our bilateral tie we agree to raise the ambition of our uk india comprehensive strategic partnership which cover security defence technology climate health and education build on the unique bond and cultural tie between our country crucially this work will start with trade and investment and i be pleased to say that we agree to relaunch free trade agreement negotiation early in the new year 
 i also hold a bilateral meeting with president xi this be the leader level meeting between the united kingdom and china for year we have a frank constructive and pragmatic discussion as g20 economy and permanent member of the un security council at a time of huge volatility we both recognise the importance of engagement i be clear that we will always act in our national interest but we need to work together on challenge such as climate change and deliver growth we agree a new dialogue on these issue which my right hon friend the chancellor will take forward with vice premier he in beijing of course there will continue to be area where we do not agree and we will address they clearly and frankly they include a number of human right issue the sanctioning of member of this house and of course hong kong but here too we need to engage the lesson of history be that we be well able to deal with problem and the world be safe when leader talk so we agree to keep this channel of communication open 
 although it be not on the formal agenda of the g20 the spectre of conflict loom large over the summit conflict be spread misery destruction and despair and cause child to starve and family to flee their home i call again for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostage in gaza who be always uppermost in our mind i also call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza and for a massive increase in the flow of aid which be desperately need yesterday we back a un security council resolution to that end we must find way to make this international pressure count to end the suffering on all side 
 the g20 coincide with the marking of day of conflict in ukraine for the year run putin do not attend instead on the eve of the summit he launch russia ’s big attack for month kill yet more innocent ukrainians and hit civilian energy infrastructure at the start of winter and he indulge yet again in dangerous irresponsible rhetoric this be a member of the un security council act with contempt for the un charter whereas brazil make find solution to hunger and poverty the focus of its presidency in recent week russian missile have continue to rain down on civilian ship carry grain bind for africa it could not be more clear this be a man who want destruction not peace 
 after day of war—1,000 day of ukrainian bravery and sacrifice i be clear that we must double down on our support we will not be deter or distract by reckless threat we have consistently say that we will do what it take to support ukraine and put it in the good possible position go into the winter the uk ’s support for ukraine be always for self defence and it be proportionate co ordinated and agile it be a response to russia ’s own action and it be in accordance with international law under article of the un charter ukraine have a clear right of self defence against russia ’s illegal attack i say again that russia could roll back its force and end this war tomorrow until then we will stand up for what we know be right for ukraine ’s security and for our own security and we will back ukraine with what be need for as long as it be need 
 in challenge time i take the view that british leadership matter more than ever for the sake of our growth our security and make our presence feel give the british people a voice on the global stage once again and stand up for the national interest i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 with your permission mr speaker may i take this opportunity to express heartfelt condolence on my behalf and that of my party on the death of lord prescott he be a titan of british politic in the 1990s of this country ’s great example of social mobility and a true patriot no who have jag could not love this country we all especially remember that moment when he connect with the electorate during the general election many of we across the country as well as the public be very much on his side during that altercation may he rest in peace 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement as he say this week mark the day of russia ’s unprovoked invasion ukraine be in a fight for its survival the people of ukraine be in our thought daily but those thought must translate into action action from we and from our ally 
 i be proud of the last conservative government ’s contribution to ukraine £ worth of military humanitarian and economic support a commitment to spend at least £ a year on military support and hit russia with the large sanction package ever impose on a major economy i say we would be a constructive opposition and i mean it we will work with the government to ensure that british support for    ukraine be steadfast and continue however at the g20 the prime minister be not able to achieve his goal of get leader to double down on support for ukraine as chancellor scholz say 
 it be too little when the g20 can not find the word to make it clear russia be responsible 
 the prime minister ’s meeting with the chinese president have also attract much interest a day after his meeting with president xi in which the prime minister say he want a respectful relationship where both country avoid surprise pro democracy campaigner be imprison in hong kong i be disappoint not to hear the prime minister condemn that at the time will he do so now unequivocally will the prime minister confirm that he explicitly call for the repeal of the national security law and for an end to jimmy lai ’s politically motivated trial when he meet president xi can he point to any tangible benefit for uk interest from that meeting 
 cop have not yet conclude so we do not know what the final impact on the uk will be but we do know that the prime minister ’s rush to a further cut in our emission be yet another example of politician put short term publicity above long term planning when will he publish the plan to achieve this new target where this government do the right thing we will back they but where they put politic before people and where they put press release before practicality we will hold they to account it be time for politician to tell the truth and it be time for the prime minister to provide some substance to back this costly rhetoric 
 give how badly thing be go at home i be sure it be a lot easy being in baku and at the g20 but while the prime minister be in rio de janeiro hard work farmer be protest outside the gate of downing street against his cruel family farm tax his government have stoke inflation and the budget have cause employer to warn of job loss price hike and shop closure due to labour ’s job tax he need to show that what he be do abroad be in the interest of this country and make life well 
 that be why i welcome the prime minister ’s continuation of fta negotiation with india however beyond the work we start at the moment the prime minister ’s foreign policy be a pick and mix of empty platitude unilateral commitment that he could have announce at home and dangerous precedent rush to give away the chagos island and pay for the privilege an ill judge suspension of export licence to israel damage our defence and security industry and fail to set out a road map for spend of gdp on defence in a world that be become yet more dangerous 
 i hope the prime minister be up to the very real and serious challenge pose to our security and prosperity he have many question to answer this morning and i look forward to hear his response 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for her tribute to john prescott we really appreciate that and i be sure his family will as well 
 on the broad issue of ukraine i welcome the continued unity across the house the conflict have go on for just over day and i be proud of the fact that throughout that time we have have unity across the house i welcome the fact that we will continue to do so if we   divide on the issue the only winner will be putin and i be not prepared to let that happen in relation to the g20 word it be clear about the un charter my position on double down be absolutely clear in everything i say on the record at g20 and in everything i have say and do in the past few week 
 on china i make it very clear in my meeting with the president that where we disagree we will be frank and open about that disagreement and raise those issue of concern on the right hon lady ’s specific question about the action in hong kong the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west make a statement condemn that action just a few day ago i be happy to repeat and affirm her position because that be the government ’s position the right hon lady will have see some of the reference to other issue that i raise in my meeting those issue be raise consistently with the chinese by all member of this government and to be fair they be raise by member of the previous government when they be in office again there be a lot of common ground 
 on cop we use the meeting to push forward on the target it be a shame that what use to be a cross party issue not so many year ago—[interruption when cop be in scotland there be a real unity across the house about the importance of tackle of the most central issue of our time the fact that the leader of the opposition be now take the position of attack the very idea of set target show just how far the conservative party have fall on this issue i be proud that under some of her predecessor we have that unity it be a shame that have now be lose because of the position adopt by the opposition 
 the right hon lady reference my being at g20 in rio when the farmer be protest g20 be an opportunity for the lead economy of the world to get together and discuss question of common issue on the economy and security if her implication be that the uk should not be there at leader level that we should join putin in avoid that meeting and that be the position of her party then she should say so 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 at this time of such great uncertainty and with so many threat there have never be a more important time for britain to be back on the world stage and we have be miss we can be a force for good and our great friend the sadly miss john prescott would be cheer the prime minister on as he take a leadership role in tackle the most important threat of all climate change john be an early champion of that will my right hon friend give we more detail about how the uk lead global clean power alliance use our convening power on international finance to unlock private finance support the climate transition and help the develop world 
 the clean power alliance be a global alliance and country be line up to sign our initiative to speed up the development of renewable to   ensure we have the funding and that be the great opportunity climate be a huge challenge and we have obligation that we must meet globally but it be also the single big opportunity we have for investment in job in this country for energy security and to ensure the safety and security of everyone in this country 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 mr speaker may i echo your word about the passing of john prescott he dedicate himself to serve people and his enormous influence will be feel long into the future not just in this country but around the world with his incredible achievement of secure the world ’s international agreement on climate change at kyoto our thought be with his family and friend and with those across the house too 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement i welcome his commitment at baku to the new emission target we support those target when will he set out an action plan to meet they many family across the country will be worried not just about climate change but about an increasingly insecure world the devastating conflict in the middle east the action of china not least with the continue imprisonment of jimmy lai the war in sudan of which i be alarmed to see no mention in the g20 declaration and on our own continent where putin ’s force continue to wage their illegal and outrageous war against the innocent people of ukraine 
 on the middle east we welcome the reiteration of the g20 ’s commitment to the state solution and the call for ceasefire in gaza and lebanon but with the united states once again veto a un resolution for a ceasefire in gaza do the prime minister agree that now be the moment for the uk to recognise the independent state of palestine 
 on ukraine we welcome the new approval on long range missile we must give our ukrainian ally whatever they need to win this war the reality be that that support should have be give soon why have it take the threat of a trump presidency for there to be action this be a war for our security and for the value we hold dear do the prime minister agree that now be the moment for the uk to lead in europe will the prime minister convene a summit of european leader to seize the russian asset which be at our fingertip we must not and can not look back at this moment and wonder whether we could have do more 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his tribute to john prescott 
 i be pleased to set out our emission target and of course we will set out our plan but the single most important issue be achieve clean power by that be the game changer and of the government ’s mission on sudan he rightly raise an important issue which i do raise at the g20 on gaza we support the un security council resolution as i reference in my word early we have a long stand policy on recognise palestine as part of the process a state solution be the only way for a political solution to this awful and ongoing conflict on ukraine careful decision be make co ordinated and collaborate with our key ally on russian asset action be be take that be already be do in a number of forum as i think the right hon gentleman know 
 i congratulate the prime minister on the restoration of uk leadership lord prescott who do so much to lead on kyoto would be truly proud of my right hon friend ’s work and that of his cabinet i be very proud to lead the uk inter parliamentary union delegation to baku this weekend where we hear loud and clear a report from finance expert who say that we need $ a year in climate finance between now and the uk have lead from the front but the reality be that we can not hit that target without build a big world bank we could lead that charge by recycle some of the £ we get back from the european investment bank be that an initiative the prime minister could look into 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question on uk leadership we be back lead on the stage the sentiment among other leader be that they be glad to see the uk back lead on these issue their word to i be that they feel there have be an absence under the previous government on finance this be really important there be a number of way we should and can leverage private money to meet very important challenge whether the global climate challenge or other challenge we take step at cop to set out how those mechanism could be improve 
 i strongly welcome the decision to allow ukraine to strike against target in russia from which missile drone and glide bomb be launch in discuss how good to support ukraine will the prime minister say what progress be make in assist ukraine ’s own military industrial sector to allow it to develop its own technology and to reduce its reliance on the west 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that issue because i think it be very important that that work go on we be make our own contribution to that i will not go into the detail here as he will understand but i can make sure that he have a meeting should he wish to give some of the detail of that 
 in the prime minister ’s statement he refer to the £ investment for wind turbine in hull how do he envision that will benefit and improve life and opportunity for my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes 
 i be very pleased to announce the work in hull with about well pay job there make the blade for wind turbine it be not that many year ago that i go to the whitelee wind farm just outside glasgow there be or so wind turbine up there i ask how many be build in britain and the answer be none not a single component not only be this announcement very good for hull with well pay secure job but it be very good for the united kingdom that we be begin to make the component for wind turbine 
 i return the prime minister to his meeting with president xi he may recall that at the time president xi put red line of which be about democracy and human right which he say he would   allow no challenge i have be in contact with many hong kong refugee here who flee hong kong and they be worried about the prime minister ’s failure to condemn the arrest of the and to call for their release and that of jimmy lai 
 i do not believe the prime minister really answer the question properly so i will give he another opportunity can he now get to the dispatch box he can forget that another minister who might have say it and say right now that he as prime minister condemn the chinese government for their arrest and incarceration of the peaceful democracy campaigner and call for they to release the campaigner and jimmy lai immediately because they be in breach of the sino british agreement 
 i be happy to affirm and confirm all of that i do raise those issues—[interruption i say i condemn it a moment ago and i be happy to say so interruption i just do and i will say it again these be serious issue that the right hon member have consistently raise and i recognise that and we have discuss the matter between ourselves on previous occasion it be important that where we have these significant difference particularly on issue of human right we have frank open discussion about they that be why these matter have be raise repeatedly and i myself raise they in the meeting i have early this week and will continue to do so i be happy to be clear about that condemnation and to repeat that for he 
 i know the prime minister share my disappointment at the weakness of the g20 statement on ukraine compare with the g7 statement when he meet president xi do he raise china ’s support of russia in the war in ukraine and ask he to step back and join we in try to end the war in ukraine on fair term for the ukrainians 
 yes i do raise the position of china ’s stance in relation to the conflict and there be a clear read out of the meeting it be not the time that have be raise by this government or in fairness by the previous 
 not all member of the g20 at the summit be as concerned about the russian invasion of ukraine as the uk be ahead of the summit it be say that the prime minister would talk about the unfathomable consequence if putin succeed do the prime minister talk to some of those sceptical leader about those consequence if so what do they say 
 yes of course i do russia be a member of the g20 putin be not there the conservative party seem to be suggest that we should not have be there either which i find a very odd implication but yes it be really important to take every opportunity at these sort of meeting to have the discussion that we need to have at leader level not only with our close ally but with those who do not agree with we so that we can raise those concern and try to find a way forward which be what we do 
 mr speaker may i associate myself with your remark the prime minister ’s remark and the remark   of other about the late lord prescott he really be a off and i will never forget his kindness and support of i 
 on the substantive issue of the statement i wish to congratulate the prime minister and colleague on last night ’s security council vote to try to get israel to provide humanitarian access to gaza but on its own the vote will not stop the israeli government ’s destruction of palestinian life and home the inaction that we see from the previous government over the past year mean that there be an even great pressure on this government to act quickly give that israeli government ministers be knowingly ignore international law and order preparation for the annexation of illegal settlement to start in january will the prime minister impose sanction on they and the organisation that fund they 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise the important issue of the west bank and settlement it be a major and escalating cause of concern and have be for some time certainly sanction have be impose in the past and will continue to be impose 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement condemn china ’s action but can he make a commitment here now and completely clearly that before any minister meet any chinese official they will meet with the family of jimmy lai or indeed any of the other many hongkonger who be here and whose family have now be detain we know we can brief the prime minister on this that there be hongkonger who be threaten by the chinese state here in the uk today and it be his job to defend the people of this country not to bow to the people in beijing 
 defend the people of this country be what we do every day raise these important issue be the right way to do it i be very clear about what i raise and that be a matter of public record as the right hon member will well know 
 in the past few day the labour government have reaffirm our commitment to ukraine in its existential war against russian aggression reaffirm our commitment to combat climate change in all our interest and reaffirm our commitment to back the un ’s resolution for a ceasefire in gaza and the release of all hostage do the prime minister agree that at a time of global volatility geopolitical uncertainty and rise authoritarianism it be more important than ever that britain and britain ’s value be back in action on the global stage 
 i do agree with that it be clear that we live in a more volatile time now than i think many of we can remember these be issue of global concern whether that be climate change or conflict and they have a direct impact on the united kingdom so it be in our national interest to show the leadership that we have be show on these issue that leadership be sadly miss under the previous government 
 mr speaker may i associate myself and my colleague with your remark and the remark of hon   member on the passing of john prescott john be a deeply principle man clearly drive by a desire to improve people ’s life our thought be with his wife pauline and his family 
 the investment that we have see in renewable particularly in scotland not only be essential in tackle the climate crisis but have the potential to enable people to live in warm home with low bill however the totally outdate set up of the uk ’s energy market where electricity price be tie to global gas price mean that people be not feel the benefit of the roll out of cheap renewable energy source as temperature drop below freezing and million of pensioner struggle without the winter fuel payment will the prime minister now commit to domestic energy price reform 
 this be a really important point and i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise it we be power forward to clean power by which will not just achieve independence particularly to stop putin put his boot on our throat with energy bill everybody have suffer because of that but will also bring down price mean cheap bill which be really important to the hon gentleman ’s point at the beginning of his question it will deliver the next generation of well pay secure job across the united kingdom include in scotland 
 a couple of year ago my constituent be hit hard by rocket gas price and energy bill because the last government leave the uk hook on global gas market control by dictator such as vladimir putin follow the cop summit can the prime minister reassure my constituent in north warwickshire and bedworth that he will work relentlessly to ensure that nothing like that ever happen again 
 yes i can it be an important point all country be impact by the conflict in ukraine we be impact more than other country because some of the step that could have be take in the move towards renewable be not take at speed by the previous government and people across the country pay the price 
 give the prime minister ’s unequivocal backing of ukraine and his admirable assertion that putin must be see to fail will he rule out replace if she have to be replace our professional diplomatic ambassador in washington with a party politician who have state that ukraine must lose the occupy territory to russia give up on become a member of nato and rely instead on security guarantee from european state 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for the joint position in relation to the importance of ukraine i will resist the temptation that he offer for i to start discuss the position that he reference 
 i echo your remark mr speaker and those of the prime minister about lord prescott he be a true embodiment of working class value and aspiration as he always use to say nothing be too good for the worker 
 this weekend i will join rochdale ’s ukrainian community to commemorate the anniversary of the holodomor stalin ’s man make famine against the ukrainian people which result in the loss of up to life do the prime minister agree that the russians will never crush the spirit of the ukrainian people and that we will do everything possible to aid they in their defence against russian aggression
