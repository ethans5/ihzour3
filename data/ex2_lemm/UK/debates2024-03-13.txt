the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on support rural area in wales with the cost of living 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in wales 
 the uk government fully recognise the challenge pose by cost of living pressure as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and the war in ukraine which be why we have provide £ since to support household and individual across the united kingdom an average of about £ per household 
 i call   the member for slough mr dhesi 
 diolch mr speaker just as the cost of living crisis here demand urgent action for my constituent in slough the cost of live crisis in wales demand it for the good people of wales especially as household face be £ bad off under this government ’s tax plan shockingly a which survey have find that in working age parent in wales be skip meal owe to high food price what recent conversation have the secretary of state have with supermarket about keep the cost of food down 
 i hope the hon gentleman will recognise and welcome the fact that as a result of the policy be pursue by this government inflation have fall from more than to about i hope he will also agree that worker throughout wales will be very pleased with the cut in national insurance contribution which mean that on average they will be £ well off if he be really concerned about the plight of work parent in wales i hope he will ask his colleague in the welsh labour government to roll out the childcare initiative that be be roll out in england but not by they in wales 
 a number of my constituent have be adversely affect by their transfer from work tax credit to universal credit because they work in sector such as agriculture and tourism and their income be therefore seasonal the switch from an annual to a monthly assessment of their entitlement mean that many be lose out but the government have say that there will be no impact assessment to determine the financial effect of the move will the secretary of state intervene in support of such an assessment so that worker with seasonal income can be treat fairly 
 the hon gentleman be a champion of constituent in rural area such as his and i be happy to look at any information that he want to give but i hope that he will recognise that the increase in the living wage will have help his constituent even those who work seasonally that be alongside the extra payment that the government have make to household in which people be live on benefit or have disability 
 be the secretary of state aware of a report publish this morning by the trussell trust it state that of the people receive universal credit in wales run out of food last month and could not afford more nearly have need to use a food bank in the last month and in have fall into debt because they could not keep up with their bill whatever the uk government be do about this it be clearly nowhere near enough what be the secretary of state go to do about it 
 the focus of this uk government be on ensure that people can work and do not have to live on benefit but we recognise that there be those in need that be why pension benefit and the living wage have all rise in line with inflation and why we have ensure that additional payment be make to pensioner those live on benefit and household where there have be disability the fact be that people on low wage will not be help by the plan of the hon gentleman ’s government in scotland and indeed the labour opposition to shut down the oil and gas industry which would throw people out of work 
 do my right hon friend agree that the welsh government ’s sustainable farming scheme if implement would have the most serious possible impact not only on welsh farming business but on the cost of live in the rural area that depend on they do he far agree that for those community the scheme be the very opposite of sustainable 
 my right hon friend be entirely correct the welsh labour government ’s sustainable farming scheme involve take of prime welsh agricultural land out of commission in order to pursue a whole load of nebulous scheme it will increase food mile and will reduce our ability to feed ourselves 
 of the good way we can support people with the cost of live across wales be by support business do the minister agree that the welsh labour government prop up by plaid cymru should do more to support hard work farmer on anglesey such as richard jones and his family dairy maelog jerseys in llanfaelog 
 i completely agree with my hon friend the welsh government should abandon their so call sustainable farming scheme which will remove of prime welsh agricultural land and prevent farmer from grow food or graze crop on it they need to do something about tuberculosis which be run rampant in wales unlike in england and they need to look at the nitrate vulnerable zone across the whole of wales which will also impact farmer such as her constituent 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the impact of the conservatives cost of living crisis on people in north wales have be exacerbate by their dither and delay on new nuclear at wylfa the previous project which ministers abandon in could have be complete by now and would have create up to job some permanent job would also be well on the way add a total of almost £ a year to the local economy in wage what do the secretary of state say to people across north wales who be still look for good job because of his government ’s failure 
 the last labour government certainly do not build any nuclear power station the uk conservative government be get on with hinkley and we be sort out small modular reactor there be a process go on in which company with an smr model will be reduce to and will be select by the end of the year we have provide £ to buy the wylfa site that will ensure that there be a nuclear industry in wales a result of the policy of this conservative government 
 it be a stark admission of the government ’s failure that the secretary of state boast after year in government and do absolutely nothing for year of acquire a site at wylfa his government ’s inaction have cost people money and still do in year all but of our current reactor will be offline which will weaken our energy mix risk high price and again leave we vulnerable to energy tyrant such as putin will the secretary of state make an explicit commitment today to back new nuclear in place such as wylfa as labour have do in order to unlock job investment and cheap bill issue that his party have ignore for so long or be this another never end tory fiasco like high speed 
 the last labour government be not in the least bit supportive of nuclear what this conservative government have do for energy be increase to the amount of electricity that come from renewable we be the advanced economy to halve our carbon dioxide emission and we be push forward with float offshore wind and smr all we get for business from the welsh labour government be a block on new road be build mph speed limit and legislation to charge people for drive to work 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the spring budget on business in wales 
 the uk government be back our small business by raise the vat threshold deliver tax relief for the creative industry and investing in high growth industry such as advanced manufacturing that be in stark contrast to the welsh labour government ’s anti business agenda wales have some of the high business rate in the whole united kingdom it be interesting that   the hon member for cardiff central jo stevens   think that have the high business rate in the united kingdom be funny 
 sadly pub and restaurant be close at a fast rate in wales than in any other part of the uk the measure in the budget that the secretary of state mention will bring some relief but do he agree that what be push many of these business to the wall right now be welsh labour ’s slashing of business rate support 
 my right hon friend be absolutely correct the uk government have make sure that pub and other small hospitality business receive a discount on their business rate in wales that policy have be absolutely slash mean that pub and small business pay thousand of pound more under the welsh labour government that be an absolute disgrace 
 may i return the secretary of state to the issue of the rhondda tunnel the chancellor of the exchequer dole out bit and piece of money to the constituency of various member of parliament on the tory at risk register but he do not allocate any money to the rhondda tunnel despite the secretary of state have tell i personally in the chamber that we should apply for money from the levelling up fund that be all go have n’t it so where should we now apply for money for the rhondda tunnel 
 there have be round of level up funding the hon gentleman should know that there be growth deal across the length and breadth of wales cover every single constituency that there be special project be back in area such as newport and that there be an investment zone and a freeport in port talbot constituency the length and breadth of wales have benefit from the many project that this government have put forward i appreciate his concern for that project in his constituency and i suggest that he might look at share prosperity fund money in future 
 my right hon friend be well aware that the chancellor have extend business rate relief at the rate of here in england but of course the welsh government be refuse to pass that money on to small business in barry and cowbridge in my constituency do he not think it completely unfair that a business in bristol or cornwall will pay a lot less in business rate than a business in barry or cowbridge 
 my right hon friend be absolutely correct it be extraordinary that the welsh labour government who be receive this funding in order to support small business in wales be fail to pass it on as a result the average pub in wales will pay more than £ more in business rate than a pub in england the welsh labour government must do more to support small business in wales 
 the secretary of state will know that much of our monetary policy which have an effect on interest rate for welsh business and welsh household be decide in threadneedle street have he meet the governor of the bank of england recently if not will he invite he to wales to see the impact of his policy on the welsh economy will he hold a meeting with other welsh mps and may i humbly suggest that it be in blackwood newbridge or risca in my constituency 
 the hon gentleman will surely be aware that the bank of england set interest rate independently as a result of a policy bring in by the former labour government it have be widely accept that it be right that the bank should set interest rate with a view to not what politician ask it to do but what the economy demand as a result of the policy be pursue by this uk government in conjunction with the bank of england inflation have drop drastically from over to and i would like to think that interest rate will soon follow 
 i call shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker this 
 budget will do nothing to deliver a well future for retailer and their customer 
 those be the word of the british retail consortium whose member face incident of theft and incident of violence and abuse every day to help keep our welsh high street safe we labour member want to fund an extra police officer and police community support officer and extra measure to deal with offender why be the government fail to tackle the epidemic of shoplifting and its victim and to take it seriously 
 the hon lady be right to raise this important issue for retailer but i remind she that the uk government have provide for an extra police officer across the whole united kingdom we have repeatedly bring forward legislation to increase prison sentence and punishment for offender but that legislation have often be vote against by member of her political party 
 this government pledge £ to electrify the north wales main line we all know that that £ be an uncosted number pull out of the air we also now know that phase go no far than llandudno how can the secretary of state explain that to the people live in ynys môn and gwynedd talk of rail electrification just mean more of the same for we slow train cancel service and empty election promise 
 the uk government have already show a commitment to transport in wales spend £ on improve rail infrastructure over the last control period in addition to that there have be the south wales metro which be part of a uk government welsh government joint fund growth deal the prime minister be very clear about our commitment to the electrification of the north wales rail line and that commitment stand 
 the tory leader in the senedd oppose move to tackle the effect of excessive number of holiday home in our community he go on about 
 anti tourism and anti english policy be impose on the welsh tourism industry 
 now that the tory westminster government be abolish tax break for holiday let would the secretary of state claim that his chancellor be anti tourism 
 i would not my friend in the senedd have speak out repeatedly about the welsh labour government ’s plan for an overnight tourism tax which will have a detrimental impact on tourism business across wales the hon lady ’s party be in partnership with the welsh labour government and if she really want to support the welsh tourism industry i suggest she tell it that her member will vote   against welsh labour ’s budget to prevent that tax from come in 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net and the welsh government on electricity transmission and distribution policy 
 the government be commit to transform our electricity network to reach our energy security and net ambition we recently announce an ambitious electricity network package that will reduce consumer bill bring forward £ of investment over the next year and allow we to harness wales ’s renewable resource such as float offshore wind in the celtic sea 
 pylon development for   electricity transmission and distribution purpose be very controversial in the community that be expect to host they i have such potential development in my constituency and the whole of carmarthenshire be in uproar will the right hon gentleman ask the secretary of state for energy security and net to commission a study on technology such as cable ploughing which allow undergrounding and have a comparable cost to pylon 
 i understand the concern that have be raise in the hon gentleman ’s constituency he have discuss this with i previously and be champion his constituent concern the information that i have be give be that lay cable underground would cost to time more but i hear what he be say if he have a presentation or something that he can forward to i i would be delighted to make sure that official in the department for energy security and net see it 
 on the subject of transmission and distribution policy be my right hon friend aware that the senedd have decide to ban gb news what be his policy on that 
 there may be a small electricity saving but it be very disappointing that the welsh labour government be prevent a perfectly legitimate viewpoint from be hear by member of the senedd who would do well to listen to people who do not always agree with everything they say 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the adequacy of healthcare service in wales 
 as my hon friend know healthcare be devolve to the welsh government who have receive record funding to deliver on their devolved responsibility they receive more funding per person than be receive for comparable service in england despite that extra money more than patient in wales have be wait more than year for treatment the number of people wait more than year for treatment in england which have roughly time the population be around 
 last month few than half of red call be answer by the ambulance service in labour ’s wales within the necessary minute that be the leader of the opposition ’s blueprint for government do my right hon friend agree that instead of campaign for more politician in wales labour should focus on deliver the health service that the people of wales thoroughly deserve 
 i completely agree with my hon friend i have to make a call for an ambulance for my father in law at o’clock morning and it arrive at o’clock the follow morning my father in law then have to wait for another hour in the back of an ambulance outside an accident and emergency unit the welsh labour government have build industrial fan in the ambulance bay to waft away the diesel fume that be totally unacceptable they be cut the nhs budget in wales by around £ yet they can find £ extra for more politician in cardiff bay 
 the under secretary of state for health and social care   the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom have announce an extra £ of spending for dentistry i have repeatedly ask she whether that be in the english budget or additional in which case it would produce a barnett consequential but all she could say repeatedly be that it be additional can the secretary of state for wales tell i whether the extra £ for dentistry in england will produce about £ extra for wales or will it produce nothing at all perhaps he do not know either 
 as a result of the budget around £ extra will go to wales the hon gentleman know that wales receive around extra to deliver healthcare and it be therefore absolutely appalling that the welsh labour government be unable to deliver the same service that be supply in england it be interesting labour claim to be the party of the national health   service but where be labour member they be not stand to ask a supplementary to this question because they be ashamed of the healthcare that they have deliver in wales let this not become a blueprint for the rest of the united kingdom 
 a year old constituent of mine spend hour in the back of an ambulance outside the wrexham maelor hospital wait to be see betsi cadwaladr university health board which serve north wales be responsible for of the preventable death in wales do the minister agree that the welsh labour government who run the nhs there be put life at risk 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise concern about the level of healthcare be provide to her constituent shockingly when the independent commissioner at the betsi cadwaladr university health board raise serious concern about more than £ be misspent the welsh labour health minister call they in and sack they no wonder we be not get the right level of healthcare in wales 
 the secretary of state and other tory mp bring up a litany of health issue in wales but barnett consequential be a result of health spending and need in england have the uk government ever make any spending decision on need in wales such as in health and then fund england scotland and northern ireland as a consequence of welsh need he might find that a strange question because uk decision be always make on the basis of england ’s need and other people get money as a consequence which be why wales be never go to catch ireland for as long as wales be in the uk and not independent be that not so 
 the holtham review look at what welsh need be and calculate that wales need an extra the uk conservative government then provide wales with an extra the question still stand why have thousand of people in wales be wait for more than year for treatment give that the welsh labour government have be give more money than they need to properly fund the health service in wales 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the independent commission ’s final report on the constitutional future of wales 
 the not very independent commission be set up by welsh labour ministers and report to they but it be pay for by welsh taxpayer its report be entirely in line with all the prediction i make it contain more constitutional navel gaze and more call for more power and nothing at all to address the problem that have be inflict on wales by the welsh labour government 
 it be deeply concern that a so call independent commission describe welsh independence as viable despite the fact that the vast majority of people in wales support remain part of the union of course there be a difference between something that might be viable and something that be good do my right hon friend agree that independence for wales would be hugely damaging to the welsh economy and public service and that any further exploration of this idea must be immediately rule out by the labour welsh government 
 i completely agree with my hon friend it be hugely concern that the welsh labour government be even willing to consider independence for wales with this commission they should be sort out the long nhs waiting list in the uk and do something about the fact that we have the low educational standard and some of the high business rate in the uk as a result of the last bit of legislation we also have some of the slow speed limit in the uk it be time the welsh labour government address the real priority of the people in wales with the power they already have 
 be the reality not that the conservative party never want devolution in wales or scotland in the place which be why it do not want to see power extend to either the senedd or the scottish parliament 
 i campaign against the senedd in the place but i be perfectly happy to accept the result of the referendum i suggest that scottish national party members ought similarly to respect the result of independence referendum be they about independence from the uk or independence from the european union 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on support for farmer in wales 
 the recent protest by farmer across the whole of wales include outside the senedd show the huge anger there be about the proposal for the welsh labour government ’s so call sustainable farming scheme 
 of the good way we can support welsh farmer be by choose to buy british product that be good for the environment as it reduce food mile and for our food security as we support our farmer will the secretary of state congratulate morrisons aldi sainsbury ’s and now ocado which have all sign up to my campaign to have a buy british button online so that consumer can easily find british produce 
 i completely agree with my hon friend about buy british although i might go step far and suggest we buy welsh food wherever possible that will be a lot more difficult if labour implement its plan to bury of welsh agricultural land under tree and to bury another under pond that will increase food mile decrease food security and destroy prime agricultural land in wales the welsh labour government need to think again 
 the good way to support farmer in wales northern ireland scotland and england be to buy british do the minister agree that we should all work together across all this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to promote farming everywhere 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right let we encourage everyone to buy british and ensure we use as much of our land as possible for grow food not cover it in tree it be particularly hypocritical for the welsh government to tell farmer they have to plant tree on their land when the welsh labour government be responsible for thousand of acre of forest they be chop down tonne of tree every year and even put some of they into the boiler that heat up the senedd not that many tree be probably require to add to the hot air in there 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march 
 the post office it scandal be of the great miscarriage in our nation ’s history i be determined that the victim get the justice and redress they deserve today we be introduce legislation to quash conviction result from this scandal the department for business and trade will be responsible for the new redress scheme and we be widen access to the optional £ payment hundred of innocent sub postmaster have fight long and hard for justice with this bill we will deliver it 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 despite serious opposition from the archbishop of canterbury former home secretaries and government adviser on antisemitism social cohesion and political violence the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities be due to widen the definition of extremism tomorrow while member on the government benches peddle far right conspiracy theory about islamists and muslims take over britain should the prime minister ’s priority not be to get his own house in order and to stamp out extremism racism and islamophobia in the conservative party will the prime minister finally take islamophobia seriously and agree to the definition 
 discrimination have no place in our society it be important to distinguish between strongly feel political debate on hand and unacceptable act of abuse intimidation and violence on the other i urge the hon gentleman to wait for the detail of the strategy it be a sensitive matter but it be we must tackle because there have be rise in extremist who be try to hijack our democracy that must be confront he talk about peddle conspiracy theory i would just point he in the direction of the previous labour candidate in rochdale 
 armed force personnel who serve their country for year be eligible for the medal for long service and good conduct similar medal be in place for those who make a career serve in the police the fire service the ambulance service and the coastguard as i learn on a recent visit to royal bournemouth hospital where i meet the dedicated staff no such accolade be in place for the nhs will the prime minister support my campaign to see whether that anomaly can be correct so the nation can formally recognise those who devote much of their work life in the nhs to help other 
 my right hon friend be right that our incredible nhs staff deserve our utmost thank for their service i be pleased that many nhs organisation as he know have their own scheme in place to do that we also recognise outstanding nhs staff through our honours system and mp be able to acknowledge their work through the nhs parliamentary award nomination remain open and i encourage colleague to avail themselves of that scheme i will make sure that my right hon friend get to meet the secretary of state for health and social care to discuss his specific proposal far 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i welcome the legislation on the post office scandal 
 mr speaker this week we lose the formidable tommy mcavoy who serve his hometown of rutherglen and the labour government with loyalty and good humour we send our deep sympathy to his wife eleanor and their family 
 we also learn that   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may   will be take she well deserve retirement she have serve this house and her constituent with a real sense of duty and her unwavering commitment to end modern slavery be commend by all of we we thank she for her service 
 be the prime minister proud to be bankroll by someone use racist and misogynous language when he say that   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott 
 make you want to hate all black woman 
 the allege comment be wrong they be racist and he have now—[interruption as i say the comment be wrong and they be racist he have rightly apologise for they and that remorse should be accept there be no place for racism in britain and the government that i lead be live proof of that 
 mr speaker the man bankroll the prime minister also say that the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington should be shoot how low would he have to sink what racist woman hat threat of violence would he have to make before the prime minister pluck up the courage to hand back the £ that he have take from he 
 as i say the gentleman apologise genuinely for his comment and that remorse should be accept the right hon and learn gentleman talk   about language he might want to reflect on the double standard of his deputy leader call her opponent scum the shadow foreign secretary compare conservative to nazis and the man whom he want to make chancellor talk about lynch a female minister his silence on that speak volume 
 the difference be that the prime minister be scared of his party i have change my party—[interruption 
 order i want to hear both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition 
 week ago the prime minister invite himself into everyone ’s living room at o’clock on a friday evening no ask he to give that speech he choose to do it he choose to anoint himself as the great healer and pose as some kind of unifier but when the man bankroll his election say that the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington should be shoot he suddenly find himself tongue tie shrink in sophistry hop he can deflect for long enough that we will all go away what do the prime minister think it be about the hundred of million of pound of nhs contract give to frank hester by his government that attract he to give £ to the tory party in the place 
 mr speaker i be absolutely not go to take any lecture from somebody who choose to represent the antisemitic terrorist group hizb ut tahrir who choose to serve a leader of the opposition who let antisemitism run rife in this labour party those be his action those be his value and that be how he should be judge 
 the problem be that the prime minister be describe a labour party that no long exist i be describe a man who be bankroll the conservative upcoming general election interruption they can shout all they like week ago the prime minister march they out like fool to defend islamophobia and now   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson   be warm up the opposition benches for they yesterday the prime minister send they out to play down racism and misogyny until he be force to change course he will not hand the money back he will not comment on how convenient it be that a man hand huge nhs contract by his government be now his party ’s big donor you have to wonder what the point be of a prime minister who can not lead and a party that can not govern 
 mr speaker national insurance contribution fund state pension and the nhs so be the prime minister ’s late unfunded £ promise to scrap national insurance go to be pay for by cut to state pension or cut to the nhs 
 i be glad that the right hon and learn gentleman have bring up the budget it be about time that he speak about his plan because what have we hear from the shadow chief secretary to the treasury—[interruption 
 order i call the prime minister 
 the shadow chief secretary to the treasury have confirm that the labour party will not be stick to the conservative government ’s spending plan so we now have a litany of unfunded promise on the nhs mental health dentistry and breakfast club that do not even include the £ eco pledge that the right hon and learn gentleman be still commit to we all know that while we be cut taxis labour ’s unfunded promise mean high taxis for work britons 
 no the labour party will not be stick to the prime minister ’s completely unfunded £ promise he think that he can trick people into believe that simply shake the tory magic money tree will bring it into existence let we be clear of national insurance be spend on social security and pension be spend on the nhs he be either cut pension or the nhs or he will have to raise other taxis or borrowing which be it prime minister 
 i know that it be not the right hon and learn gentleman ’s strong point but if he actually listen to the chancellor last week he would have hear that nhs spending be go up it be a plan that be back by the nhs chief executive officer who say that we be give she what she need at the same time we be responsibly cut taxis for million of people in work with the average worker benefit from a £ tax cut what i be hear from the right hon and learn gentleman be that he be against our plan to cut national insurance 
 we have the high tax burden since the world war i do listen to the chancellor £ of unfunded commitment the conservatives try that under the last administration and everybody else be pay the price 
 week ago the prime minister promise to crack down on those spread hate today he have shrink at the challenge last week he promise fantasy tax cut now he be pretend that it can all be pay for with no impact on pension or the nhs all we need now be an especially hardy lettuce and it could be all over again be it any wonder that he be too scared to call an election when the public can see that the only way to protect their country their pension and their nhs from the madness of this tory party be by vote labour 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about pension pension be go up by around £ this year it be this government who have protect the triple lock for the last year he talk about support work people it be this government who be cut taxis for every single person in work it be this government who be invest in the nhs all we have from he be a £ unfunded promise i have a look at make britain a clean energy superpower it be all there he be still stuck to it mr speaker and if you look through it carefully there be billion in spending that he have already commit to for scotland and billion for wales there be actually money for north london too i notice the problem be that none of it be fund so why do he not come clean and tell we that under his plan the british people ’s taxis be go up 
 million of people around the uk and europe have be inspire by the brilliance of nations rugby premier league club like gloucester rugby which be fund during the pandemic through loan authorise by the prime minister the then chancellor have always be grateful for be keep solvent but he will know that some club finance be fragile and that the current loan repayment scheme could be crippling will he ask the sports minister my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew and the treasury to try to find a solution so that taxpayer interest be protect and all of we can go on be inspire by top class rugby for year to come 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we step in with a £ financial lifeline to ensure the survival of premiership rugby league club during the pandemic i be tell that the department for culture media and sport be work with sport england as the agent to talk to borrower with concern about their loan agreement any that have concern should contact sport england in the normal way i can also proudly tell he that we be talk to the rugby football union and the premiership league to secure the future not just of rugby union but of his local gloucester rugby 
 i call the leader of the snp 
 i begin by wish ramadan mubarak to muslims across these isle 
 the conservative party have accept a £ donation from an individual who have say that of our parliamentary colleague in this chamber should be shoot why be the prime minister of the united kingdom put money before moral 
 as i have say the comment be wrong the gentleman in question have apologise for they and that remorse should be accept 
 this be complete rubbish the gentleman in question apologise for be rude he be not rude he be racist odious and downright bloody dangerous on monday no say that we have 
 see an unacceptable rise in extremist activity which be seek to divide our society and hijack our democratic institution 
 be not the extremism that we should all be worried about the view of those tory donor we have read about this week 
 no there have actually be a rise in extremist activity that be seek to hijack our democratic institution it be important that we have the tool to tackle this threat that be what the extremism strategy will do i urge the hon gentleman to wait for the communities secretary to release the detail 
 sub post master across the country will welcome the government ’s announcement today on the introduction of legislation to overturn wrongful conviction will my right hon friend reassure the house that the legislation will be pass as quickly as possible and that we will support all sub- postmaster right across our united kingdom 
 i pay tribute to all postmaster who have campaign tirelessly for justice include those who tragically will not see the justice that they deserve today ’s legislation mark an important step in finally clear their name across the house we owe it to they to progress the legislation as soon as possible before the summer recess so that we can deliver the justice that they have fight for we continue to work with our counterpart in scotland and northern ireland as they develop their plan but regardless of where and how conviction be quash redress will be pay to the victim across the whole of our united kingdom on exactly the same basis 
 the future of child ’s cancer service in my constituency and across south west london surrey sussex and beyond will be decide by nhs england tomorrow the exist service be world lead and have save the life of countless child many of we who have engage with the consultation process feel that the wrong decision be about to be make ignore risk to child ’s cancer care by move they to the evelina london children ’s hospital if the evelina be choose tomorrow will the prime minister intervene personally to delay any final decision until he have meet i and concern mp from across the house so that he can prevent the risk to our child ’s cancer service 
 as the right hon gentleman know decision about clinical provision be rightly make by clinician in local area across the country more generally we be invest in more oncologist radiologist and community diagnostic centre which be contribute to cancer treatment be at record level but i will of course ensure that he and colleague get a meeting with the secretary of state 
 radical islamists pose a serious threat to our nation ’s security i agree with my right hon friend the prime minister that we must urgently address that but report that the government wish to broaden the definition of extremism be concern because in separate the definition of extremism from actual violence and harm we may criminalise people with a wide range of legitimate view and have a chilling effect on free speech will my right hon friend reassure i that instead of try to police people ’s thought and speech as opposition members clearly wish to do the government will target specific group that foster terrorism and those who fund they 
 my hon friend make a good point that be why the strategy which i urge she to wait for will be that she can support it be our duty to ensure that the government have the tool to tackle the threat that she rightly identify and highlight this be absolutely not about silence those with private and peaceful belief and nor will it impact free speech which we on this side of the house will always strive to protect 
 child deserve the right to breathe clean air but many school be in area with high level of air pollution sadiq khan the mayor of london have announce a pilot    for of london ’s most impact school to access air quality filter so that child can breathe clean air in their classroom do the prime minister support that pilot and will he implement similar measure across our country 
 i be pleased that the late publish figure show that air pollution have reduce significantly since partly due to our legally bind target to reduce concentration they will continue to reduce over the following year on top of that we have also provide almost £ to help local authority across the country to implement local plan to reduce nitrogen dioxide and to ensure that we can help those impact by those plan 
 i understand that the late scheme be consider be to pay migrant thousand of pound to leave britain let we just leave the european convention on human right and deport they for free so far more than brit have sign my petition with the conservative post call for we to leave the echr will the prime minister commit to leave the echr or at the very least have it in our manifesto to have a referendum and let britain decide 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we must do everything we can to secure our border and ensure that those who come here illegally do not have the ability to stay that be why our rwanda scheme and legislation be so important as i have say repeatedly and will happily say to she again i will not let a foreign court block our ability to send people to rwanda when the time come 
 the national theatre ’s production nye which star michael sheen celebrate at its end the transformational increase in life expectancy since the founding of the nhs however university college london finding indicate that austerity policy between and be responsible for a year setback in life expectancy progress do the prime minister or the leader of the opposition for that matter think that public service can withstand an extra £ of cut 
 i be pleased that the national theatre receive significant funding from the chancellor in the recent budget to support its fantastic work across the uk however i be surprised to hear the right hon lady raise the nhs when her party be prop up the welsh labour government who have absolutely the bad nhs performance of any part of the united kingdom 
 may i thank my right hon friend the prime minister for meet i week ago to discuss the plight of victim of covid-19 vaccine damage follow that discussion and his very sympathetic response during the gb news people ’s forum to mr john watt who be himself a victim of covid-19 vaccine damage will the government be support my covid-19 vaccine damage payments bill this friday 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the issue and for the conversation i have with he i extend my sympathy to all those who have be affect i will of course ensure that he can meet the secretary of state to discuss his bill we be as i commit to he look at the issue in some detail to ensure that our policy be provide the support that be need 
 the prime minister stand outside downing street and say that he want to root out hate and extremism yet shamefully it take he more than hour to finally say that the remark by the tories big donor that look at the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott make you 
 want to hate all black woman 
 be indeed racist in november the prime minister accept a non cash donation to the tune of £ from frank hester for the use of his helicopter so will he reimburse he yes or no 
 no mr speaker i be pleased that the gentleman be support a party that represent of the most diverse government in this country ’s history lead by this country ’s british asian prime minister 
 i look forward to voting later today for a tax cut for thousand of my constituent a national insurance tax cut that will mean £ off the tax bill of thousand of my constituent after listen to the rhetoric from the leader of the opposition today do the prime minister expect that the main opposition party will vote against this afternoon ’s tax cut 
 my hon friend raise an excellent question because while conservative member believe in a country where hard work be reward and people can keep more of their hard earn money which be why we be cut their taxis by an average of £ each we hear consistently from labour members that they not only disagree with that approach but continue to cling to unfunded spending promise that would put taxis up also just yesterday the shadow chief secretary to the treasury   the hon member for bristol north west darren jones describe our plan to end the double taxation on work as morally abhorrent that be the contrast between we and they labour will put your taxis up and the conservatives will keep cut they 
 many of his back benchers and now it seem the prime minister himself have take to refer to the european court of human rights as a foreign court as if there be something inherently wrong with thing be foreign or people be foreign in what way can a court that the uk have belong to since and which have an irish president and a uk justice with an llb from the university of dundee be consider foreign the house need to hear the prime minister commit today to the uk ’s continue membership of a court and convention that have protect our right and freedom for over year 
 when it come to the issue of tackle illegal migration when parliament express a clear view on what it believe should happen and support that with legislation and when we believe that we be act in accordance with all our international obligation i have be very clear that i will not let a foreign court stop we from send illegal migrant to rwanda that be the right policy and in fact the only way to ensure the security of our border and end the unfairness of illegal migration 
 as a general election be not merely an expression of opinion but a serious choice do my right hon friend agree that there be only potential party of government that have the will the inclination and the determination to stop mass illegal and legal migration and that be the conservative party let we unite our movement and do that 
 i agree with my right hon friend entirely we know this because not only have the leader of the opposition oppose the scheme but he have be clear that even when the scheme be implement and work he would still scrap it that tell we everything we need to know on this issue labour ’s value be simply not those of the british people there be only party that be go to stop the boat the conservative party 
 on this conservative government ’s watch thames water have dump over litre of sewage into london ’s river all while rack up multi pound debt and it be now report that thames water could go bust any day despite this the government be still refuse to publish their contingency plan for the collapse of our country ’s big water firm do the prime minister believe that thames water will still exist by the end of the year yes or no 
 it would not be right for i to comment on individual company but what i can say be that our ambitious storm overflow reduction plan be back by £ of capital investment we now monitor every single storm overflow across england and we have legislate to introduce unlimited penalty on water company that breach their obligation the independent regulator and the environment agency have the power they need to hold water company wherever they be to account 
 later this year a new digital eu border system will come in yet key change that be require and key detail have still not be decide by the eu urgent decision be need on additional funding and preparation to keep dover clear and traffic move through kent can my right hon friend the prime minister assure i that this issue be be take seriously at the high level of government and that funding and support will be make available to keep dover clear support the resident of dover and deal and kent and secure our vital cross channel trade and tourism 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue and i assure she that it be be discuss at the high level of government between uk ministers   and our eu and french counterpart to make sure that we have practical and constructive solution that will ease the flow of traffic in the way that she describe and benefit her local community 
 and day and there be no   peace and no justice there be no food no clean water no sanitation and no medical aid there be just no word leave as disease be spread and the death toll be rise not least among child the victim of these atrocity it be evident that the prime minister ’s plan be not work so will he change track for the sake of these child and so many more and work to secure   a bilateral immediate ceasefire between israel and hamas 
 i have say repeatedly that we be incredibly concerned about the grow humanitarian crisis in gaza too many civilian have lose their life and nowhere near enough aid be get through in contrast to what the hon lady say actually the uk be play a lead role in alleviate that suffering just recently we increase the amount of aid this year to £ just today tonne of uk aid be due to arrive in gaza and a full field hospital fly from manchester to the middle east last week will arrive in gaza in the come day staff by uk and local medic to provide lifesave care we be do absolutely everything we can work with our ally to bring much need aid to the people of gaza 
 will my right hon friend join i in thank the maternity team at the royal cornwall hospital at treliske in my truro and falmouth constituency for all the outstanding work they have do to improve maternity service over the last few year their sheer hard work along with the come new woman and child ’s hospital mean that there be no midwifery vacancy in cornwall which i think he will agree be a fantastic achievement 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the improvement in maternity service at the royal cornwall she be a tireless campaigner on reduce baby loss and i commend she for her recent work on the introduction of baby loss certificate as she know we be commit to a new woman and child ’s hospital for her local trust in as part of the new hospital programme 
 my constituent in somerton and frome work together with the langport transport group submit a robust   strategic business case to the government in july for the reopening of a train station in the somerton and langport area such a train station would connect over people to the rail network boost the local economy and support local people to reduce their reliance on car almost year on they be still wait for a response do the prime minister support this project and can he provide confidence to my constituent that their hard work to drive this vital project forward have not be futile 
 conservative in the south west be rightly champion the reopening of local station cullompton and wellington will be among the place that receive funding as a result of our decision on hs2 it be because of that decision that we have now free up billion of pound of funding to invest in local transport across the country and local leader will be put in charge of that money to prioritise their local need 
 rise 
 final question mark francois 
 prime minister in the 1930 of your less illustrious predecessor neville chamberlain so denude the british armed force of funding until it be too late that we fail to deter adolf hitler and people tragically die in the world war russia have invade ukraine china be threaten taiwan and british shipping be be attack by houthis in the red sea could you please assure i as the son of a d day veteran and the house of commons that we be not go to forget the lesson of history and make the same mistake again 
 i thank my right hon friend for his tireless campaign for our armed force he be right to champion they and the role they play i agree with he wholeheartedly that sadly the world we be live in be become both more challenging strategically and more dangerous and in response to those challenge we must invest more in our armed force that be exactly what we be do with the large uplift since the cold war recently top up with billion of pound to strengthen our nuclear enterprise and rebuild stockpile 
 my right hon friend rightly mention the threat pose by the houthis and by russia in ukraine i know that he will be proud of the role that the united kingdom be play in both those situation we be respect and value by our ally most importantly we on the government side of the house will do whatever it take to keep our country safe 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net to make a statement on the government ’s plan to build new gas fire power station 
 the consultation of the review of electricity market arrangement be launch yesterday it set out the choice that we need to make to deliver a fully decarbonise electricity system by since the government have reduce emission from power by and thus make the uk the major economy in the world to halve emission overall we have build record volume of renewable from less than of electricity supply in to nearly today allow we to remove coal altogether by october this year 
 our success in grow renewable be the reason we need flexible back up for when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine our main source of flexible power today be unabated gas more than half of our gw of combine cycle gas turbine could be retire by meanwhile electricity demand be set to increase as heat transport and industry be electrify we must ensure that we have sufficient source of flexibility in place to guarantee security of supply we need up to gw of short duration flexibility and between and gw of long duration flexibility our aim be for as much of that capacity as possible to be low carbon 
 while low carbon technology scale up we will extend the life of our exist gas asset but a limited amount of new build gas capacity will also be require in the short term to replace expire plant as it be the only mature technology capable of provide sustained flexible capacity we remain committed to deliver a fully decarbonise electricity supply by subject to security of supply and we expect most new gas capacity to be build net ready the government have commit £ to carbon capture usage and storage and be develop comprehensive support for hydrogen in the future unabated gas plant will run for only a limited number of hour a year so emission will be entirely in line with our legally bind carbon budget 
 i be a bit tired of this government shun any scrutiny of their climate record and instead rely on a past record because while the uk may indeed be the major economy to cut its territorial emission by half since we be not on track to achieve our target and if we factor in consumption emission the uk have cut emission by only so let ’s have a little less complacency from the minister he will know that the government ’s announcement on new gas fire power station do in fact contrary to what he claim risk undermine our climate target and leave the country reliant on import of expensive gas member should have be give the opportunity to question the minister on its implication for the decarbonisation of the uk ’s energy system by with of uk electricity be low carbon by 
 why be the statement not make in parliament why be it make instead at chatham house where member be not able to question the minister on the impact of this decision secondly will the minister   explain how this proposal differ from the functioning of the exist capacity market or will he admit that it be just the government ’s late attempt to stoke a culture war on climate thirdly the climate change committee be clear that no new unabated gas plant should be build after so what be the government ’s timeline for develop these new gas fire power station 
 i ask the minister about this yesterday in the environmental audit committee i do not get a response i also ask he what be be do to ensure that these gas plant be carbon by that be not set out either in the secretary of state ’s speech yesterday or by the minister today the minister do tell the environmental audit committee that the plant would be require to be both carbon capture and storage ready and hydrogen ready that do not amount to a meaningful plan so will he please give we more than his thus far unevidenced word of assurance and will he explain what the government ’s plan be to support the development of battery and long term storage technology and to drive innovation so that we can get off volatile gas for good 
 it be rather odd to be ask about the ability to scrutinise this when yesterday be the launch of a consultation that will go on for some time and as the hon lady know i be in front of the select committee yesterday it be rather strange that she should highlight that point 
 the hon lady be confuse as she often be because she be so political she would appear to set politic always ahead of climate she struggle to recognise that that united nations framework convention on climate change rule be about territorial emission country own the emission in the territory where they take place her number on embed emission be wrong but she do not care about that she just carry on with a political diatribe against the government who have do more than any other in any major economy on this earth to decarbonise their economy and we have do it not as the hon lady would have we do it by be reduce to live in yurt but while grow the economy by it be people like the hon lady who make people on my side of the chamber at time think that we be perhaps engage in some form of madness we be not but she do n’t half make it sound like we be 
 can these new gas plant be consistent with the government ’s commitment to decarbonise the power sector by our publish net scenario for the power sector i invite the hon lady to read they show that build new gas capacity be consistent with decarbonise electricity by from those scenario we expect that even with new gas capacity rather than the of electricity generation which in come from gas that figure will be down to by or if we follow the scenario set out by the climate change committee perhaps we be go to have that as a back up it be sensible insurance it be about keep the light on while we carry on the remarkable transformation this government have achieve in move from the appalling legacy of the labour party of less than of electricity come from renewable to nearly today 
 the announcement on gas fire power station be extremely welcome but at the moment a kilowatt hour of electricity   in the uk cost cent against cent in the us and cent in both china and india we have become fundamentally uncompetitive because of this green obsession we want cheap electricity and we should have gas and we should have coal and we should postpone net indefinitely because we be only of global emission we be make no difference and the us economy be grow consistently fast than our because of cheap energy this be a good step against the net obsession we need to go far 
 i would chide my right hon friend with the science and evidence that be emerge all the time there be a climate challenge and emergency which be why we be look to reduce our emission he be quite right to challenge that by say we be less than of global emission so how do this make sense that be why we host cop26 and get the rest of the world to commit to follow we we be bring in the carbon border adjustment mechanism from precisely to ensure that we create an economically rational system that support job in this country while meet the climate challenge that need to be meet 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be little puzzled about what all this be about the committee on climate change and all credible energy expert have say that we will need a small residual of unabated gas in the system for the medium term and that be consistent with a fully decarbonise power system no dispute that and it be barely worth an announcement we should extend the life of exist plant to meet that need if new build plant be need in the short term to replace some of those retire gas fire power station there be no disagreement provide they be capable of convert to hydrogen or carbon capture as the government say they must be 
 however that be not what the secretary of state say yesterday at the chatham house meeting the government ’s own analysis publish yesterday show that gw of exist gas capacity could be maintain via life extension and refurbishment and gw of new capacity be already in the baseline under exist capacity market arrangement that be an uncontroversial position and analysis and hardly something worth make a huge fuss about but again that be not what the secretary of state talk about at yesterday ’s chatham house conference 
 give that analysis could the minister enlighten we with the number of new gas plant that the government be hop to build give there be no mention of that in the page of document that be publish yesterday that be an important point because it appear to show the government ’s intention to go beyond what be already in the analysis and build a large number of new gas fire power station for the future 
 there be a great deal in the review of electricity market arrangement publish yesterday that be worth discuss not least the government ’s glare failure to bring forward low carbon flexible technology such as long duration storage which everyone know we will need it be a shame that the minister have not properly   address that will he give we clarity on whether this be a meaningless announcement within exist policy arrangement or as have be say be it an attempt to conjure a culture war out of climate and energy policy with announcement with no substance or value that show that the government have no serious plan for energy in our country 
 the hon gentleman ask whether new power plant will be hydrogen or carbon capture utilisation and storage ready we will legislate to make that a requirement he ask how much there will be around gw but that be dependent on so many interrelated thing such as the growth of low carbon and flexible storage which as he refer to we be a world leader in develop and support both in innovation and through the capacity market he suggest that none of that be clear yesterday but it be make crystal clear 
 we be a world leader have announce £ for ccus the hon gentleman will remember because he have be around a long time that in the then labour government say that carbon capture utilisation and storage be urgent and that there be no route to without it but then they proceed to do nothing about it this government be get on with it we be put our money where our mouth be and develop technology such as carbon capture and hydrogen in a way that the labour government fail to do as they do with renewable to boot all they do be talk about climate but the truth be that the great climate risk to this country be if   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband   destroy the market and start some state run quango which will wreck the renewable growth that we have see 
 i welcome the announcement the independent committee on climate change recognise that we will need unabated gas in the electricity market right up until and beyond and more widely that even in of our energy need will come from hydrocarbon do my right hon friend agree that this be exactly the right way to maintain low energy production cost while still meet our net target 
 i do agree with my hon friend the point be to have a wide range of back up capacity but not to use it very much with fossil fuel and as i think have long be the case to ensure that any new gas generation should be carbon capture ready we look forward to it be hydrogen ready too we be in a very similar position to germany and other country that be look at exactly that for instance i think both germany and ireland as part of their growth in renewable recognise the need for gas albeit use less and less to ensure that the light stay on and there be appropriate insurance in place 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 what a cluster it be unbelievable that we be in this situation in the secretary of state ’s letter to members today she say that the government be take step to make sure the light stay on that be the legacy of year of the conservatives in charge of energy uncomfortably i find myself in agreement with   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg this be a significant   departure and we should be alarmed about where be the government ’s precious nuclear baseload now where be the exemplar of ccus work at the necessary scale from which the government be take inspiration would it not have be an elegant solution to have unabated gas wind down at the same time as battery storage and long duration pump storage be wind up we can not have that because the government have drag their foot on both thing what do the minister say to people who be have infrastructure for transmission put throughout their community and be be tell to suck it up because that be what we need to get gas out the system when the same government be now build gas fire power station 
 the hon gentleman who be suppose to lead on this subject for his party should have listen to what i say early in of generation come from gas by the mid-2030 it will be or why be we have it to balance the renewable we be grow particularly in scotland and support scottish job of course if we put generation in scotland when the demand be in the south we have to provide connect infrastructure previous generation have to wire up the uk to become the rich and prosperous country we be today we need to do it again now we be work with local community listen to their voice and make sure they be not mislead by people who come up with such nonsense as the hon gentleman just do 
 i commend my right hon friend for his refreshingly clear articulation of our strong record in this area both in the house today and in the medium yesterday obviously security of supply must come how will the plan incentivise investment in back up gas fire power station while minimise cost to consumer which be also very important 
 i thank my hon friend he and my right hon friend   the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg   be absolutely right to focus on the economic we have to get the economic right we have use an auction type mechanism in the capacity market to ensure flexible capacity we be incentivise more and more of that to be low carbon with battery come in at scale as well as pump and potentially hydrostorage we also need hydrogen and carbon capture we be ensure a balanced system with discipline build into it to drive cost down when cbam and so on come on stream i firmly expect that in the 2030 we will have low cost energy than our neighbour and we will as my right hon friend the member for north east somerset refer to be more economically competitive 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 thank you mr speaker tapadh leibh 
 it be concern that this be announce in chatham house and not here in the house and that the secretary of state be not here today off piste speech have cost in the past my committee hear this morning that an energy minister make a speech a decade ago that with the effect it have on investment cost job the minister say that this be a consultation but have the   government pick a winner what room have they give for storage to be in the mix be they confuse energy security we have learn from the ukraine war important how that be with continual electricity supply give what the minister say about the percentage of gas use by and after what percentage of capacity will this provide and what percentage do he envisage will be use day to day what thought have be give to consideration of other technology in his gigawatt demand 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i suggest on different scenario about or of total generation come from gas in future compare with in on an annualise basis clearly as the hon gentleman should know well than anybody here with his deep knowledge of the subject it be base on intermittency it depend on how much the sun shin and how much the wind blow but we will ensure we have a robust system that be exactly what we be do i would love it if people could celebrate this country ’s global leadership and the fact that we be drive this forward especially those such as member of the green party who be suppose to care about climate change we be do this in a way that maintain security of supply and by bring in more and more renewable with the low cost and most flexible system to back it up do so in a more and more economical fashion 
 i welcome the announcement today it be pure common sense when the wind be not blow and the sun be not shin we need security of supply although we need to deal with climate change in the medium to long term we must also deal with security of supply in the short term so i welcome the announcement do the minister agree that for medium and long term security of supply we must upscale what we be do in the hydrogen sector with more hydrogen production and usage and be a world leader in hydrogen for the moment we be slip behind a bit 
 i agree with my hon friend about the importance of hydrogen where i disagree with he be that have see the project in hydrogen allocation round project i think i do not think there be any indication that we be slip behind the truth be that the whole world need to do this because everyone ’s analysis from the international energy agency to the climate change committee to my own department suggest that hydrogen and carbon capture be necessary to bring about the decarbonise system we seek he be absolutely right on the importance of hydrogen he can expect more development because this country be lead on that as it be on ccus 
 i have a great deal of respect for the minister and his knowledge of the subject and the fact that he like most of we in this chamber recognise the need to cut carbon i be sure he be not of those who like the right hon member for north east somerset would follow the flat earther but clearly a great deal of trust and reliance be be put on carbon capture and storage and on hydrogen both be still quite new technology we have talk about this stuff for year the minister seemingly forget that this government have be in power for the   past year and we be still not off the block on hydrogen and carbon capture and storage be it not the case that the government be take this position because it be a nod and a wink to the gas and oil industry whose support they will probably need before the election this year and that this be part of the whole agenda of placate the right wing of his own party 
 i be with the hon gentleman nearly all the way he be right the whole world be look at carbon capture and hydrogen because that be what the science say everybody who analyse it say that we need it bur that it be not yet at a great level of maturity just as in so many other area this country be lead the way we have cut emission more than anyone else he know the dire legacy leave by his party in with less than of electricity from renewable which be just appalling and the real danger if we go back to that that be why we have gas power as a back up so that we have a completely sound system we will seek to deliver a decarbonise system by the big risk to that would be if the right hon member for doncaster north be to come in and start to mess with a system that have lift we from the back to the front of climate leadership that be the real danger and that be what we need to avoid 
 will my right hon friend stop by south derbyshire specifically the willington site which already have plan permission for a new gas power station and cut the ribbon when it open we want spade in the ground so i welcome the announcement i invite he to come and have a look at that site which be ready to go 
 i agree with my hon friend and i applaud those who be invest in our system we have make ourselves of the most investable country in the world for clean energy gas have an important part to play in that balance and with the development of carbon capture and hydrogen there be every opportunity for such asset to have an even long life in a green fashion i would love to come and see my hon friend 
 oil and gas be the energy source of the past and we need an intermittent energy source gas power plant be not intermittent they sit there and then because there be too much renewable energy it be shut off and gas the carbon energy continue to flow that be the reality of today we be waste renewable energy the government do not recognise that reality and do not respond to it 
 my question be this however how many time have ministers meet representative of the oil and gas industry and how do that compare with the number of meeting with representative of the renewable industry 
 as so often the hon lady do it spectacularly well she be completely and utterly wrong renewable be turn off as she would say because of constraint within the system and gas be turn on because the system could not cope otherwise that be why we have the transmission acceleration action plan and the connection action plan interruption every time we try to build out the infrastructure   the hon   member for angus dave doogan   oppose it he say that he and the scottish national party want to be a friend of the renewable industry and scottish job but then he oppose the infrastructure that be require for it 
 what about my question 
 i meet representative of the oil and gas industry a lot because the truth be that even give our world leadership and we have cut emission by more than any other major economy on the planet—75 of our primary energy today be still from oil and gas we will still be dependent on oil and gas in when we be at net that be why it be so crazy that the opposition party include that of the hon lady believe in oppose licence when we be actually dependent on the product all that end licence would do be lead to the loss of british job and the import of high emission product from abroad i really do hope that opposition members will think a bit more deeply and we can hear some common sense i hear it in the corridor from back benchers but from the front benchers and the hon lady i hear nothing but nonsense 
 i welcome this policy decision which be a recognition of reality can the minister confirm that the new plant will be able to convert to low carbon alternative in the future 
 i thank my hon friend we will be legislate precisely to create exactly that obligation for carbon capture and/or hydrogen readiness 
 i hope that this decision be indicative of a realisation that seem to be slowly dawn on the government about the impact of the madness of their net policy which have damage the uk economy we have high electricity price than most of the other g7 country we have lose vast number of job in energy intensive industry and now it have be recognise that because of the intermittency of wind and solar there be a risk of blackout 
 i welcome this common sense decision but give that we be go to use gas to power these station why do the minister not take the next logical step and legislate to allow we to tap into our vast uk gas resource as the united states have show that would bring down price give we energy security and make our economy more competitive 
 the right hon gentleman could not be more wrong we have record level of employment and we overtake france recently to become the large manufacturer in the world i would not expect he to join the dismal party opposite in talk this country down in truth we be lead the world in tackle climate change and we have create more job than at any time in british history go forward into the 2030 by harness more and more british low carbon renewable energy we will lower bill for family and increase our competitiveness as i have say in a world that be increasingly recognise the need for action and seek to introduce measure such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism effectively carbon taxis at the border the uk be in pole position to grow from its already strong economic position into an even strong as a result of the net policy of this government 
 across london and the south east many much need development that be require for the increase population have literally be freeze because of a lack of supply from the grid nuclear power can provide the baseload renewable be unreliable and obviously gas be require at peak time in particular do my right hon friend agree that this be all about top up the grid at peak time when people want to use electricity because gas be the fast way to bring a power station on to the grid and be also the fast to shut down 
 my hon friend will be aware of all the work we be do to speed up transmission we be halve the timeline from to year to and the connection action plan have already move forward connection date for project amount to gw we be put in a lot of work across the piece this gas capability be there as a back up but the usage and the emission result from it will fall precipitately over the next year and we can all celebrate that 
 after their year of delay meaningful investment in clean cheap reliable renewable energy technology such as tidal and long duration pump hydro storage it be no surprise that the government be now have to scramble to create new dirty gas power plant how much do the department estimate the new plant will cost where be it suggest they should be build and what do the minister mean by carbon capture ready do he mean carbon capture operational 
 hear hear do tell 
 as i have say further legislation will come forward in the not too distant future and the hon lady will be able to scrutinise it but it be extraordinary that she should say of a country whose renewable energy generation have rise from less than to approach that we have go slow on renewable we have decarbonise our power system fast than any other major economy on the planet 
 the reality denial that we hear from the scottish national party be quite extraordinary the hon lady highlight tidal energy well guess which country in the world use the most tidal energy   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael who be of the great champion of tidal could tell the hon lady if she be really so ignorant he be a fellow scottish mp and he could tell she that the uk have more tidal deployment than any other nation we be proud   of that we be proud of the transformation and it be about time the snp and the labour party stop mislead the people and the house 
 the minister say early that we face a climate challenge after struggle for word to describe what we be face why can the government not join the global consensus and admit that what we be face be a climate emergency as the secretary general of the united nations have say the year of climate warming be over and we be in an era of climate burning 
 unlike the hon gentleman i be not primarily concerned with word i be primarily concerned with action but in fact i do use the emergency word i do not know whether i break some golden rule which say that ministers should not use it but i do treat this as an emergency i see the world warm up i see the negative impact of climate change and that be why i spend every single day feel proud to be part of the department that be decarbonise its country fast than any other in the world the hon gentleman should get away from rhetoric and start to focus on action 
 i thank the minister for all his answer while there be certainly an urge to prioritise our net promise i be grateful to the government for take back up precaution into consideration as the minister have often recognise in respond to question from i northern ireland play an important role in our contribution to meet the net target will he therefore ensure that northern ireland be prioritise as a lead location for any new gas power station that be to be build 
 the hon gentleman sometimes give the impression that he would like i to be run the energy system in northern ireland but it be devolve and we have ministers there again which be a cause for celebration i will work closely with ministers in northern ireland as i do with ministers in other devolved administration because if we be to meet our net target northern ireland must deliver its own target scotland have to deliver its target as do wales 
 we must work together in a spirit of collaboration we can do that and if the hon gentleman can persuade his right hon friend   the member for east antrim sammy wilson who be sit beside he that it can be do in a way that strengthen our economy as well we really will have something to celebrate 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement about post office legislation and the horizon redress scheme 
 i be very pleased to be able to announce that today we be introduce a new bill that will quash the conviction of postmaster in england and wales affect by the horizon scandal as set out in my write statement last month this legislation will quash all conviction that meet a clear set of condition those in scope will have their conviction quash on the day that the new legislation be bring into force subject to parliamentary passage our aim be for royal assent to be receive as soon as possible before the summer recess 
 we accept and have always be clear that the legislation may overturn the conviction of some people who be guilty of genuine wrongdoing but we believe this be a price worth pay to ensure that many innocent people be exonerated however the government will seek to mitigate the risk of people receive financial redress when they have not be wrong 
 the government also accept that this legislation be unprecedented it be an exceptional response to a factually exceptional situation i want to be clear that this do not set a precedent and neither be it a criticism of the judiciary or the court which have deal swiftly with matter bring before they the fact remain however that year after the conviction be overturn only around have be quash without government intervention many of these conviction could not be overturn either because all the evidence have long be lose or because quite simply postmaster have lose faith in the state and the criminal justice system and will not come forward to seek justice 
 the legislation will apply to england and wales only however we be fully commit to work with the scottish government and the northern ireland executive through regular weekly official level engagement to progress their own approach i have meet my counterpart in the scottish government and the northern ireland executive to offer support and address their concern and i will have further meeting the financial redress scheme will be open to applicant throughout the uk once conviction have be overturn 
 i thank the business and trade committee   which recently publish a report that include some recommendation for the government regard horizon redress we will respond to they in the usual way but today i would like to address of the committee ’s recommendation the be that responsibility for redress should not lie with the post office as it should be subject to independent oversight something that have also be recommend to we by the horizon compensation advisory board i can announce today that the department for business and trade rather than the post office will be responsible for the delivery of redress for overturn conviction final decision on redress will be make by independent panel or independent individual 
 with your permission mr speaker i shall return to the house at a later date to provide detail on how we intend to deliver redress for those who have their conviction   overturn by the bill or via subsequent measure take in scotland and northern ireland we be discuss the detail with the advisory board the financial secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for mid worcestershire nigel huddleston will introduce legislation to make any payment make via the new scheme exempt from tax 
 secondly the select committee recommend that the government introduce legally bind timeframe to deliver redress for sub postmaster with financial penalty for non compliance i strongly support the committee ’s desire to speed up redress but we feel that its propose regime would have the opposite impact it would potentially mean impose penalty on forensic accountant or other who be help postmaster to prepare their claim do that would probably cause some of they to withdraw from this work which would slow down the delivery of redress furthermore we do not want to be in the position of rush postmaster into major decision about their claim and the offer they receive which would possibly mean that some be time out of redress altogether the advisory board have say that its strong view be that 
 this would be a backward step 
 which be why we pass legislation less than month ago to remove the arbitrary deadline from the group litigation order scheme we do not want to reverse that change 
 however the government be act to ensure that redress be deliver as quickly as possible we be work with claimant lawyer to reduce the number of case that require expert evidence for example from forensic accountant or medical evidence which delay claim we will pilot that approach and assume that the pilot succeed we hope to expand it rapidly 
 secondly the advisory board and i have ask for monthly report on each scheme they will come from scheme independent case manager where such manager be in place we will publish the report which will give we the good basis on which to assess measure for speed up redress 
 finally we be introduce optional fix sum award in january the government announce that they would offer an optional fix sum award of £ to those in the group litigation order scheme as of   march offer have be accept and over people have take the £ fix payment of those who have accept the fix payment quarter be new claimant so the fix offer have already mean that over claim have be resolve promptly in some case those people will have get more than they would have ask for the fix offer have also have a helpful effect on other claim because it substantially reduce work on small claim by claimant lawyer make more resource available to progress large claim more quickly 
 i be pleased to announce today that the £ fix sum award offer will now be extend to the horizon shortfall scheme to ensure that everyone be treat fairly across all the scheme those who have already settle their claim below £ will be offer a top up to bring their total redress to that amount over postmaster will benefit quickly from this announcement 
 we be mindful that claim be not be submit to the glo scheme as swiftly as we would like we have already announce the optional fix sum award of   £ but to ensure that we get help to claimant more quickly i can announce today that anyone who choose not to take that offer and instead submit a full claim for individual assessment will have their interim payment top up to £ straight away 
 many postmaster life have be ruin by the horizon scandal and we be work hard to deliver redress we have set up the williams inquiry which will discover the truth we will provide fair financial redress as promptly as we can and we will exonerate those who be so unjustly convict of crime that they do not commit i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement before i respond to it i would like to put on the record my deep disappointment at the minister ’s comment this morning on bbc breakfast he fail to categorically condemn the tory party donor frank hester ’s horrific and racist remark about   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott despite no finally after much delay describe the remark as racist and wrong the minister appear to contradict that position this morning 
 on a point of order mr speaker this be a statement on post office legislation may i respectfully say that what the hon lady be say be irrelevant to this statement 
 the shadow minister will be move on 
 i will move on i simply hope that the minister will reflect on the reversal of the statement he give this morning in which he take the position that he would take a donation from that donor i hope he reflect on the impact that the issue be have on many of we 
 i turn to today ’s crucial statement the horizon scandal be truly shocking and be of the most devastating miscarriage of justice in british history the scandal have bring devastation to the life of hundred of falsely convict sub postmaster over year on they and their family still suffer from the consequence and the trauma of all that they have be put through i pay tribute to they for their determination in pursue justice and to alan bates and the sub postmaster who pioneer the campaign and work tirelessly to seek justice without their bravery and perseverance the campaign would not be where it be today i also pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for north durham mr jones   for all his work to lord arbuthnot for his campaigning on this issue for many year to other in this house and the other house and to member of the business and trade committee and its chair my right hon friend   the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne
