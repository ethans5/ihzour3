 the secretary of state be ask 
 what estimate she have make of the number of pensioner in poverty who will not be entitle to the winter fuel payment in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of pensioner in poverty who will not be entitle to the winter fuel payment in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of pensioner in poverty who will not be entitle to the winter fuel payment in winter 
 may i say briefly mr speaker that as my right hon and learn friend the prime minister have say   october   last year be the deadly day in jewish history since the holocaust and we stand firm in our commitment to bring the remain hostage home and secure the immediate ceasefire and aid that civilian in gaza and lebanon desperately need 
 an estimated of the poor pensioner be not claim the pension credit they be entitle to so they do not get the winter fuel payment or pension credit of up to £ a year that be why we have launch the big ever drive to increase pension credit uptake and ensure that the poor pensioner get the support they deserve 
 have spend the run up to the election scaring pensioner into vote for they by claim it be the conservative government who be a threat to their wellbeing some of our poor pensioner will now be force to find out how difficult it be to keep warm huddled around labour ’s gaslight give that the government ’s own equality analysis state that only of the pensioner who be eligible for pension credit be expect to apply for it if all those who be eligible do apply how much more will that cost compare with the initial saving from remove the winter fuel payment 
 i say gently to the hon gentleman that upon come into government we discover that pensioner be not claim the pension credit they be entitle to give that his former government fail to   take action to deal with that issue i suggest that instead of make that point he work with his council to increase pension credit uptake and look at the £ we have give to peterborough council to make sure that all the help for pensioner include on winter fuel be make available 
 i remain deeply concerned about the pensioner in my constituency who will not be entitle to the winter fuel payment this winter we be now into october give that we now know that just of pensioner in absolute poverty receive pension credit how can the minister justify her government ’s claim that they be focus support on those in the great need 
 again i say to the right hon lady that the reason so many of the poor pensioner be miss out be that her government fail to increase pension credit uptake we have launch the big ever programme to increase uptake of pension credit for the time we will be write to all pensioner on housing benefit and i urge the right hon lady to work with her local council and other to make sure that the poor in her constituency get the money they be entitle to 
 over people in my constituency will lose the winter fuel payment but this be not about figure it be about individual which be why i be run a pensioner advisory service on friday to help they with this issue this be about people so what do the secretary of state say to people such as rita in my constituency who be look after her husband who have multiple sclerosis and who will not be eligible for pension credit and therefore the winter fuel payment 
 i know that the hon gentleman have focus over many year on health and healthcare issue and i would say to he that we be in this situation because his government leave a £ black hole in the public finance unlike conservative members we take our responsibility seriously and i would urge he to work with his council they have receive £ in hampshire and £ in surrey from the household support fund to make sure that all pensioner get the money they be entitle to 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 i welcome the work that my right hon friend be do in ensure that the uptake of pension credit be increase but there be genuine concern about people who be just above that threshold who will remain in poverty just under a quarter of a in the north west alone in addition to the fantastic commitment there have be through the household support fund will my right hon friend be undertake any other mitigation to ensure that those pensioner live in poverty particularly disabled pensioner will not fall foul of this 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and i welcome she to her position as chair of the select committee alongside our work to increase pension credit uptake the household support fund be available for those just above the pension credit level my own   council have do a lot of work to make sure that pensioner just above that level can get extra help with the cost of heating or energy debt there be also the warm home discount which be available not just to those on pension credit but again to those just above that level if they be on low income and have high housing cost 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on her ambition to sign people up to pension credit but we know that about people will not sign up in time and also that there be people in fuel poverty above that mark give that we be really worried now as winter be approach about the impact that this be go to have particularly on the health of old people will she look at the work do by energy systems catapult and nhs gloucestershire on social prescribing to ensure that people can receive energy payment in that way 
 my hon friend raise a very important point this be not just about urge people to come forward and claim we be write to pensioner on housing benefit for the time ever and i be determined to bring forward the merger of housing benefit and pension credit which the former government delay for year i very much agree about the need to bring together social prescribing with help from the household support fund and other area to make sure pensioner get all the help they need and about the need to work with frontline nhs staff as we be also do to make sure that the poor who may be stick at home with chronic condition also know what they be entitle to 
 it be clear that of the driver of pensioner poverty be the sheer number of pensioner eligible for pension credit who have be leave not claim it for successive year by the previous government i welcome the secretary of state ’s zeal for make sure that we put that right but how can we as member from across the house work with her department to make sure that there be no unnecessary barrier for those who be eligible and in need of pension credit to claim it this winter 
 i would urge all hon member in this house to work with their local council as i be do to make sure that those on housing benefit and other pensioner know what they be entitle to and to make sure that their council know that the household support fund the £ we have set aside this year despite all the problem we face be also available to those pensioner just above the pension credit level 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the general election the labour party promise that it have no plan to mean test the winter fuel allowance yet we learn that million of pensioner be to be affect indeed in the right hon lady ’s party produce an analysis suggest that around pensioner would die prematurely be this policy to be bring into effect do she stand by that figure of around if not how many premature death do she believe will occur as a result of this policy 
 in the right hon gentleman ’s party manifesto promise to mean test winter fuel payment until conservative member know that they have to apologise to the british people for the extra pensioner in poverty over the past year and for a £ black hole in the public finance which we be now put right but that have put the public finance at risk they will remain on the opposition benches and we will remain on the government benches 
 i think i need to correct the right hon lady there be actually few pensioner in absolute poverty under the previous conservative government she quite rightly be press the uptake of pension credit but if all those who be eligible for it take it up that will cost £ which be substantially more than the saving that be score at £ if she be successful in her aspiration the cost will substantially outweigh the saving if she be not successful potentially million of pensioner will be plunge far into poverty may i ask she which it be 
 there be more pensioner in poverty and i be happy to put those figure into the public domain to set the record straight the saving we have put forward take into account the increase in uptake that we foresee unlike conservative members we be determined and will do everything possible they should perhaps ask themselves why they announce the merger of pension credit and housing benefit in and then put it off until to change thing and get people the money they be entitle to we will bring that forward to ensure that all the poor pensioner get what they be entitle to 
 i call liberal democrat spokesperson steve darling 
 there be pensioner over the age of who would have benefit from the £ winter fuel allowance they be among the most vulnerable in our society the right hon lady be right to say that the previous government let they down but let we not add insult to injury and have the new government let they down can she reassure the house that she will reverse the regressive approach that she have take to the winter fuel allowance and not hit the most vulnerable people who be over 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he will know that this be not a decision that we want or expect to make the reason we have take it be that we have to deal with the £ black hole in the public finance leave by conservative members but in do so we will as a progressive party always prioritise the very poor pensioner that be why we be so determined to end a situation where up to people miss out on the winter fuel allowance because they be not get pension credit we be determined to put that right 
 what step she be take to reduce the time take for access to work claim to be process 
 i thank my hon friend for her question labour ’s manifesto say that we will tackle the backlog of access to work claim and we will we have improve the process and increase the number of staff processing claim but there be more to do and that work be ongoing 
 do the minister agree that delay to the processing of access to work claim not only impact the individual and their health particularly their mental health but impact their ability to fulfil their potential and contribute to our economy what further step will she take to ensure that the process for help disabled people back into work be reform to ensure that it be genuinely of support that allow people to fulfil their potential and enable business to thrive 
 i agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend disabled people have the right to work like everybody else we have an ambition to see an employment rate in this country and we can not do that without the contribution of people with disability we be work on an employment white paper and develop our policy and we want everybody in this country to make their full contribution especially disabled people 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the child maintenance service in collect payment 
 the child maintenance service be commit to ensure that separate parent support their child financially and to take robust enforcement action against those who do not do so between march and march this year the percentage of parent pay something towards maintenance through collect and pay increase from to this government recognise that child maintenance payment play a crucial role in keep hundred of thousand of child out of poverty each year and we be determined to do all we can to increase those collection level far 
 give that around half of child in separated family that be child be receive no support from their non residential parent do the minister know when that figure might change 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point about those family who receive no support i be tell that the figure be actually around but none the less it be not good enough although there be varied reason for that indeed there be some parent who do not want an arrangement we be look as he may be aware at a recently conclude consultation on the future of the child maintenance service we will consider our next step with a view to try to increase collection level wherever we can 
 member have to stand to be call i be not a mind reader i be pretty good but i can not win the lottery 
 constituent have contact i with separate but similar case relate to obtain child maintenance payment from abusive ex partner in both case their abuser have be able to use feature of the system to avoid pay their fair share to their victim and their child leave my constituent with a shortfall of thousand of pound can my hon friend tell i what step be be take to reform the child maintenance system to protect victim of abuse such as my constituent 
 the department take domestic abuse extremely seriously my hon friend will be keen to hear that the recently conclude consultation i reference in my previous answer look to address some of the issue with the direct pay service indeed it consult on the potential removal of that service move forward that service have be open to abuse and have lead to victim of domestic abuse continue to be terrorise that be unacceptable and we will look to address it move forward 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of mean testing for winter fuel payment on people with medical condition that be exacerbate by cold weather 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place pensioner with a long term health condition or disability may be eligible for disability relate benefit such as disability living allowance or attendance allowance and these benefit also provide for an additional amount in pension credit for those on low income 
 the government ’s impersonal approach be cold comfort to thousand of disabled pensioner include ann in my constituency she have to boil water to prevent infection and use an electric nebuliser and as a result she have high energy usage to protect her health can the minister tell ann what sacrifice she should make to protect her health this winter 
 this be a decision that we neither want nor expect to make but when we come into office there be a £ black hole in the public finance there be mitigation in place we have extend the household support fund and the hon gentleman ’s council will receive an extra £ we be increase the state pension through the triple lock the state pension will increase by £ in this parliament we will also deliver the warm home discount scheme and i hope he will join i in make sure that every pensioner who be eligible for pension credit receive it which will passport they to the winter fuel payment 
 we know that old people currently live in poverty in this country with million more with income just above the poverty level do the minister agree that the government should set up a pensioner taskforce to look at how pensioner poverty can be tackle once and for all 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i will meet he and any other member of this house who have concern on this matter 
 what step she be take to ensure pensioner who be eligible for but have not previously claim pension credit receive a winter fuel payment in winter 
 what step her department be take to help increase uptake of pension credit 
 we have be run a national campaign since september across a range of channel include print and broadcast medium to encourage pensioner to check their eligibility and make a claim and we will continue to work with external partner local authority and devolve government to boost the take up of pension credit 
 around of pensioner in mid bedfordshire face lose the winter fuel payment this year some of they earn less than £ a month what further support will the minister give they to fill labour ’s black hole in their household finance so that they can keep warm this winter 
 the winter fuel payment be once describe as the 
 large benefit pay to pensioner regardless of need give money to wealthy pensioner when work people on low income do not get similar support 
 those be not my word but the word of the tories manifesto 
 claim pension credit can provide pensioner with additional help for housing cost council tax and heating bill we all have a duty to boost pension credit uptake to ensure that low income pensioner in all our constituency receive the necessary support i welcome the deputy prime minister and the work and pensions secretary collaborate with local authority and charity for the annual pension credit week of action which take place during recess what more can be do to ensure that low income pensioner receive pension credit 
 we be pleased to see local authority respond positively to our call for action they be work with we to drive the boost in uptake of pension credit apart from the national campaign that we have be run we will bring together the administration of housing benefit and pension credit in a way that the former government fail to do 
 what progress she have make on respond to recommendation on compensation make by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman in his report on change to woman ’s state pension age 
 what her department ’s timetable be for respond to the recommendation on compensation make by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman in his report on change to woman ’s state pension age 
 i be the minister for long year to meet women against state pension inequality campaigner to hear their experience directly however we do need time to carefully consider the ombudsman ’s report and evidence before we can outline our approach 
 i have long support woman in bedford bear in the 1950 who have be fail by the dwp we must do right by the waspi woman some of whom be struggle to make end meet will the minister tell they today when the government will respond to the report by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman which recommend a compensation scheme 
 the ombudsman ’s report be a serious report that take year to complete and deserve serious consideration we be carefully review the detail of that complex report and will come to a conclusion in the round 
 i echo the sentiment of   the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin   on this serious injustice which be be compound by the lack of swift action for redress it really matter to all our constituent include mine in norfolk and suffolk where i have speak to the local waspi woman group which highlight just how a big an impact it be have include on woman bear in the 1950 who be struggle to make end meet will the minister please set out the timescale by which she will respond to the report and the action that will be take 
 the ombudsman take year to look into what be a serious significant and complex set of case we need time to look at that seriously and we be do precisely that 
 what step she be take to support vulnerable people into work 
 we be commit to support vulnerable customer into work at jobcentre for example we can identify the support need and signpost people to course or organisation to help they overcome barrier we will be say more about our proposal in the forthcoming employment white paper 
 in my local jobcentre on mare street in my constituency there be an extremely good team of dwp staff who work closely with vulnerable constituent to help they overcome the hurdle to get benefit and get into work however for people with fluctuate condition and particularly mental health condition there be many barrier both for they and for prospective employer i wonder whether the minister could give we a taster of what might be in   the white paper in term of support for employer in particular to encourage they to take on people with such challenge 
 i very much welcome my hon friend ’s positive report of the work in her local jobcentre she highlight a major challenge behind a significant proportion of increase inactivity over the past few year we will set out our response in the get britain working white paper but we be already provide tailor support in partnership with nhs talk therapy and individual placement and support in primary care my hon friend be absolutely right that there be a good deal more to be do 
 conservative run east sussex county council be threaten to close the steps to work programme as well as linden court in eastbourne which support people with learn disability to work towards employment will the minister urge the county council to halt its plan and to consider alternative such as sell off council building to raise the fund need to provide these essential service for people with learn disability 
 the hon gentleman draw my attention to a concern development my view be that we need more support for people with learn disability to get into work not less if he send i the detail of the concern he have raise i will be happy to look into they far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the well receive and groundbreake buckland review of autism employment focus on the action need to help to tackle the lack of opportunity and outdated recruitment practice that do not meet the employment need of autistic people how be the minister i welcome he to his place go to use this review which i seem to remember he welcome to tackle the lack of understanding and ongoing stereotype to help to make real change via access to work and other dwp intervention 
 i thank the hon lady for her welcome i be look forward to a meeting with sir robert later on this month and we will be talk exactly about that matter 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that answer the disability action plan mid year update be now somewhat overdue can the minister confirm to the house when there will be a much need update in help vulnerable people to thrive in all walk of life whether in employment or in respect of equality of opportunity will the minister ’s government commit like the previous conservative government do to work towards host the special olympics 
 we will be say more and we will provide an update in the forthcoming get britain working white paper if the hon lady would like to drop i a line about the special olympics i would be happy to look into that as well 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the accessibility of jobcentre to people live in rural area 
 we need jobcentre to be well everywhere include those in rural area with unique challenge in the autumn we will publish a white paper on our plan to transform the employment support system which will change jobcentre i welcome input on that issue from member from all part of the house 
 in south shropshire youth unemployment have rise over the past month what be the minister go to do to stop this worrying trend in rural community like mine 
 i thank the hon member for bring that point to the house it be a major focus of the work that be currently go into the white paper we have have very worrying development for young people since the pandemic and we need to do much well to give they the good possible start in life i will say it again on this issue we welcome input from member on all side of the house 
 housing association be the large investor in employment support in the uk only to the department for work and pensions their work invest in employment support for some of the hard to reach community include rural community such as mine in suffolk coastal will the minister commit to work with housing association to co design and co invest employment support over this parliament 
 i thank my hon friend again for her very welcome point housing association be extremely important for connect with resident who often have multiple vulnerability when think about the journey into work we need join up service between the nhs the local authority and our housing association they will be a part of the future partnership and i look forward to work with she for her constituency 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the effectiveness of jobcentre plus in help people get back into work 
 to be frank the current system be focus on the problem of yesterday in the last parliament economic inactivity increase and the employment rate fall we be plan fundamental reform to the system that will focus on the problem of today and get more people into work detail of which will be set out in our forthcoming white paper get britain working 
 will the minister set out how the propose merger between jobcentre plus and the national careers service will help to tackle economic inactivity and change the way that jobcentre work with their customer 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be pleased to hear that of his early visit as the ever labour member for southport be to his local jobcentre with the minister for employment who i know would want i to commend all the staff at the southport jobcentre the truth be that at present jobcentre seem to function more as place from which benefit be administer than as centre support people into work the merger of jobcentre plus and the national careers service will address that enable we to get more people into employment and help those on low pay increase their earning through more personalised and localise support ensure that no be leave behind 
 the challenge that jobcentre in kendal and the rest of cumbria face as well as get people back into work be the fact that our workforce in westmorland be far too small the average house price in our constituency be time average earning and waiting list for social housing be through the roof some of all employer survey in our community recently say that they be work below capacity because they could not find enough staff so if we want to tackle the problem in our economy we need to do thing increase the amount of social housing and secondly allow more flexible visa arrangement would the minister ’s department work with housing colleague to provide more housing grant for our community and sign up to the youth mobility visa arrangement 
 order the hon member should know well he get in a lot so he should not take advantage of other member 
 the hon member will be pleased to know that we intend to work considerably more flexibly to support the need of community in a varied and bespoke way he have particular challenge because of the rural nature of his constituency and various other factor but he will appreciate that i will not make housing or home office policy on the hoof from the dispatch box 
 i call the shadow minister 
 jobcentre be extremely good as we just hear from   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier who be leave the chamber yet the new minister for employment previously describe jobcentre as place nobody want to go and claim that they do not offer real help our jobcentre help to ensure that almost more people have work compare with when her party leave office in more than of those employ be woman will the minister and the dwp team who have make disparage remark apologise to work coach and dwp staff who she and they have rubbish but who now have to look up to they as the new ministerial team 
 i fear that the hon lady have misunderstand the criticism which be levy not at our outstanding work coach but at the policy of the previous government who have leave we with economic inactivity at its high rate in year we be the only g7 economy with a low employment rate than before the pandemic those be the challenge that we have be leave with and the problem that we will solve 
 what guidance her department have issue to private contractor work in partnership with jobcentre plus on reimburse claimant travel cost 
 provider guidance which be publish on gov.uk make clear that contractor on all our employment programme must reimburse customer reasonable travel cost 
 i thank the minister for that response my constituent connor be in a predicament he be out of pocket for taxi fare to weekly or even twice weekly session with a jobcentre plus private contractor connor tell i that the session last barely minute and be not help he to reach his goal of become a mechanical engineering apprentice will the minister review the value of jobcentre plus private contract to both jobseeker and taxpayer 
 my hon friend be absolutely right performance be review regularly and there be customer satisfaction survey but unlike the previous government this government want to publish performance datum so that everybody can see what be go on 
 i thank the minister very much for his response i think everyone wish for claimant to be able to get job opportunity without find themselves in a financial mess due to have to pay out for travel cost when they should be reimburse this be a big issue in my constituency in northern ireland will the minister help directly those constituent who have be accordingly disadvantage 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman i be not familiar with the arrangement in northern ireland but certainly in the rest of the uk it be very clear that contractor ideally need to pay up front buy ticket and give they to the jobseeker before they embark on their journey or if not reimburse they very quickly on production of a receipt 
 what step she be take to progress the work of the child poverty taskforce 
 tackle child poverty be a top priority for the new government and a personal priority for i child can not fulfil their potential without food in their belly or a decent roof over their head and we can not fulfil our potential as a country when the talent of so many be leave behind that be why our new child poverty taskforce will drive action across every area of government to drive up family income drive down family cost and give every child the good start in life 
 i welcome the establishment of the child poverty taskforce how will the taskforce ensure that lesson include on the role of housing cost in drive up relative poverty and the necessity of growth to drive   down absolute poverty will be learn from previous attempt to drive down child poverty in wales and across the uk 
 my hon friend make a very important point about learn the lesson from the last time we be in government and lift more than child out of poverty and look at similarity and difference not least that there be more child grow up in poverty in household whether in the private rent sector or in social housing and that there be more child grow up poor in a household where somebody work get and create more good quality job and help family into those job be absolutely a crucial part of our child poverty plan 
 yet we have a situation where family with more child be impact by the child cap and the benefit cap and the government be refuse to get rid of those thing at a stroke they could lift thousand of child out of poverty and improve overnight their life chance i appreciate the fact that the government have the child poverty taskforce but that be not make a difference to these child today be it 
 i be under no illusion about the impact year of the conservatives and the social security system have have on child poverty that be why we be determined to take action across government to increase family income drive down cost and crucially put in place long term support particularly in the early year we will produce the strategy by spring i be absolutely sure that every part of the plan will lift more child out of poverty 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the level of child poverty in the last year 
 the last labour government lift child out of poverty under the conservatives the number go up by there be now more than child live in poverty in the uk in the century in of the rich country in the world that be a complete disgrace that be why the work of the child poverty taskforce which i co chair with the education secretary be so urgent and so important 
 almost a of child in the north east live in poverty the problem be particularly acute in the region will the secretary of state work with our mayor of the north east kim mcguinness on her excellent regional plan to reduce child poverty 
 yes we have already meet kim mcguinness on   september when she set out the action she be already take let i say to member on both side of the house that our strategy will be out in the spring but we will not be wait until then to act nationally we have put £ into the household support fund to help the poor family and mayor such as kim mcguinness be do amazing work they be work with school to ensure that people claim the benefit to   which they be entitle and crucially work with business to help they to do all that they can to tackle in work poverty and ensure that work family receive the money for those child 
 what step she be take to tackle carer ’s allowance overpayment 
 what step she be take to tackle carer ’s allowance overpayment 
 the work of unpaid carer be vital and often heroic and we be determined to give they the support that they need we be currently look at option for tackle the problem of overpayment include the possible introduction of a text message alert service 
 carer make incredible sacrifice to care for love one but they can be leave deep in debt as a result of repay the allowance after unintentionally breach the qualifying rule do my right hon friend agree that we as a society have a duty of care to carer and can he say more about the progress that the government be make in overhaul carer ’s allowance and address the earning cliff edge 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and i agree that we need to support carer properly we want to get to the bottom of what have go wrong with these overpayment and why so many people have be catch out we have be pilot the introduction of a text message service as i have mention which have involve texte claimant to alert they when his majesty ’s revenue and customs inform the dwp that they have breach the current earning limit we be currently look at the result and if they be positive that will be the step towards address the overpayment problem we will need to do more but it will be a good step 
 there be nearly recipient of carer ’s allowance in shipley the current earning limit leave people vulnerable to accidentally accrue overpayment if they become ineligible for the allowance and it also act as a disincentive deter people from work as much as they would like to will the government consider raise the earning limit 
 my hon friend have write to i about this matter and i welcome her commitment to make progress in an excellent piece of work the former work and pensions committee make a number of recommendation on the earning rule and once the new committee be in place we shall respond to the former committee ’s proposal 
 the minister have refer to the army of carer that we have across the country but we also have an army of unpaid carer who be be deter from apply for carer ’s allowance because of concern about the financial implication can the government reassure those who have not yet come forward that they will be support properly 
 i very much hope that we can because the hon gentleman be right there be a good deal of anxiety about these overpayment problem we hope that the alert service will at least inform people when they run into a problem so that they do not then develop a large overpayment which have happen all too often in the past but we also need to look at the other arrangement relate to carer ’s allowance in order to provide the reassurance for which the hon gentleman have rightly call 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the number of benefit sanction in the last year 
 in may the universal credit sanction rate be it reduce considerably during the pandemic gradually return to by november it then continue to rise reach a peak of in october but it be now fall with a rate of in may 
 accord to recent research by gingerbread a high percentage of sanction have be misapply to single parent not because they have not meet the job search requirement but because of miss meeting for reason connect with childcare max a bereaved single dad of have his sanction overturn which involve a fairly challenging process will my hon friend please look into the possibility of overhaul the mess of a system that be leave behind by that lot over there 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and through she i would like to thank gingerbread for its work on this issue there have always be and always will be condition attach to social security but the past year show what happen when we have a government who be more interested in blame people and create cheap headline than offer real help in our manifesto labour commit to review universal credit so that it make work pay and tackle poverty and the report that gingerbread have write will also help inform our child poverty taskforce 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be determined to put transparency at the heart of the dwp so i have today publish report that be sit on by the previous government something that my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability have long campaign for under this government ’s leadership the dwp will be honest about the problem that the country face and focus on the solution need to help people build a well life that start with our forthcoming white paper to get britain work again 
 i join waspi woman women against state pension inequality campaign in their welcome campaigning activity back in year later they be still fight for justice can the minister    assure woman in my constituency and across the country that she will act urgently unlike the previous government and bring this injustice to an end 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i meet representative of the waspi campaign before this government be elect my hon friend the minister for pensions be the minister to meet they in year it really be a serious report that require serious consideration we will do everything possible to get this issue resolve as soon as possible 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on   september day before recess i lead a debate in this chamber secure by the conservative party on the winter fuel allowance the right hon lady speak just now about transparency but there be no equality impact assessment make available for that debate indeed on   august by way of a write question my hon friend   the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans   establish that the government have no intention of publish that particular report yet on   september day after the debate and the vote and day after parliament have rise the report be make available it be clearly in my opinion deliberately withhold do the right hon lady agree 
 that be not true the conservative government do not even allow the office for budget responsibility to do an analysis of liz truss ’s disastrous mini budget and sit on publication that under their own rule should have be publish we publish an equality analysis the right hon gentleman will know that that be never do for secondary legislation when he be in government but this government will be open and transparent which be what we be already do 
 since the election numerous constituent have contact i to raise concern about the child maintenance service ’s inefficiency in collect arrear payment can the minister outline the measure be take to enhance the service ’s effectiveness in this area 
 my hon friend be entirely right to raise this issue he will be pleased to know that this government be look to utilise new power to obtain a liability order without recourse to the court reduce the time take to secure such an order from week to around 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 mr speaker may i draw your attention to a report recently publish by the university of bath which highlight that benefit claimant face a series of cliff edge if they claim additional fund if a family earn just £ they lose the ability to claim free school meal what plan do the minister have to tackle the lack of compassion in the system 
 i be not familiar with the report to which the hon member refer but we commit in our manifesto to review universal credit nearly year after it be launch the cliff edge issue and other will be among those that we will want to look at in the course of that review 
 after year of tory economic chaos and year of scottish national party public service failure as many as in child in my constituency now live in poverty last year the scottish children ’s commissioner say that the former minister nicola sturgeon have absolutely fail young people in scotland do the secretary of state agree that tackle child poverty will be a crucial part of the work of this labour government as part of the important work that she be do with the taskforce to develop a new child poverty strategy will she come to my constituency 
 order these be topical question so please can we keep they short i have to try and get through the list to help other 
 my hon friend have raise these issue with i before and i will absolutely meet child family and child poverty organisation from her constituency we aim to visit every region and every devolve nation as part of that strategy and i look forward to meet she and her constituent then 
 datum from marie curie suggest that people die in poverty every year many of they after a terminal diagnosis even with the help of the special rule system there have be report of terminally ill people face mound of red tape when try to claim benefit be the minister satisfied that the current month limit on special rule be sufficient and have she assess how the current administrative burden on terminally ill people claim benefit can be reduce 
 the hon lady raise an extremely important question which i have discuss with a hospice and other organisation such as marie curie and sue ryder in my own constituency i want to look at how the system can be make to work as quickly and swiftly as possible particularly for people at this very difficult time in life and i would be happy for the social security minister and my office to contact she directly to get more information 
 research by sense have find that none of the computer in jobcentre across britain be equip with specialist assistive technology and it have estimate that it would cost £ to ensure that every jobcentre have that specialist assistive technology will the minister commit to introduce a jobcentre assistive technology fund in order to aid disabled people in their quest to look for work 
 my hon friend be an absolute expert on this kind of inclusive change that we need to make to our employment   support system so that we can help everybody and i look forward to work with she on idea just like that when we bring forward our white paper in the autumn

 i thank the hon member for his question i have look into this issue which have a long and complex history and i would be very willing to meet he to discuss it in more detail 
 the secretary of state have today publish research paper commission but hide by the previous government which among other thing provide valuable insight into the experience of disabled people apply for personal independence payment in order to live and work independently why do the minister think the last government choose not to publish these finding 
 my hon friend ask an extremely good question the policy of the previous government be to publish all such commission research report within week of receive they that policy be comply with until when ministers stop comply with it so we have have to publish all these report today my right hon friend the secretary of state ’s announcement be a vital step in rebuild the trust in the department that be so shattered by the culture of secrecy obfuscation and cover up by conservative ministers 
 in response to several hon member ministers have speak about the complexity of the ombudsman ’s report on the waspi campaign while appreciate that may i ask for a statement in principle that the government will eventually offer significant compensation to the waspi woman 
 as i say previously the ombudsman take year to consider this complex case we be look into it very seriously but i can not make any announcement today the right hon gentleman will have to wait for our announcement on this issue 
 the government ’s propose youth guarantee will help to ensure that young people be either learn or earn of course the young person ’s guarantee be already a key commitment of the labour run welsh government can the minister assure i and my cardiff west constituent that this government will learn from the work be do in wales 
 i assure my hon friend that we will work with the welsh government welsh local authority and all our colleague across the united kingdom to get the policy right for young people who i believe have be fail over recent year it be about time they have the future they deserve 
 with employer in witham and across the country about to be whack with a barrage of high taxis thank to this government how do the government expect employment level to stay high how do they expect small business to be at the heart of any employment strategy that they claim to have 
 under the previous government we have the high taxis in year and jobcentre to which only in employer ever go to recruit we will transform our jobcentre into a new job and career service so that people get the help they need and so that employer can recruit the staff they desperately need 
 i welcome the government ’s propose fraud bill can the minister explain how it will claw back money from people who cheat the system while also protect privacy 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s support for the propose fraud bill the level of fraud in the welfare system be absolutely unacceptable almost £ be lose last year increase use of datum will be essential to clamp down on both capital fraud and broad fraud however we will do that without share any information at all with bank and financial institution 
 i thank the secretary of state for her personal commitment to transparency far to the question ask by the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend   the member for central devon mel stride will she share with the house how many thousand of people will die as a result of labour ’s choice to cut the winter fuel payment 
 i be very happy to share the datum there be more pensioner live in poverty after year of conservative government i be also very happy to publish information show a increase in pension credit claim thank to the big bold campaign run by this labour government 
 my constituent want a fair and robust welfare system but they have no truck with fraud can the secretary of state assure my constituent that she be do everything she can to crack down on fraud and to make sure that those who genuinely need help get it 
 my hon friend be correct to raise this issue as i say we will not tolerate the current level of fraud in our welfare system he will be pleased to note the prime minister ’s recent announcement of the forthcoming fraud error and debt bill which will begin the necessary work to drive down fraud in the department 
 can i share with the secretary of state the plight of my constituent who go without child maintenance payment for month that happen not because of anything do wrong by she or the pay parent or the pay parent ’s employer which process the direct deduction of earning order but because the child maintenance    service misplace the payment will the secretary of state apologise for that mishap what plan do she have to rectify that deeply flawed organisation 
 i be very sorry to hear of this case i be not familiar with it but i will look into it if the hon gentleman contact i with the detail 
 before i call the prime minister i be sure that the house will wish to reflect for a moment on the fact that this be a solemn day it mark the anniversary of the terrorist attack on israel dozen of hostage be still in captivity and the conflict have claim thousand of innocent civilian life today we should come together to remember all those who have be affect i call the prime minister 
 today we mark a year since the horrific attack on israel by the terrorist of hamas it be the bloodiest day for the jewish people since the holocaust a day of sorrow a day of grief over people be massacre with hundred take hostage in an attack bear of hatred target not just at individual but at jewish community at their way of life and at the state of israel the symbol of jewish security to the world british citizen be brutally slay that day another have since die in captivity our thought today be with the jewish people around the world the jewish community here in the united kingdom and all those we lose a year ago 
 for so many the pain and horror of that day be as acute today as it be a year ago they live it every day last week i meet the family of british hostage and those kill on   october i sit with they as they tell i about their love one i will never forget their word mandy damari speak of her love for her daughter emily she say 
 my personal clock stop at 10:24 on the of october 
 the moment when emily send a desperate unfinished message as hamas attack her kibbutz she be still hold captive today we can hardly imagine what hostage like emily be go through or what the family be go through the agony day after day so i say again the hostage must be return immediately and unconditionally they will always be uppermost in our mind i pay tribute again to the family for their incredible dignity and determination 
 today be also a day of grief for the wide region as we look back on a year of conflict and suffering the human toll among innocent civilian in gaza be truly devastating over palestinians have be kill ten of thousand orphan and almost displace face disease starvation and desperation without proper healthcare or shelter it be a live nightmare and it must end we stand with all innocent victim in israel gaza the west bank lebanon and beyond and we stand with all community here in the united kingdom against hatred of jews or muslims because any attack on a minority be an attack on our proud value of tolerance and respect and we will not stand for it 
 with the middle east close to the brink and the very real danger of a regional war last week the iranian regime choose to strike israel the whole house will join i in utterly condemn this attack we support israel ’s right to defend herself against iran ’s aggression in line with international law let we be very clear this be not a defensive action by iran it be an act of aggression and a major escalation in response to the death of a terrorist leader it expose once again iran ’s malign role   in the region it help equip hamas for the   october   attack it arm hezbollah which launch a year long barrage of rocket at northern israel force israelis to flee their home and support the houthis who mount direct attack on israel and continue to attack international shipping 
 i know the whole house will join i in thank our brave servicemen and servicewoman who have show their usual courage in counter this threat but make no mistake the region can not endure another year of this civilian on all side have suffer too much all side must now step back from the brink and find the courage of restraint there be no military solution to these challenge so we must renew our diplomatic effort together with my right hon friend the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs i have have discussion with the leader of israel lebanon jordan the palestinian authority the g7 and the european union and make the case at the united nations for political solution to end the fighting 
 in the week ahead we will continue that work focus on area the be lebanon where our immediate priority be the safety of british citizen our team be on the ground help to get people out we have already bring more than people home on charter flight and we stand ready to make additional evacuation effort as necessary i again give this important message to british citizen still in lebanon you must leave now we be also work to ease the humanitarian crisis in lebanon last week we provide £ of vital support in addition to the £ we be already provide to unicef but the situation can not go on we will continue to lead call for an immediate ceasefire and for the return to a political plan for lebanon base on security council resolution which require hezbollah to withdraw north of the litani river they must stop fire rocket and end this now so that people on both side of the border can return to their home 
 secondly we must renew effort for an immediate ceasefire in gaza but we can not simply wait for that to happen we must do more now to provide relief to the civilian population that be why we have restart aid to the united nations relief and works agency we be support field hospital and the delivery of water healthcare and treatment for malnourished child but the ongoing restriction on aid be impossible to justify israel must open more crossing and allow lifesave aid to flow crucially israel must provide a safe environment for aid worker too many have be kill include british citizen israel must act now so that together with our ally we can surge humanitarian support ahead of winter 
 thirdly we must put in place solution for the long term to break the relentless cycle of violence the ultimate goal here be well understand it must be a state solution there be no other option that offer stability and security we need to build a political route towards it so that israel be finally safe and secure alongside the long promise palestinian state that require support for the palestinian authority to step into the vacuum in gaza it require an urgent international effort to support reconstruction and it require guarantee for israel ’s security we will work with our ally and partner to that end but the key to all this remain a ceasefire in gaza now the unconditional release of the   hostage and the unhindered flow of aid that be the fundamental step to change the trajectory of the region 
 nobody in this house can truly imagine what it feel like to cower under the body of their friend hop a terrorist will not find they mere minute after dance at a music festival nobody in this house can truly imagine see their city home school hospital and business obliterate with their neighbour and family bury underneath it be beyond our comprehension and with that should come a humility it be hard even to understand the full depth of this pain but what we can do be remember what we can do be respect and listen to the voice that reach out to we at these moment and what we can do be use the power of diplomacy to try to find practical step that minimise the suffering on the ground and work towards that long term solution so that a year of such terrible and bloody conflict can never happen again that be what we have do on the labour benches it be what the whole house have do and it be what this government will continue to do i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement 
 today be the anniversary of   october this modern pogrom the bad loss of jewish life since the world war be a horrendous reminder of the antisemitism in our world and the existential threat that israel face over the past year many of the hostage kidnap by hamas on   october   have be rap sexually abuse murder and mutilate beyond recognition today a year on many still remain hold by hamas and other terrorist group i think particularly today of the british citizen emily damari who have endure a year in captivity across this house i know that we join in say bring they home 
 the situation in the middle east be grave too many innocent civilian life have be lose it be right that this country continue to play its part in defend israel against iranian attack but we should not forget the base cause of all these event iran ’s refusal to accept israel ’s right to exist and its desire to destabilise the region through arm and fund its terrorist proxy hamas hezbollah and the houthis the current conflict in lebanon be a result of hezbollah ’s determination to use this territory to launch rocket attack on israel let i be clear israel have a right to defend itself it have a right to eliminate the leadership of hezbollah and it have a right to restore security for its citizen this country should support israel in pursue those goal but can the prime minister expand on what he say about what role the united kingdom be play in provide humanitarian support to those lebanese citizen who have be displace because of this conflict i welcome his announcement on some financial support to that end 
 the medium term question that we must help to address be what happen once the israeli operation have finish i ask the prime minister to update the house on what step this country along with our ally be take   to help to build up the capacity of the lebanese state so that hezbollah can not simply re establish itself in southern lebanon we must never forget that hezbollah do not represent the interest of lebanon or its citizen it represent those of its paymaster in tehran 
 turn to the situation of british national in lebanon i know that the government have rightly be urge they to leave for some time now but it be clear that difficulty in obtain ticket on commercial flight mean that a number of our citizen be still there i welcome the government ’s chartering of plane to help british national to return home and know very well the logistical challenge involve i pay tribute to all the foreign office and other team who will be work hard to make sure that that happen can the prime minister assure the house that any british national who wish to leave lebanon will be able to do so on a government charter flight 
 turn next to the prime minister ’s speech at the un general assembly which he mention i fully endorse his reaffirmation that the united kingdom will stand with ukraine for as long as it take event in the middle east and indeed ukraine be another reminder that the world be increasingly become more dangerous if we wish to be able to continue to deter our enemy defend our value and stand up for our interest we will need to invest more in our military the prime minister and i have discuss previously my view that we should increase defence spending to of gdp by and in our previous exchange in this house he have say that a trajectory for future defence spending would be set out at the come fiscal event i ask that he reconfirm his commitment to that timetable 
 on this sad anniversary i finish by say that the united kingdom stand with israel against this terrorism today tomorrow and always i say to the jewish community here in britain that i know that at moment like this when the jewish people be under attack in their homeland jewish people everywhere can feel less safe i know that the prime minister will agree with i that across this house we will always stand against the evil of antisemitism 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for his word on an occasion like this it be important that we speak with voice across the house and i think the whole house will agree with he that we must bring the hostage home they must be uppermost in our mind 
 the leader of the opposition ask about the assistance in lebanon humanitarian assistance be be provide aid and money as well as training as he will know and we be work towards the security council resolution 
 on evacuation we will make sure that any british national have the assistance they need to come home i repeat that now be the time to leave if any british national require assistance i ask they please to make contact with we so that we can provide it 
 in relation to defence spending let i recommit to increase it to we will set out our plan in due course but the most important thing today be for this house to do as it be do speak with voice on the year anniversary of an awful terrorist attack 
 i call the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs 
 on this anniversary the house unite in its condemnation of the murder of more than israeli citizen and make a united call for the release of hostage parliament also stand behind a belief in the rule base international order a belief that all civilian life be equal and must be protect today we mark a year during which more than palestinians have be kill in gaza people have be kill in the west bank and more than people have be kill in lebanon will the prime minister confirm that all british action in the middle east will be guide by the principle of de escalation peace and diplomacy and the protection of all civilian life 
 i thank my right hon friend for that question particularly her word about all civilian life be equal and protect i confirm that everything that we be do be aim at de escalating across the region it be on the brink and it be important for all side to pull back from the brink that be why we have be work so closely with our ally in the g7 on de escalation speak with voice 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement 
 on the anniversary of the horrific attack in israel we remember the victim the people take hostage and their family and we stand with the whole jewish community early this year i visit israel and palestine and see how both people be experience trauma we must never forget the trauma of the hostage and their family in tel aviv i meet itzik horn a father still pray for his son yair and eitan to come home we must urge all actor to take the step most likely to get the hostage home quickly and safely 
 the past year have see terrible violence in the middle east a humanitarian catastrophe in gaza and an appalling spike in hate crime here in the uk we must stand firm against antisemitism and islamophobia we must press for an immediate bilateral ceasefire to end the terrible cycle of violence and bring about last peace and security for both israelis and palestinians and we must do all we can to prevent a regional war in the middle east uk force rightly play their part in help israel to neutralise iran ’s outrageous attack and i hope that the government will now try to convince israel that keep her citizen safe and secure be well achieve by restraint not retaliation and the risk of a regional war as we do that let we take a tough stance on iran and all her proxy from hezbollah to the houthis will the prime minister finally proscribe iran ’s islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 we be horrify by the new crisis unfolding in lebanon will the government go far on humanitarian aid most importantly we join the prime minister in call for the cessation of rocket fire the protection of civilian and an immediate bilateral ceasefire just like the that we so desperately need in gaza 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for those question i absolutely agree with he in relation to the hostage family when i sit with they we often sit in silence because they could not find the   word to describe what they be go through i also agree with what he say about hate crime the message and the messaging be very much de escalation across the region he be right that we need to deal with state threat include the irgc we be work at pace to identify further way to deal with such threat include those from the irgc more than sanction designation against iranian organisation and individual be already in place and we continue to look at that important issue 
 i associate myself with the remark of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in condemn that horrific attack year ago yesterday at church during bidding prayer we pray about the conflict in the middle east and elsewhere my thought remain with those love one who be still displace a year on 
 sadly the united nations have report credible evidence of sexual violence against innocent civilian on both side of the conflict no matter the intensity of the situation there can be no justification for sexual violence which leave victim traumatise for many year what step be the government take to raise that issue and ensure that innocent civilian across the middle east be protect from the horror of sexual violence 
 my hon friend raise an important point about sexual violence which as she rightly say have absolutely no justification along with other issue we continue to raise any such allegation with our ally 
 i call the father of the house 
 there be many different opinion on policy in the middle east but do the prime minister agree that what must surely unite everyone in this house be our profound detestation of antisemitism in all its shape and force as well as our profound love for the jewish people on their day of suffering especially as many of those who be murder at the music festival and in the kibbutz be actively work for peace will he reflect that there be still many people many jewish and arab people who want a moderate solution and that we should give they our support 
 i agree wholeheartedly with the right hon gentleman on antisemitism and on our love for and on stand with the jewish people both across the globe and here in the united kingdom many of they want nothing more than peace and security for themselves and their family and we will continue to work with they i agree with his remark and the sentiment behind they 
 i very much agree with my right hon and learn friend ’s comment about the need for all side to work towards a state solution do he therefore understand the wide concern at the israeli prime minister say repeatedly in recent week that he do not support a state solution either now or in the future do my right hon and learn friend understand the frustration and anger that that create among many palestinians particularly young one and that it breed a climate in which hostility and violence be likely to increase rather than decrease what can he do to change the israeli prime minister ’s mind 
 we have to be very clear that the state solution be the only viable long term route through this conflict recognition have to be a question of when not if israel have a right to be safe and secure it be not and we must have a viable palestinian state however difficult that may seem at the moment we must never lose sight of that be in the end the only political solution to this awful conflict 
 we be a year on from when jewish people be systematically murder those who be woman be rap and mutilate be take hostage into gaza and remain unaccounted for i agree with the prime minister that we need to make sure the hostage be return immediately but the aspect of that be ensure that the international committee of the red cross have access to all those hostage in order to assess their state of health and indeed whether they be still alive will the prime minister press for that to make sure that we know how many be still alive and can be return to their family for those who have sadly be murder at least their family will know what have happen to they 
 yes that be very important when spend any time with the family you get a real sense of the agony they be go through which be make even bad by the fact that they do not have any meaningful information about their love one i agree with the hon gentleman that be an essential step to at least reduce some of the agony 
 we in my constituency stand today with our neighbour sharone in say the name of her father oded lifschitz a proud peace activist who have be hold by hamas for over a year now we stand with our palestinian neighbour who be able to escape from gaza who now fear for their relative and what harm may befall they we stand with our neighbour try to get out of lebanon where he be try to support local child to learn we reject the lazy stereotype in this conflict that we have to pick a side we pick peace and we simply ask the prime minister to do and show the same so what reassurance can my right hon and learn friend give i and my constituent today that everything that the british have in fighting for the rule of law in diplomacy and even in our work on arm sale will be dedicate towards peace and resolution for the innocent civilian in these region 
 i thank my hon friend for her question which be a reminder of the impact that the conflict be have on so many of our community here in the united kingdom we be absolutely work with our ally on de escalating across the region that require iran to take responsibility and be hold accountable for what it be do which be why in my view it be important for the g7 to speak so powerfully together with a co ordinated and collaborative approach 
 today be a devastating and sobering day for those who be suffer the pain of grief it feel that the claw be be run over those wound again we have now see escalation in the region something that this house   warn about for month before this point it be clear now than ever that when the ember finally die down and we can start to rebuild the palestinian question must be the no priority on the prime minister ’s list and those of other world leader not because it be the right thing to do but because it be a security concern that we must address if we want a safe world do he agree that we now need to show unprecedented level of leadership what be he do personally to add to that 
 i thank the hon lady for her question as ever she speak powerfully on this issue i completely agree that the only way through in the long term be the state solution to answer her question directly we be work non stop with our ally on that question answer what happen next and never lose sight of the fact that the state solution be the only way to long last peace we will continue in those effort which i know have the support of the house it be so important that we continue to do so and we will 
 the prime minister rightly say we need a ceasefire now but after a year and over death what more can he do to achieve that ceasefire while the violence in the region continue will he ask the foreign secretary and the home secretary to look sympathetically at request for evacuation from dependant and close relative of uk citizen 
 on the question of a ceasefire we be continue to work with ally to bring that ceasefire about and to co ordinate our effort i recognise that diplomacy be sometimes slow but it be in the end the only way to bring about that ceasefire and we will continue with it in relation to british citizen in lebanon we do have a plan in place if anybody across the house have any detail of our citizen who need further assistance i would genuinely be pleased if they pass they to i so we can action that straightaway 
 on the anniversary of the terrorist attack last year may i echo the sentiment of the prime minister in condemn hamas in support our jewish community and of course in call for the release of all the hostage i share his concern about the malign influence of iran in that regard can he confirm to the house that there will be no british involvement be that personnel facility or airbase in any israeli response to its abhorrent attack last week 
 i thank the right hon member for his question as he will understand i will not go into detail on the floor of the house as to our capability but he will know that the involvement so far for example in relation to the attack in april relate to israel ’s self defence when missile be rain in on israel that be the support that we do provide and would always be prepare to provide 
 today as we remember all those kill in the   october   hamas attack and all those kill day after day in israel ’s war on gaza and now lebanon the case for peace the preservation of human life and the protection of human   life have never be more urgent and compelling an immediate ceasefire be desperately need to stop all the killing end the war crime free the hostage and get aid into gaza however it be clear that israel ’s right wing political leader will keep reject ceasefire and keep violate international law without strong international pressure to get israeli leader to back a ceasefire do we not need to see tough action include an end to all arm sale as recent international court ruling demand 
 i completely agree that we need an immediate ceasefire that be what we be work for and what the us be lead on i do not agree with a complete ban on arm sale that would include a ban on arm be use for defensive purpose look at the attack of only a few day ago by iran i think the house will understand my position on this and the position of many across the house 
 the prime minister have rightly speak about the significance of diplomacy right now and i think the entire house would agree that across the region itself leader must come together what discussion have the prime minister have with gulf co operation council leader about the behaviour the aggressive behaviour of their neighbour iran and what role they can play in de escalation and prevent iran from far escalate this terrible conflict 
 i thank the right hon member for that question this be a really important issue we have have numerous discussion with our colleague and with leader and i do think there be an important role that can be play and pressure that can be apply through those discussion we will continue to do so so i thank she for her question 
 among those kill in the horror of   october   be child with a number still hold hostage to this day in gaza since then there be a grisly new acronym wcnsf wound child no survive family to add to the child death toll which be now rise in lebanon as well will my right hon and learn friend press for the protection of child in advocate for a ceasefire and in his humanitarian effort and do he agree that no parent should ever have to bury their child 
 i absolutely agree with that whether it be child take as hostage it hardly seem possible to say that sentence without recoiling or those orphan in gaza as my hon friend rightly suggest 
 i appreciate that it be difficult to get into the mind of a theocratic regime such as that of the ayatollah in iran but to what extent have the government be able to establish whether a principal motivation for what happen on   october   be the desire of the iranian regime to prevent a rapprochement between israel and saudi arabia its great rival 
 iran bear huge responsibility across the region both in its assistance in relation to the   october   attack and through the other action that it be   support in the region that be why we have be clear in our positioning on iran and clear about the responsibility that iran bear in relation to those awful incident 
 on the anniversary of the horrific   october   attack i again repeat the call for the immediate release of all hostage in light of israel ’s genocidal assault in gaza the violence in the west bank and the invasion of lebanon do the prime minister believe that israel ’s right to self defence justifie a death toll that accord to research by us medical professional who have work in gaza have now surpass as well as the people kill in lebanon will he do what be morally and legally right and end the government ’s complicity in war crime by ban all arm sale to israel include the f-35 fighter jet and not just licence yes or no 
 no but it be a really serious point ban all sale would mean none for defensive purpose 
 f-35 fighter jet 
 it would mean none for defensive purpose on the anniversary of   october   and day after a huge attack by iran into israel that would be the wrong position for this government and i will not take it 
 the prime minister have rightly point out that the conflict in the middle east have be manipulate and sponsor by the iranian regime we should stand by israel which be bear the burden take the risk and stand up to world opinion in take on iran and its proxy terrorist group what part can our government play in put pressure on the iranian regime and why be it that the revolutionary guard who be sponsor much of this terrorism can still operate freely in london 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman that we must stand by israel and be absolutely clear about israel ’s right to defend herself particularly at this time of escalation by iran on the iranian regime we have to be really clear that we stand with israel and clear in condemn iran and we have to do that with our ally with voice so that the message be hear very powerfully 
 may i associate myself with the condemnation of the atrocity commit by hamas a year ago that say there be a grow humanitarian crisis in gaza and the restriction on aid be unacceptable what more can the international community do to achieve the free movement of aid into gaza 
 i address that in my statement we need to get more humanitarian aid in it be desperately need and have be need for a very long time that be why we continue to press for that aid to go in and for the protection to go in for those who will be deliver it once the aid get into gaza as be desperately need 
 since the barbaric attack on   october we have see an explosion in antisemitism and extremism on the street of our own country only on saturday we see people flagrantly valorise hezbollah in london we must root out   those who despise our country and our value what will the prime minister do to revoke the visa where appropriate of those in the uk who be conduct themselves in this manner to encourage the police to enforce our exist law without fear or favour and to far ban and proscribe organisation such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps which do not support the uk our value and the way we wish to conduct ourselves in the world 
 we be proud of the democratic right to protest in this country but support a proscribe terrorist group be unacceptable and we need to be very clear about that and give the police our full support in take the action they need to take in relation to that wherever it be in the united kingdom 
 as we mark the anniversary of the horrific hamas attack the subsequent colossal death and destruction and the ensue escalation in the region we should say for anybody in any doubt in the country that iran be no friend of ours indeed it be dislike by many of its neighbouring arab nation for its destabilising activity in the region it be abundantly clear to many of we that as soon iran come to the aid of its proxy hezbollah israel ’s ally would come to its aid to protect it from iranian missile however it be extremely frustrating that prime minister netanyahu continue to ignore the international community and the un security council resolution our own prime minister be of the to call for an immediate ceasefire between lebanon and israel and this uk parliament vote month ago for an immediate ceasefire in gaza how exactly will the uk government help to bring all side to the negotiating table and secure peace 
 my hon friend ’s comment about iran be absolutely right we must stand with israel in the face of the attack wherever they come from and wherever they be sponsor in direct answer to his question we be work with our ally on de escalation we be work with the us in particular on its plan for a ceasefire because it be only through a ceasefire that we can create the space for the hostage to be safely release for the aid to get into the region and for a foot in the door for a political state solution which be the only way to last peace 
 the prime minister speak rightly of the fact that we can barely imagine the pain of the israeli family and those in gaza affect over the past year since that hamas atrocity but it be also a pain feel acutely in our own community by our jewish community and by our muslim community we have have antisemitic attack in this country since that atrocity a record number so what will the prime minister do to reassure the jewish and muslim community and to work with the community security trust and tell mama to strengthen their bond 
 the hon lady raise an important point we have up the support to community as a result of the dreadful rise in hate crime in all its manifestation in the past year or so and we will continue to do so i know we will have the support of the house in do so 
 today be a day of mourning for all those who lose family member on   october   and those hostage in the tunnel lose since then and for all those civilian in gaza the west bank and now in lebanon like the prime minister i have be meet hostage family all this past year the only time hostage get release be when there be a hostage prisoner deal on   november   last year and some prisoner and hostage be release have the prime ministers speak to the israeli government about another deal to allow the hostage to be release through swap they with political prisoner hold in israeli jail 
 i accept my hon friend ’s point that it be through a cessation of hostility that the space can be create for the release of hostage yes of course we talk to leader include in israel the whole time about how that can be bring about it be the central focus of all our discussion with israel and with our ally 
 it be vital that today and every day we remember every life lose at the hand of hamas a year ago and every life lose in captivity since and that we renew our call for the release of every hostage while i totally agree with the prime minister when he say that israel must have that right to defend herself some of the decision he have take have lead to a feeling that the government have step back their support for israel not least in the restoration of funding to the united nations relief and works agency do the prime minister regret that and will he revisit that decision so that action marry up with word 
 no there have be no step back of support for israel we have be absolutely robust in that support i have express it many time in different place include to the prime minister of israel we will continue to support israel and we will continue to support israel ’s right to defend herself the house be at its good when it speak with once voice 
 it have be a year of profound suffering darkness and trauma ten of thousand of innocent people have be kill and displace yet the world have learn nothing the prospect of a state solution be a distant dream and the odd on all out war in the middle east be grow by the day the unimaginable devastation have to stop the only hope be a diplomatic solution will the prime minister assure i that the government be do everything in their power to bring about an immediate and permanent ceasefire across the region 
 yes and we be not do it alone we be work with our ally in relation to it last week i speak to g7 ally about it and we speak constantly to the us about it because we need to de escalate across the region we have see escalation in recent day and week and all side need to pull back from the brink 
 on behalf of the green party i associate myself with the remark make by the prime minister and other in the house in remembrance of all those who lose their life and be take hostage in the horrific terrorist attack on   october    last year of those be hayim katsman who be murder by hamas in kibbutz holit his brother noy have his word include in a collection of speech and eulogy publish today by stand together noy say this of hayim 
 i have no doubt that even in the face of hamas people that murder he in the face of their extreme right wing belief he would still call out against killing and violence of innocent people here too he would be empathetic to pain and oppression 
 those be powerful word in that spirit i express my continued and deep concern at the disproportionate response of israel to the attack on   october   and the extent to which that have perpetuate pain oppression and the killing of innocent people in recent day that response have result in an escalation of deadly violence i welcome the prime minister ’s word about commitment to de escalation do he agree that an urgent ceasefire both between israel and hezbollah and in gaza be essential to resolve the conflict 
 the hon member read out some powerful word which will have be hear across the house yes de escalation be absolutely need at the moment as the region stand on the brink 
 mr speaker may i associate myself with your word and those of the prime minister in open his statement in any time of conflict our focus must be on thing de escalation and peace and the plight of the civilian population whether they be those hostage kidnap on   october those in lebanon now shelter in the street or those in gaza who seek to find health facility to treat their love one and themselves when they suffer from attack by israel what more can we do to support the health service in lebanon which be now on its knee and really need our support if it be to help the people of lebanon 
 we do need to help and assist with the health service in lebanon along with the other humanitarian support and the support for training and other matter that we be put in it be so important that we do that we be in constant contact with the lebanese authority in relation to that 
 many of we have be fortunate enough to see the good work that unrwa have do on the ground over many year but to be effective an aid delivery vehicle need to be rigorously impartial give that will the government treat unrwa with caution and carefully and remember that other aid delivery agency be available 
 we of course have to be careful to ensure that any agency absolutely complie with international law and where there be any allegation we must ensure that they be properly investigate and any wrongdoing be root out we do have to provide or help to provide aid across the region but that be caveate by the part of my statement in relation to the point that the right hon gentleman rightly raise 
 i wish to put on the record my sorrow at the appallingly violent event of   october   year ago in southern israel and at all the day of violence we have   witness since since the house last meet the forced displacement of almost resident of gaza by israel ’s military action have be compound by a further half a people forcibly displace in lebanon again by israeli military action do the prime minister share the concern of the united nations high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi that in destroy civilian infrastructure kill civilian and impact humanitarian operation the israeli invasion be a breach of international law what further step will the prime minister take to enforce a ceasefire 
 i be not go to accept invitation to agree with other people ’s assessment i will make my own i have be absolutely clear that israel have the right to defend herself in accordance with international law the displacement be a very serious issue across the region very many people have be displace and many of they simply want to go home that include israelis who have be displace from their home as well that be why we need to de escalate to ensure that those displace can return back and live safely in their own community 
 in just month iran will be free of many of the restriction under the joint comprehensive plan of action on its production of centrifuge and its uranium enrichment give the new nexus of evil of north korea iran and russia on nuclear technology transfer do the prime minister believe the jcpoa be still fit for purpose 
 the right hon gentleman raise a really important point in relation to the nuclear ambition that we absolutely have to be alive to we must ensure that iran can not possibly get weapon the sanction and the regime around they must be gear towards that central issue
