i welcome my hon friend to her place she and i be involve in young labour together only a few year ago i feel so it be great to see she finally in this place where she belong she raise the important matter of nhs dentistry and the difficulty that people have get an nhs appointment which be particularly acute in norfolk that be why the government be commit to a rescue plan and to provide another nhs dentist appointment which i hope will relieve that acuteness in norfolk 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i congratulate you on your election and welcome you to the chair although it feel a bit weird to welcome anyone here give that i have be here for about minute i follow on from the excellent contribution make by my hon friend the members for poole neil duncan jordan for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray among other i praise in   particular my hon friend for edinburgh east and musselburgh both because he give an excellent speech and because his mum be of my constituent 
 as i start this new job i have be think a lot about my family i be do so while prepare my remark today i be think in particular of my grandpa who be a coalminer in the coalfield of lanarkshire just outside glasgow when i be a wee boy he would tell i of the condition that he work in darkness he say so black that you could hold your hand right in front of your eye and still not be able to see it in that darkness he would toil away unable to imagine his own future let alone that of his grandwean as he would say all the while he toil he be inhale fume so toxic that later in life he would have lung cancer and live the rest of his life with just lung 
 my dad a welder be here today off during the glasgow fair along with my mum who run her own business to watch i from the gallery my career so far have be very different from that of my parent and grandparent for a start they have a proper job whereas i be now do this for a living but it have be different for related reason the be the labour party both in the sense that it have help to provide i with a new job and in the protection that it have deliver for work people health and safety legislation deliver by labour and build by the trade union movement have end the kind of condition that my grandparent work in the reason my career have be different be technology i suspect that today in britain there be more bitcoin miner than coalminer and that be ultimately a good thing coalmining be difficult hard laborious work 
 as a kid i spend many long hour in front of my computer and while much of that be spend play fifa against my wee brother mark some of it be more productive because i teach myself to code i watch youtube video and over week month and year i learn how to build software i develop iphone app that be use around the world mean that code write on my laptop in glasgow could be push out to device around the world in second and that this year old kid in his childhood bedroom could run an app servicing people from los angeles to dubai 
 if it can do that technology can reform our public service too technology might even help to reform this house as we be debate today i hope and know that high growth innovative business in my home city of glasgow will be a key part of that 
 much have be say and write about glasgow over the year but thing stick with i in particular anthony bourdain be not a man know for his parliamentary language so let we just say that he describe glasgow as the most unpretentious place on earth an antidote to the world in his word 
 so unapologetically work class and attitude free 
 i think he be right because of all the thing i love about glasgow it be our people and our humour that i enjoy most if someone ever get a wee bit too big for their boot return home to glasgow will soon put an end to that something i be sure will be increasingly useful the long i spend in this place 
 unlike many glaswegians my admiration even extend to some of glasgow ’s politician it be customary in speech such as this to praise our predecessor but i know that for some that will be do through slightly   gritted tooth at the end of a long and bitter fought election campaign in my case i talk about my predecessor with genuine warmth and admiration stewart mcdonald serve the people of glasgow south diligently and build an enviable reputation in this place he be particularly respect for his long stand support for the people of ukraine something that see he award the ukrainian order of merit if i leave this place have do half as much as he do for people around the world fight for democracy i will leave a happy man 
 before stewart there be labour predecessor there be tom harris who have be personally kind to i john maxton now lord maxton whose son teach i modern study in high school believe it or not although i will leave it up to other to decide whether he do a good or bad job of that and of course teddy taylor who be still remember fondly by many of my constituent 
 i would also like to mention other member of this house who have a big impact on my life both from glasgow the former member for east kilbride adam ingram grow up in the east end of glasgow and be of the people i ever speak to in the labour party his advice and wise counsel have be a constant source of support to i over the year and i be incredibly grateful the other be a southsider my friend and the former member for glasgow central anas sarwar i have the great privilege of serve as the director of anas ’s successful leadership campaign to become leader of scottish labour and a half year ago as we sit begin that campaign it be hard to imagine what the future might hold but even in our most optimistic of moment i do not think we would have predict this i stand here as of scottish labour mps 
 have praise glaswegians i will do something unusual for a glasgow mp and praise someone from edinburgh my right hon friend   the member for edinburgh south ian murray   have be a friend of mine for many year and he deserve enormous credit for his long and lonely shift as the sole scottish labour mp and for be someone who recognise that the labour party have to change if it be to earn people ’s trust once again it give i enormous pleasure and pride to see he in his rightful place as the secretary of state for scotland 
 that brief interlude aside we return to scotland ’s real capital city i be privileged to represent glasgow ’s southside a place that have have something of a renaissance in recent year boast the trendy tenement of shawlands the tree line avenue of newlands and the beautiful conservation village of carmunnock among other my constituency contain many of glasgow ’s beautiful park of which linn park queen ’s park and pollok country park be just a few in the latter hon member will find the burrell collection which be award the art fund ’s museum of the year award after its reopening last year 
 like many part of the city however we be not without difficulty castlemilk be an area with enormous spirit and the kind people anyone will ever meet but it also remain an area with challenge even today the simple act of get a supermarket in castlemilk have prove difficult something i hope i hope to change as local mp 
 what be true of all my constituency be that it be an outward look diverse and welcome place the scots asian community in particular have contribute   enormously to glasgow ’s character and i be very proud to represent they here in parliament immigration have make my constituency rich and it make our country rich too the southside of glasgow be also a passionately pro european place although brexit be settle in the previous parliament i intend to support the government ’s move to repair our relationship with europe 
 my duty be to my constituency and my country be the member of parliament for glasgow south be the only job that i will do so long as the people of glasgow south wish for i to continue but i also feel a sense of responsibility towards the many million of people at home and around the world who do not have a voice the people toil away in darkness just as my grandpa do all those year ago i hope that none of we in this house forget the million indeed billion of people around the world who be not as lucky as we include those face persecution or war those without access to clean water or a good education and those bind by modern slavery i be of the lucky few to serve in this place but i will never forget the people who put i here and the people who do not have a voice deliver for they will be how i judge my success 
 let i thank my hon friend and his family for walk across the country to raise awareness of child poverty during the pandemic 
 the government recognise the disruption to education cause by the pandemic and the different access to online learning and it equipment we be commit to learn lesson from the past and make improvement for the future in the immediate term the government have invest in deliver nationwide gigabyte connectivity as soon as possible we be invest £ as part of this project to ensure that the hard to reach area across the uk such as my hon friend ’s constituency receive coverage 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to speak let i say congratulation and welcome to your place 
 i have be move and inspire by so many contribution over the past few day and it be an immense privilege to be make the maiden speech of today i also offer my good wish to   the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer who will also be make his maiden speech today not only be he my neighbour but he be represent a place that be really close to my heart 
 i be incredibly proud to be make my maiden speech as the new member of parliament for ipswich however this be not my contribution in this house yesterday i ask a question at pmq highlight the huge potential that ipswich possess but say that after year of neglect we desperately need government support to help revive our town centre 
 however corner of social medium instead focus on a very gentle joke i have make when i point out that my home county of suffolk once again have a premier league football team unlike our friend north of the border in norfolk keyboard warrior in particular take umbrage at that his name be ed balls and apparently he use to work here he say that norwich have have a year unbeaten run in the old farm derby a run that will now sadly be extend due to ipswich be promote to the premier league and norwich get knock out in the play off last season i be sure that that will be a bitter pill for town fan to swallow as they visit anfield the tottenham hotspur stadium the etihad and old trafford next season ed ’s tweet also represent my most significant celebrity beef on social medium since steve brookstein yes the winner of the x factor nearly a decade ago 
 ipswich have a rich and long history so rich and long in fact that i be go to use this as an opportunity to settle an old score now that colchester have vacate its town status i be lay claim to ipswich be the old continuous town in england no i have not check that with the house of commons library as i might have be give an answer that i do not want to hear but minute of search online tell i that i have a decent chance of be right and i presume that as i be now state it as fact in parliament it now become true 
 thomas wolsey be arguably ipswich ’s most famous son and we in ipswich have be celebrate his legacy throughout the past year through the wolsey wolsey do not always get the praise he deserve climb the greasy pole will not win you many friend something to which member of this house will attest i be sure however his story rise from humble beginning to become of the most powerful statesman in england be remarkable and he leave his imprint on our town too 
 ipswich can also lay claim to ralph fiennes constance andrews thomas gainsborough jean ingelow brian eno edith cook and even richard ayoade to name but a few my job over the come year will be ensure that kid grow up in ipswich today get their chance to make their dream a reality so that when my successor come to make their maiden speech they have a few more name to mention too 
 i would also like to mention my predecessor tom hunt while an mp tom often speak about be neurodiverse and be open about challenge that he face grow up he look to tackle some of the stigma that still exist and that be an incredibly powerful thing for a member of parliament to do on election night tom charitably mention our share commitment to improve the life of child with special educational need and disability an issue that i have campaign on for many year in suffolk i will now use my role to fight for those family here in westminster 
 the send crisis be a national issue and i know many colleague from across the house will have hear countless story about the struggle that family have have to endure to access the service that should be theirs in suffolk we have have a decade of the most grotesque and repeat failure i remember year ago after another damn report the front page of our local paper the east anglian daily times show the face of just some of the child and family who have be so badly fail by a broken system with the heartbreaking desperate headline we must be hear 
 as itv ’s report show today so little have change half a decade later those child and their family have still not be hear this be not just about the educational impact on child immense though they may be it be also about the exhaustion desperation and isolation that family suffer day in day out the month year even battle for an education health and care plan the time spend wait by the phone or check email hop that they might finally get some positive news and the energy they have to find just to try to navigate this broken system fight through tribunal and submit mountain upon mountain of new documentation and information all while try to care for their family 
 as a labour government we can not let the suffering of vulnerable child and their family continue it will be my personal mission in this place to fight this inequality   and injustice if i can make final plea on this issue as a former teaching assistant and proud gmb mp i urge that when we talk about the crisis in retention and recruitment of teacher we include specialist and support staff in the conversation they be crucial to break down barrier to opportunity too 
 i would like to touch on another subject that be incredibly important to i the energy transition this be not just an environmental necessity but an economic imperative it can boost our economy reduce bill ensure great security and deliver the well pay job that we need with gb energy we will be able to achieve that if britain be to become a world leader in this area as the labour party have pledge i want ipswich and suffolk to be right at the heart of this national renewal why should we not be over the come year thousand of job will be create in new nuclear at sizewell in offshore wind and in solar i be unapologetically ambitious for our town and our county i do not want those job and that investment to drift away elsewhere i want kid grow up in ipswich or people look to retrain and upskill to get those secure well pay job i want local business to benefit from the billion of pound that will flow out of these project and i want our area to be the centre of national excellence that be our future if we be brave enough to grasp it 
 as a labour and co operative member of parliament it be particularly welcome to i that our commitment to community energy sit at the very heart of this mission the great ever expansion of community energy project deliver a new owner of energy will be genuinely transformational and as a proud co operative party mp i will champion the growth of such project so that local people will benefit from our green transition too 
 many of we be just a few week into our new role and as this debate be about job i will be honest in my contribution and say that i have no idea why or how any member of parliament would have a job we all know what i be talk about to be the member of parliament for ipswich be the great privilege of my life but to be frank it be not like any other job i think about ipswich and its beautiful award win park its waterfront look absolutely glorious on a sunny day the music festival that we have now which i would have love to have be to as a teenager i be only slightly old now than i be then and the fact that our town once again have a premier league football club i might have mention that already 
 i think about suffolk too the place i move to year ago i still hang out with my friend from debenham high school i still play for the same cricket club the mighty eye and district cricket club my batting just as terrible and my bowling just as slow if not slow i still want to walk around fram castle and along the beach of southwold aldeburgh and dunwich i still pop into coes a family business found nearly year ago and i love nothing well than eat at the lighthouse restaurant or drink an adnams or an aspall in the woolpack or the greyhound i be still surround by my friend here my family and my neighbour not to mention a happy memory have be shape and inspire by they for nearly a quarter of a century i have no doubt that i will make some mistake along the way and i know that there will be some time when my constituent disagree with i but know that everything that i do here will be out of service friendship and love for my home ipswich and suffolk 
 i join other in welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker thank you for give i the chance to make my maiden speech and to contribute to this important debate on job speak for the people of spelthorne i pay tribute to all member who have make their maiden speech in particular my immediate predecessor   the hon member for ipswich jack abbott he be clearly go to be a fearsome and fearless advocate for his constituent base purely on the fact that he be prepared to risk the opprobrium of the people of colchester the people of norwich and perhaps most impressively of all mr ed balls i congratulate he 
 i thank the house staff for the impeccable welcome that they give we all as new member i be for quite a long time a soldier so i be bring up on the mantra that minute early be minute late it be therefore no surprise that at minute to on the monday after the election i be the in the queue at the top of the ramp i see armed police officer but there be also a doorkeeper resplendent in his uniform of morning coat and gold badge and his beard not know what to expect i approach he he say good morning mr jopp i be beyond impressed he continue you might not recognise i under this beard sir but i ’m matt and i be with you in the scots guards in afghanistan i go from be impressed to be deeply touch 
 have have the chance to listen to a large number of maiden speech i have notice that when the name of the member and their constituency flash up on the screen that be sometimes meet with a knowing smile and sometimes not depend on the name of the seat it be like that excellent episode of yes prime minister when jim hacker and sir humphrey appleby start discuss somewhere call st george ’s island both of they suggest that they have some form of superior insight into st george ’s island but it quickly become apparent that neither of they have any idea where on earth it be lest my maiden speech become something like that i think that i ought to tell the house where spelthorne be 
 spelthorne be everything south of heathrow airport until the thames we be in the administrative county of surrey and the historic county of middlesex we be inside the m25 but not in london crazily you can use an oyster card to take a london bus there but not the train we be outside the clutch of the mayor of london ’s dread ultra low emission zone charge but accord to the church of england we report to the bishop of kensington hon member might think that all those special circumstance would give rise to something of an identity crisis for the people of spelthorne but not a bit of it because no who live there actually call it spelthorne anyway instead people say they live in staines stanwell or stanwell moor in ashford shepperton or laleham in halliford charlton village or sunbury 
 by the way all hon member sit in parliament today be here thank to a notable resident of stanwell thomas later lord knyvet it be he whom the king   dispatch to search the cellar beneath parliament result in the capture of the treacherous gunpowder plotter clearly lord knyvet ’s ability to navigate this place be a great deal well than mine 
 i pay full tribute to my immediate predecessor as member of parliament for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng who have represent the constituency since hon member will not be surprised to hear that his name come up frequently on the doorstep in the last general election kwasi be a much respect back bencher and minister as well as be a charismatic performer in this chamber a strong advocate for small business in spelthorne he instigate the spelthorne business plan competition now in its year 
 spelthorne people be some of the hard work people in the country so it be appropriate that i should be make this speech in a debate on job many of my constituent have they i too have have a selection of job as a friend of mine recently remark blimey lincoln year in the army and year in private equity where do you see more violence now i be in parliament with the huge honour of represent the people of spelthorne and i be strike by just how important that be particularly at the moment i be sure that all member want to be a strong voice for their constituent and a local champion for their area and i do too passionately 
 however we be also here to fulfil our job to make thoughtful contribution to the national and international debate on issue of great moment none of which be more important in my view than the defence of the realm give that the world be the most dangerous it have be since the end of the cold war we be have a defence review which will take time but time may be run out and the right course of action increase defence expenditure be all too clear now let alone in month time when the review report i gently suggest to all member of this house that to govern may be to choose but it be also to act and that the answer to autocracy be rarely more bureaucracy 
 to finish on a light note i hope that hon member now know a little bit more about spelthorne they be welcome to visit any time whether to hear about the work of bp ’s global technology centre as it seek to decarbonise the world or to see the large film studio in europe and the big in the world after hollywood they might instead be interested in a flutter on the horse at kempton park not that we on the conservative side of the house be allow to bet any more or maybe just to potter along the thames like men in a boat 
 madam deputy speaker i say i would finish and i do not make promise i can not keep i make promise to the people of spelthorne it be that if they elect i we would move to the constituency thank solely to the effort of my amazing wife caroline we pick up the key to our new home in spelthorne on tuesday and will have move there by the end of the weekend that be the promise i have keep to the people of spelthorne i look forward as i serve they to there be many more 
 thank you madam deputy speaker it be a real privilege to make my maiden speech with you in the chair and a delight to follow   the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp   and my hon friend   the member for ipswich jack abbott i can not promise that my speech will be as witty as theirs but i do support a proper premier league team in manchester united—[interruption i have lose the house already 
 it be an honour to make my maiden speech in this house as the very proud mp for my home town telford be where i be bear and raise and where i be now bring up my own family i be telford and proud i begin by talk about those mp i follow my predecessor lucy allan work on many notable cause i particularly pay tribute to her tireless work in respect of the post office scandal and to her constituency team who have support the resident of telford over the past year i would also like to mention and thank my friend and mentor my immediate labour predecessor david wright who serve our town and this house with passion for year 
 i also want to pay tribute to the person to hold the job of mp for telford a great supporter and crucial adviser to i who now sit in the other place lord bruce grocott lord grocott lead i on a tour of this house in when i be just year old right hon and hon member may be forgive for think that i look to old to have be in but that be what year in local government do to you

 in telford we be also incredibly proud to be home to some of the big defence company right now telford resident be work on tank destine for ukraine and distribute essential equipment from uniform to morphine that will be deploy across all part of   the world to our brave armed force our relationship with the armed force be deep and strong we be home to over veteran my own family have serve in all service and our council become of the authority to be award a ministry of defence gold accreditation for our work on the military covenant 
 for the past and a half year i have serve as leader of telford council and we have do a lot over that time we have regenerate our town centre with the creation of southwater we have be a business win and business support council we be home to besblock which provide brick to almost every house build company across the country and to aviramp which provide airport across the world with boarding ramp and we also provide wheelie bin to most household across the country we have keep our council tax among the low of all council in england we have support child with outstanding child service deliver exceptional adult service and be leader within our sector 
 as well as a be a council leader i have lead labour in local government i have chair the cross party local government association indeed i be proud to be the former chair of the lga to sit in this house rather than in the down the corridor i welcome to the house hon member and friend who have serve as councillor and council leader 
 in telford as in the rest of the country poverty and child poverty be increase it be heartbreake that almost in child be live in poverty for i that be not an academic issue it be personal i be in poverty as a child i remember switch the light off in our council house and lay on the floor as debt collector bang on our door i remember the embarrassment of queue for a blue free school meal ticket as many of my friend get their pay yellow one that deep down impost syndrome remain and be very much with i today 
 for too long town such as telford have have their contribution to housing and job growth bank but the investment and support that be so desperately need to break the cycle of poverty have not arrive despite our housing growth we have not have the investment need over the past year the closure of our a&e and the relocation of our consultant lead woman and child ’s unit be example i say to my constituent that i will never stop fight to bring service back to telford i pay tribute to telford crisis support which work with the community and provide meal last year up by almost on the year before it also provide clothe nappy and the very basic of life offer a vital lifeline to family 
 family come in many different shape and size from the age of i live with my nan betty who be and be my guide star although i live with my nan from such a young age my parent have always be there for i too i be lucky to have people like my great aunty dil who provide i with the financial support that mean i could be the person in my family to go to university where i read law and qualified as a solicitor i be so lucky to have my own family now i be a proud dad and stepfather to evan millie and owen my wife elise and i see no distinction in our family 
 part of the role of councillor be to be a corporate parent those in state care should be consider part of all our family in telford young people be in our   care and we support care leaver when i be the chair of the lga i describe the local government sector as the corporate uncle and aunty of those in care and those who have leave care what then be this house what be member of parliament to those child in state care maybe we be the corporate great aunty and uncle with resource influence and wisdom just like my auntie what more can we do to support our child in case to child live in council home in temporary accommodation or in our care who be pick up free school meal food parcel and avoid debt collector i say this if i can get here so can you 
 to provide a well future to all our child we must reform our public sector yes for some that be a dry subject but it be the only way to fix our break system reform be vital and prevention be key the long term approach to investment invest a pound now to save hundred of pound many time over will be important invest in and focus on the day of a child ’s life can lead to well life outcome and massive saving to the public purse 
 we must always ask ourselves how public service can well serve the public the answer be so often with the user of those service and those who work in they when those who have skin in the game be empower and trust the result be always well we know that so well in telford after the recent work of holly scarlett and joanne for too many our country do not work for they not only be they disconnect but they feel a mile away from this place that allow other to exploit the void to divide we we all of we should work together despite our political difference to help connect this place to our citizen so that democracy do not just survive but thrive i hope that i can work on that nationally in the come month and year 
 i thank the people of telford for trust i with the incredible honour and privilege of represent my home town i will stand up for telford and for they i know that we have a long road ahead of we but i be committed to the challenge after all nothing great be easy 
 i welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker thank you for allow i to make my contribution to the house in this important debate in my previous role i be proud to play my part in change the labour party so it be apt that i should give my maiden speech as we discuss change and modernise this house i associate myself with the comment of my hon friend and other member and congratulate all those who have make their maiden speech both today and in the past few day 
 it be a privilege to stand here as the newly elect member of parliament for cardiff west it be not an exaggeration to say that i stand in the shadow of some   impressive individual when it come to my predecessor i be the individual since world war to have the honour of represent cardiff west of my predecessor stand under the labour banner and go on to forge formidable career here in westminster serve as speaker of this house rhodri morgan my predecessor but serve in this house for nearly year before begin his next act as minister of wales serve in that role for over year rhodri be a political giant and very much love and miss by my constituent 
 as for my immediate predecessor kevin brennan as well as serve in a number of ministerial role in the last labour government his single big impact in this house might be his membership of the parliamentary rock band mp4 so we have a speaker a minister and a lead guitarist for i the pressure really be on in all seriousness kevin serve cardiff west with distinction for year and he be a quality act to follow that quality be clearly spot by the house when kevin give his maiden speech on   june after finish it peter bottomley the last parliament ’s father of the house comment that kevin 
 will be of the star of the parliament he have the sort of speak talent that probably guarantee his join the whips office and be shut up for a bit ”—[official report   june vol c. 
 mr bottomley be prescient because follow the general election kevin be indeed appoint an assistant government whip i want to place on the record my thank to kevin and his wife amy for their generosity advice and support 
 have listen to a number of maiden speech over the past few day of debate i believe it have become a tradition to refer to ’s constituency as the most beautiful in all the land as this place be steep in tradition with perhaps a sprinkling of modernisation to come i would not want to disappoint so i can confirm that cardiff west be indeed the most beautiful or as we say in welsh prydferth or hardd 
 until this election cardiff west exist entirely within the boundary of the city of cardiff but follow the most recent set of boundary change the ward of pontyclun in rhondda cynon taf now form part of it cardiff west ’s gain be pontypridd ’s loss as pontyclun be a vibrant community full of good people and a thriving high street that we must strive to maintain on that note i thank my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones   for her work represent pontyclun in the last parliament 
 move east there a diverse prydferth and hardd constituency in corner be llandaff a city within a city that house the beautiful llandaff cathedral of cathedral in cardiff in st fagans we find the st fagans national museum of history of europe ’s pre eminent open air museum in canton there be a thriving cultural scene include chapter art centre and the corp. 
 cardiff west also regularly punch above its weight when it come to sport it be home to glamorgan cricket sophia garden the athletic stadium at cardiff international sport stadium and cardiff city stadium the home of cardiff city football club and the welsh national team cardiff west also house riverside pontcanna fairwater and pentrebane pentyrch radyr and morganstown gwaelod y garth ely and caerau to name but a few each area be define by its own   unique character but the common thread that run through they be a proud community replete with family local activist sport club volunteer and faith leader all commit to serve the community they call home that become clear to i during the election campaign as their newly elect member of parliament i will work with anyone who genuinely seek to support cardiff west 
 in the past few day the labour government have set out their plan to deliver on the commitment we make to the british people at the last election throughout that election campaign i meet countless constituent who demand change but not just for change ’s sake they want change with a purpose change that would improve their life by make work pay by deliver a new deal for work people by rebuild their break public service by make their street safe by offer a more inclusive and tolerant discourse and by make an offer of a future for our country that be more positive more hopeful and more honest 
 of course for we to deliver that change we must embody that change and we need only look around the chamber to see that in this parliament woman be elect represent a record high of just over this be also the most diverse parliament by race and this parliament include the large cohort of lgbt+ member of any parliament in the world progress do not always move in a straight line but if look around this chamber and consider the tenor of maiden speech we have hear in these last few day of debate there be indeed reason for hope at the outset of this new parliament that deserve special mention while we can disagree in politic we should always strive to do so with decency honesty and respect do so be not a sign of weakness but of confidence in ourselves

 thank you madam deputy speaker i congratulate you on your election and welcome you to the chair although it feel a bit weird to welcome anyone here give that i have be here for about minute i follow on from the excellent contribution make by my hon friend the members for poole neil duncan jordan for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray among other i praise in   particular my hon friend for edinburgh east and musselburgh both because he give an excellent speech and because his mum be of my constituent 
 as i start this new job i have be think a lot about my family i be do so while prepare my remark today i be think in particular of my grandpa who be a coalminer in the coalfield of lanarkshire just outside glasgow when i be a wee boy he would tell i of the condition that he work in darkness he say so black that you could hold your hand right in front of your eye and still not be able to see it in that darkness he would toil away unable to imagine his own future let alone that of his grandwean as he would say all the while he toil he be inhale fume so toxic that later in life he would have lung cancer and live the rest of his life with just lung 
 my dad a welder be here today off during the glasgow fair along with my mum who run her own business to watch i from the gallery my career so far have be very different from that of my parent and grandparent for a start they have a proper job whereas i be now do this for a living but it have be different for related reason the be the labour party both in the sense that it have help to provide i with a new job and in the protection that it have deliver for work people health and safety legislation deliver by labour and build by the trade union movement have end the kind of condition that my grandparent work in the reason my career have be different be technology i suspect that today in britain there be more bitcoin miner than coalminer and that be ultimately a good thing coalmining be difficult hard laborious work 
 as a kid i spend many long hour in front of my computer and while much of that be spend play fifa against my wee brother mark some of it be more productive because i teach myself to code i watch youtube video and over week month and year i learn how to build software i develop iphone app that be use around the world mean that code write on my laptop in glasgow could be push out to device around the world in second and that this year old kid in his childhood bedroom could run an app servicing people from los angeles to dubai 
 if it can do that technology can reform our public service too technology might even help to reform this house as we be debate today i hope and know that high growth innovative business in my home city of glasgow will be a key part of that 
 much have be say and write about glasgow over the year but thing stick with i in particular anthony bourdain be not a man know for his parliamentary language so let we just say that he describe glasgow as the most unpretentious place on earth an antidote to the world in his word 
 so unapologetically work class and attitude free 
 i think he be right because of all the thing i love about glasgow it be our people and our humour that i enjoy most if someone ever get a wee bit too big for their boot return home to glasgow will soon put an end to that something i be sure will be increasingly useful the long i spend in this place 
 unlike many glaswegians my admiration even extend to some of glasgow ’s politician it be customary in speech such as this to praise our predecessor but i know that for some that will be do through slightly   gritted tooth at the end of a long and bitter fought election campaign in my case i talk about my predecessor with genuine warmth and admiration stewart mcdonald serve the people of glasgow south diligently and build an enviable reputation in this place he be particularly respect for his long stand support for the people of ukraine something that see he award the ukrainian order of merit if i leave this place have do half as much as he do for people around the world fight for democracy i will leave a happy man 
 before stewart there be labour predecessor there be tom harris who have be personally kind to i john maxton now lord maxton whose son teach i modern study in high school believe it or not although i will leave it up to other to decide whether he do a good or bad job of that and of course teddy taylor who be still remember fondly by many of my constituent 
 i would also like to mention other member of this house who have a big impact on my life both from glasgow the former member for east kilbride adam ingram grow up in the east end of glasgow and be of the people i ever speak to in the labour party his advice and wise counsel have be a constant source of support to i over the year and i be incredibly grateful the other be a southsider my friend and the former member for glasgow central anas sarwar i have the great privilege of serve as the director of anas ’s successful leadership campaign to become leader of scottish labour and a half year ago as we sit begin that campaign it be hard to imagine what the future might hold but even in our most optimistic of moment i do not think we would have predict this i stand here as of scottish labour mps 
 have praise glaswegians i will do something unusual for a glasgow mp and praise someone from edinburgh my right hon friend   the member for edinburgh south ian murray   have be a friend of mine for many year and he deserve enormous credit for his long and lonely shift as the sole scottish labour mp and for be someone who recognise that the labour party have to change if it be to earn people ’s trust once again it give i enormous pleasure and pride to see he in his rightful place as the secretary of state for scotland 
 that brief interlude aside we return to scotland ’s real capital city i be privileged to represent glasgow ’s southside a place that have have something of a renaissance in recent year boast the trendy tenement of shawlands the tree line avenue of newlands and the beautiful conservation village of carmunnock among other my constituency contain many of glasgow ’s beautiful park of which linn park queen ’s park and pollok country park be just a few in the latter hon member will find the burrell collection which be award the art fund ’s museum of the year award after its reopening last year 
 like many part of the city however we be not without difficulty castlemilk be an area with enormous spirit and the kind people anyone will ever meet but it also remain an area with challenge even today the simple act of get a supermarket in castlemilk have prove difficult something i hope to change as local mp 
 what be true of all my constituency be that it be an outward look diverse and welcome place the scots asian community in particular have contribute    enormously to glasgow ’s character and i be very proud to represent they here in parliament immigration have make my constituency rich and it make our country rich too the southside of glasgow be also a passionately pro european place although brexit be settle in the previous parliament i intend to support the government ’s move to repair our relationship with europe 
 my duty be to my constituency and my country be the member of parliament for glasgow south be the only job that i will do so long as the people of glasgow south wish for i to continue but i also feel a sense of responsibility towards the many million of people at home and around the world who do not have a voice the people toil away in darkness just as my grandpa do all those year ago i hope that none of we in this house forget the million indeed billion of people around the world who be not as lucky as we include those face persecution or war those without access to clean water or a good education and those bind by modern slavery i be of the lucky few to serve in this place but i will never forget the people who put i here and the people who do not have a voice deliver for they will be how i judge my success 
 it be an absolute honour to follow   the hon member for glasgow south gordon mckee he speak passionately about his constituency and his love for his constituent be clear for all to hear it be also an honour to follow maiden speech from the hon member for ipswich jack abbott for spelthorne lincoln jopp for telford shaun davies for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson for cardiff west mr barros curtis for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge and for poole neil duncan jordan each be in their own way an act to follow 
 i thank the people of hazel grove constituency for place their trust in i that trust be a profound responsibility and i be committed to repay it through hard work integrity and service to my community i acknowledge the work of my predecessor william wragg who serve in parliament from until he stand down at the last election he stand up to those in power when he feel that it be need and he speak openly about poor mental health in a way that i be sure will have help to break down stigma on behalf of all resident of hazel grove i wish he all the good for the future 
 i accept that i may be a little biased but hazel grove be quite clearly the fine constituency in the land it range from central stockport out to the edge of the peak district take in the community of bredbury bosden farm compstall great moor hawk green heaviley high lane little moor marple marple bridge mellor mill brow norbury offerton romiley strines woodley and some but not all of hazel grove itself whether the peaceful haven of our green space or the proud reminder of our industrial heritage hazel grove have it all we have the peak forest the macclesfield canal which have of the steep lock flight in the   country and our beautiful river the goyt the mersey and the tame it be no wonder so many people want to call our area home our river would be even more beautiful if the water company be not pump quite so much sewage into they we very much look forward to the government implement their plan to clean up that scandal 
 however it be the people who really make our community start point social enterprise in woodley be tackle digital exclusion by give some of my more mature constituent the confidence to get online the cherry tree project in romiley empower young people to live their good life and nk theatre arts work with child and adult of all ability across the borough use creativity and the perform art to transform life local people have many of the answer that we seek on how to fix the problem we face as a country my job and the job of this house be to empower they not tell they what be good for they 
 i be a liberal and a liberal democrat we exist to build and safeguard a fair free and open society in which we balance the fundamental value of liberty equality and community and in which no shall be enslave by poverty ignorance or conformity 
 i join the lib dems and get involve in politic because shout at the television be not bring about the change that we need my constituent have be very clear with i that their top priority be our local health service they should not have a hospital that be literally fall down they should not have to wait month or year for treatment and they should not have to struggle to care for their love one the phenomenal staff at stepping hill hospital should not have to wade through flood corridor to get to their patient because yet another pipe have burst as it do last weekend stepping hill hospital must get the repair it need and we need a new additional hospital in the town centre so that local people can get the health and social care service they deserve i will not rest until they do 
 i could not possibly make my speech in this house without mention the last liberal democrat to represent my community andrew stunell andrew be the mp for hazel grove from to and he be that rare kind of politician who give politic a good name he be an mp who set the standard to which all who come after he be rightly hold he be interested in do something not just be something he put his constituent and bring about change in the law both as a minister and as a back bencher 
 andrew make thing well for the whole country as a minister he deliver the localism act but as a back bencher he come top of the private member ’s bill ballot in result in the sustainable and secure buildings bill become an act of parliament in more than all that he be of the warm kind people i have ever meet he be the kind of person you want on your team hard work honest and kind he help i work out what it be to make a difference in public life the people of hazel grove the whole lib dem family and i will miss he and his guidance hugely 
 i be the woman to be elect as the mp for hazel grove and i take that responsibility really seriously i be especially delighted to be a member of the large   group of liberal democrats ever elect to this house there be of we if we include the right honourable jennie i go to a comprehensive school and be the member of my family to go to university 
 before decide that shout at the telly be not bring about the change that i want to see in the world and that stand for elect office be the way to be part of that change i work in a business as a director of client relation my client be big pension fund charity and foundation i be then the chief exec of a charity educate woman and girl in the develop world for the past year i have also be lucky enough to represent some of my constituent as an elect councillor for bredbury green and romiley on stockport council a role i have love i be of a rather large number of colleague who come to this house know at hand the value of local government and the desperate need for it to be fund properly 
 i turn to the substance of today ’s debate which be standard and modernisation the main thrust of what we have hear from the government and the leader of the house that any further role should benefit an mp ’s constituent be absolutely right in the short term we should of course stop mp from take on role as pay parliamentary adviser strategist or consultant in the long term daylight be often the good disinfectant so i ask the leader of the house to consider whether publish any employment contract for outside arrangement with suitable redaction and the transparency that would bring would allow constituent to judge for themselves whether they be get value for money from their mp 
 as a new mp i be strike and more than a little bemused by some of the wonderful convention and habit of this house take it as read that colleague be honourable be a good thing and refer to another as the members for our constituency act as a powerful reminder of who send we here but i be also strike by how much modernisation be need we on the lib dem benches look forward to support the government when we agree but i would expect we to urge persuade and on occasion push the government to go far and fast to make we the most effective we can be because our constituent deserve no less 
 with so many newly elect colleague we have a crack opportunity to change this place for the well it could be so much more efficient and so much more effective let we do that with fresh eye before we be all too institutionalised and think that some of this stuff be normal however that be also go to take some courage from the new government because make process and procedure less obscure so that more people understand they and make this place more efficient will mean that mp have more power and the government slightly less of it government especially government with new large majority i be guess will probably grow rather fond of that power quite quickly so let we get crack 
 alongside modernise this place we should of course reform our politic and our democracy more fundamentally the house of lords should obviously be elect and year old should be able to vote and we must replace the antiquated and deeply unfair past the post system with a fair proportionate voting system i look forward to make the case for these change during my time here 
 this election be the time i have stand to represent the people of hazel grove as the lib dem candidate and it probably take a certain sort of stubbornness resilience and determination to do that it most certainly take the support of my family and especially of my partner ed i be so grateful to he our mischievous rescue dog bonnie have not quite make up her mind yet about what she think about i work away from home rather more but i hope to be able to convince she that win be well than lose as it undoubtedly be win enable we to get stuff do and there be a lot to do 
 it be the honour of my life to be elect to represent my phenomenal community the people of hazel grove constituency they will be at the heart of everything i do here and i hope i do they proud 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i pay tribute to the many maiden speech of new members i have hear today include   the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart   for her fine speech hon member have speak with affection and commitment about their home constituency each of they rightly place their own area above all other and that be understandable but i stand before you as the member for the old continuous constituency to send a member to this house for almost year man and woman have stand as i stand today proud to proclaim themselves the member for lincoln 
 i walk in the footstep of a series of strong labour woman lincoln ’s female member of parliament be a titan of our movement margaret beckett grafton house lincoln ’s labour club be found and sustain by the much miss leo margaret be succeed by other formidable labour woman gillian merron and karen lee both of whom continue to serve our movement in local and national government i be honour to succeed they 
 i would like to pay tribute too to my immediate predecessor karl mccartney who also love the city he dedicate himself particularly to improve local transport provision he press forward with relief road for the city and i now take up that cause too lincoln be a beautiful historic young and dynamic city but we be far from other major urban centre and indeed from any of my hon friend on these bench we need a public transport network that reflect that relative geographical isolation and i hope to work with colleague across the house to make sure that lincoln and lincolnshire get the transport network they need right hon and hon member may not yet be sick of hear i talk about the urgent necessity to upgrade the lincoln to newark line of the slow in the country but i assure they that they will be 
 all of we elect to serve our community will of course be seek the support that they deserve as i also intend to in relation to the cost of living healthcare and housing but i also want to pause to pay tribute to the service my city have do for this country that service snake back even far than my predecessor over year ago in england seem almost lost french force loyal to prince louis have take most   of england and even the majority of lincoln herself it be only our castle lead by a woman in her mid sixty nicola de la haye the constable of lincoln castle who survive month of bitter siege warfare that finally repel the invader at the battle of lincoln secure the city and save england 
 hundred of year later lincoln and her worker again spring to the defence of this country in the chaos of the world war face mechanised industrial scale warfare of the most horrifying kind lincoln invent the tank we produce in of all royal air force plane at ruston and the work people of lincoln deliver to this country the equipment and people need to prevail against the odd on these benches and in this movement we never forget that 
 lincoln ’s connection with the raf have never since dim and less than a decade later young man include my grandfather train to fly at the raf station surround our city to this day we be proud to continue to host raf waddington of the most important raf basis at this moment raf waddington and its brave man and woman protect this country and this house as do sobraon barrack in uphill lincoln i be proud of their service and i will be a champion for they and their family for as long as i be in this place 
 as for so many of my constituent public service take i far from home and i be surprised and honour to be ask to return to the foreign office shortly after my election to this place i know that my constituent expect i to do my duty there as they do at waddington and across the world it be an honour to join the government but before i speak from the front benches on government business i wish to send a message to my constituent i be and foremost the member for lincoln for the city and bracebridge waddington and skellingthorpe for the school and university for the barrack and the airbase for the hospital cathedral and castle for our copy of magna carta for the independent shop of the bail for sincil bank and the park of boultham and hartsholme and for the gillie the ermine birchwood and steep hill this be the honour of my life and our city on a hill will be my and last priority for as long as you send i here 
 it be an honour to rise to make my formal contribution as a member of this house and i start by congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker and on take your seat in the chair 
 i also start with a slight admission of honesty since arrive here i have be nervous and anxious about make my maiden speech we might even say that i delay make my maiden speech for fear that my new colleague be superb orator who would go on to make excellent speech i be happy to admit that that fear come to pass there have be some superb speech over the past couple of day even today i pay tribute to my hon friend the members for spelthorne lincoln jopp and for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson and the hon member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for cardiff west mr barros- curtis for poole neil duncan jordan for glasgow   south gordon mckee for hazel grove lisa smart for lincoln hamish falconer and of course my neighbour   the hon member for ipswich jack abbott whose great speech do justice to that town i thank he for his kind word he be no long here so i will stop the nicety there 
 i be in the fortunate position of have be send to this place to represent a constituency and a people that have play a huge role in my life my grandfather grow up in east london before move to essex to raise a family it be in the 1980 after retirement and with my grandmother mary that he make that all too familiar trip up the a12 to settle just minute outside ipswich my early and happy childhood memory be spend fall in love with a country and a countryside that i still call home today and a county and a people i be now humble to represent in this place 
 shock horror madam deputy speaker i think central suffolk and north ipswich be bless with some of the most beautiful countryside in england but it be the history of the area that make it unique the anglo saxon king raedwald be of the rich and most powerful of his era consequently suffolk have become a treasure trove for archaeologist for nearly a century my neighbour   the hon member for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter   can boast of sutton hoo but on my far eastern border just last year a year old pre christian temple be discover expert can trace back human activity in the area almost year i be fortunate to have the beautiful market town of framlingham in my patch it be home to framlingham castle a former seat of the famous howard family and st michael ’s church which contain the tomb of tudor royalty and nobility and which i love to take my child to see i also have helmingham hall in my constituency which have unbelievably host both queen elizabeth i and queen elizabeth ii 
 it be unsurprising give our ancient lush and beautiful landscape that we have a rich history of produce great artist who be inspire by those surrounding thomas gainsborough john constable benjamin britten and even brian eno and ed sheeran to name a few be all product of our wonderful county in some way or another i be afraid to say that this child of suffolk be not bless with the same artistic talent 
 the other great contribution that i have always feel that suffolk make to our country be in food and drink i have be tell by my wife that it be certainly a domain in which i have more expertise and experience central suffolk and north ipswich be home to aspall cider manufacture for almost year from apple tree in the ground of aspall hall it be now of the most recognisable brand in the global drink market export product to customer around the world it be a great example of global success by a home grow british business we be great exporter of not only cider but sausage spud chocolate and condiment it be not uncommon to find suffolk produce in shop across the country it be for that reason that i have in the past and will now in this place support initiative like that of my hon friend   the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans   that give consumer in this country the opportunity to buy produce from producer in this country 
 the suffolk farming and agricultural community be such an important part of our local society and they be also emblematic of our local culture and identity with their no nonsense attitude to hard work love for family and community complete and utter ambivalence to the weather and deep affection for our natural environment i be sure that all member have their bias but i be of the firm belief that the people of central suffolk and north ipswich be the fine our country have to offer 
 while i hope to be a voice primarily for the people of suffolk and ipswich i hope to use my time in this place to speak up for another cause in a previous life before enter this place i work under my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   at the centre for social justice and then as an adviser in the department for education in that time i realise that the conservative party and conservativism have a proud story to tell on the critical issue of help those who need help on offer the most vulnerable in our society not just a handout but a leg up and on stand up for what be just and fair in society more than anything they be about give people the opportunity to fulfil their potential 
 i count the ward of whitton whitehouse and castle hill as part of my patch whitton and whitehouse be of the most deprived ward in our country castle hill be probably of the most unequal by any measure ipswich be like its football team a huge success story but large part of it include many family live in whitehouse whitton and castle hill have be leave behind the story be all too familiar the failure to adapt in a post industrial economy generation of low wage work if not worklessness the proliferation of crime and high level of immigration that have cause a degree of social polarisation for however long the people of central suffolk and north ipswich want i to represent they i will fight in this place to empower those people who feel left behind those who want to get on in life and those who want to and can reach their potential at a time when faith and trust in politic be at an all time low among those who feel lock out of our economy and our society there be no more pressing cause than ensure that britain work for everyone 
 today we be debate the merit of allow mps to have a job time and again on the doorstep during the election and across dining table for many year i have hear from people rich and poor young and old left and right that they have lose faith in politician do the right thing believe it or not the nhs immigration job income and access to home be all hugely important to the voter at this general election but the most important thing to the people across my constituency from whitehouse to whitton kesgrave to claydon and ringshall to rendham whether they vote for i or not be restore a sense of moral probity and public spiritedness to our political system as we embark on this debate and other in this place let we keep that in mind 
 before i finish i would like to pay tribute to my predecessor dr dan poulter he be as dedicate a servant to the people of suffolk and ipswich as ever there be both an mp and in his job as a consultant doctor he use his invaluable nhs experience when he be a junior minister in the department of health and when he be on the draft bill committee   review the mental health act for the time in year we feel the benefit of his healthcare expertise in suffolk when he manage to save hertismere hospital which be previously in my constituency and be now in neighbour waveney valley and when he lobby the government for a new accident and emergency wing for ipswich general hospital 
 as many people know dr dan arrive in this house as a member of my party and leave as a member of another but i do not feel any ill will for another political hero of mine winston churchill perform a similar journey over year ago i do not mind say it here madam deputy speaker i too hope day to cross the floor before i give my whip a heart attack i should add not to swap political allegiance but as part of a conservative party elect back into government take our place on the government benches that be a whip issue line 
 in the meantime though i would like to thank my wife and my little boy leo and jasper who i be sure be watch on bbc parliament right now i also thank the doorkeepers and the clerks i also want to thank my mother who have be a real troup to sit through a nearly hour debate she look bright now than she do when i put she in a polling station as a teller as i be say i look forward to work with member from across the house in the pursuit of deliver for the people of this great nation 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of fraud and error in government department and agency 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of fraud and error in government department and agency 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of fraud and error in government department and agency 
 government estimate of the amount of money lose to fraud and error vary hugely in truth the late estimate have a range of between £ and almost £ which be a huge range the public rightly expect we to do all we can to minimise fraud in the use of public fund which be reason why my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer have announce the establishment of a covid corruption commissioner whose job it will be to track down as much as possible of the money lose to fraud during the pandemic the cabinet office will work closely with the chancellor on this to try to ensure good value for money for the public and of course crack down on fraud right across government departments and agency 
 covid contract fraud have cost the public purse an estimate £ with the previous government assign contract worth billion for useless personal protective equipment to those with close personal connection to ministers through their so call vip lane with the chancellor announce a new covid fraud commissioner this week can the minister please outline how his department will work with the treasury   to support that commissioner in order to ensure that this egregious waste of public money be rectify and the british taxpayer get back what they be owe 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to what happen during covid when vip lane and dodgy contract end up burn through billion of pound sometimes for unusable equipment we will do everything we can to recover money that have be lose and my department will work closely with the office of the covid corruption commissioner to oversee that work and try to ensure the good value possible for the taxpayer 
 new technology must be at the beat heart of the new government and artificial intelligence present an opportunity to tackle waste and error the national audit office have claim that the counter fraud agency be only just begin to utilise new technology in their fight against public sector fraud and rely on outdated legacy system and incomplete time lag datum how will the minister implement new technology include ai to tackle fraud and error in government 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there be potential for great use of ai in detect and root out fraud we want the uk to be an excellent place to develop new us of ai both in its public sector application and the development of private business there be already a single network analytic platform which be an ai base detection tool to help public sector organisation detect fraud but like many ai application we be probably only at the beginning of what can be achieve in this area we should use every technological tool at our disposal to secure good value for money for the taxpayer 
 as well as matt hancock ’s pub landlord score a ppe contract despite have relevant expertise non covid error fraud and waste cost the public purse £ in the year alone could my right hon friend tell we how those colossal sum of money will be recover he mention a commissioner can he also tell we how we will get rid of cronyism and nepotism so that these thing never happen again 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the scale of the problem the truth be that accord to the late figure the amount that have be recover be relatively small compare with the scale of loss the previous government ’s own former minister for counter fraud describe the conservative party ’s record as nothing less than woeful and riddle with schoolboy error and the shadow business secretary   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake describe the previous prime minister ’s handling of this issue as dismissive we can not afford to be dismissive we have a duty to take it seriously and use whatever mean we can to bear down on fraud so that money mean for public service and legitimate recipient of public fund be use for its intend purpose 
 i want to highlight innocent error where government system be fail to pick up overpayment and as a result people be chase i be think particularly of unpaid   carer earn just a few extra pound which mean that the department for work and pensions be claw back thousand from they in carer ’s allowance because hmrc system fail to alert the dwp when earning have increase what be the cabinet office do to ensure that government system properly work to stop these thing happen 
 this issue have be highlight more than once in the chamber this week we be of course hugely appreciative of the job that carer do and that have to be balance with the proper use of public fund so that those fund get to the intended recipient where there be overpayment they do need to be recover in the interest of the taxpayer but i hope that be always do in a proper and compassionate manner 
 i very much welcome the minister to his place and wish he well in the role he now play this be a vastly important question right across the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland do he hold statistic for northern ireland on the cost of fraud and error to the public purse and what discussion will he undertake with the devolved institution to improve financial decision particularly at the northern ireland assembly 
 this be my but i suspect not my last exchange with the hon member i have not see a specific breakdown of this figure for northern ireland but i can tell he that we take relation with northern ireland extremely seriously that be why the prime minister go to northern ireland as well as scotland and wales on the weekend after the general election 
 whether he plan to take step to consolidate the number of national pay bargaining unit in the civil service

 i thank the minister for the reply he have just give will he assure the house that he be go to make progress towards a return to full sectoral bargaining he must be aware that many thousand of civil servant be not cover by a pay review body or any other bargaining mechanism will he take step to ensure that all civil servant be buy within the purview of a pay review body bargaining unit as part of a return to sectoral bargaining 
 i thank the right hon member for his question i hope to have a good and fruitful dialogue with the civil service union about pay and many other issue it be important that we have public servant who feel value and motivate and who do their part on deliver the government ’s objective on the specific issue of pay that he have raise as i say to my hon friend   the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon the government will have more to say on civil service pay before the summer recess
