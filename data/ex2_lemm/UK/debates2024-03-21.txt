unlike the hon gentleman i be at the launch of the say report and have read it he will be aware that for example reason for the complication be that the number of people work from home have increase by we have a plan to tackle that with the record investment that be be make to mayors he talk about franchising but it be also the case without a shadow of a doubt that he do not have a plan to finance it particularly for rural local authority what be the case be that when labour organisation be challenge on this they struggle to find out how they will deal with the funding the truth be that there be no plan and they be not put forward any funding individual people who attend that event be genuinely in shock at the shadow secretary of state ’s suggestion that labour be go to do this but be unsure about how it would fund it 
 with great respect to the hon lady she know full well that her council attempt to have an active travel scheme in jesmond and it so mess it up that it have to scrap the scheme the ltn be scrap and there be objection and a considerable waste of money with due respect active travel be do a great job and we support it but council have to take local community with they 
 the chair of the pac be entirely right although in the mod context if it be groundhog day groundhog sound like a vehicle that have slip to the right 
 more recently after a detailed inquiry the defence committee on which i serve publish a damn report on   february entitle simply ready for war i have serve on the committee since and this be of the punchy report we have ever produce in answer to the question in the title the all party committee which include former mod ministers conclude 
 despite the united kingdom spending approximately £ a year on defence plus more for ukraine the uk ’s armed forces require sustained ongoing investment to be able to fight a sustain high intensity war alongside our ally against a peer adversary 
 in plainer english and as the subsequent detail in the report starkly point out despite a considerable outlay of taxpayer ’s cash we could not fight a sustained war with putin ’s russia for more than a couple of month before we run out of ammunition and fighting equipment not least as we have very few tank ship or combat aircraft in reserve the full report can be find online 
 give that it take year to build a modern warship a totally ridiculous year in the case of the new type frigate and year to build a typhoon fighter if we have to fight what the strategist sometimes describe as a come as you be war with little further warning we would have to rely on whatever equipment we have to hand or could rapidly remobilise we simply do not have enough war win kit to win as it be as the public accounts committee ’s report on the year equipment plan illustrate starkly the difference between what the mod aspire to buy and the funding it be likely to have available be £ however it be bad because the service account for the plan on a different basis without go into all the technicality an apple and apple comparison across the service show that the gap be £ even beyond gap in capability of our kit our great weakness be now the lack of skilled personnel to operate and maintain the equipment that we do have without they and far too many of they be leave as the chair of the defence committee say even multi dollar aircraft system simply remain in the hangar 
 perfect example of how dysfunctional the mod have now become in relation to people be the saga of capita or forgive i crapita as it be now affectionally know to the defence committee it have totally mess up the recruitment system for the british army a few year ago its share price top £ today it be barely penny everyone in defence know that the outsourced contract have be a disaster yet absolutely no in the upper echelon of the department have the moral courage to sack the company the defence secretary recently describe the situation in the times as ludicrous he be absolutely right indeed no doubt he have make a note of his own comment on his own famous spreadsheet but still nothing actually happen capita limp on as the army bleed out with in some part of the army soldier now leave for every that capita somehow painfully manage to recruit if we think we be go to deter the like of vladimir putin in this manner we be live on a different planet in a parallel universe in a fantasy dimension 
 give that we now spend the thick end of £ a year on defence the british taxpaye public be quite entitle to ask why so little of our defence capability work properly why be some of the army ’s fight vehicle year old why do we have hardly any battle tank that actually work why do we have hardly any submarine that be now regularly put to sea why do we have aircraft carrier that perennially break down whenever they try to leave port bluntly it be because we now have a ministry of defence that have become in recent year a gigantic sclerotic bureaucracy constantly hidebound by needless self generate red tape obsess with process rather than outcome in which some senior civil servant be now more interested in wokery than weaponry endlessly rip off by some of their own major contractor such as boeing to name but and in which key element of our fighting equipment be so old and the procurement system for replace they so broken that we now can not fight a major war with russia for more than a few week as it well know 
 moreover as the red book clearly show in table and we be cut the core uk defence budget next year by £ and play smoke and mirror with the donation to ukraine and with address an overspend on the nuclear enterprise from the treasury reserve in order to pretend otherwise this act of what the russians call maskirovka or strategic deception be wholly unworthy of a conservative government if member happen to believe as i do that the role of our armed force be determinedly to save life by convince any potential aggressor that be they to attack we we would defeat they then we be palpably fail 
 this be not an intellectual parlour game ultimately this be about whether our grandchild be go to grow up in someone else ’s re education camp but we might not know that if we walk into the current mod we can try to blame the military for instance for so frequently over specify new military equipment such as ajax that it enter service many year late but in the end the responsibility lie with the politician who theoretically at least be suppose to be in charge 
 the romans have a famous saying about military matter si vis pacem para bellum”—he who desire peace save line3should prepare for war give that the secretary of state the man who run the department have tell we that we be in a pre war world surely we have well start prepare for it if we be to have any chance whatsoever of prevent it and we should now do that in earnest before it be too late 
 i agree with every word my right hon friend the former eminent chairman of the defence committee just say my caveat be that the mod ’s excuse for these capability gap be that we can rely on ally to fight with we but they will be rely on we and if we be unable to support they or they be on wartime task elsewhere thing might go horribly wrong 
 i say all of this not just as someone who serve proudly as a territorial army infantry officer in my local royal anglian regiment during the cold war not just as someone who be still very proud to carry the late queen ’s commission not just as a former veteran and then armed forces minister in the ministry of defence albeit almost a decade ago but most of all as i say at prime minister ’s question last week as the devoted son of a d day veteran stoker class reginal francois die when i be year of age he tell i night of the carnage his word that he witness that day albeit from offshore on a minesweeper name hms bressay in the afternoon they be opposite omaha beach 
 let i quote shakespeare ’s famous phrase 
 this story shall the good man teach his son 
 my father be a good man the story that he tell i be of a country that eventually reluctantly have to go to war against the evil of nazi tyranny because for year its politician have be so parsimonious he actually say tight”—and so naive that when nazism emerge we completely fail to deter it that be the lesson of the 1930 but it be also his lesson to i 
 my father make i take a solemn vow that as his son i would never take live in a free country for grant because as he say too many good man have die to achieve it year after we have that conversation he be dead that be why i be here this afternoon that be why i come into politic in the place as a wartime serviceman my father be a great admirer of winston churchill our great ever prime minister who lead this country through a war of national survival and then lose a general election for his trouble when i walk into the chamber early this afternoon i could still see the damage cause when the chamber be bomb in churchill insist that it not be repair lest we forget and he be right 
 in summary i may not be my father ’s contemporary that famously courageous mp leo amery so i can not claim to speak for england on this matter but i be elect to speak for the people of rayleigh and wickford and so on their behalf i issue this stark warning today the sky be darken brutal dictator with powerful weapon at their disposal be on the rise the democracy be on the backfoot rather than the front history tell we time and again and indeed ad nauseam that the appeasement of dictator be they call adolf hitler or vladimir putin do not work we should be increase the defence budget to at least of gdp what my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis   use to call at least to keep we free”—not cut it as we now be and pretend that we be not the duty of government above all other be the defence of the realm and we forget that at our peril si vis pacem para bellum 
 my hon friend raise this issue with the prime minister only yesterday she be a fantastic campaigner on issue relate to the tamar bridge i accept entirely that the tamar bridge and torpoint ferry joint committee have recently look at the situation an application be be consider by the transport secretary and i be happy to meet she again to discuss it far 
 the vice chamberlain of the household report to the house that his majesty have be attend with its address of november be pleased to receive the same very graciously and give the follow answer 
 i have receive with great satisfaction the dutiful and loyal expression of your thank for the speech with which i open the present session of parliament 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of bus service level in england 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of local bus service 
 what step he be take to improve bus service in leeds 
 the government continue to provide unprecedented investment into bus since the pandemic we have announce more than £ of support for bus service in england outside london include £ recently reallocate from hs2 to improve service in the north and the midland through network north bus passenger journey in england increase by to in the year end march and we be see patronage increase in some area 
 it have be year since the government publish their national bus strategy but we be still wait for the promise guidance on what constitute socially and economically necessary bus service for which local authority can provide subsidy while we wait people in stapleton in my constituency be have to walk a mile to get to a bus stop to catch a   bus to the city centre because bus say it be not commercially profitable to run a service through stapleton and there be no money to subsidise it last july a minister tell i that guidance would be issue in this parliament which be clearly close to come to an end when will we see that guidance 
 we particularly want to try to assist the hon lady and her local authority with the finance the west of england combine authority receive £ every year through the bus service operator grant to subsidise socially necessary bus service it have also be allocate in excess of £ in city region sustainable transport settlement and to deliver transport infrastructure which include the bus infrastructure the hon lady require 
 as a regular bus user myself i recognise it when people in rural devon tell i that some bus fail to appear mean they miss connection with train as a result the service be well use by college student unreliable bus service not only affect the productivity of the college student but of their parent who be then call upon to help the student make the journey to college curtail their work day what can the government do to encourage well co ordination between rail and bus to get student to college on time 
 that depend on funding as the hon gentleman will be aware because i raise it with he in his adjournment debate on   december devon county council have be award £ to deliver its bus service improvement plan but there should be well integration between the provider the local authority and the rail company 
 our bus service in leeds have be unreliable for year and yet the leeds city council conservative group want more of the same and hop the problem would just go away will the minister join i in congratulate labour ’s west yorkshire mayor tracy brabin on take the significant decision to bring our bus back into public control so they can once again be run for people and not for profit 
 i have the dubious honour of be praise as the hon gentleman ’s favourite mp early this week damn by faint praise i would gently push back that the west yorkshire mayor be able to do that only because this government have provide unprecedented funding of in excess of £ in the devolve settlement under the city region sustainable transport settlement 
 southend welcome the £ of bus service improvement plan funding that have already enable conservative cabinet member kevin buck to reinstate the much love 25a route but we need more will the minister commit to come to my high level bus summit on monday to listen to resident and see what more we can do 
 in the time honour tradition i   can only say yes to my hon friend she be a doughty champion for southend i would be delighted to attend   her bus summit to speak to the relevant councillor and to explain how the bus service improvement plan and the bus service operator grant funding be transform local bus provision 
 never mess with busy mum and dad not least because i be and i know that the minister be as well parent in arlingham frampton elmore and longney be really struggle with rural school bus transport this be not all about money it be about reliability safety and fairness indeed they feel that their child be discriminate against versus what child in town and city receive gloucestershire county council be do a lot it be stretch itself but we be really struggle to find solution will the minister meet i and councillor stephen davies to see whether we can find solution for our parent in the community 
 i would be delighted to do so i welcome the fact that my hon friend be stand up for her local community in this way clearly it be a question of integrate the particular service whether they be local or school provision but it be definitely something that we can sort 
 it be good to meet my hon friend the minister and the resident of fishburn in the sedgefield constituency recently and he then follow up with arriva will he endorse my campaign to reconnect fishburn trimdon and sedgefield back with newton aycliffe and darlington which be cut off by the removal of the x21 do he also agree that rural service to place such as these be the critical platform to enable opportunity to be spread and a key reason for the bsip funding 
 it be a pleasure to attend the meeting at fishburn community hall meet the local resident and councillor be offer a pancake on shrove tuesday and discuss bus service and bus funding i have to say that there be no doubt whatever that the improvement of the x21 in particular take resident and worker into newton aycliffe and darlington seem to be utterly sensible and i will continue to support my hon friend ’s campaign and meet again with arriva to ensure that it happen for the people of fishburn and trimdon 
 i call the shadow minister 
 good morning mr speaker passenger watchdog transport focus publish a report last week which find huge regional variation in bus passenger satisfaction across the country with large number of passenger be let down under the tories deregulation of the bus sector passenger satisfaction with some of our operator be mile below the average of with some as low as a dismal in place such as west yorkshire labour mayors be not stand for it any long as my hon friend   the member for leeds north east fabian hamilton   say tracy brabin have announce her intention to pursue franchising to reverse decade of tory decline but the vast majority of local authority do not have those power so will the minister adopt labour ’s plan to give every local transport authority the same power to take back control of their bus service 
 unlike the hon gentleman i be at the launch of the say report and have read it he will be aware that for example reason for the complication be that the number of people work from home have increase by we have a plan to tackle that with the record investment that be be make to mayors.[official report   march vol c. 13mc correction he talk about franchising but it be also the case without a shadow of a doubt that he do not have a plan to finance it particularly for rural local authority what be the case be that when labour organisation be challenge on this they struggle to find out how they will deal with the funding the truth be that there be no plan and they be not put forward any funding individual people who attend that event be genuinely in shock at the shadow secretary of state ’s suggestion that labour be go to do this but be unsure about how it would fund it 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of seafarer welfare standard on p&o ferries fleet 
 i wish to make it clear that the dismissal year ago by p&o ferry of nearly seafarer without notice and without consultation be completely unacceptable which be why this government introduce a comprehensive package of measure to improve the welfare of seafarer and to stop the abuse 
 on the specific of the question the maritime and coastguard agency periodically inspect vessel that enter uk port to assess their compliance with international standard include those in the maritime labour convention we expect all operator to meet if not exceed those standard and the uk continue to play a lead role internationally in drive up working condition across the maritime sector we be pleased that just this weekend p&o ferries have commit to sign the seafarer charter along with other operator we will work with p&o ferry to support it in its application for chartered status and assess its welfare standard against the charter ’s requirement 
 year on from p&o ferries shocking attack on seafarer job trade union right and employment law the legal loophole that it use to escape criminal sanction have still not be close the p&o seafarer be uk base worker but because p&o ferries have flag its ship out to cyprus bermuda and the bahamas p&o and crucially the government know that criminal sanction include fine for the offence that it commit would not apply why have the government not close that loophole 
 as i say the government have introduce a comprehensive package of measure to stop the abuse of seafarer in particular we have introduce the seafarers wages act which will come into force this summer and ensure the minimum wage for seafarer in the uk we have the minimum wage corridor that be open up this summer with france ensure the minimum wage across the channel and we have the seafarer charter which raise standard far higher as i say p&o and other operator have apply   to join it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last sunday mark the year anniversary of p&o ferries illegally sack worker but year on nothing have change this week an investigation by itv and the guardian reveal that p&o ferries be not only pay many of its worker less than half the minimum wage but force staff to work hour shift day a week for up to week at a time france ’s maritime minister have call that dangerous and not moral and have change the law to stop it happen the seafarers wages act will not curb that treatment nor will the government ’s voluntary charter so when will the government act to prevent those exploitative practice from happen in our water 
 the government agree that seafarer should obviously not be work so hard that they be fatigue that it be dangerous and that operator have a duty to ensure that that be not the case the seafarers wages act be obviously primarily focused on wage and will ensure that seafarer get pay the minimum wage within uk water provision of the seafarer charter will ensure that the operator have roster so that seafarer be not fatigued and overwork the department will monitor compliance and work with the operator to ensure that seafarer be not fatigued 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 far to the point make by the labour front bencher it be just over year since nearly p&o worker be summarily sack and throw off ferry we will finally debate the government ’s utterly supine and ineffective fire and rehire code of practice next week but it be just over month since the government claim that they be make substantial progress on implement the point plan for seafarer protection the seafarers wages act still have not come into force alongside a toothless and voluntary seafarer charter which will not change how p&o operate even if it sign up to it we all know that in this house so be it not time that the government take meaningful action and get behind our seafarer 
 the seafarers wages act will come into force this summer unfortunately it take time to pass legislation and we have to consult on it no want it to come into force quick than i. the claim that the seafarer charter will have no impact be completely untrue the operator will have to abide by the term of the charter which will ensure that seafarer earn the minimum wage throughout their engagement that they get overtime payment of at least time the hourly rate and that they have roster that ensure that they be not fatigued and safety be not compromise the government will monitor the compliance of the operator with that charter 
 what step he be take to help local authority improve local transport in the west midland 
 in total local transport authority across the west midland have be allocate around £ to improve local transport service and infrastructure through the city region sustainable transport settlement bus service improvement plan funding and our recently announce local transport fund thing that would of course hugely help local transport in the west midland be for voter in the combine authority to re elect our fantastic mayor andy street 
 hear hear the extension of the birmingham to lichfield line go all the way to burton and pass the national memorial arboretum at the moment the line be use only for freight and i be tell year ago that the cost of upgrade it for passenger traffic would be only about £ which be nothing in the great scheme of thing when will we see the line be complete so that people can go to the national memorial arboretum which have half a visitor a year by rail instead of always have to use road 
 i know that my hon friend be a long stand champion of that scheme and take every opportunity to raise it with we it be for local authority to promote scheme for transport in their area i be pleased to tell he that follow our decision to cancel the phase of high speed we have be able to make significant fund available so staffordshire county council his local authority will get just under £ from the local transport fund i urge he to talk to the council to see if it can fund the very modest bid that he have just set out for that scheme 
 the tram system in the west midland be not go accord to plan unfortunately and the rail line between moor street snowhill and marylebone the chiltern line as it be know be underperform and have become highly unreliable the air quality in our area include in warwick and leamington snowhill and elsewhere be very poor because the service be diesel run other country such as india have electrify their main network will the minister electrify the chiltern route use the budget free up from hs2 
 there be significant plan to electrify across the network another thing we can do to spend money more cost effectively be consider where battery train can be use in order not to electrify the very expensive part of the network i be also aware that chiltern be look at modernise its rolling stock particularly to improve air quality all the thing that the hon gentleman raise be absolutely in progress the rail minister will be able to say more about they in due course 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of create new direct ferry link to mainland europe 
 the uk ferry sector be a highly competitive commercial market there be currently a significant number of link to europe offer a variety   of freight and passenger route from many location include new route since ferry route be develop on a commercial basis by private sector operator to provide service that meet wide passenger or freight demand as such the department do not currently intend to undertake any such assessment 
 the reinstatement of a direct ferry link from the forth estuary into europe address key objective an environmental objective of reduce road congestion and carbon emission from heavy good vehicle improve import export resilience and deliver economic opportunity to scotland industry agree and ferry operator stand ready to deliver a route but the scottish government lack the courage to support project brave what can be do to encourage the scottish government to invest a modest amount of pump prime funding to realise the economic and environmental benefit that would be feel by all across the uk 
 as i say in my initial answer the uk government see the ferry sector as a commercial market and do not subsidise it as the hon gentleman point out however this be a devolved matter in scotland ferry be the responsibility of the scottish government so he should make his protestation about that route to the snp government because it be up to they to decide what to do i totally understand that they be slightly worried they have an undistinguished track record on ferry with various fiasco maybe it be because they try to get ferry that can hold motorhome 
 what estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of delay to plan rail reform 
 what estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of delay to plan rail reform 
 the recent national audit office report be clear that we expect to spend £ on rail reform up to the end of march compare with initial plan to spend £ the report be also clear that we be forecast £ of total saving over the current spending review period which be of our original saving target 
 it have be year since we be tell that great british railways would happen in my reading of the nao report it say that the £ of saving will not be meet in time the national union of rail maritime and transport workers say that another half could be achieve if we remove the profit motive from the railway where a huge amount be waste on shareholder when will the government progress on gbr and when will we get a date for its implementation be it not time for they to bite the bullet and renationalise our railway as we have do successfully with several line 
 at the heart of rail reform be integrate track and train i be very pleased that the transport committee have take on the role of be the pre legislative   scrutiny committee for the draft rail reform bill and be now scrutinise that legislation the cut off date for evidence be next wednesday if the hon gentleman would like to put his suggestion forward i hope that the committee will complete its report by july the government will have month to respond to the recommendation and if we have cross party support for an integrate rail body that bring track and train together i hope we will be able to bring in legislation to that effect and improve rail service for everyone 
 high speed with its out of control cost be compound local misery because it be now set to close the vital artery of old oak common lane for to year we only know that because it leak out which show the government ’s disregard for community and transparency what assurance can the minister give about funding for the euston leg so that the world class interchange that we be promise do not end up be the terminus and so that my long suffer resident do not pay the price of government project mismanagement by be hem in until because they can not get on their access road to the outside 
 an old oak common terminus provide a great opportunity for regeneration in the area i have visit a number of time and i be committed to work with the community to minimise impact of the way that be be do be by ensure that the spoil be remove by conveyor rather than by lorry we do seek to minimise the impact we recognise that when new rail station be build there be an impact 
 turn to the hon lady ’s concern about euston i have meet our property developer partner lendlease our aim be to deliver not just a station but the large public sector land deal in london which will completely regenerate the area it will deliver office job and home and will also provide the funding to deliver the station not just for hs2 but for network rail we be committed to ensure that network north deliver that station 
 i call the shadow minister 
 early this month the national audit office issue a damn report that make it clear that this government ’s refusal to bring forward long delay rail reform be cost taxpayer dearly avanti west coast make the amount of waste in our rail system crystal clear when it brag about get free money from government despite the truly shocking service that it deliver so it should come as no surprise that yesterday northern mayors and council leader unanimously call for avanti to lose its contract due to its appalling service the question for the minister today be simple will he strip avanti of its contract yes or no 
 no we will not the reason be that there be issue with the west coast main line that will remain regardless of who the operator be it be essential to get underneath the bonnet look at the issue and fix they rather than look just at what be on the side of the car to take just week period from christmas of the delay in that period be down not to the operator but network rail and they involve weather relate issue as well as trespass and sadly suicide which we need to minimise 
 we also have issue with restrictive contract and i would like change there for example avanti be unique as an operator in the sense that its driver will not double trip they will do return journey but will not go over the same leg of rail twice interruption   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh   ask whose fault that be that contract be agree in so maybe we know whose fault it be that sum up this ludicrous situation we be talk about a contract from that be due to end in year in yet that contract between the union and any operator remain until we can make progress on restrictive contract we will not be able to make change a government can not break the contract it be between the operator and the union i welcome the step that mick lynch 
 order i do not mind have an adjournment debate or statement on this subject if we need i be more than happy to allow but we can not have it now i have a bit to get through but the minister ’s answer be excellent i be sure i call the snp spokesman 
 i start by thank alex hynes for have do a fantastic job run scotland ’s railway for year he be depart to become the director general of rail at the department for transport where he will help steer rail reform and what a job he have as we have hear the national audit office say that rail reform be not on track not only be there £ a year in lost saving but the department have fail to make planned saving of £ from workforce reform and the establishment of great british railways cut of £ to the transport budget be nevertheless announce by the chancellor week ago do the minister agree that his government be unable to make saving but all too willing to make cut 
 no i do not i be delighted at the appointment of alex hynes who will become a director general in the department for transport he will put track and train together in the department and that departmental section will move out to great british railways once the legislation be put in place so i do not agree at all the appointment demonstrate that we be get on with rail reform by appoint the right staff and we have start on the legislative path 
 mr speaker i know i take too long at the dispatch box when i talk about the need to fix such contract but they be complicated this session should not be about cheap soundbite it do not work like that it should be about get into the detail there be sticky contract provision that the court will not allow a government or an operator to break unilaterally i do wish this house would be a bit more intellectual in its approach to scrutiny 
 what step he be take to support active travel in newcastle upon tyne 
 this government be invest more than any other in active travel around £ have be provide to newcastle upon tyne since to   deliver high quality infrastructure that be support by over £ of funding to transport north east to improve capability across the region active travel england support local authority in deliver maximum value for money by ensure that scheme comply with the relevant guidance and council receive tailor support from the government 
 walk and cycling prevent serious long term health condition on tyneside every year accord to the walking and cycling index and they bring in £ in economic benefit so it be no wonder that half of tynesiders want to walk or wheel more and that fifth want to cycle more but if they be to do that the street need to be make safe what be the minister do apart from undermine low traffic neighbourhood to make our street safe for walking wheeling and cycling 
 with great respect to the hon lady she know full well that her council attempt to have an active travel scheme in jesmond and it so mess it up that it have to scrap the scheme the ltn be scrap and there be objection and a considerable waste of money with due respect active travel be do a great job and we support it but council have to take local community with them.[official report   march vol c. 14mc correction 
 what step he be take to improve rail service 
 official and i be focus on improve rail service in the short and long term this week i bring together representative from across the rail industry for a leader in rail session to discuss how collectively we can make change to deliver a well passenger experience long term we remain committed to bring track and train back together under great british railways and to continue to build on the £ of investment since 
 carshalton and wallington be of the poor part of london for connectivity it be promise that the ultra low emission zone would bring additional public transport investment but instead the bus have be scrap the go sutton bus have be scrap the bus service be be reduce and the superloop be just an exist bus route that have be rebrande thing that would improve connectivity be deliver on the croydon area remodelle scheme that national rail and network rail be work on to improve connectivity in london and the south east what discussion be the department have with network rail about move this project forward 
 i thank my hon friend who be an absolute champion of that project and he make his point clear upgrade make in the gatwick area be already deliver significant improvement to the brighton main line and the industry continually review how good to respond to change in demand i understand that my hon friend have be in discussion with the operator on the option for increase capacity on busy weekend service between carshalton and london victoria and   that govia thameslink railway will shortly respond to he directly i will continue to work with he on the enhancement project that he champion 
 the leader of nottinghamshire county council who have a nice side hustle as   the hon member for mansfield ben bradley once say 
 the full delivery of hs2 ’s eastern leg be what the east midlands need to support and create highly skilled job link community to opportunity and decarbonise our transport network 
 as he fail to persuade the prime minister who cancel that vital investment in our region ’s rail service can the minister tell i how we will now deliver the transformative change to our connectivity sustainability job creation productivity and social mobility that hs2 promise fill a few pothole will not cut it 
 i certainly look forward to the day when my hon friend   the member for mansfield ben bradley   be also an excellent east midlands mayor and we be devolve more power to the east midland to help he with that task   the hon member for nottingham south lilian greenwood   reference hs2 money from which more than a £ will be allocate to the mayor of the east midlands to spend on the transport project that he and indeed the hon lady may want that allow we to devolve more project to the local area and we have be absolutely clear that all the money that have be save as a result of the hs2 cancellation will be reinveste primarily in the north and the midland 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the recent budget contain welcome additional funding for east west rail what be the minister ’s intention for that additional funding may i suggest that he work with the bletchley town fund board of which i be a member on use the money to provide an additional eastern entrance to bletchley station which will improve accessibility and enhance regeneration 
 i be happy to work with the chair of the select committee and i thank he for the evidence session we have on east west rail it be also brilliant to go to the winslow and calvert area to see that final link put in place the phase of east west rail be ready for open next year winslow station be look absolutely superb and i be so excited to see rail service come back there on the phase from bletchley to bedford as he rightly say money have be allocate from the last budget to deliver that i be certainly happy to meet he and the bletchley team to see what more they can do to enhance the station for both the and phase 
 wandsworth town and battersea park station in my constituency will soon be make fully accessible thank to the access for all funding queenstown road have be nominate for the next round of funding but a decision have still not be make can the minister tell the house when the department plan to announce which station have be successful in control period will they include queenstown road in my battersea constituency 
 i be delighted by the progress that the hon lady mention and she be right about that station i will meet official so that i can write to she with the detail i be keen to work with her local authority to see how we can use regeneration money to achieve that end as for build on the access for all step free access station that we have we will make decision shortly we have be through brilliant application and we be shortlist they for delivery i will happily write to she to ensure that she have the detail about her project

 my right hon friend be spot on as always i thank he for his work because ultimately that project would not have get off the ground without the campaigning and partnership that he provide it just show that a superb mp work in the community and the access for all station fund which have deliver project and will deliver more be a win partnership 
 passenger in my constituency of edinburgh west face consistently overcrowded train from scotrail which be take into public ownership by the scottish government in an unreliable service from avanti and now a staggering pilot from london north eastern railway in which east coast main line price from waverley to king ’s cross will increase by in some case do the minister agree that that be not provide a good service to the people of edinburgh or those anywhere else on that line it be the wrong move when we be try to encourage more people on to the railway 
 the trial with lner try to give passenger great flexibility they can now get on a train minute either side of the that they book rather than just the fix train only of fare be impact in that trial and be well value than before work with our partner at lner we be try to flatten out demand rather than have crowd train follow by quieter train we hope to change the number of passenger on train which would make for a well service overall i will happily write to the hon lady because i believe that the trial have great merit we sometimes have to be bold and try fare and ticket reform if we do not we will never change the system that many criticise for be too complex 
 thank to the support and determination of west midlands mayor andy street we will see a train station and the return of passenger train service to aldridge for the time in year which be something many people think would never happen the service will start at walsall but now that we have the west midland rail hub will my hon friend agree to continue to work with i and other to secure a service to london

 i call the shadow secretary of state louise haigh 
 the minister will have see report this week that job be at risk at alstom rail factory in derby the government tell we that they be do everything in their power to prevent those job loss but they appear to be fail it get bad this morning i receive correspondence from hitachi rail warn that despite year of representation to ministers no solution have be find that will keep its order book full and safeguard the future of staff at its factory in newton aycliffe the secretary of state have it in his power to vary contract and commission the necessary order when will he do that and protect those job 
 the secretary of state have lead for the department on the response to hitachi and alstom and their understandable concern about order as i have say we have a challenge in that while fleet can last from to year the average age of our fleet be under year we have modernise out of our carriage and as a result there be a lag with the order book we be do everything we can to work with all train manufacturer to bring more tender through those will be for the transpennine express northern southeastern and as the secretary of state mention chiltern railways the work to find a resolution be do in partnership between train manufacturer the secretary of state and the department and we hope to find that resolution 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the potential merit of dualle the north cotswold line between oxford and worcester 
 i recognise my right hon friend ’s long stand campaign on this scheme she have work alongside stakeholder include the north cotswold line task force we continue to work with local stakeholder on their aspiration for enhancement to the line 
 i thank the team of ministers for the £ that have be allocate to worcestershire county council from hs2 money to help with local transport improvement will the minister endorse a project in which we work with oxfordshire county council to find way to redouble section of the oxford to worcester line that will result in fast more frequent and more reliable service on the beautiful north cotswold line 
 as my right hon friend mention additional funding through network north will help network rail have be work with the taskforce and its consultant on timetable capacity and analysis to see whether there be a smart way to deliver additional service with few infrastructure intervention we expect that work to complete next month i would be delighted if my right hon friend would join i and leader of worcestershire and oxfordshire county councils and her neighbouring mp to discuss this matter in the come week 
 what step he be take to improve transport connectivity in city in the north of england 
 network north announce £ of investment in the north of england include £ for the local transport fund and be increase the city region sustainable transport settlement to £ from my hon friend ’s local authority lancashire county council will receive nearly £ from the local transport fund an additional £ for the bus service improvement plan and an uplift of £ for road resurfacing 
 to truly build our northern powerhouse and contribute to economic growth direct connection between city such as liverpool and preston be really important do the secretary of state agree that take out the buffer at ormskirk which be put in for purely administrative reason in the 1960 and prevent direct train be a great idea and that such service would be far enable by battery technology do he agree that that would enhance the case for stop the nonsense at midge hall station which be close by beeche in the 60 where passenger train stop but passenger can only peer out at the platform because they can not get on or off 
 it ’ true 
 i be sure that my hon friend be glad to have your endorsement for her question mr speaker the government believe that local authority be well place to promote and take forward those scheme and as i say the local transport fund in the north will mean that £ will be available for they i encourage she to work with stakeholder such as lancashire county council i have the pleasure of discuss a number of those local scheme when i recently meet its leadership on a visit to preston 
 when i have be contact by constituent excite by the news of the local transport fund i have ask my local council officer when we can begin some of these project but they have be tell by department for transport civil servant that the bulk of the money   will not come until the end of the decade when will we have some timeline for the delivery of that money i do not want my constituent to have their expectation raise unreasonably 
 i be pleased that the hon gentleman ’s local authority will get £ we have be clear that that money will come over a year period and we will shortly publish guidance for the local authority on how it can go about that i hope he will be pleased to know that we will make it clear to local council that when they put their plan together member of parliament should be involve in develop scheme so that he and other hon member can represent their constituent and their local transport priority 
 i call the shadow minister 
 if the secretary of state want to improve connectivity between our great northern city he might want to start by repair the road the backlog of local road repair have go up by this year alone to £ the network north announcement be spread over year and its average annual contribution account for only a of the £ annual increase in the backlog that be not all go to road anyway and it will go nowhere near address the damage do since when the government slash the road repair budget in half when will the secretary of state apologise to road user for the damage that his government have cause and admit that they have fail to repair the pothole 
 what the hon gentleman say be interesting we make a commitment to take the money from the cancellation of the phase of high speed to make £ available for local road maintenance—[interruption yes it be over year but we make the tranche of money available this financial year and again next financial year we will set out the allocation in due course that money be available only because we make the decision to cancel the phase of hs2 labour can not give a straight answer on that question and it have not commit to spend that £ at all driver know that they will only get that investment with a conservative government 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we be get on with deliver the plan for driver with new statutory guidance require local support for low traffic neighbourhood and strengthen guidance support mph limit where they make sense not in blanket measure as in wales if council do not listen they could see their future funding affect we be consult on remove the profit motive from council traffic enforcement while speed up traffic light across the country 
 as i just say that follow our record funding increase for improve our road with £ of reallocate hs2 funding something that opposition member have refuse to support there be nothing wrong with driving and the plan for driver which be dismiss as nonsense by the shadow secretary of state show that only the government be on the side of driver 
 i thank the minister for bus   the hon member for hexham guy opperman for share with i the list of action he manage to elicit from   north east bus operator follow my debate on real time bus information however no date be give this afternoon our fantastic candidate for north east mayor kim mcguinness be launch her vision for transport in the north east can the minister confirm that those action will be fulfil to enable she to deliver on her commitment to real time bus information as soon as possible

 there be a retendering at chalkwell and network rail find that the exist structure would not be suitable to deliver the project as it stand the design work be go on right now and building will happen next year my hon friend be right that the delay be not acceptable i will meet she at chalkwell station and bring the network rail team along so that we can talk she through the project and its challenge and if we can show how we will speed it up 
 i call the shadow minister 
 if the secretary of state be not spout conspiracy theory he be exude incompetence ashford authority warn parliament that hour of queue be a reasonable bad case scenario with the implementation of the eu entry exit system this autumn why have he fail to adequately prepare for the queue at our port and airport 
 i just do not recognise the hon gentleman ’s characterisation we be work very hard with colleague across government i recently have a very good meeting with colleague at the port of dover and we meet with other operator there be very good plan in place work be proceed at pace and i be confident that the ees will go very smoothly when introduce the plan be in place and work be under way

 i thank my hon friend he have be a champion not only for cleethorpes direct rail service but for the east coast main line timetable change that be announce in the budget we be now go through the stage with those who use the line to ensure we do not have any timetable issue like those that arise in may i hope we will come to a position on this in some week and that i can give he more detail but i very much hope to see those direct service to cleethorpes this timetable change be design to bring in great improvement such as the he have champion 
 year ago levelling up funding for the upgrade of the b714 in my constituency be announce so far no fund have be forthcoming if and when the funding be finally allocate what support can the secretary of state provide to help ensure that this funding be sufficient to fulfil the upgrade give that the cost of labour and material be now much high than they be year ago 
 that be a matter for the department for levelling up housing and communities i will take it up with the department and make sure that it write to the hon lady 
 resident in harrogate and knaresborough often face train cancellation sometimes at very short notice cause much frustration and inconvenience a shortage of driver and train crew be often the cause of the cancellation and i have raise that with the train company involve what step be my hon friend take to ensure that vacancy be fill and operational training be prioritise 
 that be a challenge the shortage of crew be largely down to sickness the level of which be about which be too high we be work with the operator to ensure that it be work on that and with the northern rail partnership to ensure there be more resilience on that line the training backlog need to be clear work in co operation with the union rather than they go on strike we should be able to ease that backlog and get a well service for my hon friend and his constituent 
 last week the prime minister fail to provide my constituent with any assurance about proposal for a train station in the somerton and langport area but he do state that money be available to invest in local transport across the country will my constituent see that money once again when will the langport transport group hear back regard its strategic business case which it submit almost year ago 
 i will happily write to the hon lady and the langport transport group so that they have a response if they feel that that be outstanding the prime minister have commit to ensure that the network   north money make available from the cancellation of high speed be spend where hs2 would have be deliver that mostly include the north and the midland but there will be other project in the rest of the country through the recycling of the funding from euston

 i assure my right hon friend that national highways work closely with local community when deliver major project and it will continue to do so on the a12 widen scheme my department be commit to deliver the scheme and grant consent for it on   january   but as she say it be subject to an application for judicial review i therefore can not add anything far but i will continue to work with her local resident if at any time she want to raise issue with the scheme with i i will be delighted to meet she 
 i thank ministers for facilitate discussion with the operator of the search and rescue helicopter service base in my constituency about the propose response time they have be fairly productive so far and we will see what the outcome be it be apparent already that the decision be make solely on the basis of the number of call and not the nature of the work undertake if the contract conform to that can we ensure that future contract do not leave we expose in that way 
 i know how important the helicopter search and rescue service be in orkney and shetland the right hon gentleman have be a big campaigner for they and have ask various question and secure various debate on the matter a review be go on about the recent incident datum which will report in the summer and we expect to publish it by the end of the year that should include the answer to his question we be invest more than £ in the new search and rescue service the number of basis will go from to overall and there will be no closure of basis and no change to service in orkney and shetland before october 
 as my hon friend will know i have serious reservation about the propose low thames crossing and its ability to tackle congestion at the exist dartford crossing many of the argument be rehearse as part of the development consent order process which complete on december as i understand it the planning inspectorate have month from then to come up with a recommendation which by my calculation be yesterday can my hon friend update the house on whether he have receive a recommendation from the planning inspectorate and what the process   will be so that i can ensure that the department understand why many of my constituent and i do not believe that the propose crossing be the answer to the problem 
 my hon friend be right in his estimation of the date a decision will be make in a matter of month and certainly by the summer i be very happy to sit down and have a discussion i will be visit the site very shortly

 i have look into this particular scheme and meet other colleague in the house about it i will write to the hon gentleman in detail i be sure we can continue with the project 
 my constituent and business face an additional tax to cross the river tamar to our main city and beyond take over such key piece of infrastructure and fund they through tax measure which they already pay would create a level economic playing field and help level up my part of the country will the minister at least give a contribution towards the maintenance of these facility so this tax do not go up again

 be the secretary of state aware that the uk use to be of the safe country in the world along with sweden in term of road accident he have campaign with the prime minister to help the driver but driver be kill more vulnerable road user and passenger than for a very long time be it not time that this government take road safety and the health and welfare of pedestrian and vulnerable road user more seriously 
 i will say thing on monday we announce a furth £ for our safe road fund secondly the hon gentleman ’s general point simply be not right i think i be right in say that out of comparable country we be good in the world we have a very good road safety record and actually that position be maintain we focus on road safety in everything we do particularly for vulnerable road user that be at the heart of all our policymaking 
 the a338 a346 which run north south through marlborough be regularly choke nose to tail with heavy good traffic the village of the ogbournes and the collingbournes be particularly affect include collingbourne ducis where a little girl be kill year ago by a heavy good vehicle that traffic should really be on the a34 and the a36 to the east and the west we have be wait many month now for the result of the north south connectivity review will the minister tell we when that will happen so that we can have a well system for manage heavy good traffic through wiltshire

 i listen to the minister ’s response early on why avanti should continue to provide rail service it sound like he be read from of its press release the litany of excuse be very long blame everyone but itself when will he listen to the leader of the north when will he listen to the people of the north and get rid of avanti 
 the point i be make be that if the operator change the contract between operator and the union will remain unless the union be willing to release there can not be a unilateral change the court would not allow it as i say that be put in place in it be suppose to end in but continue it be now effectively a part of a term and condition a change of operator will not make any difference to that i do listen to those in the north and i be delighted that i will be listen to the leader of aslef because he have agree to sit down with i so we can discuss those term i hope i can work with all member of the house to make that happen 
 my highways act amendment bill which be due to have its reading tomorrow would make it easy for motorist to make claim against local authority for damage cause to their car by neglect of road maintenance and by pothole why be the government not support my bill 
 i shall be the duty minister tomorrow and i look forward to deal with this matter 
 the government have be promise action on pavement parking for a decade but despite a consultation in we be still no far forward will the minister finally listen to disabled people parent child and local council who overwhelmingly support a ban and act to curb this dangerous problem

 i be delighted to visit my hon friend recently engage with he and deal with the individual point that he raise but i would be happy to sit down and talk to he again it seem to i that there be a way forward with bus and other form of transport to help local resident to travel to the shopping centre that he have mention surely the integrate multimodal approach be the way ahead

 may i congratulate vaughan gething on his election as minister of wales vaughan have make history as the black leader of any european country which be something i be sure the whole house can be proud of we certainly be 
 follow my question last week it be good to see that the tobacco and vapes bill have now be timetable although it look like the government will be rely on our vote to pass their flagship bill i also welcome the football governance bill finally be publish but when will we get its reading 
 this could have be our last business question before a general election in may but the prime minister bottle it he may hope that go later increase his chance but he have quickly find out that he have make thing bad he be be buffet by event rather   than be in control of they with more division more chatter and his authority ebb away day after day   the many reset be not work the public be just sick to death of tory chaos no wonder we be rise early for easter 
 the house of commons guide to procedure state that the government should reply to the recommendation in a select committee report within month so where be the leader of the house ’s response to the procedure committee ’s report on the accountability of secretaries of state in the lords it be publish over month ago and she have repeatedly tell we that she would reply to it when will she bring forward the motion just this week the foreign office have to be drag to parliament again to discuss the horrific situation in gaza and rafah it be not on she say she want the view of the lords procedure and privileges committee however i understand that she have still not contact it have she 
 let we address the elephant in the room there be an unusual level of interest in today ’s business question follow the swirl rumour and speculation thousand of column inch have be write about the unfold drama will she will not she when will it come to a head yet the leader of the house have remain tight lipped duck the question but now we have the answer the rwanda ping pong will not take place until after easter if it be such an emergency why have the leader of the house yet again delay programming this legislation she delay committee stage over christmas because of disquiet among conservative members and now she have push back furth lords amendment until after easter 
 i know the leader of the house will want to blame the lords but it be her timetable and it keep get stretch be it because the cost just keep go up and up and the scheme be unworkable on top of the £ price tag for the people the home office intend to send to rwanda the national audit office ’s damn report publish yesterday add to the department ’s woe not only be the home office spend £ a day on hotel it have waste ten of million of pound on new site to house asylum seeker that will never be use the truth be that if the government be ready to implement the scheme we would see the bill back here next week this be their timetable and their delay no else ’s 
 i know the leader of the house will be quick to herald this week ’s inflation figure as some kind of proof that the government ’s plan be work interruption i know that would get a cheer but she might be less keen to highlight the ever rise housing cost that be not include in those figure rent be up in the last year and mortgage rate be still crippling homeowner that be why for the time on record living standard have fall in this parliament 
 the under secretary of state for health and social care   the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom claim this morning that the cost of living crisis be over the government be so out of touch that it be embarrassing so can i ask about their plan for the economy they say they want to scrap national insurance altogether and the chancellor float another point cut yesterday but who be go to pay for this £ unfunded promise will it be pensioner or the health service people deserve to know 
 the last time the conservatives embark on such a huge unfunded tax cut they crash the economy and have to get rid of their prime minister i know that many conservative members be now actively discuss wield   the sword and a coronation both of which the leader of the house be accustom to but i have previously hear she in these session pay rather fulsome sometimes slightly over the top personal tribute to the prime minister give that so many be lose faith i think she might want to take this opportunity to give we another gushing homage anything less might be misinterpret last time she describe he as a signpost but deep down she know that the only direction he point towards be crush defeat 
 i have briefly emerge from under the hairdryer and put down my take a break magazine and not only find my way to the chamber this morning but remember on which side i be suppose to sit to be present and correct for business question which be quite a feat if medium report be to be believe 
 i be buoy by what the hon lady have say after all we have see inflation fall to this week real wage be rise we have positive growth household energy bill will fall by £ a year in a couple of week time average disposable income be grow and we have sign the accession treaty to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership which will create a huge number of high wage job it be confirmation that the plan be work when on thursdays the opposition focus not on these real world fact but on the westminster rumour vortex 
 i will address the hon lady ’s point in turn i join she in congratulate vaughan gething i wish he well in his new post 
 i be glad that the opposition welcome the tobacco and vapes bill and the football governance bill and i look forward to their support and involvement i be still in time to respond to the procedure committee ’s report on the foreign secretary ’s accountability to this house on which their lordship will deliberate 
 the hon lady bring up rwanda and i wish to clarify that i have no wish to blame their lordship for the delay to that bill i make it clear that i wish to blame labour lords for the delay for all labour ’s talk of be tough on border it have vote against our plan time and it have vote against our measure to stop the boat time despite its tough talk on crime labour have vote against our plan for tough sentence and new police power 
 this week we have learn that despite all the armed force frottage come from labour front benchers they be plan an eu defence pact at a time when all effort should be with nato which have standard and clear and agree principle about what it will do and under what circumstance and it have be busy ukraine kosovo iraq support for the african union baltic air policing aegean maritime security operation sea guardian a stand naval force and of course disaster relief in contrast since its creation in the eu battle group which have no such agree threshold for deployment have never get out the door 
 there could be no great metaphor to illustrate the differ approach between our party labour be all talk include minute on ferret last week whereas we offer practical action it be virtue signal over there versus result over here it be unfunded policy over there versus cost proposal over here it be no plan versus a plan that be work to borrow from the   opposition ’s new find heroine margaret thatcher if you want something say wait long enough and labour will say it if you want something do vote conservative 
 further business will be announce in the usual way 
 i call the vice chair of the backbench business committee 
 as the house may be aware the chairman of the backbench business committee be not able to be here because his daughter in law be seriously ill in hospital and it be right that he be by her side at this time i be sure the whole house will wish she a speedy recovery hon member hear hear 
 on behalf of the committee let i say that our debate in the chamber be now full until   may provide we be allocate the time by the leader of the house equally we be full in westminster hall until   may obviously we will have control of that time so all those who wish to get application in before the summer recess should do so quickly as the committee have be work overtime to process these application 
 the shocking rise in antisemitism and anti muslim hatred have be well publicise but what have not be be the anti hindu hatred occur on our campus and across our country i have the honour of chair the all party group on british hindus and it have recently publish a report on that hatred on which action be clearly require all round so will my right hon friend allow time in the chamber for a debate on hatred of british hindus and enable we to celebrate the contribution they make to this country give that it be holi on tuesday will she also join i in wish all hindus holi hai 
 may i on behalf of all of we in this place send our good wish to   the hon member for gateshead ian mearns   and his family at this time i thank my hon friend for step in for he and assist member with an advert for future business from the backbench business committee

 i call the scottish national party spokes- person 
 may i associate myself with the remark about the new welsh minister and pass on my good wish to former minister mark drakeford 
 of course we be grateful to the leader of the house for make time in her hectic schedule to pop along to the house of commons today all that leadership plot and scheming do not just happen by itself she have be a busy bee we can only pray that we be near the season finale of this endless tory soap opera but her leadership campaign have not stop she come here today so that she can ignore our question in person every thursday she display some essential quality to be the next tory prime minister for a start she regard question as a bit of a nuisance something   to be avoid at all cost they get in the way of her important work record all those youtube video about willy wonka escape monkey or whatever if member do not take my word for it they can check hansard 
 the leader of the house be right to say last week that i have not send she through detail of my many unanswered question there be just so many to compile however i be happy to offer a few reminder now we have have no answer on whether baroness michelle mone be a pay up member of the tory party as she herself claim we have have no answer on the startling increase in child poverty in england the leader of the house be far too busy to deal with those distraction and we still have no idea how much taxpayer money be waste on her government ’s initial state of the union report to the uk cabinet which be write at the height of the pandemic and be still keep firmly under wrap until we get some insight at the covid inquiry the report be still for strictly for tory eye only even now scot be not allow to know the cost or decision take to stifle our democracy 
 but with the revelation that of young scots say that they want independence it be no surprise that the cabinet panic and swing into fervent union jackery action so will the leader of the house take a moment from her busy campaign diary to answer these question i make no apology for ask they again how much taxpayer money be spend on that state of the union paper what be the strategy the cabinet be ask to endorse and when can we see the paper in full perhaps we could have a statement from the relevant minister if she do not have those answer to hand 
 before i get to the specific of what she raise i have notice a consistent hostility and unpleasantness in the hon lady ’s question to i this have be go on for some time week in fact i be get the impression that the hon lady do not like i perhaps even hat i her follower on social medium certainly do there be patronise undertone in what she say i believe she be say that i be deficient in my ability to answer her question perhaps because i be a woman i feel very intimidate upset and deeply deeply hurt as well as note her question i have be sit on the front bench fill in a hate relate report form which my official have kindly place in my folder i will have ready for every single snp colleague who get to their foot if i send the form to the scottish police they would be oblige to investigate increase the grow number of reason why they be struggle to attend burglary i sincerely hope that the snp ’s new hate crime law do not have a chilling effect on our exchange 
 i be not sure the hon lady have understand the purpose of business question the question that she have ask should be direct to department such as the cabinet office and the department for work and pensions she can ask these question of i and i can write to those departments for she but she could also cut out the middleman and write to the departments herself i look forward to receive her list of question i think it be now month overdue i will farm they out to the relevant government departments and ask they to respond to the hon lady 
 i call the father of the house 
 i wish to raise brief thing the leader of the house will soon see the parliamentary and health service ombudsman ’s report on woman ’s state pension age and its finding on injustice and associate issue the report be about the waspi woman women against state pension inequality i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   who campaign with i on these issue and see various secretaries of state will the leader of the house say how the government intend the house to respond to the reference to parliament consider the recommend remedy it be not a massive remedy but it be an important 
 secondly the leader of the house may have hear i question the prime minister yesterday about planning and building over prime agricultural field yesterday afternoon arun district council planning committee consider an application all the member of the committee look as though they be go to turn it down until the planning officer say the cost of an appeal by the developer be more than the council could afford all the member of the committee except for the conservatives and liberal then vote to leave it to the council planning officer to make the decision 
 can we have a debate on intimidation on cost by developer that make district and borough council feel they have to approve something or allow something to go through that should be oppose will the leader of the house join i in recommend the council call in the proposal and if it do not the secretary of state do 
 i thank the father of the house for his question i know the department for work and pensions will want to consider today ’s announcement about waspi woman this be a concern among member across the house and i be sure the minister will want to update the house at the early opportunity they will want time to consider what have be say today but i hope that an update will be give to colleague before recess 
 on planning the father of the house raise a worrying concern i be sure the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities will be concern to hear that people be not shoulder the responsibility to which they be elect i will ensure he have hear what my hon friend have say 
 this week i be astonish and appal to find that moat housing association in my constituency be increase rent and maintenance service charge in affordable accommodation to an exorbitant amount something need to be do about that because the increase to rent be over and the increase to the maintenance service charge be a whopping those rise be due to start in april so there be a level of urgency will the leader of the house ensure that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities look into this case so that resident do not fall into in work poverty and they be not price out of the area the housing association must deal with they efficiently and fairly and keep   to the formula initially give to resident to calculate   such increase 
 i be sorry to hear about that situation in the hon lady ’s constituency and will certainly ensure that the secretary of state hear what she have say today i hope also that the organisation she refer to have hear her word and can come to some accommodation with its resident 
 may we have a debate on improve access to gp appointment in the north central london area the number of appointment in gp practice per month be now 680,000—50,000 up on last year which be a huge improvement but a debate would give we an opportunity to discuss how pharmacy can enable people to get treatment from their pharmacist free up more gp appointment for patient with more complex condition 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this matter general practice be now deliver more appointment than they be pre pandemic and more than appointment be carry out in january of this year alone we have also bring in as she rightly point out pharmacy i think that this have be well receive in our community but of course there be always more we can do to publicise these new service which be available to everyone in our community the next health and social care question be not until after easter so i will ensure that the department have hear what she have say
