 before i begin to address the issue madam deputy speaker may i on behalf of myself and many other express our condolence to mr speaker who i know be unable to be present today because he be attend his father ’s funeral i have the privilege of serve with doug hoyle in this house from until and he be an exemplar for back bench activity during that time our sympathy be very much with mr speaker 
 turn to the amendment and particularly new clause i thank the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore   and my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries with whom i be privileged to have a meeting last week to discuss my amendment they will have a well understanding of the way i work than quite a lot of other colleague i be pleased that as a result of that meeting there be essentially an agreement an acceptance that we must try to link communication about the appalling incident of pet abduction or theft to the need for people to microchip their loved animal particularly dog and cat in the course of that discussion it be point out by the minister of state that before the bill be to become law it will be necessary for guidance to be discuss with the crown prosecution service regard exactly what the enforcement provision would be i hope that in respond to this debate my right hon friend will expand on that point 
 follow that discussion i think i would table a new clause about guidance so that any reference in the debate could include reference to the specific issue of guidance that would be issue follow the enactment of the bill i would like that guidance to set out clearly the position for people who do not microchip their cat and dog microchipping of dog be mandatory and have be since but we know that something between and of the dog in this country be not microchippe in early june it will be mandatory for all cat to be microchippe and probably about have be microchippe by now 
 i hope that we can send out a message in discuss this important legislation that if someone do not have their cat or dog microchippe they should not expect the law to rush to their assistance in the event of their cat or dog be abduct apart from anything else if they complain to the police that their dog or cat have be abduct and it have not be microchippe it be all the more difficult to identify it search for it and so on on that great principle of english equity it seem to i that if someone seek the protection of the law they should come with clean hand in this context that mean they should be able to say that they have comply with the law in respect of the pet for which they have responsibility and have microchippe they i hope people will realise that if they do not i hope that the government will point this out in the guidance have their pet microchippe they will not be able to take advantage of the benefit and special provision in this legislation 
 my hon friend be make a fair point that if people want help when their dog have be steal they should have they properly chip in accordance with the regulation i do not think puppy be include in that it be important that we think about the pet owner for whom we be try to get this bill through i know that he be not seek in any way to block it but these people would almost certainly have comply with the law and i understand that the amendment would make it far more difficult for the police while i understand the sentiment i hope he will not press this to a division 
 i will hold my counsel on that until i hear the minister ’s response if i say now that i agree with the minister before he have even say anything i would be close off an important option despite the temptation from my right hon friend i will not do that she herself have say to i in private that she think there be a lot to be say for what i be try to achieve on microchipping i have a specific amendment link microchippe to the text of the bill the guidance be perhaps another way of achieve the same objective 
 my right hon friend remind i that when the bill come out of committee it be originally put on the list of bills to be consider without debate on a friday on the basis that everything that could have be say about it have already be say and it should now proceed directly to the statute book it be with wry amusement that i see that my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth the promotor of the bill have now take advantage of the opportunity provide by have a debate on report to put down her own amendment to the bill she could not have do that if her original intention of have the bill go through all remain stage on the nod have be implement i hope she will thank i for that 
 since the bill be produce the government have bring forward some important new measure relate to microchippe to deal with the problem of the conflicting or complementary microchipping database the pet theft taskforce be commission to look into these issue of pet abduction and it strongly recommend that something be do to ensure that there be consistent database for microchipping that be accessible to vet the police and local authority i be pleased to see that the government have issue guidance and that there will potentially be new regulation on that when we meet the minister tell i that that will come into force before the end of this year hopefully that will make the use of the microchip database easier and reduce the cost of enforcement 
 obviously the priority that a bill or an issue have in the house depend largely on the view of right hon and hon member the government obviously believe that pet abduction be an important issue as indeed it be but we need to keep it in context with the burden on the enforcement authority of bring in new law and with that new penalty and essentially new pressure for prosecution that be why the guidance will be important 
 the late figure that i have show that in with dog in the country there be only report of dog theft by contrast the late figure show that in england and wales in motor vehicle theft be report every minute   we therefore need to keep the issue in context there seem to be an exponential increase in the incidence of motor vehicle theft and an inability of the police and the prosecute authority to investigate thoroughly and prosecute the perpetrator the number of motor vehicle theft be resolve by the prosecution and enforcement authority seem to be derisorily low i therefore do not think we should have guidance that essentially say to the police that deal with the potential prosecution or investigation of a theft of an unmicrochipped dog or cat should take precedence over try to find the perpetrator often gang who be steal motor vehicle to order off the street and in some case even from people ’s garage or drive 
 my hon friend be be generous in give way perhaps he might consider that the instance of motor vehicle be steal to order be a symptom of organised crime just as we recognise that pet theft be now a key contributor to organised crime 
 i accept that behind the incidence of pet theft there be organised crime but in the late figure that we have that organise crime have result in only some incident of dog theft compare with more than incident of motor vehicle theft many of which have be steal to order i accept that some of the pet theft we be experience be because pet of increase value be be steal to order so i be not say that we should not deal with that i be say that we should ensure that the guidance issue reflect the public priority and do not divert too much police resource away to concentrate on pet theft rather than other crime such as motor vehicle theft 
 that be the background to new clause which would require the secretary of state to publish guidance on the enforcement of the provision of the act i hope that in respond my hon friend the minister will say that he will do that anyway so there will be no need to include this provision in the bill 
 in our discussion of the point make by my right hon friend the minister of state be that he would prefer the bill to go through the house totally unamended i suspect however that that aspiration have be abandon because the promoter of the bill my hon friend the member for southend west have table her own amendment they seem perfectly reasonable but that would mean the bill would be amend in this place if the bill be to be amend or of her amendment could be a complement by other amendment should they be necessary in that respect there have be a development since our meeting when nobody declare a need for the bill to be amend my hon friend will speak in due course 
 i will speak briefly to some of my other point the bill as draft state 
 a person a commit the offence of dog abduction if they 
 a take a dog so as to remove it from the lawful control of any person 
 or 
 b detain a dog so as to keep it from the lawful control of any person who be entitle to it 
 it be only after have be arrest for that offence that a person could take advantage of the defence under clause 1(2 that before the allege abduction the pet be live in the same household as that person 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker as the house will be aware very serious event have take place overnight in the middle east with israel apparently strike target in iran that could lead to far very serious escalation as a former armed force minister and now a member of the defence committee may i take this opportunity to say that it be important as the house be fortuitously sit today that a minister from either the foreign commonwealth and development office or the ministry of defence come to the house as soon as possible to make a statement on exactly what we know about the attack and what the government believe the implication might be madam deputy speaker have you or the speaker ’s office have any indication that the government intend to make such a statement and if so at what time 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order as he say he be an ex armed force minister there have be no indication either to myself or to the speaker ’s office so far as i be aware that the government intend to make a statement certainly at the conference meeting this morning there be no indication that the government intend to make a statement but government front benchers will have hear his point 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker i do not for moment wish to push my luck but under the circumstance i believe that a statement be very important as you know the government can interrupt business at any time to make a statement such be the importance of these event and i notify the office of the leader of the house that i would make this point of order that i believe before the house rise this afternoon a minister should come to the house to tell we everything that the government know about what be go on i will leave it at that 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his further point of order i note that he have inform the leader of the house of his strong view on the matter so i think he be right that at this stage we leave that there 
 i take it from the ruling you have just make madam deputy speaker that unfortunately there be no application for an urgent question on the matter that my right hon friend raise if there have be such an application in the circumstance it be likely to have be grant perhaps the government when think about whether they will make a statement should take into account that so far they have be very lucky that there be not an application for an urgent question in the require timescale they be probably prepare for such an eventuality so it would be reasonable for the government to come along and volunteer a statement as my right hon friend have request 
 the hon gentleman be rather push his luck   could he return to his speech on the bill 
 you be quite right madam deputy speaker to emphasise the importance of the bill we be discuss this be not the only occasion when compare with what be happen in the rest of   the world the legislation we be discuss seem to many people to be relatively unimportant but pet abduction be a very important subject for those who be directly affect by it 
 before the point of order i be seek to make the point that people should not be charge or arrest for dog abduction if it be clear at the time of the initial investigation that at the time of the taking or detention of the dog the person who take or detain the dog the person from whom lawful control be take and the dog all live together in the same household why should a household in that situation be face with have to defend themselves against arrest and prosecution by use this defence surely it would be well and fair to require that someone only commit an offence if they abduct a dog without lawful authority or a reasonable excuse that be the background to my put forward new clause we increasingly put the cart before the horse in accuse people of crime and then force they to defend themselves against the allegation instead of require the prosecute authority to look into possible defence or excuse before make an arrest or institute a prosecution 
 amendment be design to test out whether an offence be commit if a dog be not permanently remove from someone ’s lawful control i look forward to hear the minister ’s comment in response to that 
 amendment be design to ensure that an offence be commit only where a dog be remove from the lawful control of its register keeper rather than where it be take from any other person i know it will be say that if someone be a dog walker or run some kennel and be not the registered keeper the offence of pet abduction should equally apply but in those circumstance the more serious offence of theft should be apply under the theft act again that would emphasise the distinction between somebody who be a registered keeper and whose detail be set out on the microchip database and another person to whom the dog have be give for safe keeping for whatever reason 
 amendment would test out the distinction between the requirement of permanence where someone be deprive an owner of their dog which in essence come under the theft act and the less stringent requirement under this bill amendment be a similar amendment to ensure that only where a dog be detain so as to keep it from its registered owner would there be an offence amendment be consequential on amendment and amendment be consequential on amendment 
 that bring i to amendment which deal with the key point that cause i to get engage on report because we have a great opportunity to link this new offence of pet abduction to the microchippe requirement as i understand it there be very few prosecution for people keep dog or cat without comply with the microchippe requirement the microchippe requirement in respect of cat do not become law until early june but that law be already well in place in respect of dog as with all these thing there be a danger that the government make regulation or legislate and then no proper enforcement take place why after plus year be probably the good part of dog that should be microchippe still not what be be do about that why be nothing be do about it   my amendment provide an opportunity to get the government to explain why microchipping be a good idea but only for not of dog owner 
 amendment would give the word keeper the same meaning in the bill as it have under the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations again that be a sensible and modest amendment amendment be a probe amendment to tease out from the government what be happen in deal with cat abduction when they set up their taskforce it recommend that dog abduction should become the subject of the pet abduction legislation and that at some future stage reference to cat and other pet could be make when i think of other pet i think particularly of our old next door neighbour sadly she have die who be a great lover of tortoise and have lot of they she be the subject of a cruel theft of her tortoise and i hop that in due course tortoise would come within the scope of this legislation as they can do under the provision of clause 
 i declare an interest as a cat owner my cat be call hetty part of the reason that cat have be provide for specifically in the bill a move i support be the excellent campaign run by cats protection the briefing i have receive from battersea show that there be pet cat theft in i be not sure of the equivalent figure for tortoise but i suspect it be a lot small 
 i suspect that the incidence of theft of tortoise be much high if we look at the percentage of theft in the relative population my hon friend say there be only case of cat theft and my understanding be that there be cat so if we work out the percentage of cat owner who find that they have be deprive of their cat i suspect that it be much low than the percentage of tortoise owner who find that their tortoise have be abduct 
 however i think what my hon friend ’s point show be that in the context of cat theft be hardly a really serious issue he be a cat owner i be not my family be dog lover but the be not necessarily incompatible i recognise the importance of microchippe cat obviously this legislation will not get on to the statute book until after the microchipping of cat have become mandatory and until there be criminal penalty if that be not comply with 
 i be proud to have visit the premise of the cats protection league in my constituency in ferndown which be a very important centre for the rehoming of cat and that be of the great task that that important charity undertake i be not against cat but i table this amendment to test the government ’s thinking the original taskforce set up to look into these issue reach the conclusion that dog should take precedence but the government subsequently give way because of behind the scene lobby by interest group not as a result of public consultation and support the extension of the legislation to cat 
 the taskforce ’s advice be to start off with dog and then extend the measure to cat all i be do be in a sense repeat what the taskforce say the essence of my amendment and so on be that they would enable cat to be include at a later stage under the provision of clause thereby bring the bill into   conformity with the recommendation of the pet abduction taskforce if the government do not want to do that i understand why they may not then so be it but i still think that be worth explore in debate that be why i table the amendment include amendment which be consequential on the removal of clause as be amendment and 
 the next amendment on the amendment paper be amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for southend west who promote the bill she say 
 this be a technical amendment to ensure that it be clear how the commencement of clause and operate in so far as those clause extend to england and wales rather than just in relation to england 
 who could possibly object to that however when back benchers bring forward legislation and do not get it draft by government lawyer there be always something faulty with it and ministers delight in say at the dispatch box we agree with the intent but the wording be inadequate the question i throw out for debate and discussion be this why do the government lawyer who draft the bill for my hon friend not get it right in the place why do they leave it until so late in the day before insist that this amendment and amendment be include in the bill when she address her amendment i hope that she can explain the background to that situation it show that instead of be all know and beyond criticism government drafter have some of the same frailty as member of the house when try to draft legislation even with all the expertise that the public bill office be able to bring to bear when assist we in that task 
 amendment link back to my new clause which would make the commencement of the legislation contingent on the necessary guidance have be issue from discussion i have with the ministerial team it seem that be the intent but the amendment would put that in the bill amendment be consequential and i have already refer to amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for southend west 
 that be a quick run through of the amendment i hope it will generate a proper debate and discussion and enable people who take an interest in the matter to become more familiar with the issue around microchipping include the importance of ensure that cat and dog be microchippe the burden on the enforcement authority and the deterrence that microchippe provide against those who be minded to engage in the theft of pet i hope those issue can be share more widely across the country there be a lot more detail behind the bill but there be no need for i to go into any more of that at the moment if the government can not accept new clause i hope they will be able to provide undertaking that its measure will be implement voluntarily 
 i thank the hon gentleman for pass on his condolence to mr speaker as he say doug hoyle be a great parliamentarian and a very kind person who be always there with a ready smile and good advice to all of we i pass on our condolence to mr speaker from the whole house 
 i be delighted to have another opportunity to speak about this important bill and to speak to amendment and which be minor technical amendment in my name i thank my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for his interest in the matter i hope he will forgive i when i say that his amendment seem to fall into broad group laudable concern about microchipping and legal issue about the offence as draft 
 i will start with my hon friend ’s amendment concern microchippe it be very clear that he have a great passion for ensure that keeper microchip their pet i be sure that we can all get behind that as a general point that be a very responsible way for dog and cat owner to behave microchipping be a safe and reliable way of identify animal whether they be find as stray or whether in keep with the topic of this debate they be recover have be abduct the microchip should be a lifeline to help they get home that be obviously good for the animal and good for the keeper 
 i agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend ’s wish to ensure that we be more responsible and that we encourage microchippe although i do not agree with his try to lever those principle into the bill the microchipping of dog have be compulsory in england since year ago it have also be compulsory in northern ireland since as he rightly point out microchipping have be a success story around of dog in the uk be already microchippe there be also good evidence that microchippe work the government ’s recent post implementation review of the microchipping of dogs england regulations conclude that the introduction of the regulation have increase microchipping and reunification rate with obvious benefit for animal welfare and pet owner 
 i be delighted that these benefit be soon to be extend to cat through the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations i agree with my hon friend when he say that all cat over week in england will need to be microchippe from   june   of this year in a couple of month time before this be the key point the bill come into effect indeed already more than of cat in the uk be microchippe the level be similar in england and northern ireland the amendment that my hon friend seek to make today be totally unnecessary because we will be overtake by event in relation to the microchipping of cat 
 the effectiveness of microchippe relie on keeper ensure that the information on the microchip be up to date that be what the police and the rescue centre need accurate information to enable they to reunite the keeper with their animal swiftly and efficiently as i keep say i could not agree with my hon friend more on the importance of that but i do not think that it have anything to do with the bill i be sure that my hon friend the minister will want to go into more detail about way in which he intend to encourage more microchipping 
 i understand my hon friend ’s motivation for his amendment and to to far incentivise compliance with microchipping but as i have already make clear there be a high level of compliance already   and further legislation be come down the track shortly there be also an effective enforcement mechanism where a dog in england be find not to have a microchip police in local authority have the power to issue a notice that notice will require the keeper to get that dog microchippe within day that will apply unless the dog have be certify as exempt from the microchipping perhaps by reason relate to health and it be an offence to fail to comply with that notice a person would be liable for a fine of up to £ and the same regulatory regime will soon come into force and apply to cat 
 as i have say these amendment be not necessary because we will soon be overtake by event however far more importantly amendment and to would restrict the scope of this bill considerably amendment to would remove cat from the pet abduction bill entirely as well as remove certain dog from the scope of the offence i regard that as a very retrograde step indeed and that i would oppose entirely this legislation have be a long time come it have be very carefully consider by the pet theft taskforce involve government departments and to seek to undermine it in this way be entirely wrong 
 will my hon friend give way 
 no i will not give way my hon friend have a very long time to speak and i would like to get through my remark 
 cat be among the most beloved pet in the uk there be around pet cat across the country and a quarter of household have they i must declare an immediate interest here as i have wonderful cat merlin and marmalade who be appal by these amendment which would take they entirely out of the protection of the bill 
 we hear impassioned story on read about the importance of cat to people and the heartache it would cause they if they be lose we hear about mrs landingham the cat of my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland and liesl von cat the cat of my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon we hear from my hon friend   the member for dover mrs elphicke   about her beloved ragdoll cat and we have of course hear about cats protections today 
 the cat theft report from pet theft awareness show that cat theft increase by in and more than quadruple between and this be a grow problem cat deserve the same protection as dog 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i have already say to my hon friend that i will not give way at this point 
 at all 
 oh i will give way 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for give way it be a debate and i wonder if instead of give percentage increase she could give put a figure on the number of cat theft 
 my hon friend be right to suggest that it be small it be a matter of hundred not thousand the point that i be make be that it be increase i do not believe that cat deserve less protection as we hear on reading from   the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy who be not in her place bengal cat which have a value of thousand of pound be among the cat be steal we can check hansard but from memory they might be worth as much as £ the number of cat may be small but the value of the cat both to the owner and in actual fact be significant 
 my hon friend be make a very good point it be about not just number but the emotional impact on family i declare an interest as i lose a kitten at the age of it still come into my mind when i think about this bill and how important it be it have an emotional impact on my whole family number do not give the full flavour of the impact on the community across the united kingdom who be cat lover as well as dog lover 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that point she be absolutely right whether someone ’s cat be a mongrel a rescue cat or a stray cat that they have rightly adopt and look after or i have just check hansard a £ bengal cat to the owner they be a member of the family and they deserve the same protection merlin and marmalade deserve exactly the same protection as my precious cavapoochon lottie 
 the house of commons library helpfully prepare a brief for these debate and it refer to pet theft awareness which conduct freedom of information request across a number of force some of the big force include greater manchester and other do not respond but take the figure from the metropolitan police and apply they at the same percentage rate we get a figure of around cat theft a year rather than the or so that be refer to 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for bring that more accurate information to the chamber and illustrate that we be talk about a figure in the thousand for cat just as for dog if we be to remove cat abduction from the bill as per the amendment from my hon friend the member for christchurch we would be send a clear message that cat do not matter as much as dog that would be wholly wrong it would certainly be meet with a great deal of resistance from my constituent in southend west 
 while i be on the subject of cat i would like to correct the record it have come to my attention that in committee on   wednesday january respond to a question from my hon friend the member for dover about indoor pedigree cat such as ragdoll i inadvertently misspoke when speak about extend some of the dog provision to hold indoor cat i say that clause should enable further provision to be make but that be not the case the enable power in the clause relate only to the abduction of animal commonly keep as pet other than dog and cat i want to make that clear however as i say clearly in committee and as i assure hon member then and now clause already apply in relation to the taking of a ragdoll cat 
 the amendment would exclude certain category of dog although amendment acknowledge that dog can temporarily be exempt from microchippe requirement for medical reason it do not recognise that puppy do not have to be microchippe until they be week old be the amendment to be accept a person take or detain puppy would be entirely exempt from the offence of dog abduction yet we know that high value puppy may be the subject of organised crime yesterday i consult the police and crime commissioner for essex roger hirst about the bill and he remind i as an essex mp you may recall this case madam deputy speaker that a litter of blue merle french bulldog puppy value at £ in nearby basildon be steal in its entirety in a clear case of organised crime to exclude puppy from the bill would be another extremely retrograde step 
 the amendment would have the same effect in relation to dog that have be import into england by their keeper for a holiday of less than day as the regulation do not require they to be microchippe it would also exclude certain work dog such as police and army dog that do not have to be microchippe until they be month old they would be unprotected before then 
 in addition there be a risk in rely on a definition lay down in secondary legislation that be crucial to the interpretation of the bill there be a risk of unintended consequence in the application of the offence be the secondary legislation to be amend furthermore the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations do not apply in northern ireland which have its own microchipping legislation as a result if the amendment be make the abduction of most dog in northern ireland would be exclude from the scope of the dog abduction offence another backward step 
 it be important to recognise that the abduction offence in the bill be deliberately frame around the broad concept of lawful control by not use term like keeper or owner the bill recognise that different people have lawful control of our dog at different time by change the wording as propose in amendment and a person take a dog so as to remove it from the lawful control of a dog walker for example would not be commit an offence i do not believe it be right for a dog to be afford different level of protection in law accord to the individual the dog happen to be with at any give time we know that dog be commonly abduct from park or garden when they may well be under the lawful control of a dog sitter a dog walker or another member of the family why should a dog that be steal or abduct in those circumstance be deal with differently i do not believe that it should be and think most people in this country would agree 
 in summary i believe that abduct a dog be an abhorrent crime i think we can all get behind that idea regardless of whom the dog be take from and exactly the same be true for cat although i be of course sympathetic to the underlie intention of amendment and to they move the bill far away from its intend spirit we simply can not create a tier system in which only microchipped animal be in scope of the legislation give that the legislation implicitly recognise that cat and dog be sentient being it be absolutely not right for only those that be microchippe to be protect so i urge my hon friend   the member for christchurch not to press those amendment i will leave it to the minister to address my hon friend ’s new clause and amendment 
 let i address swiftly my hon friend ’s amendment and which fall into the broad basket of legal amendment the explanatory statement to the amendment suggest that he be seek to ensure that the person allege to have commit an offence be not require to prove their innocence if they have a reasonable excuse or lawful authority for the act constitute the alleged offence i be pleased to say again that he and i agree in principle the burden in a criminal case should always rest on the prosecution that be a well and long establish principle of our english law but in my opinion the bill do just that its drafting be such that the prosecution do bear as usual the burden of proof what he be refer to be the fact that the bill place an evidential burden on the defendant in relation to the defence of reasonable excuse or lawful authority in that they need to produce sufficient evidence to raise that issue but the burden of prove the offence remain fairly and squarely on the prosecution my worry with the wording of the amendment be that they could introduce more uncertainty about the kind of burden that might be impose and could impose more of a burden on the defendant for those reason i urge he not to press amendment and 
 i turn now to amendment and which be also legal amendment they seek to restrict the offence to situation where a dog be remove or detain permanently from a person ’s lawful control the pet theft taskforce suggest an offence of pet abduction in order to move away from the formal ingredient need to prove theft of which be the intention to permanently deprive because that be more difficult to prove in relation to pet put that back into the bill take we back to a place we want to move away from again i urge my hon friend the member for christchurch to withdraw those amendment 
 finally let i turn to my minor technical amendment and to clause you will recall madam deputy speaker that my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   table in committee an amendment relate to the commencement which be agree to so the original bill be change slightly that be the main driver for my minor technical amendment which be practically stylistic in content they intend to clarify the bill ’s drafting in respect of the commencement of clause and which introduce the new offence of cat and dog abduction the amendment confirm that those clause so far as they extend to england and wales will come into force month after the bill receive royal assent they also confirm that clause and so far as they extend to northern ireland will come into force on a date appoint in an order by the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs of northern ireland for clarity the amendment be stylistic and do not in any way change the policy of the bill i urge hon member to support those minor clarification of the bill 
 i rise to support the bill of my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   and the amendment in her name and to thank my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher   chope   for all the effort thought and consideration he have put into the work he have do as i mention i lose my kitten when i be age when microchipping be not a thing it be of my most prominent childhood memory it still stay with i but if microchipping have be possible then we might have find that kitten and come back together as a family it be such an issue for a young girl lose my very pet so i thank my hon friend for all of his consideration microchipping be extremely important as he say and i be very glad that the government will bring forward legislation in the near future 
 i wish to speak briefly about a role that i have over the past few year until recently that of chair of the all party parliamentary dog advisory welfare group i praise and thank my hon friend the member for southend west for take this bill through parliament during my time as chair of that group we be able to bring lucy ’s law into legislation and it make such a huge difference to animal lover right across the united kingdom i have chair a number of all party parliamentary group and that be of the most popular that i ever chair during the pandemic up to member attend the meeting online and well over people would attend every single meeting in parliament itself we must recognise that the uk be most definitely a country of dog lover 
 i also pay tribute to the local animal welfare sanctuary in bothwell just next to my constituency which i visit very regularly it cover the whole of south lanarkshire include my constituency and i thank it for its work 
 when i chair the dog advisory welfare appg pet theft be a huge issue not only because as my hon friend the member for southend west say some of the dog steal be extremely highly pedigreed and valuable but because the fate of some of the dog be heinous often people be take the dog as bait for dog fight purpose the horrendous story that we hear in that appg underscore how vital it be that this legislation move forward it be an excellent step forward and i think it send a message to those who would try to abduct pet particularly dog and cat that it be not acceptable we wish to underscore that and this government have a mandate to do so 
 before closing i wish to give my condolence to mr speaker for his loss i do not have the privilege of personally know his father but from my understanding he have be a great servant to politic across both houses i want to pass on my condolence today madam deputy speaker 
 let i begin by say that labour strongly support the measure to tackle pet theft and abduction and i thank   the hon member for southend west anna firth   again for introduce the bill let i also echo the comment about doug hoyle and the condolence to mr speaker 
 much of the discussion in committee be about timing a subject that have come up again this morning but i will start by address amendment that have already be discuss particularly amendment which would effectively remove cat from the scope of the bill   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   seem to play an important role in this place on fridays along with some of my colleague i have feel frustrated on occasion by the degree of challenge that he present   but i think it important for legislation to be properly challenge so i thank he for the point that he have raise this morning especially in relation to the amendment relate to dog which open up a range of wide issue 
 i will not go through the amendment in detail by because the hon member for southend west deal very effectively with many of those point and i find myself in agreement with she on all of they but there be big issue involve in the way in which we register and track dog all this be complicated and i know from talk to vet in my shadow ministerial role that they worry about be drag into ownership dispute as a consequence i think it be part of a wide discussion and i be certainly not oppose to our have that discussion but i agree with the hon lady that there be a danger of our be draw into delay and also into diminish the scope of the bill which i think would be disappointing labour will therefore not support the amendment table by the hon member for christchurch 
 amendment which relate to cat strike i as something much more fundamental and we oppose it strongly as my colleague and i have argue throughout the long saga of this bill and its predecessor cat theft be a real issue i note the discussion about number but i suspect that there be a degree of under reporting the offence do not currently exist so why would anyone report it 
 those who advocate for cat be unsurprisingly appal by the prospect of the bill ’s be savage in this way cats protection tell i that 
 with own cat in the uk we know how much cat mean to family and how devastating their theft be both to the human who love they and the cat themselves 
 it say 
 in just a few week of run some supporter action we have over cat lover get involve in campaign for cat to be include in any pet theft legislation include over letter to mps it be imperative that cat be include in the bill 
 i be sure the hon member for christchurch will say that a campaign organisation make the case effectively do not necessarily lead to good law but i think the point we can take from what it have say be that there be considerable public interest in the issue and an expectation that action will be take 
 as for the microchippe issue that have be raise i genuinely believe that they can be resolve after all we do not look at other theft offence and say that we will not tackle they because what be steal could not be microchippe 
 there be a particular irony in the discussion in committee about time and whether the bill could be implement within month i think conservative member know exactly what i be go to say this could have be do fully year ago we need not have be here today this be yet another private member ’s bill that have appear as a result of the government ’s abandonment of the animal welfare kept animals bill it seem to i that the real question about this pet abduction bill be who abduct the keep animal bill and for what purpose i have ask that question repeatedly but have never be give an answer and i be certain that i will not be give today it be just another of those defra mystery like the mystery of how the secretary of state come to override the advice of his permanent secretary but that be for another day 
 the government ’s decision to ditch that major piece of animal welfare legislation have cause enormous disappointment to the animal welfare charity that have work so hard on it for year to pet owner and to member of the public all of whom care deeply about protect animal against cruelty most importantly of course it have allow the mistreatment of animal to continue we will never know how many animal might not have be abduct have this legislation be pass early i be not the only person to have say that 
 the same point be make powerfully early this month in a report by the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 the government ’s withdrawal of the animal welfare kept animals bill stall progress on key animal welfare issue these delay have allow the continuation of poor animal welfare practice the department must ensure that every provision from the animal welfare kept animals bill be bring into force during the current parliament we welcome the introduction of private member bill that will take forward vital animal welfare measure but note that the government be rely heavily on member who be successful in the private member bill ballot be willing to take on its handout bill to deliver its manifesto promise rather than commit to bring forward the legislation itself while on this occasion it may prove successful it be nonetheless a risky strategy 
 that be why we be here today discuss this issue with a piece of legislation that frankly be at risk because of the process we be go through there be no guarantee give political uncertainty and the febrile nature of politic at the moment that there will be time for the bill to reach the statute book the environment food and rural affairs committee be right to make those observation and it be deeply regrettable that contrary to what the government promise in their may action plan for animal they have fail to take leadership in crack down on the rise rate of pet abduction 
 labour will not be support the amendment table by the hon member for christchurch but i hope that the bill can proceed intact to reading and beyond 
 may i from the government benches send our condolence to mr speaker who be unable to be here today because he be attend his father ’s funeral we send our sympathy to he 
 it be a pleasure to speak about this bill which be so important to many people i thank my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for his consider attention to the bill not only today but previously and in the meeting that i and my right hon friend the minister of state hold with he in consideration of the point he have bring to the house i also thank he for his support of some of the measure that we be bring forward in the bill i thank my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   for her consider response and her contribution on report 
 let i start by address amendment and as be eloquently outline by my hon friend the member for southend west the bill already make it clear that prosecutor bear the burden of proof we want to create suitable offence that will crack down on case of dog and cat abduction and i agree with my hon friend ’s assessment that amendment and would undermine the scope for prosecution to be   bring for the offence of dog and cat abduction i too urge my hon friend the member for christchurch to withdraw amendment and on the basis of the point that i have make and the contribution from my hon friend the member for southend west 
 new clause and amendment and have already be discuss i commend the dedication of my hon friend the member for christchurch to microchippe i know he have a branch of cats protection in his constituency as do my hon friend   the member for north west norfolk james wild who rightly contribute to this debate state that cats protection have be instrumental in support the extension of the compulsory microchippe requirement to cat i be pleased about both the extension and its support for this issue 
 from the moment that an offence of dog abduction be introduce in this place mp and stakeholder alike have ask for it to be extend to cat the department have receive a significant number of letter from the public and parliamentary question from right hon and hon member in support of this proposal i agree with my hon friend the member for southend west that the government can not support remove cat from the scope of the bill however i understand that the desire of my hon friend the member for christchurch to remove cat from the scope of the bill be guide by the laudable intention of incentivising microchipping i be pleased that we very much agree on the importance of microchipping which be the good way to reunite people with lose and abducted animal 
 the government make microchippe compulsory for dog in england in and we be now extend the benefit of that legislation to cat from   june all own cat in england over the age of week must be microchippe and register on a compliant database microchipping be a safe simple and effective procedure the average cost be £ plus an average £ registration over the lifetime of the animal microchipping undeniably help to bring displace pet home in the uk around of dog have be microchippe in more than of cat have already be voluntarily microchippe 
 our post implementation review of the microchipping of dogs england regulations the predecessor to the regulation show that this legislation have have a positive effect on reunification rate stray dog that have be microchippe and have up to date database record be more than twice as likely to be reunite with their keeper than stray dog without a microchip police and local authority can and do issue notice require a dog to be microchippe where it be not already that have be demonstrate to be an effective mechanism to support compliance 
 since we introduce the english compulsory cat microchippe legislation we have be work closely with a number of animal welfare stakeholder to develop a co ordinated communication campaign to explain to cat owner the benefit of microchipping and the new legal requirement last summer we even enlist the support of our chief mouser larry the cat who himself be once an un microchipped stray before be take in and rehome by battersea dogs and cats home larry ’s tweet on international cat day explain the importance of microchippe for reunite pet with their owner receive half a impression 
 i be also grateful to stakeholder who have help to spread the message at the start of our day countdown campaign to the introduction of these measure with just over day to go before the   june   deadline we be ramp up our communication strategy with stakeholder for that final push i urge anyone who have not yet microchippe their cat to do so as quickly as possible our communication around the new cat microchippe rule as well as around this bill will provide a clear message that microchipping will help bring abducted pet back home soon 
 however compulsory cat microchipping be just of a number of plan microchippe reform last month we publish our response to the consultation on english pet microchipping reform we be commit to a number of improvement to the microchippe regime around theme make it easy for approve user to access record secondly improve the accuracy of record and thirdly standardise database operator process those reform will implement of the key recommendation of the pet theft taskforce that more robust process should be in place to stop steal pet be register to new keeper by ensure that the current keeper have up to day to object to a transfer of keepership request make to a database operator before any transfer can go through and by prevent database operator from create a duplicate microchip record for a pet we be also make all database operator record whether a pet be report as miss that will assist enforcement body and flag concern to a database operator should they receive a transfer of keepership request we be look to legislate specifically to deal with that issue in due course 
 my hon friend the member for southend west have eloquently outline how the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch would overly restrict the bill and the government can not support they my hon friend the member for christchurch rightly make some point on guidance in his new clause and amendment and ask for statutory guidance to be issue by the secretary of state i agree that guidance will be essential for frontline worker enforce new pet abduction offence ensure that those be use appropriately the government be commit to work with key stakeholder to ensure that appropriate guidance relate to this bill will be available before the bill ’s offence come into force the cross government pet theft taskforce already establish relationship with police officer operational partner and animal welfare organisation work in the area so we have a network already in place and i can confirm that conversation be already under way i will ensure that the point that my hon friend have rightly raise be part of the conversation that be already under way enforcer will have the support and information they need to effectively implement the legislation once it come into force without the need to legally require enforcement guidance 
 i know that my hon friend the member for christchurch be concerned about people benefit from the legislation when they have shirk their responsibility to have their pet microchippe i assure the house that we be do work with police colleague to make they aware that in the event that they recover an abducted cat or dog that be not microchippe they have the power to issue a notice under the english microchipping regulation require those pet to be microchippe within day 
 for completeness fail to comply with such a notice be an offence and subject to a fine of £ in addition the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations provide for the police to be able to take the animal in question to be microchippe without the keeper ’s consent and allow the cost associate with that to be recover the enforcement regime for the english microchipping legislation be design to ensure that an animal will end up be microchippe if it be find not to be we understand that most people comply with such a notice where issue so only a small number of such case be take through the court 
 in addition to the exist enforcement mechanism we be consider enable penalty notice for the offence of not microchippe a cat or dog through the animal penalty notices england regulations in summary i can not therefore commit that we will work—[interruption i be sorry i can commit i want to reiterate that that we will be work closely with enforcement partner to ensure that my hon friend ’s concern be address we be work at speed to prepare for this engagement 
 on the amendment table by my hon friend the member for southend west i thank she for bring forward these minor technical adjustment to the bill the government support they and agree that their clarity help to progress the bill specifically in relation to clause and i urge all hon member to support they 
 with the leave of the house i will respond to the debate we have make great progress and i be grateful to my hon friend the minister for facilitate that my amendment particularly amendment to be design to address the problem of potential waste of police and local authority enforcement resource in try to trace pet that have not be microchippe my hon friend in say what he do about the guidance and advice that will be give to enforcement authority get to the core of my concern 
 it have never be my intention to be anti cat my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   suggest that i do not think that cat matter i will not put myself into a category where cat do not matter because i have enough email come in already on other issue laughter cat do matter and so do dog and for the sake of completeness so do tortoise 
 i have never be against include cat in the bill but i have be nervous about do so when many cat be still not microchippe from   june that will be compulsory and as the minister say there will be strong enforcement measure give the number of local authority issue notice i do not think they be apply their mind to it but perhaps when they link that in with the prospect of complaint if cat have be abduct they will realise that there be a strong link between the issue i hope that the consequence of all this debate will be that we have a much well more complete database and that more cat and even more dog will be microchippe have a plus dog not microchippe at the moment be unacceptable 
 can not always say on a friday that we have make progress but i think that we have on this issue in the light of that i beg to ask leave to withdraw new clause 
 clause by leave withdraw 
 amendment make page line leave out 
 come into force in relation to england

 this be a technical amendment to ensure that the commencement of clause and be deal with in the same way throughout clause 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 may i put on the record on behalf of everybody in southend west our condolence to mr speaker and his family on the loss of his esteemed father doug hoyle 
 i be delighted to present this bill for its reading i be grateful to all member who have engage so passionately and share their story at all stage and i will keep my remark as brief as i can so that other member can get in i will start as i do on reading by take a moment to reflect on my predecessor sir david amess who be a true titan when it come to champion our pet particularly dog as i mention on reading he chair and speak in the last debate that we have in this place on pet reform and i know that he would be so proud that southend west be play a pivotal role in bring forward this legislation i too be proud to be build on his legacy again today 
 when i introduce the bill i start by say that britain be a nation of animal lover and that pet be part of our family i believe that our discussion both today and at all previous stage have illustrate that perfectly we be show that cat and dog be not just item and that abduct they cause real distress to family and individual because action speak far louder than word this bill will send a signal that we take animal welfare seriously in the uk 
 wonderful thing about the house be that we be often united when it come to issue of animal welfare we be unite in send a signal to the world that we believe in and be proud of our record on animal welfare of course i have lot of people to thank i thank the people who have make significant contribution in this area over many year include my right hon friend the members for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and for witham priti patel my hon friend the members for stroud siobhan baillie for dartford gareth johnson and for ipswich tom hunt the former lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland with whom i be at bar school my hon friend   the member for dover mrs elphicke dr daniel allen and debbie matthews the daughter of the late sir bruce forsyth 
 i thank the many organisation that have give input and support include the conservative animal welfare foundation which be so ably lead by chris and lorraine platt the stolen and missing pets alliance pet theft awareness cats protection which we have hear about again today the dogs trust battersea dogs and cats home refuge and of course southend ’s own tilly ’s angels which prompt i to take this bill on board 
 i also thank the brilliant essex police fire and crime commissioner roger hirst for his help and support and more importantly for all that he do to tackle pet abduction in essex tackle pet abduction in particular dog theft be a key objective in his police and crime plan as a result of his focus and the extra resource he deploy we have see a reduction in the dog theft figure over the past year he do fantastic work if anyone in essex want to help he to keep fight pet abduction they will have the opportunity to do so on   may 
 i want to emphasise the timely nature of the bill since reading new figure have be release by direct line show a uptick in the number of dog abduct in the past year with only in find and return that be the low recovery level since those figure should concern we all because of the number of pet who be traumatise and separate from their owner most of they permanently family be go without a beloved member of the family as i have say throughout that be exactly what our pet be 
 we have also see distress article in my local paper about attempt pet abduction which also seem to be on the rise only last month my local paper the brilliant southend echo carry an article about thug in benfleet who jump out of their van and hit a pensioner over the head with a lump of wood in an attempt to force he to hand over his beloved cocker spaniel thankfully the pensioner incur only minor injury and the dog be unharmed but he be obviously deeply shake this week there have be a report of another incident in benfleet a man be attack by man in woodside park who be attempt to steal his dog those report underline how important it be that we get the bill on the statute book and that the police start take action to enforce it these really be shocking incident and i implore all hon and right hon member to back the bill 
 pet need to be recognise in law for the sentient being they be their place in society need to be properly recognise by the law of the land the bill be the opportunity to do that i hope all member support it 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   on her work on the bill which be much need and i be very pleased to speak in favour it 
 we be a nation of dog and cat owner and many member will be able to say that those animal be like family and to speak about the fact that they play such an important role in our life and the life of our child i do not know where marmalade and merlin come from the newly famous southend west resident but magic and ninja come from cats protection which have have so many mention today i know through magic and ninja what an impact cat can have on family in particular child 
 in milton keynes we have an abundance of green space with mile and mile of lake shoreline and canal towpath ideal for walk dog if you need to walk a dog come to milton keynes but that bring with it the add risk of pet theft as an animal lover and the representative of a beautiful constituency in which to walk the dog i have to say that the very idea of steal pet often for profit and breeding be sick 
 the bill fill a gap that have exist in law for far too long until now pet theft be categorise as a type of property theft that be in no way reflective of the nature of the crime and its impact on victim we speak briefly about the link with organised crime it be increasingly worry that like other type of theft such as the theft of farm machinery and prestige vehicle pet theft seem to be do to order by gang of organise criminal the supply chain of organised crime be obviously horrendous to think that pet theft be finance it be abhorrent 
 in milton keynes and the wide thames valley our rural crime taskforce have recently be nearly double in size which will be a significant comfort to the many legitimate breeder base in our village i applaud our police and crime commissioner matthew barber for make that decision 
 it be critical that the punishment for this crime be enough to deter individual and group from engage in this despicable criminal activity the bill ensure exactly that i applaud my hon friend the member for southend west and the government for the work that they have do to develop it so far under the legislation offender will face the possibility of up to year in prison a fine or both the spectre of such punishment should have the desire effect organised crime group profit particularly from the trade in pedigree cat but such group will think twice about offend should the bill become law 
 the bill address difference in the behaviour of dog and cat really well dog spend much more time indoor than cat try keep cat indoor they tend to roam outside freely at their own will visit neighbours—“six dinner sid spring to mind the bill understand that distinction and ensure that for cat the offence apply only when a cat be take not when it be detain that will mean police can focus on case of clear criminality without undue interference he be no long in his place but my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   raise concern about police time this aspect of the legislation go some way to ease those concern this be sensible and practical law making the new offence mean that we can start to record the crime with well accuracy as we have hear some force record these crime specifically and other do not we will be able to spot pattern that could be link to certain factor such as organised crime 
 this conservative government can be proud of their achievement on animal welfare the bill will widen the scope of the government ’s action plan on animal welfare it be another step forward in put the uk at the forefront of animal welfare globally toughen the country ’s law against animal cruelty be a key priority that be why we have already pass legislation such as the animal welfare sentencing act which raise the maximum sentence for animal cruelty from month to year and the landmark animal welfare   sentience act which become law year ago and formally recognise animal as sentient being in domestic law the bill almost act as a strong arm extension of that act pet be sentient being whom we have to love and cherish as our own we need law that recognise that fact and crucially protect they in that regard this government have deliver and then some 
 our progress on animal welfare do not stop there we have also pass legislation require the microchipping of cat as we hear from the minister cat owner must microchip their cat by june this year that will make it easy to pick up cat that have be abduct and to identify stray pet so that they can be reunite with their owner 
 it be always a pleasure to speak in support of bills that have clear cross party support and cut through party political battle line issue such as these remind we of the common ground we have in this place and that we can put party politic aside to make progress on area of policy such as animal welfare which matter to million of people across the country 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   on her work on this bill she have work tirelessly on this issue and i have be pleased to support she at every stage include by serve on the public bill committee 
 we be a nation of animal lover as the owner of dog i will not name they again as they be already extensively record in hansard i can say that this bill provide we all with great confidence that those who would seek to steal our beloved pet will pay the price our pet be not just possession as the law have previously treat they in the bill we be acknowledge the important relationship we all have with our pet who be cherish member of our family the theft of a pet be an incredibly distressing experience for both the pet and its owner so it be no surprise that the vast majority of the public support make pet theft a specific offence 
 my constituency postbag regularly contain correspondence from constituent who have concern about animal welfare be it puppy smuggling dog on dog attack or the theft of a beloved family pet an issue that the bill address i have yet to meet anyone who do not acknowledge that the theft of a family pet would cause far more pain and anguish than that of a wallet purse or phone pet simply have far more than simply monetary value to we and it be right that the law seek to acknowledge that and mark they out as different from inanimate object 
 in prepare for today ’s debate i check with durham police on the rate of pet theft in their area and be pleased to learn that it have fall significantly from record theft in to only in although i welcome that reduction be still many and this bill will send out a real signal to far address the issue although durham have have a welcome reduction in such theft part of our country sadly still see worrying level of pet theft pet will be steal purely for the selfish retention of the animal deprive the family it belong to of the pet ’s companionship and inflict a   sense of loss alternatively pet may be steal for onward sale breed or fighting whatever the reason for a theft it be unlikely that the place the animal end up in will be well than the love home it have be take from 
 the bill must be see in the context of the wide range of animal protection legislation we have enact which recognise animal sentience increase sentence for animal cruelty give new protection to service animal revamp local authority licensing implement lucy ’s law ban party puppy and kitten sale and mandate microchippe for cat and dog of course we must also not forget the bill which i be proud to support buy forward by my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   to deal with puppy kitten and ferret smuggling 
 in conclusion our pet be our constituent dearest companion and most loyal friend and we need a specific offence with specific penalty for their theft i wholeheartedly support this bill and look forward to it complete its remain stage today 
 while we earnestly await a statement from the government on the israeli strike against iran last night i want to take the opportunity to pay full tribute to my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   for her wonderful work on this bill it be a pleasure to follow my hon friend   the member for darlington peter gibson who mention that he have read the name of his pet into hansard if he be like most of we he will now have send each pet a copy of hansard so that they know they be mention and we hope that go down well with they 
 i will come on to praise my hon friend the member for southend west at the end but perhaps i may briefly tell the house about some other people who i know will be very pleased to see this legislation pass in the house today let i begin with a great friend my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who unfortunately be detain on other important business today the issue before we have always be close to his heart he have have some horror story from his constituency about pet theft so i know that he a former leader of our party will be delighted at my hon friend ’s success with this bill 
 next be our very proactive and hard work police fire and crime commissioner in essex mr roger hirst who take this issue very seriously ably support by our dynamic chief constable mr harrington perhaps his dynamism be due in part to the fact that he use to be a paratrooper between they they have ensure that essex police be now fully integrate into the national pet taskforce tackle crime through the review of all investigation the introduction of a proactive ability to respond to intelligence and join up work with partner include crimestopper the rspca and dogwatch as a practical example my hon friend the member for southend west tell i that this proactive approach be put into action early this year when police release footage of the dachshund twiglet struggle to get away from a thief with help from the public the police be able to return twiglet safely home to her family i will allow my hon friend to send twiglet the hansard 
 i declare an interest in my boyhood i have a pet dachshund call tiger my parent have a sense of humour madam deputy speaker i love that little dog dearly when i tell he that i be take he out for a walk he go completely banana i have fond memory of tiger and if he be still with we he too would be delighted unfortunately he have pass away so there be no to send the hansard to 
 i also thank the conservative animal welfare foundation of which my hon friend and i be avid supporter brilliantly lead by lorraine and chris platt and their team who be absolutely passionate about animal welfare the clue be in the name they too will be delighted that this legislation be go through 
 finally i know that our great friend sir david amess would have be delighted to see this day david as the whole house well know be passionate about animal welfare of his great skill as you will know madam deputy speaker be work cross party it be form coalition for the common good i look up at his plaque and across to that of jo cox who also die in the service of this house she once say that we have more in common this be a nation of animal lover and what my hon friend have do brilliantly today be to get cross party support she have motivate that sense of have more in common across the house to do something that will make animal safe they can not speak for themselves we must do it in their lieu she have do brilliantly and she have another win recently on ban zombie knife i will if i may be presumptuous and say that if david be still with we and somehow my hon friend be still the mp he would be very proud of what she have do today she be turn out to be an incredibly worthy successor to my great friend and she have come up with an incredibly worthy piece of legislation i and member across the house wish her bill godspeed 
 i echo what my right hon friend   the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   have say about sir david like other member i strongly welcome this legislation i congratulate my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   on her work i be pleased that her bill have make it to this stage with wide range support in north west norfolk and obviously across the country 
 the bill introduce new criminal offence in relation to the taking or detaining of a dog or cat from the lawful control of any person as i mention in an intervention i declare an interest as the owner of a cat hetty and i pay tribute again to the cat protection league for its successful campaign which i support to ensure that cat be in the bill in clause along with dog 
 someone find guilty of abduct a dog or a cat under these new offence will be liable to a maximum of year imprisonment a fine or both which be a significant step forward and align with animal cruelty offence cover by the animal welfare act i be pleased that the bill include an enable power to allow these provision to be extend to other animal commonly keep as pet a bid have be make for tortoise already in the debate 
 pet be steal for many reason because of the breakdown of relationship or for breeding resale extortion or even dog fighting those theft have a traumatic   effect on the owner and the pet so it be right that pet theft be tackle through the creation of specific offence the origin of the bill be in the work of the pet theft taskforce which recommend the creation of the specific offence of pet abduction which be be implement through this legislation because the theft act itself be not prove effective 
 there have be discussion during the debate about the scale of the problem the taskforce conclude that reliable datum on pet theft be limited the most accurate figure that i could find for my area norfolk be through an foi response from norfolk police which show that between and cat and dog be record as steal overall battersea report around dog theft and nearly cat theft in that be likely to be significantly underreported for obvious reason as my hon friend the member for southend west mention it be about the individual case there do not need to be ten of thousand of case for this to be important legislation however i welcome the bill ’s intention to improve the recording and monitoring of these offence 
 when we legislate and pass important power such as these it be important that they come into effect rapidly so i welcome the amendment that my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   secure in committee which set a date for the legislation to come into effect month after royal assent 
 in the manifesto that i be proud to stand on committed to improve animal welfare standard and this bill deliver on that commitment as a nation of animal lover with a proud history of championing and take action on animal welfare the government have already pass a host of measure include cctv become mandatory in slaughterhouse compulsory microchipping and tough sentence for animal cruelty 
 to conclude around a of household own a dog and a quarter of household have a cat we need to protect these family member and this legislation do just that i therefore commend my hon friend for her hard work in bring the bill forward and i look forward to support it through its final stage 
 i call the shadow minister 
 let i reiterate how strongly we in labour support these measure i again thank   the hon member for southend west anna firth   for bring the bill forward i also echo her comment and those of other about sir david amess i think he absolutely would have be thrill to see this legislation go forward today i would also echo the hon lady ’s comment about the many animal welfare charity that work so hard on this and provide such excellent briefing again i think they too will be very pleased to see the legislation go forward 
 as have be say we be a nation of animal lover pet be very much a cherished part of our family we know that companion animal be sentient being who can experience pain fear and distress just as we can and we can all imagine some member have speak passionately about it today the heartbreak that be experience by any pet owner when their beloved animal be abduct 
 yet we talk about the number early the kennel club estimate that there be case of dog theft in amount to approximately dog steal every month as we have hear cat be also increasingly victim of this crime with a report by pet theft awareness find that in police record a increase and a quadrupling since 
 as we have hear throughout this process the law as it currently stand be ill equipped to deal with the problem under the theft act pet be wrongly treat as inanimate object their value be diminish to that of physical property like a tv or a toaster and that can not be allow to continue that be why the pet theft taskforce recommend in that a new offence of pet abduction be create a new kind of offence that would put the emphasis on the welfare of the animal abduct and pay due regard to their status as sentient being 
 that be what the bill do with those new criminal offence of dog abduction and cat abduction attract up to year imprisonment a fine or both to deter those who be look to exploit animal for financial gain by steal they from their owner and sell they or use they for breeding through the creation of those specific offence pet owner will now have a clear legal framework by which they can ensure that their case be actively investigate create those specific offence will also require police to collate well datum allow any pattern emerge to be properly analyse collate more accurate datum will help to formulate the good prevention strategy 
 i be delighted that we have manage to ensure that cat be cover as well as dog with compulsory microchipping it should soon be much easy for anyone attempt to ascertain whether a cat be own or lose to establish those detail i be also pleased that there be an enable power so that the appropriate national authority may create pet abduction offence in respect of more specie of animal where there be significant evidence of incident involve the unlawful taking or detaining of animal of that specie or a significant increase in the number of such incident i note in pass that the amendment be a sensible simple future proof provision like the amendment we propose to the animal welfare livestock exports bill which go through this house early this year but which the government choose to reject 
 although we welcome the bill the government have fall far short of the lofty claim on animal welfare that they trumpet at the last election there have be none of the promise action to stop british farmer be undercut by low welfare import a huge issue for famer consumer and animal welfare which the government have ignore indeed when i challenge the prime minister at prime minister ’s question this week he actually cite some of the trade deal as thing to be proud of quite incredible give the damage we know they will do there have be no implementation of promise regulation ban electric shock collar for cat and dog no sign of the promise consultation on ban snare and no action on ban hunt trophy import which be why last month another private member ’s bill be before the house this promote by my right hon friend   the member for warley john spellar seek to do exactly what the government promise in their manifesto
