i thank my hon friend for raise this i believe this government will seize the opportunity of net for work people create good skilled job and take they off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel market under past government hard work community have their pride and their job rip away and we will never do that in relation to a transition we have already see £ of investment in energy and renewable and the cbi datum show that job in wales be link to clean energy i want to see more of that both the conservatives and reform be against it 
 i thank the hon member for champion this really important issue my late mother have diabetes so i know at hand just what a struggle it can be and how important this be type diabetes be not preventable as she know but the soon we can reach people the soon we can care for they we have a screening programme in the uk available to family across the country and over child have already take part it be really important that we continue to deliver that but i thank she for continue to champion this and to raise her voice on this very important issue 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government on the potential merit of devolve the crown estate 
 i wish to start by pay tribute to sir billy boston the trailblaze welsh rugby league legend who receive a knighthood this week it be fitting that sir billy be recipient of a knighthood for service to rugby league and i commend those colleague who have campaign so hard for this well deserve award 
 this government be totally focused on take maximum advantage of the opportunity that float offshore wind in the celtic sea present for wales the industry have the potential to create more than job and bring £ of investment into the uk economy in coming year we do not support devolution of the crown estate as that would risk market fragmentation jeopardise those job and the significant investment that wales deserve 
 in contrast to that recent research by the crown estate scotland have reveal that in month period the crown estate help its tenant to generate an economic impact of £ and support almost job a decade on from the devolution of the crown estate ’s asset and revenue scottish voter be enjoy the benefit how can the secretary of state continue to justify withhold the same profit from wales when in scotland those profit be be put back into the scottish purse where they belong 
 i be afraid that i will not take any lecture on the crown estate from the snp whose mismanagement of the scottish seabed have see scottish asset sell off on the cheap we be focus on do whatever it take to secure the more than job and billion of pound of investment that the crown estate can help to unlock for wales 
 devolve the crown estate sound like such a wonderful idea but the truth be that it really be not and the continued lobbying and   loud chat about devolve the crown estate be jeopardise future investment in wales and job do the secretary of state agree 
 my hon friend be absolutely right if we be to devolve the crown estate and introduce a new entity that would risk market fragmentation complicate exist process and delay further development offshore jeopardise those job and that investment even if it could be do without risk the revenue that would not automatically lead to more money for the welsh government because any revenue they retain would likely be offset through reduction to the block grant as be the case in scotland meanwhile wales would no long benefit from crown estate asset and profit in england 
 there be no long term vision torfaen council have vote unanimously to devolve the crown estate to wales which mean that every local authority in wales include every labour run council support the policy do the secretary of state really believe that the uk labour government know well than the entirety of welsh local government when wales speak with voice be not it time that wales ’s voice in the cabinet say the same thing 
 i refer the right hon lady to my previous answer 
 be that the answer it be hardly even look at the question 
 in opposition the secretary of state for wales join plaid cymru in condemn the conservatives for deny wales £ in rail funding now in government she be wax lyrical about of that and she be recently content to move the goalpost and deny wales a furth £ by classify the oxford cambridge line as benefit wales i do not know how they make this up do she oppose that new injustice or be she ignore or be it her mission to see wales short change 
 i listen carefully to the right hon lady ’s question and i be sure that she would not wish unintentionally to mislead the house the situation regard the oxford cambridge line be an error make by the conservative government in the spending review and as she know heavy rail infrastructure be reserve not devolve so for every heavy rail project in england barnett consequential do not apply the uk government fund that be fund east west rail be also direct funding project in wales such as the redevelopment of wales ’s busy station cardiff central improvement to level crossing in north wales and upgrade to the south wales relief line i know that all welsh labour mp be look forward to hear what the chancellor have to say today about rail investment after all their excellent advocacy on behalf of people across wales 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of increase defence spending on wales 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the government ’s increase defence spending on wales 
 in the spring statement the chancellor announce a £ increase to the defence budget for that will help grow the welsh economy and our thriving defence sector in wales which be home to more than job support by the ministry of defence and major company such as qinetiq bae systems airbus general dynamics and thales as part of the strategic defence review a £ boost be announce for the repair and renewal of military home in wales benefit hundred of service family 
 i be glad that the government ’s strategic defence review be launch in scotland last week where increase defence spending will create new job and fuel economic growth despite the snp ’s refusal to back it i be similarly pleased that the sdr include hundred of million of pound of investment in force housing in both wales and scotland will the minister update the house on the positive impact that the review will have in wales and across the union 
 i warmly welcome the £ boost for military home in wales part of the £ spend to tackle the state of armed force accommodation in this parliament that will support urgent repair such as fix boiler and roof and tackle damp and mould and facilitate the long term renewal of military housing for hundred of service family across wales that follow our action to bring home on the defence estate include more than in wales back into public ownership 
 the strategic defence review will make wales and the rest of the uk safe at home and strong abroad just as it will my constituency of gillingham and rainham do the minister agree that the sdr be further proof that only labour can be trust to protect our union while opposition member wring their hand wish they do more when they be in power or look for way to make apology for foreign aggression 
 i agree with my hon friend the conservatives fail to deliver a plan for our defence industry and leave our home for hero in poor condition and while plaid cymru plot to leave nato and reform cosy up to putin labour invest in our military our security and our veteran 
 the minister sound unexpectedly optimistic give that so many question mark remain over promise and aspiration for defence spending can she confirm the impact of handing over the chagos island and billion of pound to mauritius interruption can she confirm the impact of that decision on wales 
 i want to focus on the benefit for wales from the defence budget that be what these question be about this spending will bring the industry more job and upgrade our military home in wales 
 i call jim shannon on wales 
 i welcome the government ’s increase spending in wales it be good for job and opportunity and secondly those in uniform whether in the army the royal air force or the royal navy come from all over the united kingdom from wales scotland and northern ireland do the minister acknowledge that the new spend on defence could be share proportionately between those country be it on those who serve in uniform or on company that be involve in the defence sector 
 as i be sure the hon gentleman know northern ireland benefit considerably from company such as thales bid into that defence fund for many year there have be many excellent service personnel from northern ireland i be sure that he will look after they when they become veteran 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 give how precarious global affair be conservative believe that defence and defence job should be a no priority for the labour control wales office major defence company such as general dynamics in merthyr and caerphilly and tekever in ceredigion among other await answer plaid want to break up the cherished union withdraw wales ’s full membership from nato and surrender our nuclear defence system be the minister seriously concerned about that and if so will she rule out her labour senedd colleague ever form a coalition with the nationalist in an expand cardiff bay 
 i be sure i do not need to remind the hon lady that defence be a reserved matter those decision will be take in this uk parliament and it be up to the welsh senedd how it form a government follow the election next year

 actually the positive impact that our uk and welsh labour government be have be clear in how the welsh economy be change employment have increase significantly in wales unemployment and economic inactivity have fall and real total wage have increase right across the uk 
 the safety and maintenance of coal tip be a totemic issue in wales include in my constituency of cardiff west the relationship between the welsh government and this labour government and the funding for coal tip in the last budget signify the importance of the union between our government can the secretary of state tell i why when give the opportunity to vote on this issue in the senedd in march plaid cymru vote against coal tip funding 
 my hon friend raise an important point ensure that coal tip across wales remain safe be of the utmost importance and unlike the conservative government we commit £ of funding this year for essential work to keep tip maintain and safe quite why plaid cymru and the conservatives vote against that additional funding in the senedd be beyond i they need to explain that to our former coalmine community

 the hon lady ’s party which be in government for year be in power when wales get of the rail enhancement budget although it have of the whole uk network her party be responsible for the historical underfunding of welsh rail and we will hear from the chancellor this afternoon about what this government be go to do about it

 my hon friend have great expertise have work for many year in the nhs as a gp and i support the work he be do as he have point out our plan for change have cut waiting list in his local trust by almost and we be go far include through state of the art radiotherapy machine roll out across the country there be go into my hon friend ’s constituency and more scanner be go to   other hospital trust include hospital in the constituency of the leader of the opposition this be all make possible by the decision we have make and i know that the leader of the opposition will want to stand up and welcome that 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 perhaps the prime minister know something i do not because there be only hospital in my constituency 
 since labour take office inflation have nearly double growth have halve and unemployment have surge be this what the prime minister mean when he tweet that the economy be improve 
 since the general election more people be in work i know that the right hon lady do not mention that she be fixate on talk britain down we be invest in the future even in the last week we have have the strategic defence review with new job build submarine yesterday we have the sizewell announcement which will create new job and there will be ten of thousand of construction job build the social and affordable housing that be announce this morning that be the difference that labour make in government 
 the prime minister must be talk about a different economy all of we in this house hear about unemployment increase unemployment have increase every month since labour take office last year the prime minister say that he be take the winter fuel payment away to balance the book but the book be not balance in fact they be bad this year the deficit be forecast to be £ high since the budget not since last year ’s election but since the budget in what way be the book now balanced 
 the right hon lady have obviously miss the interest rate cut the growth figure for early this year the strategic defence review £ go into local transport free school meal sizewell and social housing she stand at the dispatch box to lecture we and i see that liz truss be obviously back in vogue advise reform officially now and haunt the tories i remind the leader of the opposition that the shadow home secretary who i think be then chief secretary to the treasury give the liz truss budget out of the leader of the opposition say that what be wrong with liz truss ’s budget be not necessarily the package that be all right but the way it be sell the tories have learn absolutely nothing 
 the prime minister love talk about liz truss why because he want to hide from his own economic record he be a coward every time he stand at the dispatch box and talk about liz truss it be because he be scared of talk about his record and what be happen to the economy out there 
 let we bring the prime minister back to the u turn that he be run away from a u turn on a policy that his mps go out defend time and again let we go through what be happen here minute they say that it be right to take the winter fuel payment away because there might be a run on the pound the next   minute they say it be right to give it back this be laughable the prime minister stand there all puff up and self righteous why can he not just admit that he make a mistake 
 the conservatives leave a £ black hole that we have to fill and that be why we take the right decision we have stabilise the economy which be why we have see interest rate cut we have commit to the triple lock which the opposition say be unsustainable that be £ for most pensioner and we have have good quarter growth week ago i say that i want more pensioner to be eligible for the winter fuel payment i be really pleased that we set out the threshold and the certainty that be need the right hon lady say that i do not want to talk about our record but what about trade deal record investment free school meal breakfast club social and affordable housing the defence review sizewell we could go on all morning but the chancellor will say even more in a minute at the weekend the right hon lady say that she would be get well in the role she could start by apologise for the liz truss budget that would be well 
 i get well every week the prime minister get bad last week—[interruption 
 order i say to the member shout that if you think that be a good look let i tell you that it be a very bad look think twice before you try to shout somebody down in that way i call kemi badenoch 
 last week the prime minister have to get his line from the russian embassy i think we all know that he be get bad and what he do not want to talk about be how he be go to make the economy well that be what the people out there want to hear and he have get no answer his trade deal have unravel with the strategic defence review everyone out there be ask where the money be come from the fact be that he do not know how to balance the book the chancellor say that the winter fuel payment u turn will not be fund through high borrowing so will the prime minister admit that it will be fund by put everybody ’s taxis up 
 i think the right hon lady let slip on the matt forde programme the other day that she rehearse her fury for pmq so there be a very good rehearsal this morning i think she ask what we be do at the budget we put record investment in our nhs and our public service she come every week to carp on about national insurance but she do not stand there with the courage of her conviction and say that she will actually reverse it the reason she will not be because she will not stand up and say she be against the investment in the nhs she will not stand up and say she be against the investment in our public service we will all listen very carefully in just minute when the chancellor lay out more record investment as to whether the conservatives welcome it or whether they say they would not support it 
 every week i come here to tell the prime minister the truth the truth be that the economy be in a spiral because labour all of they put up taxis which cut growth we all hear the prime minister   he do not rule out tax rise so the government be go to have to put up taxis even more this be a spiral if that be not bad enough this morning we hear that because of his terrible chagos deal mauritius be scrap income tax why on earth should the british taxpayer pay £ for tax cut in mauritius 
 diego garcia be a vital intelligence and strategic capability and it be absolutely clear that legal uncertainty would compromise it in very short order that be why the conservatives start the negotiation in relation to it and no responsible prime minister would let that happen we have secure the base for the long term that have be welcome by our ally by the us by nato and by australia new zealand and india it have be oppose by our adversary by russia china and iran in the column we add reform follow putin and the tories follow reform 
 the prime minister know this have nothing to do with national security it be his bad negotiating i have have the security briefing it be a bad deal before and it be still a bad deal in half an hour the chancellor be go to stand up and tell we that everything be fine but the truth be that she have make bad choice bad choice that mean high inflation bad choice that have lead to low growth and bad choice that have mean that job have be lose every single month since labour come into office that be hundred of thousand of family who have lose their income in stoke grangemouth and luton those be their constituency and business across the country the chancellor have lose all her headroom she have fall out with the cabinet she be make unfunded spending commitment which she promise not to do be the truth not that we have get the wrong chancellor and the wrong priority 
 the wrong choice that they make be make the right hon lady the leader of the opposition 
 belate birthday greeting to you mr speaker 
 it be wrong for any labour government to try to balance the book on the back of disabled people and no labour government should ever do it but it be what the prime minister will ask the house to do in just a few week time many of we will not be able to go along with that because it will mean that people who need assistance to cut up their food to wash themselves to dress themselves and to go to the toilet will lose the personal independence payment that they currently receive they will lose that vital support this week the prime minister change direction on winter fuel payment will he do the same in relation to this matter and drop these disability benefit cut 
 it be very important that we make the change to our welfare system it be not work and it need reform i think everyone agree with that it do not work for anyone we will do this on a principled basis namely that those who can work should work that those who want to work should be support so that they can do so and that we must protect those with the most severe disability who will never be able to work and we be do that by end reassessment and pay a new premium 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 let i join other in wish you a belate many happy return for yesterday mr speaker let i also welcome the government ’s sanction on ministers in the netanyahu government ben gvir and smotrich the settler violence that they have incite against innocent palestinians on the west bank be intolerable and the government be right to act 
 as it be carers week may i pay tribute to the million of unpaid family carer across the country recognise the challenge that they face the last conservative government leave our health service on its knee we have hear report that the nhs will receive extra funding in the spending review and if it do we will support that but do the prime minister agree that no amount of money for the nhs will solve its crisis unless we also invest to fix care without pre empte the chancellor ’s statement will he reassure i that both social care and family carer will be give the priority they deserve in the spending review 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman that the health crisis create by the previous government can not be—[interruption opposition member groan but that be exactly how the country feel about the last year and the mess that they make of everything yes we do need to fix social care as well as put money into the nhs we be put record amount into the nhs which be the right thing to do and we be see the result we promise extra appointment in the year of a labour government and we have deliver so there will be that extra funding but let i gently say to the right hon gentleman that while he welcome all the extra funding he can not at the same time simply say that he be against any way of raise the money for the funding there be an incompatibility there 
 the prime minister know that he have a fair and well way of fund nhs investment and i regret the fact that he do not answer my question about care but let we move on 
 the prime minister be right to increase defence spending and later we will hear about the difficult choice that the chancellor have have to make partly to fund that defence expenditure but there be freeze russian asset worth £ in the uk right now billion that could be use to stop putin ’s war machine and to boost britain ’s defence industry even fast at the g7 summit this weekend will the prime minister seek an agreement to seize those frozen russian state asset and use they to support ukraine 
 as the right hon gentleman know that be an issue that be be consider but it be complicated and there be a great many countervail factor that need to be carefully balance in any decision we be talk to ally about it but i do not want to pretend to the house that there be an easy answer on this because there be not 
 more job cheap bill that be our promise on net if we can not meet those goal we must consider our approach in pembrokeshire we have a proud industrial history root in oil and gas and an   incredibly exciting opportunity in respect of float offshore wind in the celtic sea can the prime minister assure i that he be committed to a just transition that protect and create job 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this i believe this government must seize the opportunity of net for work people create good skilled job and take they off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel market under past government hard work community have their pride and their job rip away and we will never do that in relation to a transition we have already see £ of investment in energy and renewable and the cbi datum show that job in wales be link to clean energy i want to see more of that both the conservatives and reform be against it 
 with your indulgence mr speaker i will briefly pay tribute to the police service of northern ireland for tackle the public disorder in northern ireland over the last night with over police officer injure i be sure the whole house will want to join i in that and in condemn the racist violence 
 whether it be the cardiac scandal at the royal victoria hospital in belfast the cervical smear scandal at the southern trust the covid bereaved family or the crash of chinook zd576 all of which have impact my constituent in lagan valley the common thread here be that family simply want the truth but they be let down by institution at every cut and turn will this government urgently introduce a duty of candour bill and ensure that it reflect what the hillsborough law now campaigner and family have fight so very hard for 
 may i start with the important point that the hon lady make about ballymena i utterly condemn the violence that we see overnight in ballymena and other part of northern ireland include against psni officer it be absolutely vital that the psni be give the time it need to investigate the incident concern rather than face mindless attack as it seek to bring peace and order to keep people safe the northern ireland secretary be in touch with the psni and the executive and i be be keep update in relation to that 
 in relation to the tragic case that the hon lady mention i thank she for raise they it be important that we have a legal duty of candour and we will be introduce that because as she say there must be the truth here base on all people be deal with on the basis of dignity fairness and accountability 
 in the word of the former israeli prime minister what we be witness in gaza be the

 my drive purpose since i become chancellor be to make work people in all part of our country well off to rebuild our school and our hospital and to invest in our economy so that everyone have the opportunity to succeed after year of mismanagement and decline by the party opposite culminate in a £ black hole in the public finance that be the conservative legacy and the job i face as chancellor be to set it right so at the budget last october and again in the spring i make the choice necessary to fix the foundation of our economy we waste no time in remove the barrier to growth the big overhaul of our planning system in a generation launch britain ’s national wealth fund and reform our pension system to unlock billion of pound of investment into our economy 
 we be start to see the result the stability we have provide have help support cut in interest rate save hundred of pound a year for family with a mortgage real wage have grow by more in the month of this labour government than in the year of the conservative government and the late figure show that we be the fast grow economy in the g7 country around the world be line up to do business with britain again with new trade deal with india the united states and the european union 
 we be renew britain but i know that too many people in too many part of our country be yet to feel it this government ’s task my task as chancellor and the purpose of this spending review be to change that to ensure that renewal be feel in people ’s everyday life in their job and on their high street the priority of this spending review be the priority of work people to invest in britain ’s security and britain ’s health and to grow britain ’s economy so that work people be well off

 in this spending review total departmental budget will grow by a year in real term compare that to the conservative choice of austerity in contrast to our increase of they cut spending by a year in let we be clear austerity be a destructive choice for both the fabric of our society and our economy choke off investment and demand and create a lost decade for growth wage and living standard that be their legacy 
 my choice be different my choice be labour choice the choice in this spending review that be possible only because of my commitment to economic stability and the decision this government have make the conservatives fiscal rule guarantee neither stability nor investment and that be why i change they my fiscal rule be non negotiable and they be the foundation for stability and investment 
 my rule be for stability day to day government spending should be pay for through tax receipt that be the sound economic choice it also the fair choice because it be not right to expect our child and future generation to pay for the service we rely on today this rule allow i as i set out in the budget to allocate £ more to the day to day run of our public service over the course of this spending review compare with the previous government ’s plan 
 my fiscal rule enable i to invest in britain ’s economic renewal while get public debt on a downward path this rule allow i to increase public investment by more than £ in the autumn and a furth £ in the spring that be investment to rebuild our transport network our defence capability and our energy security in short to grow our economy 
 i have make my choice tough decision for stability and change britain ’s fiscal rule for investment today i be deliver that investment for the renewal of britain now it be time for the party opposite to make their choice the spending plan i be set out today be possible only because of the decision i take in the autumn to raise taxis and the change to our fiscal rule every of which be oppose by the party opposite today they can make an honest choice and oppose these spending plan as they oppose every penny i raise to fund they or they can make the same choice as liz truss spend more and borrow more with no regard for the consequence 
 in their clamour to cut taxis for the rich the conservatives crash our economy send mortgage rate spiral and put our pension in peril i will never take those risk yet reform be itch to do the same thing all over again   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   may be play the friend of the worker now but some of we be old enough to remember when he describe the disastrous liz truss budget as the good conservative budget since the 1980s interruption mr speaker after the damage be do he still nod along reform have learn nothing his party have be in parliament for less than a year yet it have already rack up £ of unfunded commitment reform be simply not serious every day it become clear that it be labour and only labour that have a credible plan for the renewal of britain 
 as i say in my spring statement the world be change before our eye since the spring the challenge that we face have become even more acute the sign of our age of insecurity be everywhere so we be act on the promise in our plan for change building renewal on the foundation of national security border security and economic security as the prime minister say early this month

 a more unstable world present new challenge at our border too conflict have open the way for organise criminal gang the british people rightly expect we to have control of who come into our country the conservatives say that they would take back control well mr speaker they lose control with fail policy after another there be no control and no security in contrast in the budget last year i announce £ to establish the new border security command and today to support the integrity of our border i can announce that that funding will increase with up to £ more per year by the end of the spending review period for our new border security command 
 alongside that we be tackle the asylum backlog the conservative party leave behind a broken system billion of pound of taxpayer money spend on housing asylum seeker in hotel leave people in limbo and shunt the cost of failure on to local community we will not let that stand i can confirm today that lead by the work of my right hon friend the home secretary we will be end the costly use of hotel to house asylum seeker in this parliament funding that i have provide today include from the transformation fund will cut the asylum backlog allow more appeal case to be hear and return people who have no right to be here save the taxpayer £ per year that be my choice that be labour ’s choice that be the choice of the british people

 if we want a strong economy where work people can fulfil their potential we must have a strong nhs not as the reform party have call for an insurance base system we believe in a publicly fund national health service free at the point of use perhaps the hon member for clacton should spend more time focus on the priority of the british people and less time in the westminster arms although after this week perhaps the chairmen pub might be a well fit

 i call the shadow chancellor 
 this spending review be not worth the paper it be write on because the chancellor have completely lose control this be the spend now tax later review because the right hon lady know that she will need to come back here in the autumn with yet more taxis and a cruel summer of speculation await 
 how can we possibly take this chancellor seriously after the chaos of the last month we be assure at the election that labour ’s plan involve barely any additional spending or borrowing now the chancellor parade she largesse with hundred of billion in additional spending over this parliament the initial profile for that spending be of course significantly front load but the chancellor now expect we to believe that she will let spending rise by only a year there be no chance whatsoever of that happen for the lesson of the last year have be that when the going get tough the right hon lady blink 
 she present herself as the iron chancellor but what we have see be the tinfoil chancellor flimsy and ready to fold in the face of the slight pressure she say she would not fiddle her fiscal rule then she do she say that she would not make any unfunded commitment with the humiliation of the winter fuel u turn she just have she look business leader in the eye and say no more taxis but we all know what happen next and we all know what be come in the autumn her own back benchers her cabinet colleague labour ’s trade union paymaster and even the prime minister himself have all see that she be weak weak weak they can smell the blood they will be back for more and they will get it 
 these spending plan be a fantasy and be it not the truth that the chancellor have to maintain this fiction because she have leave herself no room for manoeuvre   she be constantly teeter on the edge of blow her fiscal rule which she have already change to allow even more borrowing the only way she can claim to be meet her rule be by pretend that she can control spending over the come year but let we look at the record so far borrow in the last financial year come out £ above even the office for budget responsibility ’s march forecast and high than the plan she inherit from the conservatives 
 for someone so keen on borrowing the chancellor seem strangely reticent even to use the word indeed ministers bizarrely tell we that it be labour ’s fiscal rule themselves that have generate investment the reality be a little more straightforward they have loosen the fiscal rule so they can borrow more they borrow and borrow and borrow allow the national debt to continue to rise higher every single year while ministers pretend that it be not there will be an eye watering £ of additional borrowing in this parliament compare with the plan set out in the last conservative budget with £ more to be spend on debt interest alone in fact if the chancellor have retain our fiscal rules—[laughter labour members may laugh but if she have retain our fiscal rule as she say she would before the election the obr have confirm that she would be break they right now 
 our country be now vulnerable to even the small change in the bond market should we face a sudden external shock we have no fiscal firepower leave with which to respond all thank to the right hon lady ’s choice so can i ask the chancellor will she be open about what she have do will she admit that she have make a conscious choice to borrow more and to accept high debt do she accept that this mean interest rate and mortgage will be high than they would otherwise have be as the obr itself have say give that she continue to claim that she have bring stability to the public finance can i ask she what on earth her definition of stability be 
 the chancellor must be delighted that she do not have to face a new obr forecast today because if she do she would have to set out how she would fund her humiliating u turn on winter fuel payment have already blow the saving on buy off her trade union paymaster last year she say this week that there be still 
 work to do to ensure the sum always add up 
 from the person in charge of the nation ’s finance that be hardly reassure you do not need to have work at the bank of england for a decade to know that that pitiful utterance be unlikely to soothe the market 
 so can the chancellor confirm categorically that there will be no additional borrowing to pay for this chaotic reversal and if that be the case can she explain how on earth it can be pay for without raise taxis can she explain why last summer apparently to avoid a run on the pound this measure be so urgent that pensioner have to be leave in the cold over the last winter what exactly have change because it certainly have not be make possible by an improvement in the economy or the public finance which the institute for fiscal studies say this week be both in a bad state now than when labour come into office 
 if we have an obr forecast we might also get some answer on how the government intend to find £ to abolish the child benefit cap which we be lead to believe be imminent another addition to the ballooning   welfare bill another expensive surrender to the labour leave and we would certainly get the obr ’s assessment of the economic outlook follow the tariff change that the right hon lady know full well be come meanwhile her deluge of taxis and regulation have leave business confidence at record low cost people their livelihood only yesterday we see the late evidence of that figure for last month show that the number of people on payroll fall by more than after already fall by in april unemployment be up by more than since labour come to office 
 the right hon lady may trumpet extra spending today but be it not the simple truth that she have trash the economy and leave no contingency in the face of a highly volatile global outlook be it not the reality that the chancellor know she will have to come back in the autumn with more tax rise to fund these plan or can she assure we right now that this be not the case yes or no we know that the deputy prime minister have helpfully provide she with an entire brochure of tax rise that she will no doubt be peruse over the summer the corbynist catalogue can the chancellor confirm that as promise the income tax threshold will not be freeze at the budget a move she herself say would hurt work people 
 what about the uncertainty in the departmental spending plan that the chancellor have set out today can she assure we that these plan will not be top up and that no backroom deal have be cut with disgruntle cabinet ministers can she assure we that the capital allocation announce today will actually be spend on capital and will not be divert in year as she have do in the past to day to day budget to play more game with her fiscal rule
