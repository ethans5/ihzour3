 i know member across the house will join i in pay our respect to his holiness pope francis i offer my sincere condolence to scotland ’s catholic community who have this easter lose a much loved and compassionate leader

 before you do so mr speaker i have well answer his question laughter too excited about st george ’s day so i be mr speaker 
 we should all be proud of scotland ’s university the contribution they make to scotland ’s public life and their reputation as the good in the world but year of the scottish national party have leave some of those proud institution in dire strait job cut and course closure be the inevitable product of the snp ’s decision to deliver a real term cut to scottish student funding since scotland ’s university their staff and their student all need a scottish government with a proper plan to turn this crisis around they need a new direction with scottish labour 
 i thank the secretary for state for his answer and for his comment about the pope i make my response within the context of my entry in the register of members financial interests and i note my membership of the university and college union 
 the university sector in scotland have never be in a bad state it be in a state of crisis with job loss both compulsory and voluntary be contemplate across the whole sector in scotland it be young scot who be pay the price to balance the book the scottish government be limit the number of young scot who can go to university force university to rely more and more on the recruitment of student from overseas to be clear that mean that scot be often sit at home unable to access a place because student from overseas with low qualification be get those place do the secretary of state agree that scotland ’s young people must be support and the university sector must be fully fund in scotland 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for what he do to support high education in scotland thank to the snp ’s high education financial crisis as my hon friend say too many scottish student be miss out on place labour have commit to ensure that scottish student from all background can access university and that can only be achieve with a new funding settlement that both protect our world lead university and give any scottish student who want to pursue university the opportunity to do so i be proud to have make it from wester hailes education centre in the wester hailes scheme to the university of edinburgh but that story be become all too rare under the snp government it be time for a new direction for scottish university 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s remark about the passing of his holiness pope francis i also wish all those not fortunate enough to have be bear north of hadrian ’s wall a very happy st george ’s day 
 while he be not a graduate of the university of aberdeen like i the secretary of state be a beneficiary of a scottish university education scotland have some of the fine and most respected high education establishment in the world but as we see last week at the university of aberdeen in warning from the university of edinburgh and most starkly at the university of dundee where over job be be shed to make emergency saving the current funding model oversee by the snp be fail our institution and our young people i know we agree on that but will the secretary of state also acknowledge the devastating impact on scottish university budget of his own government ’s national insurance increase add £ to their salary bill or will he continue to defend that job killing anti growth tax on worker 
 the shadow secretary of state be defend the snp ’s dreadful record on high education in scotland it be clear from the principal of the university of edinburgh sir peter mathieson that the problem the university be have to deal with be cause by the underfunding of student from scotland which have mean the book have have to be balance with an ever increase number of international student the number of international student at the university of edinburgh for example be still go up although not as high as project and that be the major cause of the financial problem at scottish university the conservatives would do well not to hide behind the snp and support it in that process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s comment about the death of pope francis 
 in a rare consensus i agree with much of what have be say by both the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state many university be extremely concerned about the funding situation many of my constituent who be employee of university or who have child at scottish university be concern particularly follow the news of the job cut at the university of dundee i have speak to the principal of the university of edinburgh and he be also concerned about the funding model in scotland which be fail everyone will the secretary of state discuss with the scottish government how they can make change and put pressure on they to do so the national insurance change be not helpful so it would help scottish education if we have some change there as well 
 the hon lady ’s question be slightly contradictory on the hand she do not like the national insurance contribution increase which have give the scottish government a £ boost the high settlement in the history of devolution that money should be go to the frontline of high education but it be not on the other hand she talk about a more generous funding settlement for university she can not have it both way the funding model must change and the scotland office be in touch with all our university principal to see how we can work through this issue this be a problem with the funding of high education as a result of snp policy and the scottish government 
 i associate myself with the comment about the devastating loss of pope francis and the compassion that he show to the most vulnerable in our society on a happy note i wish all friend and family a very happy st george ’s day i also note my entry in the register of members financial interests in relation to high education 
 the secretary of state will know that the big financial impact on high education in scotland have be westminster policy which be why the sector in the uk face some challenge we have the national insurance increase brexit which i know he passionately oppose or use to anyway and the hostile environment labour find common ground with michael gove on stick he into the house of lords but it also find common ground with he on his commitment to decentralise migration that have have a particular impact on the high education sector not least in dundee which have have the big financial hit will the secretary of state let we know what progress he have make on that commitment by scottish labour 
 may i give the hon gentleman and all his snp colleague our deep condolence on the loss of christina mckelvie i think this be the time that we have have scottish question since then 
 i say again that the hon gentleman and his snp colleague vote against the budget which deliver an extra £ for public service in scotland some of that should have go to frontline service include to ensure that our high education sector be fund   properly in the scottish context the snp be very good at blame everybody else for power that do not belong to it but what it should actually do be get a mirror in the last day the only increase it have make in use the budget give to it be £ on the salary of scottish government ministers who have all singularly fail 
 i thank the secretary of state for his kind remark about the sad loss of christina mckelvie i also note the kind remark make by the prime minister the whole party be grateful for they 
 since the labour government do not want to talk about their commitment let i help they out a little we have time this friday to discuss scotland ’s migration need with a bill back by the care hospitality and tourism sector internationalisation in education and research be crucial so in a spirit of collegiality instead of pander to reform as scottish labour too often do on migration and our relationship with the eu will the secretary of state work with we ahead of the bill on friday so that we can find some common cause to help the high education sector 
 there be complete denial about the problem in the high education sector which be devolve to the scottish government we have make it clear that the immigration system we inherit from the previous government be not work that net migration be too high and that the interaction between migration and skill in the labour market be break so confidence in the whole system need to be rebuild 
 work be under way in government to link the work of skills england and its equivalent the migration advisory committee the industrial strategy council and the department for work and pensions to form a new framework to identify sector that either do or do not have the adequate workforce as well as skill strategy for the future workforce there have be an overreliance on international recruitment lot of young people in scotland nearly in be not in education employment or training that be a shamble it should be scotland ’s shame and we need to do something about it 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the scottish government on the implementation of cancer strategy 
 i commend the hon member for the consistent attention he have pay to this issue since he be elect last year and for educate we on it cancer remain scotland ’s big killer with cancer research uk report that scot be receive bad cancer treatment than their neighbour in other part of the uk the national cancer plan for england will save life that would otherwise be lose to cancer and deliver improve care and patient experience last year a uk labour budget deliver the big settlement for scottish public service in the history of devolution it be time for the scottish government to step up and get serious about cancer 
 i thank the minister for her reply and very kind remark as in wales and england not a single nhs board in scotland be meet the day cancer waiting time standard that be a legacy of under investment from the snp in scotland from labour in wales and from the conservatives in england to develop change and save life we need proper funding for cancer service how will the secretary of state for scotland ensure that his colleague at the department of health and social care understand the importance of fully fund cancer strategy to avoid disaster like that devise by the snp 
 i assure the hon member that this be a priority for the government but as healthcare be a devolved matter the scottish government be responsible for their own cancer strategy include diagnostic service in scotland in england improve early diagnosis of cancer include breast cancer be a priority for the uk government who be commit to transform diagnostic service and will support the nhs to meet the demand for diagnostic service through investment in new capacity include mri and ct scanner 
 my constituent stephen find out that he have prostate cancer almost by accident when he be treat for something else thankfully it be diagnose early and he be on his way to a good outcome despite prostate cancer be the most common cancer for man in scotland it be not of the tumour type that have be promote for early diagnosis in the current scottish government cancer strategy will the minister encourage the scottish government to make specific reference to prostate cancer when promote early diagnosis 
 i commend my hon friend for her commitment to her constituent and pass on the good wish of the whole house to stephen in his recovery her constituent like mine be constantly on the receive end of late diagnosis because of the underfunding of cancer service that   the hon member for wokingham clive jones   have mention we will of course continue to raise this issue with the scottish government as part of our ongoing commitment to deal with scotland ’s big killer which be cancer 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the impact of the barnett formula on funding for the nhs in scotland 
 thank to the barnett formula a labour chancellor and scottish labour mps scotland ’s public service have receive the big ever financial settlement from the uk government but how have the snp spend it well despite the good effort of our extraordinary nhs staff every week thousand of scots will wait more than hour in a&e and more than scot have be stick on an nhs waiting list for over a year doctor nurse and most of all scottish patient have be fail by year of snp mismanagement we desperately need a new direction 
 there have be a noticeable increase in the number of people contact my office about access gp service and about long waiting time for hospital appointment and operation those who live in the isle of arran and actually get an appointment often can not get to it because they can not get a ferry there and back on the same day that be a different point but as a former manager in the nhs i have see the consequence of the shortage of gps in scotland there have be a recent successful recruitment campaign in different part of england do the minister agree that it be time for the scottish government to utilise the barnett consequential in order to improve access to nhs service in scotland through robust workforce planning and to follow the example of the nhs in england and get gps successfully recruit 
 i thank my hon friend not just for her service to her constituent but her previous service in the nhs as she have note thank to labour nhs waiting list in england have fall month on month because this government have a plan and we have invest sadly it be a completely different story in scotland as she have point out like mine her constituent see a situation in which almost in people be now stick on a waiting list john swinney have announce this snp government ’s nhs recovery plan in less than year but patient and staff know that it be not good enough and we need a new direction 
 the minister be right to speak of the wonderful nhs staff that we have but she also speak of a new direction that be require let i give the house a clue as to what new direction she might be speak of the good law project reveal this month that more than of donation to labour ’s health secretary total £ come from individual and company link to the private healthcare sector as the same labour health secretary be so fond of say all road lead to westminster include on nhs funding with cut to public service come down the line be the secretary of state or the minister worry about the influence of private health donor on cabinet colleague 
 the hon gentleman say that there have be cut to public service let i put on record once again that this labour government pledge to end austerity and we have with a record settlement for scotland ’s public service that money have be squander by the snp government such that we be still in a situation where nearly in scot be on a waiting list south of the border waiting list have fall for the month in a row that be the difference make by a labour government with a plan and a willingness to fund it 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of not issue new north sea oil and gas licence on level of economic growth in scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of not issue new north sea oil and gas licence on level of economic growth in scotland 
 i be proud of the enormous contribution north sea worker have make to our country oil and gas will be an important part of our energy mix for decade to come we have a workforce who lead the world and we be determined to secure their long term future in the energy industry include oil and gas the uk government will soon respond to our recent consultation on support the energy transition in the north sea and i be in the north east tomorrow turn on a wind farm and also meet leader in the oil and gas sector 
 if the uk achieve net in we will still consume about barrel of oil and gas a year we be currently on track to produce barrel a year will the secretary of state explain why he prefer to import our energy rather than produce it ourselves 
 the national mission of this labour government be to get to clean power by but that mean thing renewable power nuclear power and oil and gas as i have say already oil and gas will be with we in the scottish and uk context for decade to come 
 a recent report by offshore energies uk show that if the uk oil and gas basin continue to be use until it could produce half our oil and gas need that would do wonder for job in the north east of scotland the north east economy our energy security and the energy transition and it would also bring in £ to the treasury on top of that it would bring in £ of economic growth to the uk which i be sure everyone in this house and the government would welcome will the secretary of state please have a word with the energy secretary and ask he to stop his policy which be continue to ruin our oil and gas sector and for once back north east scotland 
 on the oil and gas sector in i have already mention at the dispatch box as have the secretary of state for energy security and net that oil and gas will be with we for decade to come include to 
 do my right hon friend agree that there be an opportunity for significant economic growth in scotland from get right a just transition from oil and gas to clean power in my constituency the landing space at the port of leith previously use by the oil and gas sector have be transform by investment from forth ports into the large renewable hub in scotland will he join i in welcome this investment in leith and will he outline how his department will help secure every job possible in the transition from oil and gas 
 i commend my hon friend on the work she be do particularly in the port of leith to ensure that we can have the transition and have it well she highlight the important thing about this issue and debate the energy mix require we to have renewable power and clean energy by but it also require we to have nuclear power and oil and gas the energy mix mean that we do it all it be not either or 
 the secretary of state rightly outline how important the oil and gas sector be to scotland and to the worker and business that rely on it but if we be to have a truly just transition we need to invest in new technology such as hydrogen will he therefore join i in welcome the shortlisting of the selms muir hydrogen project in livingston for uk government support and outline how that will benefit my constituency 
 on   april the uk government announce that scottish project have be shortlist for the next stage of the hydrogen allocation round process my ministerial colleague and i look forward to work with industry to deliver our vision for a thriving low carbon hydrogen economy in the uk i commend my hon friend on the work he have do in push forward the project in his constituency 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 do the secretary of state agree with the scottish labour leader who say there be no question but that there have to be new oil and gas or do he agree with his colleague the energy secretary who have ban new licence in the north sea and be oversee the accelerate decline of the uk ’s oil and gas basin 
 the energy secretary and his department be involve in a consultation on the just transition at the moment but i go back to my early answer if we be to get clean power by and to have an energy mix in this country we require oil and gas we require renewable and we require nuclear it be a simple process 
 i think we all hear that and i be sure anas sarwar do the secretary of state be unable to agree with his own leader in scotland and be so in hock to the uk labour party that he can not stand up for scottish worker or the scottish oil and gas industry it have always be the party interest over the national interest for labour with no notice take of the scottish labour party year ago the scottish labour party be describe by its own leader as be simply the branch office nothing have change have it 
 the government ’s sole purpose initially in their few month in office be to clear up the mess that the hon gentleman ’s party leave in this country include the £ black hole we will get on with deliver our mission include clean power by that be what we be focus on because that be what be good for job good for bill and good for the environment 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of support available to scottish plant and seed nursery to sell product to northern ireland 
 under the windsor framework arrangement the northern ireland plant health label allow grower and trader to move plant and seed for plant from great britain to northern ireland without a phytosanitary certificate and scottish business have benefit from that for example more than tonne   of previously prohibit seed potato mostly from scottish trader be move to northern ireland from great britain last year 
 as the minister will know accord to mcintyre fruit in scotland which also sell plant it be easy to supply japan than to send plant to coleman ’s garden centre in my constituency and the same company be now see order cancel in northern ireland at the weekend ewing ’s seafoods northern ireland ’s old fishmonger have a foot container fill with hundred of thousand of pound of fresh fish return from belfast to scotland owe to administrative paperwork error on box will the minister or the secretary of state meet i and representative of those company to discuss what can be do to ease the bureaucratic burden on both northern ireland and scottish business 
 i would be delighted to meet the hon gentleman but let i reassure he the horticultural work group co chair by senior official from the department for environment food and rural affairs and the cabinet office be set up specifically to tackle issue involve the movement of seed to consumer in northern ireland as a priority the hon gentleman have also mention other topic and i should be happy to meet he to discuss they too the work group meet regularly to address such issue and include representative of the ulster farmers union the national farmers union and the horticultural trades association as well as business leader and representative of a small number of other horticultural business 
 scotland produce world class potato which be supply to our iconic fish and chip shop such as the real food café and the green welly stop in tyndrum vincenzo ’s fish and chips in stirling its fish supper win an award last year and corrieri ’s in causewayhead robert and peter corrieri will retire this year after decade of service will the minister recognise their value to our local economy and assure i that more can be do to support the supply chain link scottish grower with these much love business 
 as my hon friend know potato be a staple of our national dish haggis neep and tattie they be also a staple of my favourite breakfast the dry potato scone i be delighted to join my hon friend in recognise all the fish and chip shop in his constituency and i would be delighted to accept invitation to a tour of fish and chip shop from any colleague on either side of the house who recognise their vital contribution 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of us tariff on scotland ’s export to that country 
 we know that this will be a concern time for business in scotland in of good export from scotland be export to the united states that be why the uk government be focus on negotiate an   economic deal with the us as the business and trade secretary make clear in his statement to the house on   april the government be resolute in our support for industry throughout the united kingdom and ministers and official will continue to engage with business to understand the impact that these tariff may have 
 may i associate myself with the comment about pope francis and christina mckelvie and wish you mr speaker a happy st george ’s day it be very important that we all celebrate our national identity but still come together as united kingdom i hope that the secretary of state and i be not too optimistic in our last exchange about trade with the us in which we hop that the trump administration would be a boost for scottish business in the united states what be he do in the uk ’s discussion with the united states to ensure that specific scottish interest such as those of the whisky industry be part of the arrangement 
 as i have say at the dispatch box before it be vital that we do all we can to strengthen our diplomatic cultural and business tie with the united states i be in washington and new york for tartan week in the week when tariff be impose on the rest of the world and i make the case for scotch whisky and scottish business in particular we be engage with scottish exporter and industry representative to assess the potential impact of us tariff and remain in contact with us counterpart our pragmatic and calm approach have be overwhelmingly welcome by business and industry we will not address this important issue in a knee jerk way to get retweet unlike some other in this house 
 will the secretary of state join i in welcome the pragmatic and calm approach of our prime minister to this issue he be work in the clear interest of business and consumer in contrast to opposition members who seem interested only in social medium and quick headline 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend the pragmatic approach of the prime minister and this government to this issue have be welcome by industry and business right across the united kingdom that be in the national interest of the uk we work very hard together to make sure that the impact of us tariff on the uk be not as bad as we think they might be 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday april 
 the entire house will join i in pay tribute to his holiness pope francis an extraordinary man his lifelong work on fairness will leave a lasting legacy people of all background and belief be inspire by his humility and compassion and the outpouring of grief and love that we have see   in the last day or so show the respect and admiration that he be hold in around the world i will attend his funeral on saturday and pay tribute to his courage and leadership may his holiness rest in peace 
 i also wish everyone in england a very happy st george ’s day there be a lot to celebrate our history our value and our culture 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 may i also wish those in the chamber a happy st george ’s day 
 after a cost of living crisis oversee by the chaotic conservative government many in the tourist industry in torbay believe that they have weather the storm as do those in devon and cornwall however many in the tourist industry in torbay fear that the government ’s national insurance contribution hike and effective job tax could be the last nail in the coffin for some of those business in the light of that will the prime minister give i the pleasure of show he round paignton zoo this summer so he can see this outstanding amazing tourist attraction in torbay it be of many across the west of england that sadly be massively impact by the job tax 
 may i start by wish jennie the hon gentleman ’s guide dog a very happy birthday for yesterday she be year old although she do not look particularly interested in my answer i have to say 
 i recognise the importance of tourism to the hon gentleman ’s beautiful constituency i have be there many time and work there for a short time in drive growth and create job we have announce a new visitor economy advisory council which will work with business to deliver a new strategy that be focus on support growth and the tourism industry visitbritain have also launch a new international marketing campaign to showcase britain ’s incredible heritage culture and landscape and i know the minister for creative industries arts and tourism will be happy to keep the hon gentleman update 
 the criminal injury compensation scheme have not be uprate with inflation since which mean that in real term compensation for victim of violent crime include rape and child abuse be worth less than half of what it be then the consultation response publish before easter say that there be not the money to look at change the scope tariff or time limit despite expert advice and the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse will the prime minister commit to properly fund the ministry of justice to do this vital reform work so that victim and their need can become a priority instead of an afterthought 
 my hon friend know my personal commitment to deliver justice for victim of crime who have be completely fail over the last year we be improve access to compensation through well online system and be equip staff with the skill that they need to well support victim we be of   course also consult on a revise victim code which will increase the power of the victim commissioner to ensure more accountability i be happy to ensure that she meet the relevant minister to discuss those issue 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i too wish everyone a happy st george ’s day can i also associate myself with the remark about the passing of his holiness pope francis on easter monday be married to a catholic i know the profound loss for million in britain and across the world 
 do the prime minister now accept that when he say that it be the law that trans woman be woman he be wrong 
 let i be clear i welcome the supreme court ruling on this issue it bring clarity and it will give confidence to woman and of course to service provider the equality and human rights commission will now issue update guidance it be important that that happen and that all service provider then act accordingly this government ’s approach and my approach have be as follow to support and implement the supreme court ruling and we will to continue to protect single sex space base on biological sex and we will to ensure that trans people be treat with respect and we will and to ensure that everybody be give dignity in their everyday life i do think this be the time to lower the temperature move forward and conduct this debate with the care and compassion that it deserve and i think that should unite the whole house 
 the prime minister can not bring himself to admit that he be wrong that be the question he speak about respect and dignity compassion and lower the temperature so will he now apologise to the very brave hon member for canterbury rosie duffield for hound she out of the labour party simply for tell the truth 
 i have always approach this on the basis that we should treat everyone with dignity and respect whatever their different view and i will continue to do so i will tell you mr speaker why because when we lose sight of that approach and make this a political football as happen in the past we end up with the spectacle of a decent man and he be a decent man the previous prime minister diminish himself at this dispatch box by make trans joke while the mother of a murder trans teenager watch from the public gallery just up there that will never be my approach my approach will be to support the ruling protect single sex space and treat everybody with dignity and respect and i believe there be a consensus in this house and the country on that approach 
 there be no apology to the hon member for canterbury there be no taking of responsibility the prime minister talk about political football he practically kick she out of his party constructive dismissal he talk about my predecessor what about the abuse i face from his mp who call i a   transphobe for support what the supreme court have now clarify to use his word and where be he he hide for day without comment on the supreme court judgment why do it take he so long to respond be it not because he be scared 
 the only fiction here be the idea that the right hon member deliver anything in office she hold the post of minister for women and equalities for year and she do precisely nothing she provide no clarity on the law and do nothing to improve woman ’s life which get materially bad under her watch for example the opposition talk about hospital and mixed sex ward up hill and down dale what happen in the last decade the use of mixed sex ward in our nhs rise by there be a pattern of behaviour here the women and equalities minister who fail to do anything for woman the trade minister who fail to get a trade deal with the us the business minister who fail to get a deal with british steel she be a spectator not a leader 
 i will tell the prime minister what i do i stop the gender—[interruption i will i will when his labour leader in scotland be whip his msp to get male rapist into woman ’s prison i stop that gender recognition bill i help commission the cass review i replace the guidance on single sex toilet i make sure that the puberty blocker issue be resolve while he be sit there cheer on the ideology that be take away safe space and when the prime minister stay silent last week presumably wait to hear what morgan mcsweeney think on his whatsapp group some of his close ministers be plot to overturn the supreme court decision labour mp after labour mp stand up yesterday and challenge the ruling how can we take his government seriously on this 
 i think the whatsapp group the right hon lady should be worried about be the with her shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick the mask have slip just week before the election the shadow justice secretary be not here a man who be do everything he can to replace she the man that most conservative members want as leader of their party have admit that reform and the tories be work together he say 
 i want the fight to be unite 
 he say he be determine 
 to bring this coalition 
 as he call it 
 together way or another 
 well i think we know what that mean every tory voter be appal at the thought of pay for the nhs every reform voter hat what the tories do for the last year they be not conservative they be a con 
 who be play political football now the prime minister have no answer yesterday labour mp after labour mp challenge the ruling he should be more worried about his back benchers than my front benchers his labour ministers call the chair of the equality and human rights commission appalling baroness falkner ’s role be critical to enforce the court ’s judgment she have have to put up with relentless abuse   not just from his front bench but from activist and ideologue reappointe she would be a clear sign that he be take this issue seriously so will he commit to reappointe baroness falkner when her term expire this year 
 i have always say that the debate should be conduct properly on the principle i have say it many many time i would remind the leader of the opposition that when they be in government violence against woman and girl reach record high rape prosecution fall to record low and million of woman be leave stuck on nhs waiting list unable to get the healthcare they need under this labour government nhs waiting list be down by more than and there be domestic abuse specialist in control room we strengthen access to maternity pay something she call excessive she talk about political football but a coalition of reform and the tories be be form behind her back we know what it mean when the shadow justice secretary and   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   cook up a joint manifesto nhs charging pro russia foreign policy and an end to worker right just as the previous government lose control of the economy border and health in short month she have lose control of her party 
 the prime minister be clearly so uncomfortable talk about this subject this be a choice between a conservative party that stand up for common sense and a labour party that bend the knee to every pass fad this be a question about moral courage and do the right thing even when it be difficult the truth be he do not have the ball the prime minister only tell people what they want to hear he be a weathervane he twist in the wind he cheer an ideology that deny safe space to woman and girl because he think it be cool to do so he hound a brave female mp out of his party for tell the truth he accept now and now he be hide behind the supreme court judgment be that not because he do not know what he actually believe 
 i can only assume that that sound well when the right hon lady say it in the mirror early the truth be it do not really matter what she say because nobody none of they behind she believe that she be go to lead they into the next election anyway it will be the shadow justice secretary who be away plot that be why he be not here today and the hon member for clacton fight over the bone of the tory party the conservatives think reform will give they its vote without change their policy absolutely no way the hon member for clacton will do what he always do eat the tory party for breakfast 
 i wish you mr speaker and the house a happy st george ’s day 
 i recently have the pleasure of visit the national gas operation in peterborough where the company be announce a £ investment in the uk include at least new job in my constituency the investment will make peterborough the centre of the nation ’s core gas and hydrogen network of the big challenge face by infrastructure project be the lack of   available skill and training for young people what more can the prime minister do to boost apprenticeship in place such as my constituency to ensure we create the opportunity this country so desperately need 
 the net transition be a huge economic opportunity for this country despite the naysayer on the opposition benches we have have almost £ of investment since july which will deliver job across the country include in my hon friend ’s constituency investment that the opposition presumably do not want we be ensure we have the skilled worker that we need launch skills england and our new growth and skill offer to encourage even more apprenticeship and support the industry lead plan for hydrogen to deliver the workforce need for the industry of the future 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i also wish the house and the country a happy st george ’s day and join the prime minister in pay tribute to the late pope francis as a christian i find his compassion absolutely inspiring my prayer be with catholics in the uk and across the world who will feel his loss particularly deeply 
 i have previously raise with the prime minister the issue of north devon district hospital the previous government promise to rebuild it as they do hospital across the south west in place such as torbay and musgrove park unfortunately they break that promise leave appalling condition like sewage leak and patient be treat in corridor will the prime minister reconsider his decision to delay far the construction of new hospital and ask his mps to vote for our motion today for new hospital 
 the previous programme introduce by the conservative party be undeliverable and unaffordable as i think the right hon gentleman know and accept we have put the new hospital programme on a sustainable footing with a timeline that can be meet we be not prepared to trade on false promise as the conservatives do and obviously we have also put record investment into the nhs 
 i gently urge the right hon gentleman to day get a bit more serious about the funding of these measure every week he come to the chamber to push i on issue he push i to spend a lot more money but at the same time in the next breath he oppose the measure in the budget to raise the necessary money 
 unlike the prime minister we have a fund programme at the election i be disappoint with his reply i hope he will actually visit some of these hospital to see the urgent need for rebuild 
 at merton mead farm in oxfordshire last week i see world class british beef farmer at work farmer want the prime minister to be careful in a trade deal with president trump they be let down by the conservative appal trade deal and worry that a bad us deal could allow american agribusiness to undercut they with inferior meat will the prime minister guarantee a vote in this house on any trade deal that he agree with the united states 
 the right hon gentleman raise a point that be of real interest and importance to farmer we will negotiate as he would expect in the national interest and uphold the high animal welfare standard we be make progress on that and there will then be a process if a deal be reach 
 this time last year train manufacturing at alstom in derby be grind to a halt on a single day worker with a combine welding experience of nearly year walk out of its door but the whole city come together with crucial backing from this prime minister what a difference a year make with alstom save and set to host the great gathering to celebrate year of rail and our railway come back into public ownership with the headquarters of great british railways in derby do the prime minister agree that with labour we be back on track 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for derby she be right whether it be the workforce i meet at alstom or the worker at hitachi in county durham we will support our rail industry provide certainty that deliver job investment and security i meet those workforce i know how worried they be a year ago as she rightly say when the previous government be in charge i be really proud that derby will be the home of great british railways because we be bring railway back into public ownership to provide well service for passenger cut delay and cancellation and boost growth across the country 
 i and my party join the prime minister in his condolence for the passing of his holiness pope francis 
 the prime minister have often refer to his time work in northern ireland and i have speak to of his boss who speak of his diligence in that vein could he speak to his northern ireland team about their understanding of the belfast good friday agreement in an interview the secretary of state seem to think that it have be negotiate by ian paisley rather than david trimble and my party his northern ireland minister say at the start of this week that the future of northern ireland as part of the union be dependent on opinion poll and she be not sure whether she be a unionist will the prime minister confirm to i his understanding of the principle of consent and confirm to this house that he be a unionist 
 i thank the hon member for that question i do work in northern ireland for year and therefore appreciate at hand how important these issue be it be a very formative period for i in term of my career and my thinking 
 the good friday agreement be of the proud achievement of the last labour government i pay tribute to everybody who help to bring that about because as the hon member and other members will know it be such an important moment in the history of the conflict i absolutely stand square behind its principle some of which i be do my part to help implement when i be work in northern ireland and they will always drive i on the issue that he raise with i 
 happy st george ’s day mr speaker may i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about pope francis 
 after year of a conservative government too many of my constituent live on low income or in real poverty i very much welcome the employment support proposal in the welfare green paper but the government have to be clear about the real opportunity they be offer to the more than family who they say will lose out financially as a result of this package before ask mp to vote can the prime minister confirm that we will see fresh analysis from the office for budget responsibility evidence on who will be affect by the personal independence payment change and the government ’s own assessment of the employment impact of their measure will he confirm that this policy will not result in increase experience of poverty 
 we be reform a broken system the system that we inherit i think most people accept that it need reform because it trap people in unemployment and inactivity and we need to reform it for that reason the principle will be that we will provide support where support be need where people want to get into work we will help they into work the current system operate against people who want to get into work and make that transition if they can work they should work move into work be what halve the risk of be in poverty and that be why we have invest £ in tailor employment support of course we be also introduce a new premium for those with the most severe lifelong disability who will never be able to work 
 last week former steelworker in port talbot watch in dismay as this government deem their livelihood worth less than those in scunthorpe freedom of information request reveal that the uk government do not know how their funding for reskille worker in wales be be use or even how many people be be retrain and we know that concern have be raise by the transition board if the government can not explain how they be help port talbot ’s lay off worker to build a future through reskille why should those worker not come to the logical conclusion that labour have abandon they 
 the right hon member raise an important issue i visit port talbot a number of time and hear at hand from the workforce she may or may not know that even in opposition before the election i be talk to the owner to try to persuade they to delay their decision because i know an election be come that be how important i think it be i remind she that at the same time the then prime minister refuse to pick up a call to the minister even to discuss the issue i take a different approach because i realise just how important it be 
 the right hon lady compare the situation with the decision we take last week but i remind she that the blast furnace be turn off in january last year and the coke oven in march which be before the election that be the very thing i be try to ensure do not happen for reason that she and the workforce will understand and i be talk to the workforce   throughout since then we have be able to negotiate an improved deal with tata that mean well term for the worker and we do that within week we be work hard to maximise opportunity from the £ investment in an electric arc furnace we be support those face job loss with £ of funding to learn new skill and we be support the supply chain and protect community 
 the right hon lady talk about protect work people but she vote against the big devolution settlement since devolution that include more money for public service include the nhs and her party vote against it 
 i commend the prime minister and his government for the action take to reform the nhs in england and make it fit for the modern day with improved technology more gps and appointment and waiting list cut for consecutive month however it be deeply unfortunate that in scotland the snp government have make the political choice to waste taxpayer money on vanity project flawed legislation and fail court case rather than focus on improve our health service do the prime minister agree that the people of airdrie and shotts who have be promise a new hospital for almost a decade deserve far well than to suffer in pain while on waiting list or to receive treatment in crumble building as a direct consequence of snp incompetence 
 my hon friend be a real champion for airdrie and shotts over scot have be stick wait for test or treatment for over a year which be a rise in year almost few operation have be carry out compare with before the pandemic to compare what the snp be do with what we be do here in england we have drive down waiting list within month with month in a row of reduction and we have over extra appointment scotland ’s nhs urgently need change but the snp have no strategy or plan it have absolutely no idea 
 the danger pose by china to our national security be self evident can the prime minister explain why he and his government have choose to treat beijing as a business partner and not as the hostile state that it truly be 
 i have set out our approach to china a number of time it be not materially different from the approach in the last year of the previous government i might add in relation to scunthorpe the deal that we have to deal with during recess be the deal negotiate by the last government we have take sensible decision in the national interest and will continue to do so 
 i be sure the prime minister will join i in celebrate the opening of the new brixton blood donation centre in my constituency which in month have see over people donate more than of they timer and of they black however give that sickle cell anaemia be the fast grow genetic condition in the uk that be not   enough demand for the ro blood subtype more common in people of african descent be rise by to annually and it be crucial for treat sickle cell rule around traveller as well as inaccurate iron test mean that we be see willing black donor turn away for to month of course blood donation must be safe but failure to review the guideline be cost life will the prime minister commit to review the rule and join i in call on you mr speaker to help we all play our part by facilitate a biannual blood drive in parliament 
 i be try to arrange that 
 i will leave that to you mr speaker i do not think it be for i to suggest that you donate your blood although i be sure that you do and that we can support this jointly we should take that up across the house under your leadership mr speaker 
 let i join my hon friend in welcome the new brixton blood donor centre and the lifesaving support that it provide increase donor diversity be a priority for the nhs and we be work to increase ro blood donation by engage with community who be more likely to have that blood type i will ensure that she meet the relevant health minister to discuss what more we can do in this area 
 british government of all political persuasion have long take pride in reduce the carbon footprint of the british manufacturing industry unfortunately in too many case too much of that so call reduction have be achieve by drive british industry abroad to country such as china and india that actually use more carbon to produce the same product british steel be just the late example of that which be bad for the global environment and disastrous for the british economy that be against a background of european carbon policy that have fail over year do the prime minister have a new domestic british policy that will protect british industry from this disastrous long term trend 
 we be do everything available to we to protect car building in this country the right hon gentleman will have notice that week ago i make announcement about the emission vehicle mandate and what more we could do to support the industry that be an immediate response to circumstance as they be but i indicate at the time and i do so again that we will do whatever it take to support our car industry 
 my constituent billy spend month try to see a gp to investigate his symptom it take month of telephone appointment before he be finally see in person and get the test that diagnose stage cancer that delay in diagnosis have dramatically change the prognosis and as someone who have become a friend it hurt i to see the pain that he be now live in do the prime minister agree that primary care be a vital part of the healthcare system and that we need wide access to both in person and telephone appointment 
 i be deeply sorry to hear about billy ’s case i be sure the whole house be our focus have to be on make sure that gps spend more time care for patient that include the investment of an additional £ in general practice in england which have put over gps into surgery since october we do deliver a record settlement for scotland ’s public service to help fix our nhs and ensure that people like billy get the care that they deserve 
 through the age an innovative and vibrant city of london have underpin investment and growth in the wide economy but the main challenge the city currently face be how to get more capital into capital market like many i believe that london could gain new momentum if the government take bold action to challenge and empower those who steward our pension asset to do thing in new way follow the chancellor ’s decision to offer continuity of leadership at the financial conduct authority will the prime minister convene an urgent no summit with city leader and the regulator to provide a reset and to maximise the chance that the city can lead economic growth and recovery in these time of grave uncertainty and turmoil 
 the right hon gentleman be right that we need to go far and fast in kick start growth and attract the investment we need to create job and that our regulator must regulate for growth and not just for risk we do want that continuity of leadership that he mention and we be convene and get people together to drive growth we will take away the idea that he put on the table 
 propose change to personal independence payment mean that people who require various level of support due to lifelong condition such as learn disability will not meet the new eligibility criterion however the green paper introduce a group of people with lifelong condition who will not be subject to reassessment can the prime minister confirm that people with a learn disability a lifelong condition that will not change will be include in the group of claimant who will not be subject to repeat reassessment 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i know this issue mean a lot to she we be clear on the principle for reform protect those with the most severe disability who will never be able to work as she refer to and make sure that people with the most severe disability and health condition will never again face the prospect of be constantly reassess we be make sure that extra financial support be base on the impact of a health condition or disability not the capacity to work and i can reassure she that we be carefully consider option for transitional protection 
 his chancellor ’s economic policy start off badly and have head rapidly downhill from there his energy secretary ’s policy ensure that energy rich scotland live under the high domestic and commercial energy price in the world and his foreign secretary provide diplomatic cover for the atrocity commit   in gaza by the israel defence forces to the horror of the people of scotland but the prime minister be the incompetent in chief who refuse to bring his ministers into line that be just of the reason why independence enjoy an point lead over remain in this dysfunctional break brexit britain do he understand why the people of scotland be so dissatisfied with his late iteration of dysfunctional british rule in scotland 
 do the hon gentleman understand that the electorate in scotland answer that question in july of last year i remember that there use to be quite a few snp members sit on the opposition benches now it be a distant cry from up on the back benches 
 last week humanitarian law organisation apply for an arrest warrant for israeli foreign minister gideon sa’ar over allege war crime in gaza include the siege of kamal adwan hospital and the torture of its director dr hussam abu safiya yet the red carpet be roll out sa’ar have justify block vital humanitarian aid into gaza back the illegal annexation of palestinian land and reject a palestinian state the prime minister be a human right lawyer so surely he know that the uk have a legal duty to uphold international law why then do he block the arrest of an unindicted war criminal 
 i do n’t 
 on a point of order mr speaker you like i have long be a supporter of britain ’s nuclear test veteran so i wonder whether you could advise i give that government lawyer have finally admit after year of denial that test may have take place at the time that those veteran be in the south atlantic they say that 
 information may have be record by scientist carry out radiation monitoring 
 surely a statement in the house by a government minister be require how can i facilitate that?[official report   april vol c. 14wc correction 
 i do not think i even need to answer that the right hon gentleman be a man who know how to facilitate that and i know the matter will not end here that be not a point of order for the chair and i be not carry on question but he have certainly get the matter on the record and i know he will now pursue it in the many way available to he 
 presentation and reading standing order no 
 daisy cooper present a bill to require water company to prioritise area with chalk stream and related habitat when invest in new and upgrade sewerage system include foul water leak prevention and the replacement or upgrading of porous sewage pipeline and for connected purpose 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday july   and to be print bill 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 pm 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to prepare and publish a strategy for tackle interpersonal abuse and violence against man and boy and for connected purpose 
 this labour government have pledge to halve instance of violence against woman and girl an intent that i have no doubt those on both side of this house be fully able to support the aim of this bill be to tackle an aspect of the current violence against woman and girl strategy an aspect that make no sense and that it be essential for the government to address 
 the violence against woman and girl strategy currently include male victim of violence against woman and girl the government still define violence against woman and girl or vawg as a category of crime which disproportionately affect woman therefore all victim of crime such as domestic abuse rape sexual assault digital image abuse force marriage and honour base violence include man and boy be consider victim of vawg i want to make it clear that this bill in no way detract from the work already do and still to be do in tackle violence against woman and girl the bill simply aim to ensure that male victim of those crime have a dedicated strategy that reflect the differ nature of their circumstance and ensure that male survivor be recognise and receive appropriate support the current mis categorisation force male victim into space and discussion that may more appropriately be reserve for woman 
 at present the government have no dedicated strategy for tackle interpersonal abuse and violence against man and boy in the previous government publish their ever position statement on male victim and they follow this in with an addendum on support male victim the change in government and a revise strategy on violence against woman and girl present a new opportunity to devise a parallel strategy for violence against man and boy in lieu of any direction from the government regard the publication of a new update position statement the minister for safeguarding   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips be as i understand it currently rewrite the violence against woman and girl strategy for publication later this spring and to that end now be the time to legislate for such a change to be formalise 
 it should be note that when the government state their hope to halve violence against woman and girl the start state of that datum currently include victim who be man and boy victim of gender base violence face many barrier that prevent they from report instance of abuse the fear of not be believe the threat that the perpetrator may still pose or the simple fact of not be aware of the service available to help or be aware and not be able to access they there be also the complexity around the consequence of disclosure such as the impact on living arrangement or financial security and how this can in turn lead to instance of coercive control for man and boy however   there be additional factor the shame and stigma of not appear to be masculine of be vulnerable of potentially have their sexuality out and of be the victim of a crime consider and officially refer to as apply to female victim 
 the majority of man seek help have cop alone often for long period and be still live with their abusive partner man in such circumstance might need help with housing and finance and in circumstance involve dependent child with how they can maintain their role as a father safety planning for this group of man must be initiate at the point of disclosure as the majority of those seek help do not return to those provide it follow contact 
 the crime survey for england and wales for the year end september show that of man age and over be victim of domestic abuse between september and september compare with of woman accord to women ’s aid ’s annual audit report as of may there be just refuge in england with bed space for man as such of a total of people support in safe accommodation in that period only be man 
 there be also a difference in the need of man who be gay bisexual or trans owe to the complexity of the nature of these relationship and the risk of be out of be the victim of prejudice or of be disown by family member male victim be less likely to report domestic abuse to statutory service carlisle and withers green ’s survey highlight that over of gay bisexual and trans male victim of domestic abuse have never seek support from a statutory service provider their statistic be therefore not record in any official figure and as a result these victim find themselves far isolate increase their vulnerability to abuse 
 sexual abuse against man be a vastly under report crime in adult sexually assault in the uk each year be a man in rape and in sexual assault have male victim accord to the office for national statistics of boy become victim of child sexual abuse before they turn in victim of child sexual abuse be man and over of child sex abuser be people know to their victim shame stigma homophobia and emasculation be all factor in prevent sexual abuse from be report it often take year for a male victim to report a sexual assault to the police male sexual assault survivor be time more likely to tell a family member friend or colleague than they be to report an incident to the police datum from the office for national statistics suggest that few than a of male victim of sexual assault have ever disclose what they have experience 
 for straight man there can also be a hesitancy to disclose abuse owe to the misconception that man should be physically strong enough to prevent an assault male victim of abuse who have be force to penetrate by a partner can struggle to identify their experience as abuse because it cause they to be arouse rape and sexual abuse should never be minimise because a perpetrator be female the law currently state that while male and female can be the victim of rape only male can realistically commit the act of rape the introduction of a force to penetrate sexual offence could therefore address that 
 honour base violence be another factor that be poorly understand and cater for victim of honour base violence be at great risk of repeat victimisation and be often at risk from multiple perpetrator however no discrete crime of so call honour base violence or abuse be define in our legislation so in most instance male victim would be classify by police as victim of violence without injury or stalking and harassment datum from the crown prosecution service suggest that around of prosecution for honour base violence involve male victim 
 additionally the forced marriage unit have consistently see that of force marriage victim be male that often include man from overseas who be force to marry uk citizen and can find themselves force into domestic servitude thus also become victim of modern slavery 
 this time last year professor nicola graham kevan of the university of lancashire undertake research and publish datum on how male survivor feel about be categorise as victim of violence against woman and girl state that it make it hard to seek help state that they experience distress state that the government do not care state that it be minimise their experience state that it be not take seriously and state that it be not recognise by society it be clear that the damaging impact of include male victim within a strategy that cater for violence against woman and girl mean that male survivor can not identify with that labelling organisation such as we be survivors the men boys coalition and the mankind initiative have be instrumental in provide support to male victim and advocate for a solution and i thank they for their work to highlight this inequality 
 last november the victim commissioner baroness helen newlove write to the safeguarding minister outline many of the same concern that i have highlight the concern be not unique they be share by the male survivor community the view of the victim commissioner should not go unheeded nor that of her predecessor dame vera baird kc who express similar view the purpose of the bill be echo in baroness newlove ’s word 
 i believe it be beyond time for a dedicated man and boy strategy with specific policy strategic milestone and accompany funding a tailored approach for male victim of interpersonal violence be essential to develop their right and ensure the availability of appropriate support service i urge you to seize this opportunity to create both a robust cross governmental vawg strategy and a separate comprehensive strategy for man and boy with clear policy strategic target milestone and sustainable funding arrangement 
 month later and with nothing far hear on implement such a strategy this bill be require to push the safeguarding minister to act my hope be that male survivor of such traumatic violence and abuse can finally be give the focus their plight deserve i also hope that member on both side of the house feel they can support what the bill set out to achieve and i thank they all for listen

 ben obese jecty accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday may and to be print bill 
 i inform the house that i have select the amendment in the name of the prime minister 
 i beg to move 
 that this house regret the appalling state of repair of nhs hospital across the country note that the nhs maintenance backlog rise to £ in far note the sustained pattern of cannibalise nhs capital budget to keep day to day service run condemn the previous government ’s record of starve repair budget and explode maintenance backlog which make sewage leak crack wall crumble ceiling and sink floor commonplace far condemn the previous government for launch the new hospital programme with no realistic plan to fund or deliver it far regret that almost half of the select hospital be now not set to begin construction until after call on the government to reverse the delay to the new hospital programme and create a crumble hospital taskforce to bring construction date forward and far call on the government to end the vicious cycle of false economy and rise repair backlog by put hospital across the country on a path towards sustainable funding 
 the appalling state of our hospital building be a national scandal everybody in this country should be in control of their own life and health which mean everybody get the care they need when and where they need it but that can never be realise while so many patient be treat in grossly inadequate setting from shropshire to cornwall cambridgeshire watford and devon patient be lose their dignity because of decision take by the conservatives and the labour government ’s failure to rectify they 
 the conservatives record be of starve repair budget serious leak crumble ceiling and bucket strew ward it be an outrage that million of people be wait for treatment yet overcrowded hospital have have to close operating theatre because they be no long fit for use patient and hospital staff deserve the dignity of safe modern and clean environment but instead the previous government shamefully choose to raid the repair budget to plug the gap in day to day cost as our hospital fall apart and the new government who be elect on what increasingly look like false hope be pursue a false economy in delay the desperately need new hospital programme 
 as with so much of their agenda the government promise so much but be deliver so little and betray those who put their faith in the labour party farmer who be feed up with the tories take they for grant have be hit with a tax grab on their family future employer who be promise growth and no new taxis have be whack with a national insurance increase patient who be promise new hospital have have they take away 
 i be with the hon lady almost up until that point i congratulate she on open the debate it be absolutely true that the new hospital programme do not deliver new hospital and be unfunded under the tories however it be be fund now under labour money   be be invest in my local hospital in the imperial college healthcare nhs trust and it be prepare for major rebuild will she perhaps give the new government a little credit for what they have do and correctly identify the shamble that we be leave with 
 the hon member will be aware that there be not new hospital they be not all hospital and there be not of they the issue here be that the start date for work on many hospital that need urgent rebuilding have be push back into the 2030 long beyond the life of this parliament the people who be serve by those hospital be promise new facility and have not have they that be devastating for those community 
 if the conservative approach be contemptible labour ’s approach have be to procrastinate the cost to the nhs of paper over the crack and keep hospital run past their natural lifespan be enormous that be why the government must reverse the delay to the new hospital programme at once and urgently deliver the new hospital that patient have long be promise 
 i wonder if the hon member can explain to i how spend £ extra on the national health service this year can in any way be describe as procrastination 
 it be important to recognise that the additional investment in the nhs amount to about £ a year accord to office for budget responsibility number which i be sure the hon gentleman have look at because of the cost of national insurance hike and of compensate other public sector employer for those hike the £ figure be somewhat misleading the point that we be make be that it be a false economy to keep those building go to keep repair a crumble estate to keep patch up and put a sticking plaster on those problem those building need to be demolish and rebuild so that approach be a false economy it would be much well to build new building up front and save on future repair cost we need to ensure that no be treat in break uncomfortable and unsafe facility repair and replace crumble substandard hospital be not only vital for deliver well care and treating more patient but crucial for rebuild the economy after year of conservative economic vandalism 
 how much would all this cost in my county of shropshire the cost of the maintenance backlog across all site have reach about £ i be sure that everyone here would agree that £ be a lot of money indeed it be so much that it be the total amount of government capital investment for hospice this year but in term of hospital maintenance it be a drop in the ocean torbay hospital need more than £ to clear the backlog watford hospital have a backlog of £ and hull royal infirmary require an eye watering £ across england the figure be a colossal £ and that be just to bring our exist hospital estate to the minimum standard 
 the hon member be right that a huge amount of money need to be spend a lot of that go back to the fact that as   lord darzi tell we £ less be spend on hospital building in the 2010 than be necessary will she remind i who be in government for the for half of the 2010s 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that when come into government and have to clean up the mess leave behind by the previous government have to make difficult choice it be the job of the opposition to point out where they would make those choice or take different option we would invest to save money in the long run rather than fritter money away on a repair bill for building that need to be demolish it be not sensible to pour good money after bad when the right thing to do be invest in a new fit for purpose and modern estate that do not have endless and extortionate maintenance requirement 
 rise 
 i will make some progress 
 at north devon district hospital the ducting of the ventilation system that serve the operate theatre have not be change since it be instal in and can not be replace because of ceiling height and asbestos as a result all operate theatre have be non compliant with nhs england building guidance since the good people of devon clearly need a new hospital and they be promise that they would have by only for the labour government to take it away and decide that the change those people need will not be deliver for another decade 
 even hospital with comparatively few maintenance problem such as the royal shrewsbury hospital which serve my constituent and have a £ backlog be clearly a long way short of be up to standard i will not go into detail again about the catalogue of issue in shropshire the ambulance delay and station closure the wait time for check up scan and surgery or the substandard state of cancer care but they all combine to put huge pressure on hospital where staff and building be strain under the load 
 i commend the hon lady and the liberal democrats for secure this debate issue that they have not mention in their motion be car parking at hospital which be an ongoing problem for disabled people and patient who miss or delay their appointment as a result of a lack of space do she agree that car parking be central to address the issue that she be set out 
 car parking be a real problem particularly where public transport be poor it plague my constituent and when it be unrealistically expensive for people who need to use hospital facility i thank the hon member for that point 
 the nhs crisis impact on patient outcome my constituent emma be leave in the fit to sit area for hour despite have be diagnose with suspect sepsis year old mary wait outside in an ambulance for hour and year old paula spend hour on a trolley in a corridor that be the reality in hospital up and down the country i think we all agree that that be a disgrace and it must be rectify 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will make some progress 
 of the main reason those problem have not be rectify be successive delay from successive government shropshire be again a prime example this be not relate to the new hospital programme but none the less £ be grant for the hospital transformation programme in shropshire back in year later while the country have be through prime ministers and different health secretaries shropshire be still wait for that transformation to take place opposition from both the labour and conservative council that serve the area along with the ridiculously lengthy process that capital expenditure have to go through to be sign off mean that desperately need improvement have be horribly delay as construction cost rise as a result the original plan have be scale back and their value diminish 
 my hon friend mention the inordinate delay that occur with regard to application for capital fund i have watch with horror as my local hospital trust in west hertfordshire have have to submit business case after business case while watch the cost rack up do she agree that way to spend the allocate money more efficiently would be by devolve those budget to local hospital trust rather than have a centralised programme that drive up the cost 
 i could not agree more that be exactly the situation we see in shropshire once again the people who will suffer be the patient 
 last year less than £ of the £ require to eradicate the repair backlog for hospital be invest just it do not take an accountant to work out that at that rate it will take year to clear the current backlog let alone the further deterioration of the crumble building investment in eradicate the repair backlog fall sharply from £ in to £ in a fall of i be afraid that just like their approach to fix social care the government ’s continue lack of imagination and ambition be leave our nhs less productive and less stable which risk leave million languish on nhs waiting list 
 rise 
 i will give way to   the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman   because he have try to intervene before 
 i be most grateful to the hon lady for her delay response i be strike by her lack of response to of my colleague she do not acknowledge to my hon friend   the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter   that in my constituency of chelsea and fulham the imperial college healthcare nhs trust be get money from the government as a precursor to rebuild the hospital promise to it more importantly she do not address the point make by my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   that we be all reap the whirlwind of   the decision take by the conservative liberal democrat coalition government the liberal democrats make a choice to go into that government to take on role include as chief secretary to the treasury and as health ministers and to make those cut and destroy the nhs we be now reap the whirlwind of the decision that she and her colleague make be it not a little bit cheeky of she to make some of the point and claim she be make today 
 i be pleased that the hon gentleman ’s hospital be be deal with but i be sure that the resident of torbay will not feel the benefit of that i be slightly surprised that he think that the decade since the liberal democrats be in power have have no impact whatsoever i do address the point that when a party come into government and have to clear up the appalling mess leave by the previous government there be difficult choice to be make his party know that labour members for example have vote to retain the child benefit cap and keep a quarter of a child in poverty something that no in my party have ever vote for 
 the last time i open a liberal democrat opposition day debate be in october and the topic be primary care i explain how the government ’s failure to invest in primary care be a false economy that increase pressure and cost in the critical part of the system the management of our hospital building display that same false economy just as spend money on critical care instead of prevention and public health be a poor approach to manage a health service wait for the roof to collapse be an irresponsible way to manage nhs building as problem be ignore and investment be poorly target it be the patient and the hard work staff strive to help they who be force to suffer 
 this be not just about the new hospital programme across the country there be thousand of gp surgery that need urgent improvement if they be to provide the care that patient deserve more than hospital building across england be build before the foundation of the nhs in while the state of gp surgery vary wildly many surgery be simply no long fit for purpose have be build in the 1950 prescott surgery in my constituency for example have long be recognise as somewhere that need to drastically increase in size because the population of the village have increase drastically itself despite the land and the community infrastructure levy funding be available there be no sign of a new surgery be build as the delay continue the cost be rise and the challenge grow for both the council and the integrated care board which be already under immense pressure to cut their cost 
 instead of pursue fantasy like the conservatives or false economy like the labour party the liberal democrats would invest to save by start construction now and end the epidemic of cancel operation close off ward and huge sum waste on emergency repair that would save the taxpayer money in the long run and benefit patient much soon 
 the hon lady be be a little bit unrealistic i have world class hospital in my constituency charing cross hammersmith and st mary ’s paddington the repair bill be £ but the rebuild or new build cost would be £ yes we   be refurbish part of charing cross and put a lot of investment into prepare for that work but the idea that suddenly the hon lady be go to come up with ten if not hundred of billion of pound be unrealistic be it not 
 the plan that we have put forward involve £ over year and i will come to that in a moment the real issue be that we can not pick hospital and say that it be indicative of an nhs that be be deal with appropriately hospital across the country be fall apart for example stepping hill in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for cheadle mr morrison be not in the new hospital programme yet it be fall apart at the seam we need to address the whole estate fairly urgently 
 our year guarantee capital investment programme would provide long term security and fix our crumble hospital and creak gp surgery it would provide an extra £ for our crumble building over the next decade improve outcome for patient boost productivity and cut day to day cost for the nhs provide certainty be crucial as it stand manager have to raid precious budget not just to plug leaking pipe but to plug staffing gap when winter pressure arrive that be why we would also end the reactive approach to the annual winter crisis through our winter taskforce instead of the average £ of emergency funding announce late into the winter each year for the last year our winter taskforce would manage a ringfenced fund of £ over the next year that would help hospital to plan their budget and build resilience in ward a&e department ambulance service and patient discharging 
 the hon lady be talk about the day to day budget of the nhs in particular the cost of pay off previous debt she talk about the work that need to be do during the coalition year and in the decade and a half since then in response to intervention from labour members do she agree that of the big mess that need to be clear up then which be still be feel in nhs budget be the disastrous private finance initiative of the blair and brown year 
 there have be successive failure in nhs management that all party need to hold their hand up for that be a fair point we should though focus on the task in hand rather than continually go back decade either to the coalition government or to the blair government before that that be not helpful to our constituent who want a solution now 
 on that point will the hon lady give way 
 no i have be very generous with my time and i be go to make some progress 
 we be also campaign for a review of outdated government finance rule that prevent nhs trust from invest the fund that they have raise into their own building even nhs manager struggle to access common sense investment in their facility due to overly complex rule and glacial process trust be prevent from use unspent fund on improve their building we   need root and branch reform combine with our year programme of investment to bring our local health facility up to scratch 
 in conclusion the recent history of the nhs be of short term decision making and of the failure of successive government to grasp the nettle of long term sustained investment in the thing that matter hospital building gp service dentistry pharmacy and crucially the unspoken crisis of social care the outcome be an organisation that be spend million of pound to go backwards it truly be a false economy 
 this government have speak warmly of the need to reform the nhs and improve productivity and we support they in that but we can not expect to retain staff and provide high quality care when so many doctor and nurse be negotiate leak roof and sewage back up on the ward deal with the new hospital programme be a matter of urgency and i urge the secretary of state to at long last grasp the nettle 
 i call stephen kinnock be it?—to move the amendment i have a different name in front of i 
 i be glad you recognise i from the chair mr speaker i have lose some hair since we last speak 
 i beg to move an amendment to leave out from it to end and insert 
 also note that the chancellor have announce new fiscal rule to ensure capital budget can no long be cannibalise with transfer from capital to resource budget not permit recognise that the previous government leave a new hospital programme which be unfunded unrealistic and undeliverable welcome that the government have take action to review that programme and have publish the new hospital programme plan for implementation to put the programme on a sustainable footing support the government ’s investment in the plan which will increase to up to £ over each consecutive year wave average around £ a year from and far support the work be do to bring forward construction of the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete replacement scheme wherever possible to ensure that patient and staff safety be prioritise 
 the amendment on the order paper be in the name of my right hon and learn friend the prime minister i thank the liberal democrats for use their opposition day to address a matter of vital importance for so many member include many colleague right across the chamber and their constituent i sincerely hope that the liberal democrats will work with we on solution not on soundbite because we need to be realistic about the problem we face and serious about how we tackle they 
 the new hospital programme be announce by the last government to much fanfare in october with a promise to deliver new hospital by we be tell that there be a plan and a timetable and we be glibly assure that it be fully fund but from the outset it be clear that there be not new scheme some be just refurbishment or extension to put it simply there be not project they be not all new and many of they be not even hospital 
 the spin around the programme be widely question and challenge before the general election but nevertheless we be truly shock by what we find on enter the department of health and social care the programme   be hugely delay by several year more than have already be reveal by the national audit office there be no credible plan to deliver the building project let alone to deliver they all in the next year and there be not even enough construction capacity in the uk to build all the hospital in the new hospital programme by that be why when the hospital with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be bring into the nhp in even the last government have the sense to admit that scheme would have to be deliver past in order to prioritise the raac hospital 
 perhaps most shocking of all the funding for the programme be due to run out a month ago with no provision whatsoever for future year the money simply be not there the programme be build on nothing more than false hope dodgy claim and disingenuous press release
