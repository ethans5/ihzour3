i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 i have be a member of parliament for nearly year hon member no i know it be difficult to believe for some but it be true this be the occasion on which my name have be draw in the private member ’s bill ballot i be pleased to say my name be draw i think long and hard about the most appropriate and good piece of draft legislation to bring forward i decide on this bill because i genuinely think it be incredibly important and i will set out to the house why that be 
 the bill tackle strategic litigation against public participation case widely know as slapp in all their form last year i and the labour opposition welcome the measure enact in the economic crime and corporate transparency act that ensure that slapp relate to economic crime can be tackle i be pleased to bring forward a bill to expand on that reform to protect freedom of speech and the public interest be something that all party in parliament hold dear in all debate in this house and the other place there have be a broad consensus about the need for reform to tackle the pernicious effect of slapp however in both houses it have be clear that the economic crime and corporate transparency act do not go far enough 
 slapp have take and do take many form it be vital to bring forward legislation that genuinely tackle the issue in a holistic and rounded sense there be many example of slapp i will refer to a few high profile case that have reach court and receive some publicity and to other that have not receive that much publicity 
 i begin with a case that i be sure hon member will be aware of because it have attract a great deal of attention in a defamation case be reportedly bring against the journalist tom burgis the financial times and publisher harpercollins by a kazakh mining company the case concern a book by burgis entitle kleptopia how dirty money be conquer the world 
 a defamation case be bring by roman abramovich against journalist catherine belton and harpercollins regard her book putin ’s people it be an excellent book and well worth read there be a legal assault on the book through a number of lawsuit in quick succession justifiably provoke a group of campaigner for free expression to state that london ’s court be become the venue of choice for legal action design to quash critical journalism catherine belton the author of putin ’s people have call for the introduction of reform to tackle this global industry base here in london hopefully the bill will begin to address this significant problem seriously 
 then there be the case of amersi v. leslie a british business owner mohamed amersi bring a defamation case against charlotte leslie a former conservative mp and managing director of the conservative middle east council i be familiar with the case because i be the shadow minister for the middle east and north africa the case concern a memo on amersi ’s background and dealing with russia it be put together in response to his attempt to become the chair of cmec the claim by amersi be strike out because he have fail to show how the memo cause serious harm to his reputation 
 it be not only high profile case that involve slapp there be the case of nina cresswell who name a person who violently sexually assault she after   her original report be dismiss by the police she commendably want to alert other woman who may become victim of sexual assault the man who be name sue she for defamation ms cresswell win a landmark judgment last year but the very fact that she have to fight the case at all demonstrate the huge gap that slapp claimant be only too ready to exploit and we need to address that fact 
 i have also hear story of patient who have leave negative review for botched plastic surgery be issue with slapp claim by the surgeon i have hear of tenant who have speak out about their uninhabitable housing be issue with slapp claim by their landlord that be wrong and it must be stop 
 i have give a few example of relatively high profile case and also of some that be not so well know there be many case that do not attract any attention in court and there be many more that we do not know about because individual be intimidate before legal proceeding actually commence the datum that the government have be only the tip of the iceberg as i have suggest slapp be extremely pernicious before any action reach court pre action letter and legal pressure be apply well before proceeding be initiate this often result in the search or the investigation be withdraw before publication or in some case in a whole variety of different area the effectiveness of threat and intimidation be such that the case never see the light of day accordingly that will never be reflect in available datum 
 then we come to the press in this country let we remember that as a country that champion freedom both here and abroad we must ensure that our free press which be a real pillar of our democracy never feel so vulnerable that it self censor on vital matter in the public interest no in the united kingdom be above the law furthermore no should be above proper scrutiny on a matter of public interest 
 as to the datum we have the provision of figure from the coalition against slapp in europe be deeply concern in themselves it estimate that there be   slapp in england and wales in that be up from in and in case ’s august report record that the total figure in europe over the past decade be 
 the hon member mention the coalition against slapp in europe i wonder whether he agree with the anti- slapp coalition that the propose bill as draft would introduce a subjective test require a court to infer the state of mind and purpose of the filer do he agree with i that that would create complexity cost and delay which would potentially make the bill ineffective 
 it be an issue that have to be consider carefully and indeed it have be give a great deal of consideration and much debate 
 on that point will the hon gentleman give way 
 may i just respond to the other point that have be make it be vital that this issue be consider properly and deeply i hope very much that if we be successful today the debate will continue into committee so that further consideration may be give to that issue at the moment i be err on the side of what be suggest by my private member ’s bill i think the bill strike a balance it be not quite accurate to talk about subjectivity and objectivity because a judge will have to make a determination on the fact that be present and his knowledge of how the case be be conduct at the moment i err in favour of say that there be a false dichotomy but it be something that should be consider far in committee 
 i join in concordance with   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david this be an excellent piece of legislation and i be very broadly in support of it i just want to respond to the comment from   the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord subjectivity be actually a fundamental part of our legal system already we talk often of the man on the clapham omnibus it be the reasonableness test so i do not think there be anything in the bill that be out of scope or inappropriate 
 i be inclined to agree with that comment as my bill suggest but it be something that need to have more airing and more consideration detailed consideration in committee would be an appropriate place for that to happen 
 as other have say many time most slapp relate activity take place below the radar before a formal court case and court claim be issue there be a number of reason why slapp be so bad and why slapps claimant be so successful in their warped objective of perpetrate they commonly the comparatively modest mean of a defendant be leveraged against they to encourage retraction or the abandonment of the important research that would shine a light on questionable behaviour bully tactic can include huge threaten litigation   cost and damage and all of the unbearable consequence such as bankruptcy and loss of home and livelihood as well as the emotional distress that entail all of that can cause huge hardship and psychological pressure 
 sadly many people be not able to withstand all of that so many of the case be like david and goliath but if david have no slingshot i should be clear about why the unfairness of a legal system that allow all of that have to be challenge and change that be why i be bring forward the bill today we must eradicate the harm cause by that kind of aggressive litigation we must protect publisher author and advocate from spurious claim and empower they to forge ahead with publish legitimate story ground well research investigative reporting must be protect not rein in for fear of colossal legal cost we must do our utmost to protect and empower ordinary people and give they the confidence to use the legal system of this country to ensure fairness in the public interest 
 of course protect journalist or anyone else can not be at the expense of deny claimant their right of access to justice but at present the fact that claimant can wrongly exploit the justice system to obfuscate the transparency that be essential in a healthy democracy mean that an important balance must be strike as thing stand that be clearly not the case and that be why i call for urgent reform today robust action to counter slapp in all their form be need and it be need now 
 i have seek to work alongside the government to ensure that the approach underpin the economic crime and corporate transparency act which be positively receive across civil society medium and the legal profession include the regulator remain largely intact in the bill as it achieve what be necessary the bill will therefore keep for the most part the definition of a slapp claim in the economic crime and corporate transparency act but it will also broaden the scope and capture all slapp in future in future any slapp case in which speak out be in the public interest include for publication on economic crime will be catch 
 let i address the component of the definition the claimant will have act to restrain the defendant ’s exercise of their right to freedom of speech secondly the exercise of that right will have be in the pursuit of the public interest or expose potential wrongdoing or other bad behaviour such as illegality or untruth or matter to do with public health and safety or the climate and the environment thirdly the claimant will have misuse litigation for its threat to cause harm to the defendant specifically through harassment stress or expense which be beyond that which can be ordinarily expect in properly conduct litigation the last point include an important distinction legal case almost always bring a measure of stress and expense to the party involve give their serious nature 
 as i have say slapp claim be often design to generate excessive stress and expense in pursuit of a remedy that be a mere fig leaf or excuse to allow the real harm that the claimant wish to cause thing that distinguish a slapp claim be that the legal action be not pursue for the appropriate remedy but as a means in its own right of bring oppression to bear to safeguard against that harm in an effective and proportionate way include by ensure that legitimate   claim can proceed the bill will introduce a new early dismissal test claimant will have to show that they be more likely than not to succeed at trial where they can not do so the case will be strike out 
 in addition much of the harm in slapp claim lie in the risk of adverse cost that defendant face a properly function early dismissal mechanism will assist in remove many of the risk to the defendant however for slapp claim that be not dismiss early the bill will introduce a new cost regime that protect defendant from cost that they would usually pay if they lose the case that will ensure that defendant can defend themselves properly and that the risk of cost do not force they to settle claim unnecessarily the underpinning principle of that new cost regime be include in the provision but the detail will be introduce under the usual cost regime make power through rule of court 
 together those provision will initially require only new civil procedure rule to give they shape and maximise their effectiveness as the evidence available show that slapp be focus on civil proceeding however the provision can be extend by regulation to any other proceeding as necessary such as the online procedure rule i trust that the government will make necessary regulation when claimant who be well resource and able to exploit any perceive loophole choose other court in which to pursue slapp that will also help to ensure that the bill be future proof slapp be likely to evolve and we need legal infrastructure to be robust enough to meet future challenge 
 as a result of the bill the court will have the necessary tool and guidance to deal swiftly with all slapp which aim to stifle freedom of speech investigative journalist will also be empower to expose wrongdoing in all its form whatever that may be it be my hope that defendant in such case will as a consequence feel safe from attempt to wrongly exploit our legal system journalist and other will be empower to shine a light on criminal misconduct wherever they find it whatever form it take without fear of spurious claim be make against they 
 unscrupulous individual or corporation brazenly misuse our court and legal system to further their agenda to the detriment of the public interest though it be wrong to do so as a matter of principle the public must know about wrongdoing and corruption so that our democratic society can function and the rule of law can be preserve this bill recognise the breadth and depth of slapp currently the law focus solely on economic crime but slapp can be find in all area of the law this all embrace legislation against slapp be i believe a truly significant step in ensure freedom of speech and remove a clear abuse of our legal system i therefore urge colleague across the house to give the bill their full support 
 we in this house should all be proud of this country ’s international reputation for uphold the rule of law in the current global climate and follow the recent murder of russian opposition leader alexei navalny that be a freedom that we can not take for grant navalny be an incredibly brave man and his wife   should be an inspiration to we all navalny want the world to know the truth about what kind of man putin be and today we be help he in that aim the protection of our legal system must be a priority for all in this house ensure that this country ’s reputation continue long into the future for that reason i thank   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david   for bring this bill before parliament today and i urge all colleague to support it we be here because we have to beef up the law to far ensure that we do not allow our legal system to be manipulate and abuse by bad faith actor wish to shut down freedom of the press and freedom of speech 
 in an investigation by the new york times find that in of the prior year litigant from russia and kazakhstan have be involve in more civil case in england than any other foreign national those case seek order to freeze the asset of people worldwide individual and corporation many from country where the freedom we enjoy in this country do not exist use strategic litigation against public participation claim to harass and intimidate journalist and author out of share information that those party do not want see or know the prime example be a case bring by multiple russian billionaire include former chelsea owner roman abramovich who attempt to sue the author and publisher of the book putin ’s people that book delve deep into the relationship between those oligarch and russian president vladimir putin a relationship that those individual care deeply about when it suit they but journalist can face legal action for point that out 
 as have be mention a kazakh mining company bring a case against another journalist tom burgis over the content of a book that he publish about illegally gain money in the global economy thankfully that attempt to silence a journalist fail i have raise the issue surround putin ’s people before in this chamber alongside many colleague from across the house include my hon friend   the member for isle of wight bob seely whose work on this issue i commend the point of these lawsuit be to threaten the defendant with colossal legal cost we be talk about amount that no normal person can afford and harass and intimidate they into capitulate putin ’s people author catherine belton and her publisher be leave with a staggering £ legal bill follow the case bring against they 
 today ’s bill present we with the opportunity to far prevent such attempt silencing of author and journalist by russian billionaire or any other bad faith actor it would put in place new rule so that claim deem to be slapp could be dismiss and defendant could be protect from pay the claimant ’s legal cost unless that be justify the government have be strong in their condemnation of slapp and i be proud to see the economic crime and corporate transparency act recently receive royal assent that act allow judge to throw out slapp relate to economic crime which be a good step at least of the slapp case identify by the foreign policy centre in be connect to financial crime and corruption however we can not and must not stop there so i welcome the fact that the government be support the bill we need to prevent all form of slapp once and for all and this bill be the mechanism for do that 
 the urgency of this issue can not be overstate   the coalition against slapp in europe find that slapp take place in europe in compare with in a increase the united kingdom be name a slapp hotbe and the forum of choice for would be slapp initiator a birmingham law school professor have say that the high cost of defamation litigation and the ability of foreign claimant to resolve dispute in the uk have make this country an ideal location for slapp 
 other legislature have already take action several us state have introduce similar law and the european parliament be expect to approve similar anti slapp directive next week as a result if we do not pass this bill today britain risk be leave behind in an area in which we should be proudly lead as more place prohibit slapp the chance that more case will be bring in the uk increase far 
 we must be clear that the only purpose of slapp be to silence critic they have no legal merit we must act to protect this country ’s international reputation for uphold the rule of law and our hard fight freedom of speech justice and the press we must ensure that journalist and publisher can publish information back by source and fact concern any individual no matter the size of their bank account 
 we in this country be proud of the leadership we have show follow the bloody russian invasion of ukraine and pass this bill would be a small but important way of contribute to that leadership i again thank the hon member for caerphilly for bring this bill to the chamber and i look forward to support its passage through the house 
 i commend my hon friend   the member for caerphilly wayne david   for his work in bring this bill to the house and i thank campaigner for what they be do to prevent the misuse of litigation to suppress freedom of speech democratic and press freedom be fundamental to our right and to challenge corruption and the abuse of power when whistleblower speak out and journalist and a free press report the truth society be well for it 
 just this week julian assange ’s extradition appeal close at the royal courts of justice it be concern to hear that he be unwell and unable to appear in court   i be conscious that the proceeding be ongoing but i want to say that human right be central to what be happen in his case the issue be not just how he have be treat simply for tell the truth if extradite he could be at risk of treatment amounting to torture and other form of ill treatment and punishment include the death penalty 
 julian assange ’s case have profound consequence for press freedom and democracy around the world we can not say that we stand for press freedom if that freedom exist only if it do not challenge certain power or go beyond what they want as my hon friend say our freedom be undermine when the rich and powerful use the threat of costly legal action to suppress public criticism that be why last year many of   we welcome amendment to the economic crime and corporate transparency act that give uk judge new power to dismiss lawsuit that attempt to silence those speak out about economic crime however give the limited scope of the act and certain shortcoming in its text those amendment fall short of provide meaningful protection against slapp 
 there be inequality under the legislation for those subject to slapp that do not relate to economic crime and corruption we know that powerful man use their power and the law to silence woman the purpose of such proceeding often describe as gagging order be to silence intimidate discredit and further disempower survivor some campaigner call it gendere censorship it happen in the uk but it be also a global phenomenon 
 although i welcome the ambition of the bill i believe there may be scope for further amendment about the definition of a slapp so that domestic abuse be fully cover particularly in the understanding of public interest i say that because we all know of a series of libel case in which wealthy man have seek to protect their reputation when woman accuse they of abuse current legislation put survivor at a disadvantage for example under the defamation act the defendant in libel case can argue a public interest defence but that be not available to survivor i appeal to the government to look at that carefully and at how the bill can be extend beyond the civil court to the family court 
 in january i participate in a backbench business debate on the use of lawfare and strategic litigation against public participation by those seek to suppress public debate bully people into submission and conceal vital information that be in the public interest i describe my experience of lawfare be use against i the house will be aware that i be completely clear and vindicate in snaresbrook crown court after what i and many other in my constituency and around the uk view to have be vexatious litigation pursue with the purpose of shut down my public participation as a democratically elect socialist member of parliament and a survivor of domestic abuse 
 the use of lawfare by abuser to pursue their current or ex partner be come to light more and more i be aware that the occurrence of civil litigation case of this nature have drastically increase particularly follow the widely publicise amber heard versus johnny depp case in the us the most common proceeding we see bring be by man accuse of sexual misconduct and/or domestic violence launch vexatious case in relation to defamation libel the misuse of private information harassment and press injunction 
 the un special rapporteur on freedom of expression irene khan write in a dedicated report on gender censorship in say 
 in a perverse twist in the metoo age woman who publicly denounce allege perpetrator of sexual violence online be increasingly subject to defamation suit or charge with criminal libel or the false reporting of crime weaponise the justice system to silence woman feed impunity while also undermine free speech 
 in addition barrister jennifer robinson and dr yoshida make the argument in their book that the current situation strike an unfair balance between his right to reputation and her right to freedom of speech what be miss in the legislation in the uk as it stand be a recognition of   the importance of her additional right her right to live a life free from gender base violence and her right to equality 
 the practice of abuser weaponise civil litigation against survivor be a continuation of abuse as well as additional trauma i often find myself ask if we can not speak about violence against woman and girl how can we even tackle it by their nature these case misuse the court and be bring against survivor to silence they and re victimise they emotionally and financially i urge the government to look at the situation in the family court as well as the civil court no should suffer domestic abuse and anyone in such a situation should be support in speak out it be   a matter of public good and public interest 
 it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum may i start by congratulate   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david he have bring forward an excellent private member ’s bill and this be entirely what we should be do with friday sitting i love friday sitting i have out myself as a geek on multiple occasion for i this be what the job be about come here and talk at length about stuff that be important to people 
 i also out myself as a lawyer and wave my llb about i be passionate about our legal system and believe keenly in it it be the jewel in the crown of our state it be par excellence and to none it deeply grieve i when something so important be pervert for the narrow interest of a small cadre of people who have rightly deduce that a technical flaw be available to they and they have enough money to exploit it the system should not be exploitable purely because someone have the financial resource to do it we should not be able to purchase justice in this country but people   do that 
 i will speak to main issue only that i have deduce from read this private member ’s bill which i will support fully i hasten to add the be a matter for when the bill reach committee and that be how we address the serious problem of forum shopping this country have a particularly robust approach to defamation legislation imagine that i publish a book like putin ’s people for example it could be the case that it be publish in different country but that i only get sue in this because this country be the that be most technically adept at allow somebody to get money out of i and keep i quiet that will then prevent i from be able to publish that book in other place effectively that process in country will gag i in other country i think we can do something in that space the hon gentleman have put together an excellent bill it be for the pinstripe suit i be actually not wear a pinstripe suit today geeky bod to get into we will have to drill down into the bill to ensure that it be as robust as possible but i be happy with its direction 
 my point be about address what the bill be really about it be about not technical amendment to the legal system as much as i love those but freedom of speech freedom of speech be of the most fundamental right in every democracy the united states constitution start with 
 congress shall make no law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievance 
 that be an incredibly powerful and potent set of clause that prevent the situation we be discuss from happen in the united states we have to rely on article of the european convention on human right and i will say now for the avoidance of doubt that you will get i through a wood chipper fast than you will get i through a division lobby to take we out of that 
 article be incredibly important but it be not adequate for the task ahead of we and that be why this be such an important bill as a member of parliament i want to be able to go out and talk about what be correct right proper and decent without have to rely on the fact that i have immunity in this chamber but i can not do that without fear or favour at the moment because this lawfare system i think the hon member for poplar and limehouse coin that term which be an effective way of describe what be go be basically be use to destroy of the fundamental principle of our democracy 
 the hon member for caerphilly be entirely right and proper to bring we this bill i will enthusiastically support it if he need people for bill committee when it get to that stage i will be there and i be afraid i will be talk a lot 
 it be a pleasure to take part in the debate particularly with you in the chair mr speaker this be essentially a debate about free speech which i know be of great concern to you not only in this chamber but outside it it be also of particular concern to my hon friend   the member for caerphilly wayne david and i congratulate he on bring the bill forward he be quite busy with his other hat on as the shadow minister for the middle east so it be good that he have time to be here on a friday to promote his bill i hope he have the government ’s support 
 i would say that this become a live issue for the house when   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   hold his january debate on lawfare and the uk court system as with everything american the term slapp have take over the language here but lawfare be effectively the same thing on that day which be really the issue ’s run out i reply for the opposition there be many strong contribution and the debate put the issue on the map include on the government ’s map 
 let we give the government a little bit of credit although not too much there have be some progress we have hear about what be in the economic crime and corporate transparency act deal with the issue of slapp but in a particular way and for a particular type of offence that be around economic crime and the anti slapps taskforce also meet but it be somewhat disappointing that the government have not bring forward their own comprehensive legislation on the issue i hope they will use the agency of my hon friend the member for caerphilly to get something on the book in the time available in this parliament nevertheless we have not do the entire job that be no   criticism at all of my hon friend and i do not know whether that be an invitation for i to be on the bill committee as well 
 i will deal with point that need slightly further attention the which my hon friend mention be the issue of slapp take place in the dark pre issue as it be there have be some attention by the solicitors regulation authority to that in issue guideline but there be still quite a strong feeling that many slapp be effective long before get to the courtroom because of the intimidation which we should not underemphasise place on individual they may be author or journalist but they may just be individual member of the public the intimidation may even be of corporation and yet they can not take the risk because they be up against people with not just deep but bottomless pocket we hear about the £ cost for catherine belton in relation to putin ’s people that be pocket money for abramovich but for a publisher let alone a journalist it be a significant sum of money a more comprehensive view of how slapps act be important in relation to resource 
 i do not want to disagree with my hon friend but we need to look at the point that the anti slapp coalition and the nuj have raise and   the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord about a subjective or objective test that be not easy obviously there be subjective as well as objective test throughout the legal system nevertheless there be a real fear that the need for a defendant to show subjective element will be a path for the claimant to tie proceeding up in knot complicate thing and drag they out i do not know what the solution be but we should at least explore that and listen to the expert organisation particularly the national union of journalists and the anti slapp coalition which be urge we to take that course 
 do the hon member think that a minor amendment could be introduce to add an objective test base on observable feature of abuse to help prevent litigation from be misuse to suppress freedom of speech 
 it sound like the hon member want to be on the bill committee and be draft his amendment in his head i have never know a private member ’s bill committee to be so popular i be not a legal draftsman and i do not know the answer to his question but we need to bottom out this issue because it seem to be attract the most attention 
 other issue have be raise about overlap with the defamation act and cost there be provision on cost in the bill but it be about whether they be drive down cost as far as they can and about public interest a number of area could be far explore even in this short bill cost be a vital but often neglect part of the legal process this be a hobby horse of mine we have just discuss the media bill in the house and the repeal of section of the crime and courts act which in effect take leveson part out of the equation with regard to have a level playing field for victim of press abuse if i can put it that way 
 on slapp the government appear to support legislation such as this to prevent cost be use as a weapon to prevent people get their just desert and    their day in court but there be a different situation when it come to the medium itself i can not for the life of i see the difference of course leveson cut both way leveson also provide a formula for protect small publisher against exactly the sort of people who take part in slapp indeed he could have use the word slapp in his report it also protect the innocent victim of press abuse because the press magnate not journalist and small publisher but major publisher also have bottomless pocket 
 in his response or during the passage of the bill could the minister think again at the very least about how the government will approach the issue of small publisher and journalist be sue in order to protect the so call privacy often the nefarious activity of very wealthy individual and corporation this can affect anyone include journalist like tom burgis who win his case the experience do not discourage he because next week i be hop to go to the launch of his late book cuckooland where the rich own the truth let i give he a little plug it will soon be available from all good bookshop it take huge courage for someone to risk everything simply in the course of prosecute their employment when there be the risk of bankruptcy or be drop by their publisher although that be not at risk i have to say in tom ’s case 
 we hear about the case of charlotte leslie a former colleague of ours who be effectively persecute through the court we be lucky we have the protection of privilege here however when we step outside this place we can become a victim in that way just like anybody else who be with good intent simply try to tell the truth 
 this even affect organisation such as the serious fraud office which be still be prosecute through the court by the eurasian natural resources corporation the serious fraud office launch the action in good faith and there be what i would call retaliatory slapp action although the original action by the sfo have be discontinue the slapp continue it really do look like a topsy turvy world when organisation that we should rely on to regulate society in which i include investigative journalist member of parliament and certainly criminal investigation organisation themselves become the victim of those they wish to call out 
 that be why we urgently need a much more comprehensive approach to slapp and that be why i fully welcome the bill and will support it today however i think we can do more work on this in respond today i hope the government will express their strong support and their desire to go far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this could be quite a big day for the welsh with my hon friend   the member for caerphilly wayne david   introduce his bill and my hon friend   the member for newport west ruth jones   introduce her later i hope i also hope to move from the front bench to the back benches to introduce my own bill later in proceeding so that be welsh bills this morning of course on the front bench we also have my right hon friend   the member for alyn and deeside mark tami   from the opposition whips office so it really be a big morning for the welsh 
 my hon friend the member for caerphilly and i come into the house together in it be hard to think that that be nearly year ago i congratulate he on his outing in all that time promote a private member ’s bill this morning i be glad he be successful in the ballot as it be an important bill for year strategic lawsuit have enable the wealthy and powerful to weaponise their wealth to sue critic into silence as hon member have say it be important that this house vote to put an end to these tactic that gag the press and intimidate people ask legitimate question by threaten they with enormous legal cost lawfare as it have be refer to today 
 i thank those who have participate in the debate my hon friend the members for poplar and limehouse apsana begum and for hammersmith andy slaughter and the hon member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson and for west bromwich east nicola richards they all speak extremely effectively in support of the bill but also raise appropriate question about how it should proceed in committee i be pleased that the bill have cross party support and i understand the government be in full support of it i can confirm that it have the support of those on the labour front bench as well 
 it be a step forward that the scope of protection provide for in the bill be not limited as be currently the case to economic crime slapp often masquerade as defamation or privacy claim be not really about seek justice but about impose silence exploit the financial and emotional strain of proceeding to discourage individual from exercise their right to speak on matter of public interest 
 labour have long recognise the danger pose by slapp to our democratic value we have already commit to introduce legislation to halt the ability of russian oligarch and the super wealthy such as roman abramovich who have already be mention today to use their wealth as a weapon against those who dare to scrutinise their action the background to my hon friend ’s bill be root in a disturbing trend of legal harassment from aggressive pre action letter to the targeting of vulnerable financial defendant slapp undermine the foundation of accountability and freedom of speech the enormous legal cost threaten by slapp serve not justice but the suppression of truth 
 the bill be not merely a response to a grow trend of legal harassment but a declaration of our value as a society that cherish free speech and the rule of law it broaden the scope beyond economic crime offer protection across all public interest discourse to ensure that no avenue be leave for the misuse of our legal system to suppress legitimate scrutiny and accountability the legal reform propose by my hon friend in his bill   be both necessary and timely they reflect a deep understanding of the challenge pose by slapp as outline in the evidence session of several parliamentary committees by provide mechanism for early dismissal and cost protection and extend protection to all court and tribunal we be fortify our defence against the abuse of legislation 
 as we consider the provision of the bill let we remember the individual and indeed institution who have be unjustly target by slapp their struggle underscore the imperative for this legislation i acknowledge the effort of campaigner include the uk anti slapp   coalition for their tireless work in bring this issue to light we must ensure that our legal system serve justice not the interest of those who seek to wield it as a tool of oppression 
 i acknowledge the issue that have be raise about the bill i be sure they will be rehearse in committee when we will have a deep discussion on they in addition to the concern that have be raise we need to make sure although i be sure it do not that the bill do not prevent ordinary people who wish to restrain the publication of libel and intrusion by wealthy publication from be able to do so in law as my father always use to say in life we should help the weak against the strong i know that that be my hon friend ’s intention in bring forward his bill 
 i urge all hon member to support the bill in do so we be take a stand against the tactic that gag our press intimidate our citizen and erode our democracy it be a step forward in an ongoing effort to protect freedom of expression and to ensure that those who seek to report on wrongdoing can do so without fear of retribution in the fight for justice and accountability there be no room for silence the bill can help to end the scourge of slapp and reaffirm our dedication to the principle of democracy and freedom 
 i congratulate   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david   on bring forward the bill and the numerous campaigner who have be press this issue for many year as we have hear slapp be an abuse of our court and our law by corrupt individual who seek to stifle free speech and a free press of the linchpin of our democracy 
 i can not talk about the specific case that   the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum   raise but i can reassure she that the bill widen the scope beyond what be in the economic crime and corporate transparency act and that it now talk about all kind of behaviour i be more than happy to discuss the specific issue with the hon member for caerphilly as it be his bill to see what we can do to ensure that we either reassure or accommodate she on the specific issue she wish to see cover 
 this issue become increasingly press when the russian oligarch and ally of putin use this process for their own end alongside they we see behaviour by multinational corporation or disreputable landlord to use and abuse our process slapp must always be take seriously and tackle swiftly in this house we have the ability and the privilege to ensure that such abuse be address head on this house stand for free speech and for hold the powerful to account and for always seek to ensure that the good interest of the public in the wide sense be be serve by the law 
 slapp style litigation be an abuse of power design to inhibit public interest investigation and reporting the harm that slapp cause be not only that they stifle public comment by force its removal or edit it they also discourage journalist academic and campaigner from investigate issue in the place leave matter of public interest undiscovere and the british public in the dark in this way the effect of slapp be far more   pernicious we can not sit by and allow our medium to feel that some people and organisation can not be subject to scrutiny just because they have unlimited financial firepower to mobilise aggressive legal tactic to quote andrew galizia whose mother daphne a maltese investigative journalist be murder in 
 the aim of these lawsuit be to deprive the target of time and resource and to deter other from take up the same story 
 his mother be subject to lawsuit at the time of her death 
 regardless of whether a claim be aim at an author an academic a journalist or a private individual this abuse of the law to muzzle the free press must not go unchecked we will not allow our justice system to be abuse in the government ’s response to our original call for evidence we say that although there be power enable court to strike out case as an abuse of process these power need to be strengthen to counteract the very sophisticated and aggressive action bring by slapp claimant 
 the house will be aware of some high profile case that have shine a light on slapp case such as that bring against the british journalist tom burgis whom member have already mention who be sue for libel in the high court by enrc an oligarch own mining company follow his publication of kleptopia how dirty money be conquer the world there be multiple claim issue against tom burgis by enrc target he as an individual author rather than his publisher these claim concern his tweet podcast and article that mention his book the case be dismiss early on the statement complain about be find not to be defamatory and mr burgis be vindicate but how many more case do not reach our courtroom due to the intimidatory tactic and cost run up by aggressive claimant before proceeding be even initiate i think that be the point make by   the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter and i will address a couple of his point at this juncture 
 we have engage with the sra and will continue to do so as the hon member mention warning notice have already be issue the fine for misbehaviour by solicitor firm have be increase and pre action behaviour be a legitimate cause of concern the government will continue to engage with the regulator to see how that can be far address as so many people have volunteer to be on the public bill committee i be sure that with the indulgence of the hon member for caerphilly we can look at the issue in more depth 
 there be evidence that the number of slapp be increase year on year there be case in the uk in in and in such worrying and abusive conduct whereby those with deep pocket attempt to financially bully dissent voice be unacceptable   in our democracy the court must not be a pawn in these underhand attempt to cover up corruption and wrongdoing 
 slapp be a modern day struggle between david and goliath we have individual journalist academic and author up against extremely wealthy individual and corporate with unlimited resource on their side we can not let this type of intimidation and harassment stand it be right that wrongdoing and dubious deal be lay bare for the world to see and those who expose such behaviour should not be afraid of the repercussion   of do so that be why the government listen   and introduce the economic crime and corporate transparency act to tackle slapp claim connect to financial misdeed 
 that act mean we be the country in the world to legislate against slapp at a national level although we can argue over whether it be overdue we be certainly the to do it and we ought to take pride in the fact that this legislature act fast than most the act give cover to only a small part of the slapp regime and it target only part of economic crime which be why this private member ’s bill seek to address the gap it will make sure that the definition of slapp be more comprehensive 
 the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord   raise the issue of behaviour in the test of objectivity and subjectivity the issue of subjectivity be not unusual and the court will consider all evidence before it come to an assessment include an explanation from the claimant as to why their claim be reasonable the court be of course well verse in take that information into account the test of subjectivity or intent be not unusual and it be well establish in our court system clause give specific example of slapp type behaviour i believe there be a careful balance between the standard practice of intent and tighten thing up to give objective guidance to the judiciary on what constitute slapp type behaviour 
 the bill follow the economic crime and corporate transparency act in establish a cost protection regime that limit legal cost in slapp claim protect defendant from the obscene cost run up by claimant to increase the intimidatory effect of their claim this will also help to address the glare inequality of arm between the party in these case 
 of course of the big step forward be the ability to secure early dismissal so that these case do not rumble on and rack up fee particularly for defendant the ability to strike out case at an early stage be a big part of the cost protection armoury our reform also have to ensure a balance between defend people from slapp type behaviour and protect access to justice which be a fundamental part of our system it be for the court and the judiciary to determine whether a case be a slapp and whether it have merit we have act to remove the level of fear and risk that these case can engender the government be glad to welcome and support this bill which build on the important progress already make 
 i thank the hon member for caerphilly for seize the moment to introduce a private member ’s bill this be an opportune time to build on what we have do so far and to make it more comprehensive as he outline so well the government have find that the scourge of slapp be unfortunately spread into new area such as sexual harassment clinical negligence and landlord and tenant dispute the purpose of this bill be to tackle such behaviour if the behaviour look like a duck and quack like a duck it ’ a slapp interruption sorry that be rather clumsy english i be sure hansard will correct i 
 this bill be a major step forward and it be time to legislate the majority of slapp be think to be link to economic crime but it be time to move on and make the definition more all encompass 
 i will cover a couple of point raise by hon member my hon friend   the member for west bromwich east nicola richards   raise the belton case again information from all slapp case form part of the call for evidence so i can reassure she that the activity in the belton case will be part of the foundation of this bill 
 my hon friend   the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson   speak about forum shopping which i will look at and i be sure he will raise it in his customary fashion in committee i be sure the hon member for caerphilly will urge he not to talk quite as much as he promise 
 it be a credit to this parliament that member of all party have rally to support action on this issue and to introduce new law to help ensure the integrity of our justice system and to support the freedom and protection that we all cherish in some way a private member ’s bill be the most fitting way to complete what the government start 
 i have speak about the work we be do with the solicitors regulation authority to ensure that it tighten up its regulation and we will continue to engage with it i pay tribute to the uk anti slapp coalition which have be an enormously effective stakeholder the coalition have support the government ’s effort and i thank it for its consistent engagement and clarity on this issue 
 the department for culture media and sport launch the slapps taskforce last september with a remit to develop non legislative recommendation to tackle slapp good progress be be make on a number of front and i thank the secretary of state for her tireless commitment 
 internationally the uk be represent as an expert member of the council of europe ’s working group on slapp which conclude its mandate in december the draft recommendation which be produce over the course of year will now make its way to the committee of ministers and we trust that it will be eventually adopt in all member state 
 the government act last october by legislate against slapp because we must not allow our court to be abuse and our legal system manipulate we be therefore pleased to support the bill and will continue    to ensure that those who speak out against corruption who hold the powerful to account and who guard our freedom through their voice be protect 
 let i again thank the hon member for caerphilly for promote the bill i also thank the official at the ministry of justice for provide all the necessary support as we move forward 
 with the leave of the house i be very pleased that we have have such a good debate it be laudable that so many member in all part of the house have take the time to attend and to make such excellent contribution i also pay tribute to people and organisation outside the house notably the uk anti slapp coalition it have work tirelessly on this issue for some time and its input have be of tremendous value i thank the ministry of justice and its civil servant for their assistance its briefing and its constructive engagement at all time 
 there be a number of issue that many member consider particularly important such as the so call issue of subjective test i be inclined to agree with what the minister say in sum up the debate but i accept that there be room for further discussion and we will be able to deal with it in some detail if the bill go into committee 
 i agree that cost be a fundamental issue a number of member have cite example in which it be enormously important in ensure that justice be do and be see to be do in her evidence to a select committee the author catherine belton say that in london a single letter cost as much as £ address concern that have be express by a number of people if letter cost £ we all know how much an entire case could cost surely that can not be right in a democratic country which pride itself on freedom of speech in which freedom of speech be pivotal and which allow justice for all 
 i hope very much that the bill will continue its progress through the house and will reach the statute book because i think that that would be a huge step forward for parliamentary democracy 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read a time to stand committed to a public bill committee standing order no 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 i be delighted to be here to introduce a bill that will help to support our thriving and dynamic space sector it will amend section 12(2 of the space industry act to make clear in legislation that all spaceflight operator licence must specify a limit on the amount of the licensee ’s liability under section of the act 
 the act enable commercial spaceflight activity which include launch a spacecraft and operate a satellite in orbit for example and other activity such as the operation of a spaceport and management of a range to be carry out under a licence in the united kingdom the act set out the broad licensing and regulatory framework for carry out such activity and be underpin with more detailed provision in the space industry regulations 
 united nations space treaty place obligation and responsibility on state for activity in outer space in particular un space treaty make state liable for damage or injury cause by their space activity or those of their national section of the act require person carry out spaceflight activity to indemnify the uk government and a number of name public body against any claim bring against the government or body in respect of damage or loss arise out of or in connection with those spaceflight activity however that be subject to any limit on the amount of an operator ’s liability specify in their licence except in prescribed circumstance such as where the operator be liable in respect of gross negligence or wilful misconduct 
 the act currently provide power for the regulator to specify a limit on the amount of the operator ’s liability in their licence but the act do not make it mandatory currently section 12(2 of that act provide that an operator licence may specify a limit on the amount of a licensee ’s liability to indemnify under section but this contrast with regulation of the space industry regulations make under power in section 34(5 of the act whereby an operator licence must specify a limit on the amount of a licensee ’s liability for damage or injury to party it also contrast with section 5(3 of the outer space act which regulate uk national scottish firm and body incorporate under the law of any part of the uk that carry on space activity from outside the uk these require a licence to specify the maximum amount of the licensee ’s liability to indemnify the government under section of that act 
 through response to the government ’s consultation on spaceflight liability insurance and charging the government be aware that operator hold unlimited liability could be a barrier to conduct spaceflight activity from the uk the same consultation confirm that other launch nation limit liability or provide a state guarantee for spaceflight activity conduct from their territory 
 current government policy and guidance be that all spaceflight operator licence will contain limit on the amount of the operator ’s liability and the amount of   insurance that they be require to hold so that no operator will face unlimited liability however industry operator continue to lobby for legislative certainty and have raise that for spaceflight activity in the uk to be commercially viable there need to be a clear mandatory cap on the amount of liability to indemnify under section of the act 
 the bill will provide legislative certainty by amend may to must in section 12(2 of the act so that an operator licence must specify a limit on the amount of the operator ’s liability under section the bill make a small amendment to section 36(3 of the act the propose amendment to the act will meet a key ask of the space sector on regulatory improvement to provide assurance to investor that limit on the amount of an operator ’s liability will be include in licence the bill will also address a recommendation make by the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform 
 there have be parliamentary scrutiny the science and technology committee raise the question of operator certainty on liability cap in its report of the session uk space strategy and uk satellite infrastructure publish on   november the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform consider current requirement and view they 
 as discourage investment and make the uk uncompetitive 
 recommendation be to 
 amend the space industry act to cap liability and indemnity requirement for licence applicant to launch and operate satellite from the uk 
 there have also be consultation on   october the government publish a consultation on spaceflight liability insurance and charge respondent raise concern about the wording of section 12(2 of the space industry act under which a licence only may contain a limit of liability with respect to claim make under section of the act on   march in response to the consultation the government say in their regulation and guidance on spaceport and spaceflight activity 
 if another suitable piece of primary legislation be bring forward the government may seek to amend the wording in section 12(2 from may to must 
 we all benefit from the service provide by satellite we might pay for our morning coffee use contactless payment google pay or even cash withdraw from an atm none of that would be possible without satellite satellite provide precise reference for navigation communication to remote place and picture of our change planet not to mention the support they provide to the defence and security of the united kingdom satellite datum space technology and space application be use to enhance our everyday life 
 the space sector be hugely valuable to the uk ’s economy it be worth over £ and directly employ more than people it support over job across the supply chain the uk be already of the world ’s strong centre of advanced satellite manufacturing thank to this government it be now possible to launch satellite from uk spaceport rather than rely solely on overseas spaceport to launch uk build satellite into orbit last year an historical launch from uk soil be make by virgin orbit at spaceport cornwall in december saxavord spaceport in the shetland islands become the uk ’s license   vertical launch spaceport with more to follow new launch company such as orbex and skyrora have build factory in scotland create hundred of new job ready to take advantage of the new opportunity that the government have create 
 in preparation for this debate i have be ask question by several member and i will address those now i have be ask what effect the bill will have on public expenditure and i can assure the house that it will not entail any additional expenditure as the amendment be in line with government policy i have be ask whether there be any transitional arrangement there be not clause 2(3 provide that the bill will come into force month to the day on which it be pass transitional arrangement be not require because no licence have be grant that do not have a limit on liability specify in they by virtue of the government ’s policy on limit liability 
 i have be ask whether i have ensure compatibility with the european convention on human right as this be a private member ’s bill no statement of compatibility be require however as record in the explanatory note the department for transport consider that the provision of the bill be compatible with the convention i have be ask whether it be compatible with environmental law again as it be a private member ’s bill no statement under section of the environment act be require but as the explanatory note say the department for transport be of the view that the bill do not contain provision that if enact would be environmental law for the purpose of section 
 this be a narrowly focused bill address what the space sector have ask for i hope that no further amendment will be table as it would be a shame to   be unable to progress or deliver this key ask from   our increasingly important space industry because of amendment or addition 
 let i give a final summary of the purpose of the bill why i think it be important and how it will benefit our space industry before a company can operate a satellite in orbit or carry out a launch mission from the uk it must obtain a spaceflight operator licence under the space industry act the licence process ensure that spaceflight activity be undertake safely securely and in accordance with the uk ’s international obligation under united nations space treaty the state be ultimately liable for any damage or injury that may be cause by its space activity even when undertake by commercial space operator 
 the space industry act contain provision to help mitigate potential cost to uk taxpayer arise from uk commercial spaceflight activity that include requirement for operator to hold insurance and under section to indemnify the uk government and other name public body against any claim bring against the government or body in respect of damage or loss it be recognise however that unlimited liability on commercial space activity would be a barrier to their operating in the united kingdom other space nation such as france and the united states of america limit liability or provide a state guarantee for the launch activity that take place from their territory the space industry act contain power to specify in a spaceflight operator ’s licence a limit on the amount of an operator ’s liability in order to indemnify the government and other public body government policy be that the regulator should   use those power to specify a limit on the amount of the operator ’s liability in the licence so that no operator will face unlimited liability it be essentially a form of risk sharing between the commercial operator and government this policy be set out in guidance and i understand that all spaceflight operator licence issue under the space industry act to date contain a limit on the amount of an operator ’s liability 
 however the industry have make it very clear in response to consultation and in other fora that it would welcome legal certainty that it will not face unlimited liability when launch or operate a satellite from the uk set that clear requirement in law would provide uk industry and those look to invest in the uk with great certainty and would carry more force than reliance on policy statement and guidance this bill will provide that legal certainty by amend section 12(2 of the space industry act so that spaceflight operator licence must specify a limit on the amount of the operator ’s liability under section of that act as such the bill will provide a vital further boost to our burgeon uk space industry i be particularly mindful of the benefit it will bring to grow and innovative company such as surrey satellite technology ltd on the surrey research park many of whose past and current employee live in my constituency of woking 
 our uk space industry be thrive but this measure be vital to secure an equally exciting and dynamic future it be company such as surrey satellite technology ltd just outside my constituency and many of whose employee live in my constituency that will benefit other firm large medium and small will grow in the uk and come to the uk if this measure be pass to ensure that exciting and dynamic future i commend the bill to the house 
 i rise to speak in support of the bill in my capacity as chair of the all party parliamentary group for space before i get to the thrust of my speech i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests my interest be both financial and non financial and i have a number of outside role that be relevant to the uk space industry 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for woking mr lord   on introduce a bill that appear extraordinarily simple but as we hear from his well thought through and well deliver speech would actually have a profound impact on a lot of technical area in the space sector it show a great deal of skill on his part that he can do something quite so complex in such a straightforward intelligent and elegant way 
 as my hon friend say the bill seek to enhance the uk ’s position in the space industry by make change to liability for spaceflight risk that be a wholly pragmatic and welcome change the bill ’s purpose be to make the uk an even well place to operate space business from and it follow on from the space strategy publish or year ago 
 the bill seek to resolve some technical anomaly in the insurance sector in a goo and sensible way importantly it clarify aspect of risk in a way that should provide comfort to those financial wizard support our superb space innovator many of whom i have meet i be   delighted to say that many come to parliament for of the regular space sector showcase run by the all party parliamentary group for space the next which will be in the attlee suite on the morning of   march be on the sustainability and future of space activity all member and members staff be welcome to come along to hear about that fascinating area 
 the space sector be incredibly important people do not realise that every time they use a cashpoint their transaction be confirm through positioning navigation and timing that come from navigation satellite pass overhead we can do an amazing number of thing we can analyse a country ’s economic activity through heat sensor from earth observation satellite which can tell we whether a city a port or a railway station be busy we can look at any number of different thing we can predict the use of crop fertiliser plant and distressed crop through earth observation satellite 
 i be delighted to say that i chair the advisory board of the space energy initiative this be a non financial interest and we be look at whether beam energy from space can be part of the future of a secure and safe planet what we can do be absolutely extraordinary in we land a man on the moon and we be do an enormous number of brilliant thing i be delighted to say that a number of uk space industry be now look to get involve in the artemis programme whereby nasa be look to take astronaut back to the moon possibly as early as next year this be a very exciting time for space in a wide range of area 
 we can go wrong by focus specifically on the space sector itself i would suggest that there be an increase benefit to the uk that go far than the space industry the space industry be important for a number of reason of which be that because of the high value of this type of activity it address exactly what adam smith propose in his book the wealth of nations nation should try to create great wealth by have great productivity this country have have a productivity conundrum for a number of year and concentrate on the space sector could increase our productivity and therefore benefit the whole of the country 
 the bill also talk about the service sector the insurance industry member will be aware that before come to parliament i be in financial service investment banking and small investment fund management so when i look at the opportunity present by something such as the space sector i tend to look at the many uk opportunity in the context not just of the direct beneficiary but of how the sector help the wide economy the uk have of the good certainly the old wholesale insurance market locate in the city of london it must be the aim of the whole of government to ensure not just that spaceflight and operation be control from the uk but that all involve in the space industry come to london to seek insurance and other financial service from our financial service expert 
 i have argue for some time that the uk should do more to align the interest of our space industry with the interest of the uk financial market i take inspiration from a former chancellor of the exchequer when he be newly appoint chancellor after the general   election many year ago the former member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath recognise the uk ’s good but small film industry he choose to make a small intervention in the tax system to incentivise investment into uk film as a direct result he help to rebuild the uk film industry into the vibrant and innovative industry that   it be today 
 i suspect that when we look at some great film a direct thread can be trace between that intervention by the former right hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath back in the late 1990 and for example the success of the harry potter franchise right here in the uk harry potter be a brilliant export and be always go to be a great film success but i be certain that without that intervention the hero of the harry potters may well have cast their spell with american accent i think we can look to that dare i say great former labour chancellor for the huge amount he do for the british film industry it may be the only time that the house hear i say great and labour chancellor in the same sentence but he do an important job and we should recognise that of course there be a little bit of abuse of the system by or people enjoy it but notwithstanding that the intervention have be important 
 a similar intervention can be make to support not just the space industry but our world class wholesale financial market it be important that the city of london do not just think about what it do today and whether it do market well it should be completely innovate the whole time to seek opportunity that come in the future we should not think about any industry only in term of what we can offer it we must think about our ambition in any sector with a view to how it can enhance wide service sector 
 in the case of financial service investment banker raise capital investment and insurance service secure risk cover for innovator or help investor to find a way to maximise their opportunity in the sector we should be think how a fiscal intervention might benefit all concern after all our brilliant innovator research institution network of catapult accelerator and university and all the rest of it already attract a great deal of international business to the uk that be a very good thing we also need to appreciate that we need the good space industry financier in the world to come to the uk and locate their expertise right here in the city of london and the good insurance expert and the good space lawyer we need to seek to achieve in the space industry and the wide economy the uk be the good place to come for everything need to support space ambition 
 i believe the government be enthusiastic about this private member ’s bill and i thank my hon friend the member for woke for bring it forward it be a truly innovative bill the city of london as i think i have mention need to remain relevant the city of london be an incredible jewel in the crown of this country it have have its problem but none the less it pay through taxation for an awful lot of hospital police officer and school a lot of good thing come out of the city of london but it need to be relevant the whole time for the future we need to be make sure as we develop something like the space industry or ai or any of these other industry that we help the city of london to focus and be a part of that so that there be a symbiotic   relationship between the financial service sector and these other sector that will benefit our economy i be delighted to support the bill it be fantastic 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for woking mr lord   on bring forward this private member ’s bill which i rise in support of follow my hon friend   the member for wyre forest mark garnier i will take we from the city of london on which he make some brilliant and valid point to the space sector we be almost in danger of have some join up thinking in this place today 
 would not be surprised to see a cornish mp rise on these benches when we be speak about space we have a lot to say in cornwall about the space sector cornwall be in fact at the forefront of the uk ’s develop space economy and be play an increasingly important role in the national space programme to ensure that as many people as possible contribute to and benefit from the economic growth cornwall ’s data space and aerospace strategy ambition include mitigate and reverse environmental degradation restore nature and seek to protect business and community from the impact of climate change both locally and globally work with the government to grow the uk space economy as a whole and grow the cornwall and isles of scilly economy to deliver job and international investment while offer an outstanding quality of life for its people 
 cornwall and isles of scilly local enterprise partnership make space of its main priority some time ago if the house will indulge i i would like to pay tribute to of the key player mark duddridge who we lose suddenly last year mark use to be chair of the local enterprise partnership sadly a matter of hour after i be in a zoom meeting with he from this place he tragically and suddenly die mark have leave a hole in the industry and business community in cornwall and be very fondly remember new mp look for the people they can trust with knowledge in all these thing so that we can gain our own knowledge and learn about they and mark be certainly of those people for i 
 mark say of the space industry 
 we ’ve back cornwall ’s spaceport bid from day because we see the potential for cornwall to play a vital role in the uk ’s space economy ambition and create high value job 
 the global space industry could triple in value to more than $ by and what ’s drive that be climate change security and telecom the facility we be help to fund at spaceport cornwall be already have a catalytic effect and attract new space company to cornwall 
 of those be international space logistic company d orbit which will establish a satellite assembly integration and testing facility at spaceport cornwall ’s centre for space technologies with support from the european space agency mark play a key role in that and other be continue his work he be a talented and passionate advocate for cornwall and have leave a large hole 
 i thank my hon friend the member for woke for bring clarity to the industry as a whole as he have mention where we have a may we will now have a must that be always important so that industry know what it be do member may not know that cornwall have more than business involve in the space industry   and local and national partner in people in cornwall be employ in the space industry which be worth about £ by we expect more than people to be employ in it with a potential value of £ 
 my hon friend have mention some of the business and service employ by the space industry let i add to that list the marine protection area that we be deploy not just around uk water but globally because that be do via satellite how do we know how bad climate change be in different part of the world satellite do that for we 
 when i be a cornwall councillor we have interesting debate about the benefit of the spaceport in cornwall some of our environmentalist be concern that we be send huge great jumbo jet off into space and that it would cause a lot of pollution but my belief and that of a lot of my constituent be that the good outweigh the bad give the amount of information that we can now get and that surely we in cornwall want to provide the job and infrastructure to allow that information to come back to earth 
 so what else be cornwall do in the space industry there be artificial intelligence and professional service we have space lawyer in cornwall this legislation will be of great interest to they and how they can help their client and they be abreast of it all foot anstey be such firm provide those service 
 we recently have drone test over the bay of falmouth by a company call open skies cornwall i pay tribute to the falmouth harbour commissioner miles carden for spearhead that project when huge tanker be ashore in the bay of falmouth or if in high sea it be too dangerous even for pilot boat drone can take out medical supply and bit for the boat that could save life and could certainly save a lot of money for those company so they be a great investment 
 another tech company farfields operate at mylor boat harbour with mylor boat hire it be test electric eco launch use a low cost satellite network rather than wireless system so that check on the battery voltage of a boat ’s electric motor can be do via gps check can be do on bilge pump and all sort of other thing on boat all that be happen as part of the space industry which be not just about launch rocket into space and it be vital 
 my hon friend the member for woking mention the newquay spaceport that be year of work i again pay tribute to melissa quinn who spearhead much of that project despite what people have say in the press the newquay spaceport be a huge success everything that newquay and cornwall do work perfectly cosmic girl run into issue sadly the mission be unsuccessful but newquay prove that we could have a spaceport in the uk that be what matter to cornwall 
 to reinforce that point it be a rather peculiar thing about the british that we tend to look at failure as a problem exactly this type of thing happen with the launch of the spacex starship the minute it clear the pad the mission have be entirely successful when that enormous rocket big than a saturn v rocket go spiral out of control and blow up    the spacex team let out a cheer because they have get it right we sometimes get it wrong in the uk as my hon friend mention there be a problem with the rocket itself but the uk get it absolutely bang on the money in every single way the licensing and everything go perfectly right the fact that a stage fuel filter go wrong have nothing to do with newquay or the government the spaceport be a real success story 
 i thank my hon friend for his intervention and i will pass on his regard to the good people of cornwall he be absolutely right it be a brilliant project from start to finish we have engagement locally and nationally and the local mp my hon friend   the member for st austell and newquay steve double work with the project from start to finish 
 let i explain what it mean to the people of cornwall it have inspire a whole generation of child in the county i actually feel sorry for colleague who go into school to talk about mining and renewable and who try to inspire child to go into such career because melissa quinn go in and absolutely wipe the floor with they she have inspire a whole generation to go into space career a lot of kid and family in cornwall think because we live in cornwall this be n’t for we but it absolutely be for we and our child 
 because of the project we have see investment go into truro and penwith college which now have the facility to train engineer and to do virtual welding and all sort of thing i have no idea what go on there but the facility be very shiny and fabulous martin tucker the principal have be fully engage with this project and other to ensure that the kid who be inspire in primary school at the beginning of it can carry out their training in cornwall and go into career in the county cornish mp have be fight for this for a decade or more and it be start to happen now thank to that project 
 cosmic girl run into problem newquay be only ever suppose to have or launch a year be we go to get another yes i absolutely hope that we be but it be not just about work towards launch the project mean that we have the know how the supply chain and the knowledge to support other launch around the country and across the world it be fantastic that the spaceport be still there and we should keep it go i know that the cornwall and isles of scilly local enterprise partnership and cornwall council be still very enthusiastic about ensure that we harness the expertise and do not let any of it go 
 the other large company that members may or may not have hear of i be sure my hon friend the member for woking have hear of it be goonhilly earth station when people drive right down into the west of cornwall and the constituency of my hon friend   the member for st ives derek thomas they will look across the moorland see huge satellite dish and think my goodness what on earth be they do there goonhilly be fantastic the world ’s private deep space communication network it provide additional capacity to the nasa and european space agency network any deep space mission that member have hear of will have be support by goonhilly and the team there 
 i do not know whether member have see the australian movie the dish in which the character have a small amount of time when they be the only one on earth support whatever deep space mission or moon landing mission be take place goonhilly start a bit like that but it have develop so much more i can not remember the figure off the top of my head but the capacity for the amount of datum that can be store at the facility be phenomenal ian jones who run the facility be always look for people to go and see what brilliant thing they be do such as radio astronomy support by cryogenically cool metre antenna it be a part of the global space communication network 
 on our ambition we hope that by cornwall and the isles of scilly will be a leader in the national space programme exploit the physical digital and intellectual asset of the area and use satellite datum to overcome local and global challenge such as the impact of climate change which we have hear about by datum space and aerospace will have contribute an additional £ to the economic value of cornwall and the isles and scilly through increase productivity and job turnover create twice the average gross value add per capita of £ or more 
 to facilitate those strategic ambition we have identify local and national strategic lead to support we in maintain awareness of the priority that be vital follow the aftermath of what happen at newquay as i say this be still very much part of cornwall and the isles of scilly lep ’s priority it be interlink with all the other industry we be try to promote in cornwall such as renewable and the resurgence of critical mineral critical mineral will need to come out of the ground in cornwall to ensure that we have all these satellite 
 as i mention early company be do all sort of amazing thing satellite that be only the size of a ford fiesta can now be build and go up into space we be go to launch a satellite hopefully this be still a reality that take a deep dive look from space at cornwall ’s landscape and at what we be and be not do for example we have slightly different grade agricultural land grade 3b land which be vulnerable to proposal for solar farm be actually the most fertile land we have in cornwall we be learn all that because of satellite i could go on and on 
 the change my hon friend the member for woking be introduce today may look like a small change but it be huge it will bring clarity to all the company in the city of london that my hon friend the member for wyre forest talk about and to every single company i have mention and more to ensure that there be a level playing field for everybody that everything be clear and that they can continue to build and build and build this be a very exciting future for our country and for cornwall i thank my hon friend the member for woke for introduce the bill 
 it be a pleasure to follow my hon friend   the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory there be few more intrepid voyager in this particular enterprise defiant in the face of adversity but also on a voyage of discovery she make an excellent speech and pick up on what the bill be really about 
 my hon friend rightly identify that this not just about put big shiny thing on rocket and fire they into the sky it be about unlock other important bit of the economy my hon friend   the member for wyre forest mark garnier   also make that point incredibly eloquently we can go back to adam smith and see the cosmic thread if you will we be open up new sector for the uk economy and empower our people 
 i be delighted by the idea of space lawyer i promise not to go around wave my llb about but that sound awfully like the superhero name i would end up give myself i be really excited about this i be a member of the science innovation and technology committee so i be very pleased to hear my hon friend   the member for woking mr lord   mention our report a lot of love go into it we enjoy ourselves a bit too much i be not go to deny it 
 i find this entire sector incredibly fascinating and extremely exciting not just because of the aforementioned geekery but because of its potential i think about kid in my constituency who be now be expose to opportunity and new horizon that simply be not on the radar of young people even or year ago apprentice in my patch be talk about work in this area some have go to work for airbus which be do fantastic thing with satellite i recently go to its stevenage factory as part of my industry and parliament trust fellowship which be in space and aerospace thing it purport to be do be transfer energy from space which will genuinely be a game changer i be flabbergast when that be explain to i 
 to monitor climate change satellite will tell we how much heat be transfer out of wood in forest so we know whether rainforest need to be reforest and whether we be face climate change at ° or ° that be mind bendingly brilliant stuff and it be now available to kid who or year ago might have be tell right once you finish school you either go work in the jjb sports factory down the road or in a shop it be exciting fantastically valuable and hugely important for thing like our financial sector greater manchester have a fairly sizable financial sector which be great for we we also have a large legal sector i know because i use to work in it i would love to be a space lawyer let ’s see how the rest of the year go i might need to become 
 ultimately the bill be about empower we the other thing i love about it again i promise not to wave my llb about too much be its simplicity and elegance it be that coltrane sax solo so simple that it be brilliant change a word effectively empower we to do so much more the power of that be inestimable that be why it be part of the report that the science innovation and technology committee put out 
 at the moment we be disincentivise people from innovate and that be not what we should be about we be say instead that people should go out and take risk and we will ensure that they can be reward they will not be completely and utterly obliterate for have a go even if the stage fuel pump do not work it will not be the end of the business we need to be alive to that because we need risk taker as we do in every sector we need people who be willing to boldly go into the final frontier interruption i have not finish yet when i shout house everyone will know that i have do they all fundamentally this be   about ensure that britain ’s future be not just here on earth but in the star and we have every right to be there as much as any other country 
 i thank my hon friend for allow i to intervene especially give that i have just ramble on for who know how long thing i do not mention that he might be interested in be the defence sector again when i visit goonhilly there be a huge amount go on there we talk about our maritime fleet be bother by the russians and the chinese on a daily basis but our satellite and space be as well it be hugely important that we be at the forefront of this do he agree 
 my hon friend be entirely correct like i she have be on the armed force parliamentary scheme i be restrain myself from mention culdrose when she be give her excellent speech but of course i have now do it our defence sector be incredibly important again we be make this stuff here at bae systems and airbus and defence manufacturer in this country create job and opportunity that be hugely important and i be absolutely delighted to support the bill i love its technical merit 
 my hon friend the member for woking have play an absolute blinder in do something quite sensible i will give a live example because quite frankly the empire would not have be able to build the death star if it have be on the hook for the price of the my hon friend have stick the landing   i congratulate he and look forward to support   the bill
