i thank   the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler   for secure today ’s debate 
 i be incredibly proud of many thing in beckenham and penge but particularly st christopher ’s hospice it be found in by dame cicely saunders the founder of the global hospice movement the movement come about because dame cicely a nurse who be research pain control believe that more could be do to help people at the end of their life that include deal with physical symptom and tackle the stigma around painkiller but also the idea that people should be able to achieve emotional closure through individualised care and support 
 the assisted die debate have be mention today by member from across the house i have over constituent contact i about that debate and there be roughly a 50:50 split between those who support and oppose the bill but every single of they be unite by compassion and they relay their experience of see people at the end of their life 
 i pay tribute this evening to a woman i be incredibly fortunate to work for in this place dame tessa jowell tessa be a very good friend a mentor and an amazing boss year ago next week she make her final speech in parliament tessa be diagnose with a terminal brain tumour i be with she from her diagnosis through to write the press release on the night she die she finish her speech in the other place by say 
 in the end what give a life meaning be not only how it be live but how it draw to a close ”—[official report house of lords   january vol c. 
 i sincerely believe that 
 st christopher ’s hospice give meaning to life as it draw to a close it do so by take a holistic approach it care for a patient ’s physical spiritual and psychological wellbeing i have see at hand the intimate bond and relationship establish between staff volunteer patient and family the hospice be of the large provider of palliative care education in the world for all those reason we in beckenham and penge all support st christopher ’s hospice which be a huge part of our community i be fundraise for the hospice long before i become an mp and i continue to do so 
 people help in lot of different way and i want to give a special mention to penge fest which be south east london ’s answer to oktoberfest local business such as brewery the hounds and designer drapes organisation include friend of cator park and penge business improvement district and many more   come together with local resident for a day of fun and fundraising that include an oompah band the event bring penge high street to a standstill last summer we will continue to fundraise for st christopher ’s hospice but we should not have to do so to pay for the basic support our hospice benefit everyone from the nhs to patient and that be why i welcome the government ’s announcement just before christmas of an extra £ in hospice funding through the extension of child ’s hospice grant that will ease the strain on hospice and benefit patient as well as the wide health and care system 
 however hospice still face pressure include increase demand for service the rise cost of provision and discrepancy in funding across the country which many member have mention this evening that be why as the minister recognise hospice must be a key part of the government ’s plan to shift care into the community include through the provision of at home care service that can ease the acute pressure on the nhs i invite the minister to visit st christopher ’s to see its fantastic work for himself and to discuss the role of hospice in the government ’s commitment to ensure that every person have access to high quality end of life care 
 i thank the hon member for wimbledon again for secure today ’s debate and the government for the vital work that they be undertake on this important issue 
 hospice in devon be already struggle before the government ’s budget last autumn which introduce a hike in employer national insurance to talk about the national picture we have hear that a of funding for hospice tend to come from the state through the nhs however in devon it be less than a for hospicare a charity base in exeter the figure be while for seton hospice at home and sidmouth hospice at home the figure be they do not receive any funding at all from nhs devon 
 last year i get together with ben bradshaw and simon jupp the former mps for exeter and for east devon we put aside our political difference simon jupp and i be contest the seat of honiton and sidmouth at the time write to the chair of nhs devon the brilliant sarah wollaston and secure an extra £ for hospice care in devon none the less the charity hospicare still have a deficit of £ per year 
 follow the national insurance announcement last autumn the guardian report in mid november that whitehall be consider option to relieve the financial pressure on hospice it suggest that civil servant be weigh up the possibility of offset the ni rise fund hospice nursing staff directly or set up a direct funding pot for hospice follow the announcement on   december   and the christmas gift of capital funding for hospice it seem that the government choose the direct funding pot for hospice the problem with the additional capital funding be that a lot of hospice do not have physical building they do not have infrastructure they provide nursing service and hospice at home so they can not simply offset   day to day spending with that capital spending they be completely miss out and that be the experience for seaton hospice at home and sidmouth hospice at home service in my east devon constituency 
 in conclusion these charity step in where the nhs do not provide care be central to the government ’s vision of shift treatment from hospital to community yet the current trajectory seem to be force patient back into overstretched acute hospital 
 i welcome this action plan which mention datum centre as the secretary of state may be aware the deputy prime minister be currently review the need for a data centre in kings langley in my constituency 
 both the report and the secretary of state talk about ensure that the infrastructure be in the right place i be work alongside my constituent in kings langley because the propose site be prime green belt if there be a need to build on and develop the site housing would make well sense because energy a huge requirement for datum centre be not available nearby how can the secretary of state ensure that we be not encourage the building of white elephant in the wrong place 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to ensure that the police have adequate resource to help tackle neighbourhood crime 
 what step she be take to improve the effectiveness of community police 
 what discussion she have have with the metropolitan police on the effectiveness of community police 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 before i respond i be sure that the whole house will want to remember pc rosie prior who be tragically kill on saturday while help at the scene of an accident and ryan welford who be also kill pc prior ’s death be a tragic reminder of the dedication and bravery that police officer show every single day to keep we safe all our thought be with her family friend and colleague at this difficult time 
 as the prime minister announce last month in the plan for change we be determined to restore neighbourhood policing and to put additional police police community support officer and special constable back on the beat 
 i refer the house to my registered interest and i echo the sentiment express by the home secretary 
 last year the leicestershire police panel raise serious concern about be underfunde have receive a real term cut of over the past year due to this funding crisis the police simply do not have enough manpower for night time patrol in the clarendon park area there have be a wave of burglary in local business the christopher james deli loros and spice bazzar be of that have be smash and grab over the past month at the local crime summit that i arrange to discuss the situation owner jaskaran dutta say 
 we do everything we can to survive in this incredibly difficult economic time all we ask be that the government support we by improve policing and security 
 what be the secretary of state do to address these concern 
 under the previous conservative government neighbourhood policing be decimate the proportion of people who say that they never see the police on the beat double they take police off the beat and do not put they back which be why we be set out a neighbourhood policing guarantee we have increase funding for police force by £ next year include £ specifically to kickstart recruitment for neighbourhood policing 
 a carshalton resident have her car steal from her driveway there be video footage of it but the police just give she a crime reference number and close   the case local business on wallington high street tell i that organised shoplifter be act with impunity the home secretary touch on recruitment be part of the solution but what else can the government do now to help my constituent feel safe 
 the hon member be right to talk about the deep frustration feel in community include local business and town centre about not just the absence of neighbourhood policing which we need to turn around but the weakening of power over the past year on thing such as shoplifting that be why we be introduce new respect order and strengthen power on shoplifting and assault on shop worker 
 we all know that well resource neighbourhood policing with bobby on the beat work in the community be central not just to solve crime but to prevent it we see some great result in toot just last year with a special operation result in a cut in crime year of tory government have decimate our local police team despite our brilliant london mayor pull out all the stop to bolster the number will the secretary of state pledge that our local community will have properly resource police team under the new labour government 
 my hon friend be right about the importance of have neighbourhood police team work in community with local resident and business know the kind of crime and challenge that that area face that be why we be determined not just to get neighbourhood police back on the beat with funding in place to do so but to ensure that as part of a neighbourhood policing guarantee the officer be not abstract to deal with other thing 
 in the chief constable of devon and cornwall police be suspend for misconduct and last november the interim chief constable be also suspend now the deputy police and crime commissioner have also resign do the home secretary share my concern about the leadership of devon and cornwall police and the impact on neighbourhood police morale as well as the fact that the taxpayer be pay for chief constable of whom have be suspend 
 i be aware of the point that my hon friend raise and i do have concern it be really important that all police force can strengthen their neighbourhood police and have strong leadership right through the police force we will set out a new police reform white paper to ensure that measure be in place to strengthen leadership and standard across police 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 a focus on neighbourhood policing be welcome we have see it in staffordshire for some time police leader have say that if they do not have the flexibility to recruit as they need to there be a risk that police officer will end up have to fill vacancy in specialist area will the home secretary listen to police leader and give they that flexibility 
 the chair of the home affairs committee make an important point we have say that the neighbourhood police team which we be determined to support should include police officer and police community support officer as well as special constable who too often be underuse and underappreciated in order to recognise the mix of discipline that we need for the strong and most effective policing 
 excellent partnership work between gwent police newport city council and our business improvement district see crime down by in our city centre at the end of last year although there be still much to do to improve confidence after neighbourhood policing be slash under the previous government do the home secretary agree that visibility be key and will she update we on police number in wales 
 my hon friend make an important point because this be about visibility partnership and power and she rightly talk about the impact that this kind of work can have we want to strengthen the work of police officer across england and wales by strengthen the power they have to tackle shoplifting and street theft snatch theft which have both increase in recent year 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the previous government leave office with record police number but police and crime commissioner be deeply concerned that the funding formula and settlement combine with the government ’s national insurance tax raid will force cut to frontline police number my labour police and crime commissioner face a £ shortfall and there be projection of officer be lose nationwide will the home secretary take responsibility if police number fall in the come year 
 i should point out to the hon gentleman that his government take neighbourhood police officer off the street mean thousand few on the street the number of pcso halve and the number of special constable drop by third that be the conservative shameful record which people know because they can see it they do not see police on the street as a result of his government ’s action he raise the issue of funding this government have have to add an additional £ to police force this year because the settlement that his party leave they with be not enough to cover this year ’s pay rise they let police down 
 the home secretary proudly quote the funding settlement while fail to mention that £ of it will be snatch straight back as a result of her government ’s national insurance tax raid on our police force what can be invest in frontline policing be largely determine by how she manage the home office budget do she agree that it be wrong to spend £ on a swanky dinner for civil servant and how will she ensure that never happen again 
 i be afraid i have to say to the hon gentleman that his party not only let policing and community down by take neighbourhood police off the street but let police down on the funding   this government be provide an increase in police funding of up to £ next year on top of the additional funding we have to provide for police this financial year because his party leave a huge black hole in not just home office or police officer funding but overall funding for public service across the board a shameful legacy that we have have to turn around 
 what discussion her department have have with the fire brigades union on improve protection for firefighter against occupational disease 
 we engage regularly with the fire brigades union and we take very seriously the health and safety of firefighter who risk their life for our community every day the home office be review recent academic research to evaluate risk pose by contaminant and the effectiveness of decontamination procedure we will share our finding with the fire and rescue authority which hold the legal responsibility to protect firefighter against those risk 
 i thank the minister for her answer exposure to toxic substance be an avoidable risk and every firefighter should have access to the resource they need to protect themselves the dangerous nature of be a firefighter have also be amplify as the scottish fire and rescue service have have more than frontline firefighter job cut since a reduction of nearly do the home secretary agree that the fire service need proper investment and a national body with legal standing to set standard on fire cover training equality and health and safety 
 my right hon friend the minister for policing fire and crime prevention be look at all fire and rescue issue and consider all possibility include potential reorganisation as we move the service forward 
 will the minister look at early diagnosis for firefighter because very sadly many suffer very bad ill health in retirement if they be diagnose early treatment can be provide to improve the quality and the length of their life 
 i agree that this be an important area and that much more work need to be do to consider effective contaminant and risk from the danger that firefighter put themselves in every day to protect life 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of crime on rural community 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help tackle rural crime 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of crime on rural community 
 we all understand the devastating harm that crime can cause in rural community the government be commit to take action which be why we will be enact the equipment theft prevention act to tackle the theft of agricultural machinery and equipment we will strengthen enforcement on fly tipping and antisocial behaviour and we will deliver more rural patrol through our neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 i thank the minister for her answer she will know that the funding allocation for policing be base on report crime not underlie crime rate in rural area such as north shropshire people say that they do not always report a crime when it happen resident in oswestry and whitchurch tell i that they do not bother to phone the police because they do not think anyone will come will she consider reassess the formula to ensure that in rural area the funding reflect the level of underlie crime 
 i reassure the hon lady that fund for the year for her police force will be £ an increase of £ on the figure from this year i encourage all people who be victim of crime to report it we need that information so that the police can then make the require resource available 
 in my constituency fly tipping on farm and private land and the targeted theft of heating oil be cause profound problem for family and business alike will the minister update i on progress to tackle rural crime and will the home office consider set up a rural taskforce work across department to tackle these issue 
 i absolutely share my hon friend ’s concern about the extent of rural crime particularly fly tipping recent research show that of farmer say they be affect by fly tipping i be particularly concerned about the target theft of heating oil from family and business at this time of year as i say we will be strengthen neighbourhood police and we will see more patrol in rural area which will help we will also have forthcoming legislation to provide the department for environment food and rural affairs with the power it need to support local authority in exercise new fly tip enforcement power 
 will the minister meet i to discuss the effect that rural crime particularly hare course and as we have hear today theft from farm and shed have on resident in ely and east cambridgeshire 
 i be always very happy to meet hon member the national wildlife crime unit have be do some very good work include oversee the national police response to hare coursing and operation galileo which have result in a reduction in offence in that area but i be very happy to meet the hon lady 
 right across the town and village i represent people have see as the rural police presence have decline predictable increase in shoplifting antisocial behaviour farm break in and fly tipping we can not allow that to be tolerate what step will the minister take to ensure that my local police have the resource and power they need to take those crime seriously 
 the neighbourhood policing guarantee apply not just to town and city of course but to rural community so we will see a far great police presence out and about in those community the home office be currently work with the national police chiefs council on a rural and wildlife crime strategy to crack down on some of the crime and disorder that have worsen in recent year 
 what step she be take to support the police to tackle burglary 
 burglary be a particularly invasive crime that have a profound impact on the security of individual as i know from personal experience as well as on the wide community for too long a culture have be allow to develop whereby victim of burglary and other crime fear that even if they report what have happen no will come and nothing will be do that be the culture we be determined to tackle through our safe street mission and our commitment to neighbourhood policing 
 in my local authority area of burglary go unsolved with police fail to identify suspect that be the bad figure for any community in the country and in surrey as a whole of burglary be not even attend by police this have contribute to a decline in confidence in local policing among my constituent how specifically will the government ’s new police performance unit and their neighbourhood policing guarantee ensure that my constituent can feel safe in their home and will the minister join my party in commit to a statutory burglary response guarantee to ensure that all domestic burglary be attend by a police officer 
 the police have make a commitment in england and wales to attend the scene of every home burglary so i be concern by what the hon lady have say about her local force the college of policing have set out good practice for the investigation of burglary which should be follow by police force and which set standard for what should be expect as well as explain how good to deal with victim i be mindful of what she have say today and will write to she with detail of what more can be do 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 this government will treat violence against woman and girl as the national emergency that it be and later this year our new comprehensive violence against woman and girl strategy will spell out how we plan to fulfil our unprecedented commitment to halve that violence in the interim we have announce raneem ’s law whereby domestic abuse specialist will be embed in control room and we be work with police to develop a national framework to track and target high harm offender we be pilot new domestic abuse protection order in select area and we have outline new measure to protect woman against stalk and spike 
 the entire country be appal by the terrible crime of girl be groom by gang of old man and outrage by the lack of action take by authority to help protect those victim it be about year since these crime come to light since then we have have the jay inquiry which have make recommendation will the government commit to implement all those recommendation in full and at pace to help protect future victim 
 i thank the hon gentleman for both the tone and the sentiment of his question and i hope that everyone in the house agree with he i spend the weekend in my surgery deal with case that be live today involve the grooming of both boy and girl by organise group of vary sort it be in fact year since the original jay report on the event in rotherham as for the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse we will work at pace with the stakeholder include the victim and professor alexis jay to ensure that what be intend in those recommendation can happen i will do that as quickly as it can possibly be do but i will not do what be do by the last government and just say yeah sure and then leave it to chance 
 north yorkshire be the large rural county in the country behind the beauty of the village and hamlet in my constituency of scarborough and whitby lie an ugly truth on average victim in rural area be subject to domestic abuse for long than those in urban area and be half as likely to report it can the minister reassure the house that more funding to tackle rural domestic violence be part of the government ’s strategy to halve violence against woman and girl 
 the strategy to halve violence against woman and girl be for every single part of our country the government recognise that victim in rural and remote area face particular barrier in flee abuse and accessing support we be already drive forward a range of activity that will support rural victim the victims and prisoners act will require local commissioner to develop joint need assessment for   victim of domestic abuse to identify gap in support i encourage all member to engage with that process when it come to their local area and i will happily work with rural mp in this house to make sure that that be the case 
 palestinian woman detain in israeli prison face sexual assault beating and threat of rape and death accord to united nations report give our commitment to tackle violence against woman and girl what discussion be the minister have with foreign commonwealth and development office colleague about the implication of the gender base violence face by palestinians particularly as israel continue to deny access to detention site 
 i thank my hon friend for his question my fcdo colleague sit on the violence against woman and girl sub group for the mission and i have every faith that they take the issue that he talk about incredibly seriously we have to protect woman the world over 
 a consistent finding of the serious case review into child sexual exploitation be that the authority have turn a blind eye in case where they believe that a child often as young as be in a consensual sexual relationship with an old man of course regardless of whether the girl believe that she have give consent or not the adult be commit a criminal offence do the minister agree that way we might stop the next child rape gang be by insist that in all case adult who have sex with child be investigate and prosecute 
 absolutely from my year of work on the frontline i know that the boyfriend model of consent to get young people into these group be undoubtedly of the most common in that field i absolutely agree that in any case where any adult have sex with any child they should be investigate charge and convict a fundamental part of our violence against woman and girl strategy be about prevention and work with young people who be a grow cohort of both abuser and victim in this space to ensure that we be act to prevent and not just to protect 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 when it come to keep child especially girl safe from violence and abuse there have be a lot of talk about inquiry over the last week indeed some comment have be more constructive than other inquiry can be a powerful tool for uncover the truth about injustice but they only reach their full potential when there be a duty of candour that require public official and authority to co operate fully the government have commit to bring that duty into force so can the minister and her colleague commit to a timeline for introduce the hillsborough law to parliament 
 the number of national public inquire that we have have for example into hillsborough for which nobody have be hold accountable show the importance of the hillsborough law and the duty of candour obviously we commit to it in our manifesto and it will absolutely be introduce by this government we will keep in touch about the timeline for that 
 when she plan to bring the equipment theft prevention act into force 
 i commend the hon gentleman ’s work in bring forward this legislation and reiterate the government ’s commitment to safeguard rural community we will implement the equipment theft prevention act and we fully support its intention to tackle the theft and resale of high value equipment particularly for use in an agricultural setting 
 i be grateful to the minister for his kind word and to the government for their support for what be my private member ’s bill and be now the act the commencement date for the act be in january last year but it require a statutory instrument to be move to bring it into full force when will that statutory instrument be move can he assure i that there be no delay because of the equipment manufacturer who of course benefit massively from crime because they get to sell another 
 let i reassure the hon gentleman as he know the act require secondary legislation to take effect we be currently consider the view of those who may be affect by the legislation but we intend that the regulation will be in place by the summer 
 what step she be take to help tackle crime in newcastle under lyme constituency 
 we be strengthen how we tackle crime throughout the country include in newcastle under lyme our safe street mission aim to halve knife crime and violence against woman and girl and to restore confidence in the criminal justice system the young futures programme will divert young people from a life of crime and the neighbourhood policing guarantee will deliver an additional neighbourhood policing role 
 can i say how excellent it be to see the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips in her place on the front bench i have hear concern from many constituent in recent day about the grooming of young people particularly young woman and those be concern that all of we in this house clearly share give that only of violent or sexual crime in the west midland be solve in the year end june what step be be take to hold the thug to account and to protect young people particularly young woman and girl in newcastle under lyme so that they can live their life safely 
 i echo my hon friend ’s comment about my hon friend the safeguarding minister on the point he raise there be an interesting article in the paper today where the minister be quote as say 
 it be completely unacceptable that few and few violent and sexual crime be be solve with more victim be let down time and time again 
 i can not think of a well champion to take forward the work to protect young woman in particular than the safeguarding minister 
 there will be wizardry in the way this question from sir julian be deliver 
 thank you mr speaker do the minister accept that it would greatly assist the police to investigate crime in newcastle under lyme and indeed elsewhere if they be not spend an estimate hour investigate and record so call non crime hate incident 
 the prime minister the home secretary and i as the policing minister have say that we want a common sense approach to deal with these matter the government have be very clear on this we have set out our priority as the incoming government halve knife crime halve violence against woman and girl restore confidence in the justice system and of the big issue for i tackle antisocial behaviour through our neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 what step her department be take to help tackle knife crime 
 what step her department be take to help tackle knife crime 
 we remember those who have lose their life to knife crime include year old thomas taylor kill in bedford and year old kelyan bokassa kill in woolwich just last week kelyan ’s mother say 
 i try to prevent it i ’ve try so many so many time 
 no mother should live with that grief or feel that level of fear for her teenage son that be why this government have set up the coalition to tackle knife crime which involve family alongside take new action on serious violence 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer and of course my sympathy also go out to that mother this weekend recently publish datum show a sharp rise in serious violent crime in scotland particularly in our city and town too many of my constituent feel unsafe in east kilbride town centre and the village particularly at night meanwhile the snp government ’s chronic underfunding of police scotland have result in officer number be at their low level since do the secretary of state agree that the snp now have the funding in place to increase police number and that protect our community and citizen should be its priority 
 my hon friend be right to say that the scottish government have a significant increase in funding so they can take action to improve public service this government have make it a mission to halve knife crime over the next decade include take action to get dangerous weapon such as zombie knife and ninja sword off our street by prevent the unlawful sale of these lethal blade particularly to child 
 my constituent in whitley have their christmas disrupt by an alarming threat of knife crime we have see too many tragedy of this kind in read over the last few year so i wholeheartedly welcome the government ’s mission to halve knife crime i have apply for my earley and woodley constituency to be a trial location for the new respect order will the home secretary meet i and my constituent to discuss how we can tackle the root problem that cause people particularly young people to carry knife 
 the policing minister and i will happily talk far to my hon friend she be right that we need to prevent young people from obtain and carry knife in the place as well as make sure there be swift intervention we be also take action work with police force across the country to tackle knife enable robbery which be of the area that have see the big increase in recent year 
 i thank the home secretary for her response over the past year there have be conviction for knife relate crime in northern ireland there be an epidemic in northern ireland with almost conviction in the last year alone what discussion have the home secretary have with the relevant authority include the police service of northern ireland to help we address this issue 
 the hon member will know that the psni take this issue extremely seriously the issue of knife crime be devastating to family and he be right to be deeply concerned about the increase we have see frankly it be still far too easy for young people to get hold of knife that be why we ask commander stephen clayman to conduct a detailed review of the online sale and delivery of knife and we expect his report back shortly 
 a nurse be stab in an emergency department in oldham over the weekend will the home secretary join i in condemn any attack on our health and social care worker and especially the at the weekend 
 the hon member make an extremely important point our public servant particularly our nursing and medical staff work to save life support people and help patient they do so trust that the people who come to see they be ask for their help he be right to talk about the devastating attack at the oldham hospital and we be all think about the nurse and all those work in the hospital as well as about the police investigation that i know be under way 
 what step her department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood police to tackle antisocial behaviour 
 the government be commit to tackle antisocial behaviour and the harm and misery that we all know it cause in community this be part of our safe street mission that will introduce respect order and put additional police officer pcso and special constable into neighbourhood policing role so that each community have a visible presence and an accountable police team 
 last year on average at least instance of antisocial behaviour per day be report to kent police in the city centre of canterbury alone we have great beat officer who i know keep our city as safe as they can but give that the economy of our historic unesco city rely so heavily on tourism how will the government work with kent police to far tackle this issue so that resident business and visitor feel safe 
 the hon lady make an important point about how antisocial behaviour have to be tackle particularly in area where we have lot of tourist the neighbourhood policing guarantee be important because it will deliver an additional police officer pcso and special in our town and city centre and in rural area by the end of this parliament in the provisional policing settlement announce just before christmas there be £ to start the recruitment of the police officer 
 how will the minister ensure that the safe street mission be deliver in community like mine in southwark where too often officer be extract to police protest and the met be divide between its neighbourhood and national policing role 
 my hon friend make an important point about the conflict and compete interest in the metropolitan police we have commit to put police back on the beat through the neighbourhood policing guarantee a neighbourhood police team will be in every area it will be out police with intelligence lead visible patrol and will ensure officer be protect from be deploy elsewhere that be part of the guarantee 
 what progress her department have make on close asylum hotel 
 the government be commit to reduce hotel use through reform of the asylum system include through streamline asylum processing and establish the border security command to tackle people smuggle gang at source since the general election there have be a net increase of hotel in use but be schedule for closure by the end of march 
 the government ’s new policy of smash the gang have enable they to close asylum hotel but unfortunately they have have to open another will the minister tell we when the number of asylum seeker in hotel accommodation will be low than when she take office 
 because of the size of the backlog we inherit from the conservative party and an asylum system in chaos with ten of thousand of people in limbo and very little processing happen the problem can not be solve overnight however we be work very hard to close hotel i just give the hon gentleman the figure more hotel be schedule to close by the end of march and there have be a net increase of so by the end march there will be few 
 the previous government waste a scandalous amount of public money on asylum accommodation for example in northeye they pay double what the previous owner have pay without check that the building do not have asbestos and contaminate ground and it could not be use will the minister commit to be more effective in provide value for public money to ensure that taxpayer money be not waste as we fix the asylum backlog 
 i certainly will we should also remember the £ the conservative party waste on raf scampton and the £ on a derelict asbestos ride former prison in bexhill we will not take any lesson from conservative members about value for money in government expenditure 
 in the royal town of sutton coldfield we understand that we must do our bit to help house asylum seeker but the ramada hotel on penns lane have always be the wrong place because it be too far away from inner city birmingham base service under the last government the facility be slat for closure so will the minister look urgently at wind it down and close it as soon as possible 
 it be our intention to close all asylum hotel as soon as possible once we deal with the backlog that we inherit from the conservative party 
 asylum accommodation hotel be once emergency measure but have now last several year because of the mess the tories make of our asylum system scrap the rwanda scheme and recommence the processing of claim have lead to a substantially low backlog than we would have have if we have continue with the tory policy but there be still much more to do will the minister update the house on progress towards end asylum hotel accommodation and cut waiting time for asylum application decision 
 we inherit a system where very few decision be be make we have ramp up decision make to over decision a month and we be deal with the backlog but backlog can not be abolish overnight and there be also appeal backlog we inherit a huge mess but we be methodically get through it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 housing asylum seeker in hotel of which there be more case in just the month of this government be spectacularly expensive the home secretary ’s policy be   to make asylum decision quickly so that any cost of the migrant she accept can be hide in the welfare system the home office admit in its impact assessment that it have no idea how much her policy will cost in benefit claim and council housing bill will the minister commit today to record and publish all those cost for migrant whose asylum claim she accept 
 i will take no lesson from the conservative party which spend £ to send volunteer to rwanda and leave huge backlog of more than stop asylum claim people in hotel unable to leave because the conservatives be try to get their fantasy rwanda programme off the ground 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 my constituent majida and her child be asylum seeker from syria live in of the asylum hotel in my hazel grove constituency they have be live in limbo for month as they wait for a decision on their asylum claim like all syrian asylum seeker their application have be temporarily pause follow the fall of assad many in my community be keen to support those seek asylum but also very keen to see an end to the use of hotel the cost of housing family in that way be too high both to the mental wellbeing of those live there and to the taxpayer what circumstance be the minister wait for to resume decision making on asylum application from syrians and when do she expect that to happen 
 the fall of the assad regime be a welcome development give that he be a tyrant but syrian asylum seeker be currently in our system many of whom flee the assad regime until syria ’s future become a little more settle it be difficult to decide those claim which be why both this country and most of europe have have a temporary pause while the situation in syria settle and develop i can not tell the hon lady exactly when decision making will resume all i can say be that we be keep the matter under close observation as soon as there be any development in this area we will ensure that the house know about it 
 what step her department be take to support victim of the windrush scandal 
 this labour government be determined to put right the appalling injustice suffer by member of the windrush community we will ensure that those affect receive the compensation they deserve and that cultural change be embed permanently in the home office at the end of november over £ have be pay to individual across almost claim under the windrush compensation scheme we have also re establish the windrush unit to drive forward the action need to ensure that what happen to the windrush generation never happen again 
 member of the windrush generation who struggle to submit compensation claim do not have access to legal aid leave they unable to navigate the complex process i have recently be contact by a constituent who be struggle to navigate the claim process and have no other support available to he what step be the minister take to tackle those barrier and will she commit to provide additional support to ensure that every eligible individual can access the scheme regardless of their capacity or circumstance 
 my hon friend make an important point we be committed to make change so that the scheme be accessible and so victim of the windrush scandal be far well support in apply for compensation it be why in july we bring in a single name caseworker approach to streamline the process improve consistency and remove duplication and it be why we announce £ of grant funding for organisation to provide extra support for applicant if she would like to meet to discuss her constituent ’s case far i would be happy to do so 
 the windrush scandal involve people come to this country in good faith who be then falsely label as illegal immigrant thing that the minister could do to avoid such circumstance happen again be make it easy for people to come here through a reduction in the english language requirement be that something that she would consider 
 our priority be to understand and learn from the event in the past and focus on the future by ensure that the department be inclusive and consider the impact of all its work on people from every background 
 what estimate her department have make of the potential impact of level of net migration on future trend in the number of people who will be grant indefinite leave to remain 
 the government be commit to bring down net migration after it hit record high under the last government we will do that by take a different approach link skill and migration policy so that immigration be not use as an alternative to tackle workforce problem in the uk the home office publish migrant journey analysis which show the proportion of migrant grant indefinite leave to remain over time help to inform on who might seek to remain in the uk in the long term 
 the mass import of low skilled worker could cost the taxpayer more than £ a financial tick time bomb will the minister commit here and now to extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain or bring in new qualifying criterion 
 the hon gentleman would do well to hold his own side to account for their record on net migration the government recognise and value the contribution that legal migration make to our country   there be always a place for overseas recruitment for firm look to grow but it must not be the port of call and we must ensure that our migration system be control manage and fair 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 since the government come to office illegal migrant have cross the english channel an increase of compare with the same time last year do the government now accept the national crime agency ’s advice that a deterrent like the rwanda scheme which they cancel before it even start be need last week the government be trumpet their removal figure will they honestly accept that only a tiny fraction of removal relate to people who arrive by small boat in fact in their month the removal amount to only of people who enter the uk by small boat will the minister accept that allow of small boat arrival to stay be no deterrent at all 
 the shadow home secretary appear to have forget what happen when he be in government in fact he will know that for the month of last year the number of those arrive on small boat be the high for any month on record he will know that the previous government spend over £ on a fail rwanda scheme that see volunteer go to rwanda i will not take any lesson from the shadow home secretary the conservatives should take responsibility for their record and apologise for it 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 immigration asylum rule need to be respect and enforce and for too long that have not happen since the general election we have ramp up removal for those who have no right to be in the united kingdom with individual successfully return in the month of this government the high level of return over a month period since wide work to strengthen border security be under way include the new sanction regime announce by the foreign secretary to target smuggling gang and new co operation agreement include with france germany italy iraq and beyond because vile criminal smuggler gang operate across border law enforcement need to co operate across border too to bring they down 
 knife crime continue to have a devastating impact on all too many life in sheffield i recently chair a roundtable in my constituency which bring together local leader police school and voluntary organisation that be all on the frontline do the secretary of state agree that it be vital to work together with key stakeholder so that we can build a collaborative approach to end knife crime once and for all 
 i agree with my hon friend that be why we have set up the coalition to tackle knife crime it be also why we have a knife enable robbery taskforce work with chief constable at local level we have discuss set out prevention partnership part of the young futures programme so that all organisation can come together and be part of a mission to halve knife crime over the next year 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i know that the thought of the whole house will be with the victim of the grooming and rape gang will the home secretary agree with the labour mayor of greater manchester andy burnham and   the hon member for liverpool walton dan carden a labour mp that we need a proper national public inquiry 
 the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse report touch only on groom gang and cover only of the town affect local inquiry such as the manchester that the home secretary and the prime minister refer to do not have the legal power to compel the production of evidence which be why the manchester chair resign oldham victim jane who be groom and gang rap at the age of have call for a full national inquiry 
 order mr philp this be topical you could have get this in early with a lengthy question the part of your question be absolutely accurate but you can not just roll on at topical or nobody else will get in 
 these be horrendous crime involve rape sadistic violence and cruelty exploitation intimidation and coercion so we need action truth and accountability for those terrible crime that be why we support further investigation inquiry and action into child sexual exploitation and grooming gang include new action to get police report evidence on the scale of grooming gang include on ethnicity which have still not be do the most important thing be to get more police investigation to get these criminal behind bar 
 do the home secretary agree that it be untenable for the government ’s own anti corruption minister to be under investigation for benefit from the proceed of corruption should she stand down while the investigation continue 
 the right hon member will know that the minister have refer herself to the ministerial standard adviser and that be the appropriate way for this to be address more broadly we take seriously the full range of crime that our country face and will continue to work closely with the police always to take action against crime 
 with a rise in disinformation and intimidation at home and interference from abroad it have never be more important to stand up for our british democracy will the minister therefore give we an update on the defend democracy taskforce 
 it be a top priority to protect our country and our elect representative from interference intimidation and harassment the defend democracy taskforce bring together a cross government response to these threat we will use all the tool at our disposal to protect our democratic security and resilience 
 last week the scottish parliament pass a motion call for action on immigration to address the need of scotland ’s employer community and public service with a particular reference to rural visa pilot as the secretary of state know every sector in scotland be cry out for scottish solution to distinct scottish issue and problem what be her response to that democratically pass motion other than not be interested 
 i will shortly be visit scotland to discuss these issue the hon member will know that we will not be introduce a scottish visa scheme or devolving control of immigration policy he will also know that the migration advisory committee have find that labour market need be similar across the uk it continue to engage at length with many uk stakeholder include from scotland 
 the brilliant adur ukraine support association have raise concern with i that the month limit on the extension of ukrainians permission to remain in the uk be cause issue in secure tenancy job and undergraduate university course which last for a minimum of year will the minister meet i to discuss that issue face ukrainians in my constituency 
 the uk ’s support for ukraine remain steadfast the scheme will provide an additional month temporary permission to ukrainians here under of the exist ukraine scheme when a person ’s ukraine scheme leave expire during their course and they be grant further leave to remain for example on a student visa they will continue to be able to complete their study i will be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 dorset police operate across more than square mile yet under the current funding settlement it receive far less money than urban area with similar crime rate operate over small geography will the government commit to review the funding settlement to ensure that rural area such as west dorset get a fairer settlement 
 of course the hon gentleman ’s force area be get more money in the settlement that be announce just before christmas clearly we keep all formula under consideration and as the hon gentleman know we be go to go through a police reform package and programme finance will be part of that 
 under the last government my constituent have completely lose faith that foreign national offender with no right to remain in this country would   be swiftly remove i be glad that since the last election our new labour government have enforce the return of over foreign criminal include serious and violent offender a increase since last year can the minister reassure my constituent that this government will not be take their foot off the gas and will continue take strong action 
 yes foreign national who commit offence and be sentence to month in prison have no right to be here and i can assure my hon friend that we will work tirelessly to ensure that they can be remove the increase in month be a good start but we will not take our foot off the gas 
 in my oxfordshire constituency resident be concern about increase antisocial behaviour particularly pickpockete and shoplift in our town give that the last conservative government cut the number of police community support officer in the thames valley area by more than half since what step will the minister be take to ensure that the police be able to improve community police in oxfordshire town such as wallingford wantage and didcot 
 we want to see an increase in neighbourhood police right across the country that be why we set out £ as part of the police settlement for next year to kick start and increase recruitment of neighbourhood police officer and pcso alongside strong power to tackle neighbourhood crime 
 i welcome the government ’s plan to tackle youth violence but also to prioritise early intervention in battersea brilliant organisation such as carney ’s community be deliver target service to young people from mentoring and life skill to boxing and fitness do the minister agree that organisation such as carney ’s need our support will she agree to visit it so that she can hear at hand about its approach to tackle youth violence 
 i would be delighted to visit 
 do the secretary of state believe it be fair that undocumented illegal migrant get priority access to the nhs over british taxpayer 
 they do not 
 since october my constituent have be separate from her husband and the father of her child who be a palestinian citizen of the state of israel i have deep concern about the home office ’s handling of this case and it have not reply to my last representation will the minister agree to look into this case 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that case and i be very happy to meet he to discuss the issue he have raise 
 penselwood in glastonbury and somerton be regularly blight by unlicensed music event leave resident feel frightened and vulnerable as organiser pay scant regard to they or to the police how will the minister support the police to give the public confidence that they will crack down on these illegal raf 
 if the hon lady write to i with detail i will certainly look into that issue 
 recently the owner of social medium site x have use his sizeable platform to undermine the democratic result of last july ’s general election have stir up hatred towards my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips put her safety at risk and have seek mechanism to depose the prime minister can the minister say what action the defending democracy taskforce be take to prevent this kind of foreign interference in british politic 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question the government consider this work to be urgent we have see some utterly unacceptable activity both during and beyond the general election i hope that work to address this issue will be a share endeavour right across the house but the government be work at pace to address it 
 what action will the home secretary be take follow the news that uk company and organisation have be deem terror group by the united arab emirates 
 the uae be an important international partner for the uk but of course other country have their own rule on designation and it would not be appropriate for the government to comment on their process i can say to the hon member that extremism have no place in our society and that we work very closely with law enforcement local community and our international partner to tackle group and any individual who seek to sow division and hatred 
 my deep condolence go to the family and friend of year old thomas taylor who be fatally stab in bedford last week bedfordshire have some of the high knife crime rate in the country while i welcome the increase funding for the force and the progress make on tackle knife crime in the region will the secretary of state ensure that the special grant award to bedfordshire police in recognition of the high level of serious and violent crime in the region be maintain will she outline what further step be be take to deter young people from carry lethal weapon 
 i think the thought of all of we will be with the family and friend of thomas taylor who be a constituent of my hon friend he be right to say that we need comprehensive work to prevent knife crime and to prevent young people from carry knife in the place but also to make sure that there be swift action where crime take place 
 the national crime agency estimate that £ of illicit fund flow through the uk yearly despite the existence of the david cameron create unexplained wealth order only order in total have ever be issue relate to or case what be my right hon friend do to stop these order from become pointless as they be under the tories because we can not afford to use they 
 among many other thing the government have appoint baroness hodge as the government ’s anti corruption champion we will be work very closely with she and other ministerial colleague to address the issue that my hon friend have raise 
 can the home secretary confirm that none of her ministers or official engage with or be in touch with the muslim council of britain and that there be no correspondence between no the home office and other departments about restore tie with the organisation 
 yes we can confirm that that be the case 
 several of my constituent in south oxhey have unfortunately be the victim of burglary or attempt burglary will the home secretary outline the measure her department be take to allow the police to invest in technology such as live facial recognition which can make crime such as burglary easy to solve 
 we be currently look into whether there be a need for more regulation of live facial recognition but i recognise that it be a very important tool to which the police should have access i be have a series of stakeholder meeting with various group to discuss how we take this forward but i do recognise how important the technology be and how it can be a really positive way of identify people and solve crime 
 can i place on the record my thank to the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who i know will ensure that this government do more to tackle violence against woman and girl than any other government in do so will the government amend the strategy to consider prostitution and other form of commercial sexual exploitation as violence against woman and girl 
 i thank my hon friend for her kind comment about i the violence against woman and girl strategy that the government will launch later this year will absolutely root adult sexual exploitation which so often actually stem from childhood sexual exploitation into the government ’s violence against woman and girl strategy for the time ever 
 be the home secretary aware of the grow link as highlight by a recent durham university report between rural crime   and serious organise crime if not could she ask her official to bring it to her attention give the transnational element to this serious organise crime could the national crime agency start to take a close look at rural crime 
 i be aware of this and i think there be a very serious issue about how serious and organised crime have increasingly be target rural area and   thing such as the gps equipment use by farmer the point about those involve in serious and organised crime be that they will always target area where they think they can get away with it that be why the issue be partly about the work of the national crime agency but also about the work of police force across the country and the work we need to do to take forward a rural crime strategy with the national police chiefs council 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on gas storage level 
 energy security be a key priority for this government and at no time be there any concern about britain ’s energy system be able to meet demand our system work entirely as intend we have capacity to deal with market constraint and that have be back up by the authoritative voice on this issue in the country national gas which run the gas network and the national energy system operator 
 we have sufficient gas supply and electricity capacity to meet demand this winter due to our diverse and resilient system while storage be an important flexibility tool in the gas system our varied source of gas supply mean that the uk be less reliant on storage than some other european country that have a more limited supply option our diverse option include the uk continental shelf our long term energy partner norway international market via the large liquefy natural gas onshoring capacity in europe and interconnector 
 gas storage be use throughout the year but typically operate in winter to help meet peak in demand through cold spell storage level be expect to fluctuate across the winter period that be what happen last week follow the severe cold weather and it be a sign that the gas and storage market be work exactly as they should that be precisely why we have those system in place in their winter outlook national gas and the national energy system operator assess that there be sufficient supply to meet winter demand include the role of storage on friday national gas the owner and operator of britain ’s gas network confirm that 
 the overall picture across great britain ’s gas storage site remain healthy 
 we will continue to work closely with national gas neso and storage operator to maintain continued security of supply i reiterate britain ’s energy system be work to continue to meet the demand of consumer across the country 
 all our constituent will be aware of the freeze temperature experience across the united kingdom last week dip to minus ° in the north of scotland however many will not be aware of just how close this country come to an energy shortage blackout or demand control close than at any point in the past year on friday centrica the owner of british gas issue a stark warning that freeze weather and a spike in demand have reduce our gas storage to concerningly low levels—26 low than this time last year at a time when temperature drop below freezing for an extended period of time our store be set to last for less than a week 
 early in the week the national energy system operator issue a call for electricity provider to step in to provide extra electricity to meet demand and limit the risk of   blackout pay time the average daily amount to keep the light on all of which will end up on the energy bill of our constituent with an incredibly tight margin between demand and available power generation we be once again force to rely on reliable gas power plant to keep the light on in this country show that gas be and will be a vital component of our energy security for decade to come 
 with their rush to meet the secretary of state ’s ideological target to decarbonise the entire electricity grid by this government be play fast and loose with our ability to keep the light on they be rush headlong into a renewable energy dominate system a chinese renewable energy dominate system but minister can not escape the fact that when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine wind turbine and solar panel will not keep the light on in britain we should be in no doubt that this government ’s ideological plan for our energy supply will leave the uk dependent on foreign import send bill soar and leave we teeter on the brink of blackout 
 interestingly when labour be last in government in the secretary of state whip his then minister to vote against conservative proposal to increase gas storage capacity in the united kingdom with a labour mp on the energy bill committee say that 
 the climate of this country other than in the past month be usually such that we do not quite need the same storage facility as other country in mainland europe?”––[official report energy public bill committee   january c. 
 do the minister think the secretary of state regret not back that proposal in do he accept that the push towards renewable will lead to high level of intermittency and do he accept that we will need to urgently review our gas storage capacity in the immediate future 
 the shadow minister ’s point would be well make be it not for the fact that it be completely untrue if we look at the fact the capacity market notice that he mention be cancel 
 order the minister have make a direct hint that what the member say be untrue be he sure of that or do he want to rephrase it 
 i apologise mr speaker i think the shadow minister be confuse in the fact that he give to parliament today i be happy to set that right 
 let we look at the fact the national energy system operator the people who run the system state clearly 
 at no point be electricity supply less than anticipated demand and our engineer be able to rebalance the system without the need to consider any emergency measure 
 if we listen to the expert to national gas and to neso they both confirm over the weekend that there be resilience in the system i reiterate the point that the system operate exactly as it be intend to do 
 if the shadow minister have complaint about how the system operate in the country and the gas storage situation he may want to look at some of his colleague who be in power over the past year he know the truth about his party ’s record he be a very smart guy and he know they leave we expose he know they do not do enough to build the system that we need and he   know what cause the bad cost of live crisis in live memory while his party be busy crowdsource policy advice on twitter from net sceptic it would be far well if they look at their own record in government and instead of criticise we recognise that we be get on with build a resilient energy system for the future 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the shadow minister miss from his story the role of liz truss when she be the chief secretary to the treasury in she make the decision to close our gas storage facility do the minister agree that if we want energy security and low price that all depend on reduce our reliance on the volatile nature of the international fossil fuel market do that not mean that his clean power action plan for be exactly the right policy to address the event of the past few day 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the decision that the previous government take on storage be for they to answer and anyone who look at their record will rightly raise question about that on the broad point he be right the only plan for how we can get off the volatile fossil fuel market to which the previous government leave we far too expose be the clean power action plan that we have announce if the tories oppose that they need to come up with their alternative to deliver the resilience in the system that we be fight for every single day 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   be right to raise this important question about energy security gas supply be run low because of the unexpected cold snap over the past week while those who can afford it have continue to use gas the energy crisis have leave energy price skyrocket and energy bill spiral with many have to make the decision between put food on the table or stay warm that be the case for too many family in my constituency of south cambridgeshire 
 the shadow minister accuse the government of play fast and loose but it be due to the decision of the last conservative government that we find ourselves in this mess with their reckless dither and delay over insulation and decarbonise our home and the irresponsible decision around our gas storage capacity this be about overreliance on gas for too long 
 order you be over time so i be sure you be come to the end 
 i be what step be the government take to reduce overreliance on gas by bring in an emergency home upgrade scheme that will enable people to insulate and to keep their home warm with heat pump this winter rather than wait until spring 
 i think the minister have get the point 
 the hon lady be right this be an incredibly important issue that get to the heart of the fact we inherit from the previous government not   just an economic mess but a series of policy decision not make and an energy system that need we to take serious decision quickly to build resilience for the future 
 on the broad point about consumer she will know that my hon friend the minister for consumer be do a lot of work on exactly what the warm home scheme will look like to ensure that people have as warm a home as possible she be right that at time such as this the people in the poor household struggle the most we be do what we can to ensure that home be insulate and in the long term to bring down bill the only way to do that be to deliver clean power by fast than the previous government would ever have manage 
 the shadow minister come to the house with no shame as have be refer to by my hon friend   the member for sefton central bill esterson the shadow minister ’s party close rough in leave we expose i commend the minister on take urgent step through our clean power mission to secure our energy system and i urge he to ignore the political distraction of the conservative party 
 my hon friend be right that this government be move as fast as possible to build a more resilient system to get the country off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel market the conservatives seem to oppose that but they have be on something of a journey in all these question they use to champion net and recognise that climate change be a clear and present danger to the world but now they be drift far away from that look for more extremist view on twitter and elsewhere to crowdsource their policy we be get on with build the energy system to bring down bill deliver energy security and yes to deliver climate leadership 
 the national electricity system operator issue a warning of a mw shortfall at the evening peak it revise that down to barely more than and it be run at point with only mw of margin how be the government so complacent about this it be astonishing as someone who have follow the energy debate for the past year or so i warn the minister that this be almost unprecedented for he to say that everything be absolutely fine be incredibly irresponsible when his own government ’s policy be contribute to the tightness of the generate margin if the light go out will he resign 
 that be the kind of extremist scaremongering that we have come to expect from the shadow secretary of state on twitter but we be now hear it in the house it be thoroughly irresponsible to use such language in my answer i read the very clear view of the national energy system operator which run the system and be the expert i repeat it for the benefit of the house 
 at no point be electricity supply less than anticipated demand and our engineer be able to rebalance the system without the need to consider emergency measure 
 the shadow minister and back bench mps can repeat the phrasing around blackout all they like but at no point be that a concern the reality be that while the   conservative be happy to throw around such phrase without any evidence we be build the resilient system of the future and we will get on with do that 
 in government the conservatives see the closure of rough and reduced gas storage in opposition they oppose our proposal for clean power and would see this country more reliant on volatile gas market and high energy price be it not the truth that the conservatives want we more reliant on gas with high bill and more likelihood of blackout because they oppose our plan for clean power and tackle runaway and accelerate climate change 
 the decision on whether to run gas storage site be a commercial for centrica the storage site at rough be close between and hon member may remember that that be when the beast from the east be attack the country the previous government will have to answer for the decision that they make on that we be make it clear that the only way to build the energy system that we need in the long term be the clean power action plan the conservatives use to support much of that but increasingly they have decide to walk away from it they will either keep we attach to the volatile fossil fuel market with all the price spike that our constituent continue to pay the price of or they will have to come up with an alternative plan we be get on with do the work 
 can i encourage the minister to come out of combat mode for a and consider a constructive proposal if we be not to become re dependent on gas when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine and we do not want to be dependent on foreign country indefinitely can he see a future role for modular nuclear reactor 
 if i be in any kind of attack mode it be because the opposition do not seem to be deal with reality and i think it be important to correct that the right hon gentleman be right that the future energy mix as we outline in the clean power action plan will involve a range of technology we outline the range we would expect for each of those and nuclear in particular small modular reactor will play an incredibly important part in that we be move forward with the programme we inherit from the previous government which be yet another incomplete process we will make it happen as quickly as possible and smr will play a key role in our energy mix 
 follow on from a previous question clearly the previous government do delay invest in and start up more nuclear power opportunity and option what progress have be make since this government come into power on plan to take forward nuclear power as part of our supply 
 when 
 conservative members ask when they have year in power and in year do not build a single new nuclear project the former minister for nuclear   the hon member for west aberdeenshire    and kincardine andrew bowie love to shout about all the consultation that he launch but he do not build a single new nuclear power station 
 my hon friend be right to make the point that we should move forward with nuclear we want to see nuclear project move forward as quickly as possible my hon friend the minister for nuclear be move forward with of the big project as well as the small modular reactor competition we be quite rightly go through a process to ensure that it be as robust as possible but we will have more to say in due course 
 last friday i meet wales west utilities which run the gas grid in my constituency and beyond where i hear that hydrogen be still a very viable option for home heating although there have be a number of pilot the government have recently go quite quiet on hydrogen in home heating will the minister update we on the step he be take to progress hydrogen for home heating 
 the hon lady raise the potential of hydrogen in our energy mix of course of the real strength of the gas network be that it can be change into other thing in the future that be a real strength of what we have and we be look at what those option might be there be a mix of option available with hydrogen include home heating but it could still play a really key role in industrial project for example in the short term we be look at those project we need to ensure that it be financially viable and that we have work out all the technological detail on how we would make it happen we will have more to say on that in due course 
 my understanding be that these notice be issue at time of high demand and that they be evidence of the system work in order to prevent power cut or the system break down i would have think the conservatives would have learn their lesson from the spike in international gas price that cause the crisis in people ’s fuel bill and lead to a cost of living crisis but they have learn nothing from that do my hon friend the minister agree that this really underline our policy of ensure that we have a secure provision of renewable energy which leave we less open to spike in price on the international market 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be worth say that electricity margin notice be not unexpected particularly at this time of year they mean that there be enough generation available to meet demand but that neso would like to see a large safety cushion that be the important point for people to understand what margin notice be about the notice be cancel of course because there be sufficient supply to ensure that cushion 
 my hon friend ’s broad point be important we have outline in great detail how we will deliver clean power by the conservative now claim to oppose that in fact they oppose much of net full stop they will have to answer how they would deliver a secure and resilient energy system of the future that bring down bill and deliver on climate leadership 
 i be unconvinced to use parliamentary language by the minister ’s reassurance that the light do not almost go out last week i be also unconvinced by his say that the system be robust and resilient this be the minister who tell elector in scotland that energy bill would come down by £ under this government they have go up and will go up twice more give the perilous gas storage situation it be at compare to the the eu enjoy what step will he take to de stress the system by accelerate investment in long duration energy storage 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his characteristic question on the point let i just say that it be not i who say anything about what the margin be i quote the national energy system operator which actually deliver in this country and will quote it again for the benefit of the hon gentleman 
 at no point be electricity supply less than anticipated demand and our engineer be able to rebalance the system 
 he can take or leave my word i be not particularly bother but those be the word of the people who actually operate the energy system 
 on the hon gentleman ’s final point i absolutely agree with he on the importance of long duration energy storage that be why for the time in year this government announce a new cap and floor regime to deliver new long duration energy storage scheme that be a huge step forward from the position under many previous government and it will allow the building of the pumped hydro scheme and new innovative technology that will deliver that energy storage we be move as fast as possible i hope that he and his hon friend will support those decision 
 i thank the minister for update and reassure the house and resident on the robustness of the system and for his work take forward a wide diversification of energy supply will he update the house on support for the take up of heat pump to ensure that in the long run we be far less dependent on gas from overseas will he also say something about the importance of insulation and what the government be do to support further measure to encourage insulation 
 my hon friend be right that as well as build an energy system that will deliver generation capacity for the future we need to work as fast as possible to reduce demand part of that be about move away from gas to heat pump that be important not just for our energy system and climate but for individual household in reduce their bill we already see a huge shift in the uptake of heat pump across the country there be of course much more to do on that if we be to reach our target but the government be commit to that and it be important for household right across the country i echo his point on insulation those in fuel poverty be more likely to live in house that be cold the more we can do to create warm home that be what the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh be do the well for everyone 
 last week be the cold week of the winter also last week of our energy mix be gas and just about   be wind we have hear about issue with gas storage and the government be penalise the oil and gas sector by extend the windfall tax not allow new licence and remove investment allowance it feel like this government be not take our energy security seriously can the minister reassure the house that that be not the case and that he will engage with our oil and gas company to ensure that we be secure in our energy today despite what they be try to do for the future 
 i can give that assurance indeed every month i have be in this job i have be in aberdeen meet oil and gas company to discuss the issue we be not go to agree on everything but i have be very clear that there will be a long future for oil and gas in the north sea yes we absolutely have say that we do not want to issue any new licence for new field but we will not revoke any exist licence that mean that there will continue to be work in the north sea for a long time to come 
 i repeat that it be categorically untrue that our electricity or gas supply have be at risk over the past week we have robust system in place and they work exactly as they should consumer lose absolutely no supply over the last few day nor will they in the week and month ahead 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests about my membership of the energy union gmb and unite in the then energy minister the noble lord harrington say 
 the closure of rough will not cause a problem with security ”—[official report   june vol c. 
 will the minister confirm that the waste year that follow before rough be reopen at reduce capacity continue to impose restraint on the network will the government take an open minded approach to centrica ’s proposal to gradually convert that storage capacity to hydrogen 
 these be commercial decision for centrica although if it bring those decision to we we will of course look at they let i reiterate that the uk have a robust set of storage facility to ensure security of supply rough be of they but at moment such as this in the winter it be not the most important because it be the slow to move gas into the system the remainder be in an entirely robust state and will continue to deliver but as i have say what it choose to do with its site be a commercial matter for centrica 
 we have hear in the house today about an over reliance on gas but surely in reality it be an over reliance on import gas the force of this government seem to be drive we into the hand of foreign supplier and as much as of our gas may be import by should we not support domestic source of oil and gas and back the industry job find in constituency across the land rather than push those people off a cliff 
 i take issue with of those point in the past decade job have already be lose from the oil and gas industry and that happen   under a government whom the hon gentleman support the industry be change we be put in place a robust set of plan to help the workforce into the job of the future rather than bury our head in the sand and pretend that the basin in the north sea be not super mature secondly even if we be to extract more gas from our continental shelf give that it be trade on an international market and the pricing be set not by we but by the international market we would continue to pay more for it whether or not it come from the north sea so that would not deal with the pricing issue reflect in the hon gentleman ’s question 
 do the minister assume that after the government have rob pensioner of the winter fuel allowance gas consumption would go down or be this government so obsess with their net policy that they do not really care whether we have enough gas to meet our energy need do the minister not realise that be reliant on foreign supplier will push up fuel price in the uk how do he justify the fact that under his net policy the government be ignore the fact that we have year worth of gas naturally store in the united kingdom and will not use it 
 let i repeat what i say a moment ago even if we be to take much more gas from our continental shelf it would still be trade on the international market the reason why the right hon gentleman ’s constituent and mine still face a cost of living crisis be our exposure to petrostate and dictator around the world he would clearly like to expose we to they even more and i think that the conservatives would support he in that but we want to get ourselves off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel and deliver a clean power system that be cheap in the long run and deliver energy security that be what be good for consumer and for all our constituent 
 the minister have several time mention energy security and have say that the drive to net will make we more energy secure but now that europe have learn the lesson of take fossil fuel from russia we will take our renewable resource from china which manufacture and process the vast of majority of the material need what contingency plan have the minister make in case china decide to get into a trade war with the uk on renewable or to cut off supply the threat that could come from china be exactly the same as those that come from russia about fossil fuel 
 let i say thing to the right hon gentleman our approach to china be that we will co operate when it be in our interest to do so and will challenge when necessary that be the point that the chancellor be make secondly the way to ensure that what he describe do not happen and that we build as much as possible in this country be to build an industrial base in this country and to bring clean power job to the uk the last government fail to do that we be drive forward an industrial strategy that will ensure that the job that arise from the clean power plan that we design be in this country the opposition can either support that or oppose it 
 this whole discussion underline the importance of electricity storage include at the battery energy storage system in my constituency the bredbury substation how can we encourage more community to welcome bess to their area perhaps by consider community benefit such as district heat network 
 the hon lady make a really important point about energy storage in its various form battery storage technology be move forward extraordinarily quickly and the short duration that we can get from battery be improve quite considerably so battery will have a key role to play importantly there be the potential for community to drive some of that we have be really clear in our local power plan that we want community to be in the drive seat as much as possible so that they can secure community benefit we also want they to own some of the infrastructure in a few week time i will visit a scheme in scotland where the community would be able to own not just a battery storage project but a wind turbine that fill the battery they would get a double benefit from the energy that they be generate and able to store we would like to see more such scheme right across the country 
 i have a certain amount of sympathy for   the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg whom the minister slightly fob off with his answer now that he have have a chance to calm down and check his note i will ask the question again on the hon member ’s behalf what have the government do to advance the case for nuclear energy since they take power 
 that be a very good question i thank the hon gentleman for give i a chance to reiterate that we inherit a whole series of plan that be not deliver we have move forward as quickly as possible to deliver significant project but we have also move forward the competition on small modular reactor interruption the shadow minister say all you have to do be sign it off maybe he forget the state in which he leave some of his policy when he depart office
