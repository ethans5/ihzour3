 as my hon friend be right to recognise this issue have be around for some time and the government have announce their intention to publish a draft audit reform and corporate governance bill for scrutiny in this session investor and the public need access to truthful reporting from our most important business on their finance and related issue my department continue to progress that important work and a timetable for the publication of the bill will be confirm in the usual way for draft legislation in due course 
 since leave the european union we have be diverge progressively and passively not make an active decision to diverge because it be good for we but because we can not keep up with the number of regulation come through the european union that have be particularly disadvantageous for energy trading what conversation have the minister have with government colleague around align with the eu on emission trading

 i be grateful for my hon friend for raise the case of the patels i be keen that any sub postmaster who be a victim of the horizon scandal get access to the compensation they rightly deserve as quickly as possible she will understand that i can not comment on individual case but if she want to write to i about the specific case i would be happy to look into it far and to discuss it with she 
 there be over pub across bromsgrove and the village of they the queens head face a staggering £ annual increase in the cost of business rate and national insurance contribution as a result of choice make by this government that be on top of increase concern around a banter ban will the minister confirm that nobody will be eject from a pub or hospitality venue for share a joke and will he outline what step he be take to support pub rather than put they out of business 
 i note in pass that pub close their door under the conservative government so i do not think the pub industry be look to the hon gentleman ’s party for guidance go forward on the specific he ask about he will be aware of our plan for business rate reform which will help and make a significant difference to many pub on the so call banter ban i gently suggest that he should not believe everything that he read in the newspaper 
 pub and restaurant be part of a thriving high street in doncaster that be know for its iconic nightlife will the minister set out what action the department be take to support hospitality and ensure that high street continue to thrive and may i invite he to doncaster to see how nightlife be do properly 
 i will give careful consideration to my hon friend ’s very generous offer in answer to   the hon member for bromsgrove bradley thomas   i mention business rate reform which could make a significant difference for many business in the night time economy another crucial issue that we want to tackle be the rise crime and antisocial behaviour on our high street as she will know the crime and policing bill which be begin its journey through parliament will make a significant difference in that regard 
 the high street trader john lewis partnership be announce its annual result today it be a highly successful business but this year it will not be pay a dividend to its partner the workforce because it have to absorb national insurance cost do the minister understand the real impact that ni contribution be have on what his party like to describe as ordinary work people 
 i say gently to the right hon gentleman and his conservative colleague that we have to take the difficult decision in the budget to increase employer national insurance contribution because of the mess that their party leave the country in the shadow secretary of state for business and trade   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith help to write the liz truss budget that do so much damage to our country we be try to sort out the mess the shadow secretary of state still have not apologise for his part in that fiasco he should take the opportunity to do so during these question 
 i call the shadow minister 
 yesterday the owner of the hugely popular rumsey ’s which be celebrate year on wendover high street in my constituency email i to say 
 we estimate the change come in april will add to our staff cost that we simply do not have therefore we have have to sadly make redundancy put in a recruitment freeze and implement staff hour cut to offset this 
 with real world testimony like that replicate up and down the country will the minister finally acknowledge that an urgent change of course be need to support high street scrap the employer ni rise save job and protect community 
 i gently say to the hon gentleman that it would be interesting to know whether he now regret the enthusiastic support he give the liz truss budget which do so much damage to our country ’s public finance our budget in october last year start the process of sort out those situation i look with interest at his website recently which have a my plan section it be completely blank although that be probably well give that he so strongly support the liz truss budget there be at least a bit of progress 
 well that be no answer to my question whatsoever it be almost as if labour members have not realise that they be in charge and that it be their decision that be have this impact let i tell the minister something else that rumsey ’s report to i 
 the reduction in business rate relief will leave i no choice but to raise price simply to break even far limit growth and accessibility for customer 
 i just do not know how much more the minister need to hear to understand the scale of the problem on our high street he talk of business rate reform but the only business rate change we have see be the devastating cut to business rate relief which be hurt high street now will he reverse it 
 have the hon gentleman ’s party be elect retail hospitality and leisure relief would have come to an end we have extend retail hospitality and leisure relief we have set out in the budget our plan to permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property on the high street from we be take measure to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour on the high street which his party could have do more to tackle but choose not to we be bring in new legislation to end the immunity for crime on the high street where shoplifter steal good worth £ or less and we be create a specific offence of violence against retail worker to try to make it easy for business operate on the high street 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the national minimum wage and national living wage on family in airdrie and shotts constituency 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the national minimum wage and national living wage on family 
 more than worker be expect to receive a pay rise due to increase to the national minimum wage in april protect the low pay in society after our change to the remit we accept in full the recommendation of the low pay commission which consider the impact of rate on business competitiveness the labour market the wide economy and the cost of living our impact assessment be available only by region estimate by constituency be not available but the simple truth be that worker in every constituency be well off under this labour government 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer just yesterday parliament approve labour ’s new deal for work people the big upgrade to worker right in a generation this will see a pay rise for more than work scot many in the airdrie and shotts constituency and a marked improvement to term and condition which will be beneficial to our young workforce do he agree that with a government commit to improve the pay term and condition   of worker across the country the work people of airdrie and shotts will always get a well deal with labour 
 the plan to make work pay be a core part of our mission to grow the economy raise living standard and create opportunity for all and there will be significant benefit for worker in insecure and low pay job in central scotland include in airdrie and shotts this plan be about make people stay in work it be about make work more secure and more family friendly improve living standard and put more money in worker pocket but it be also about show that politic can work for people who may have give up on this place as somewhere that can improve their living standard their life and those of their family for that i be very proud of this government 
 the increase in the national living wage in april clearly show that this labour government be on the side of work people in north durham and across the country and be make work pay can the minister tell i how many family in north east england will benefit from the increase in the national living wage and national minimum wage next month 
 i thank my hon friend for his support around worker in north east england will feel the benefit of this direct pay rise i know his north durham constituency well i be no strange to chester le street and not only will his constituent get a pay rise but his local shop his restaurant his pub and more will get what they need most of all customer who have get a bit of money to spend 
 last friday i spend the day visit local shopkeeper in kelso many of whom employ their staff on the national minimum wage and the national living wage their big pressure just now be deal with this labour government ’s national insurance hike they be face a very difficult choice about whether they continue to employ people what be the message from the minister to those hard work local shopkeeper 
 the thing i would cite most of all to the hon member ’s constituent be the doubling of the employment allowance in the budget and the threshold be remove which mean that some small business will actually be pay low national insurance contribution than they would have pay before the budget however i never shy away from the fact that the choice we have to make in the budget be out of necessity due to the black hole that be leave behind i be yet to hear any offer from conservative members as to how they would fill it 
 at these question we will talk about triple compensation for victim of the post office horizon scandal only because the money be there it be not there under the conservative party we will talk about money for the steel industry stand behind that industry again money be promise but not deliver if promise be make the resource to do those thing have to be there they be not there under the conservative party they be under labour 
 whether it be the increase in the minimum wage the increase in employer national insurance the increase in business rate or indeed the change make to the employment rights bill all of these measure collectively be negatively penalise many business across my constituency whether in keighley ilkley or far afield as a result redundancy be have to be make or the price of product and service be have to increase and these business can not absorb the additional increase that this labour government be put on they do the government undertake any economic impact assessment of what all of these measure collectively would have on hard work business across my constituency 
 as i have say to conservative members before of course we be very sensitive to the aggregate impact of government policy because frankly have observe the conservative governments of the previous year i think they completely miss this point and at many time have different departments do completely oppose thing 
 i want to say something specific on business rate no business rate relief be plan have the conservative party win the election the reduction to be an increase in what be in the national account again short term decision for short term partisan political benefit no serious plan for the future 
 the hon gentleman will have see the figure from the insolvency service this week which be very interesting they show that few people have be make redundant over the past month than in the year before so i be afraid that the doom monger of the conservative party have be prove absolutely wrong by the statistic that we have 
 what step his department be take to help microbusinesse comply with the general product safety regulation 
 the government be commit to support microbusinesse to comply with the general product safety regulation for northern ireland we have publish additional guidance for business and we will publish an update in the come week in the light of feedback we have receive we will continue to engage with business to ensure that they can trade freely across the uk business target the eu market may use the government ’s export support service since october the department ’s export academy have deliver free online gpsr training session to almost attendee 
 i thank the minister for his answer my constituent george stevens run a microbusiness in lydd make handcraft string instrument it have be run for over year and he have many eu customer he be deeply worried about brexit relate red tape which be hold back his eu export can the minister give he an assurance that as a result of the propose measure he will now find it easy to trade with the eu 
 microbusinesse such as that of mr stevens be central to the government ’s growth mission we be committed to strengthen our relationship with the eu and to tackle trade barrier and friction and we regularly engage directly with business and their representative organisation to understand the difficulty they face our export support service help small and medium sized enterprise navigate opportunity in eu market and get the practical help they need to do so for example the unlock europe programme which be launch in december as part of the export academy offer practical guidance to help uk business enhance their export potential to the eu 
 our country ’s very high electricity cost be another huge problem face business in my constituency and nationally reintegrate our power market with europe ’ through the single day ahead coupling system would cost our country nothing save cost for business reduce carbon dioxide and make our power market more efficient will the minister take fast step to reintegrate our electricity market with those of our european neighbour 
 i thank the hon member for his tangential question relate to gpsr he make an important point about energy cost and we be work closely with the eu on how to build on that and of course the industrial strategy will also be look very closely at how energy cost can be bring down for business 
 if he will take step to reduce employment regulation for business 
 the plan to make work pay be central to our plan for change to grow the economy raise living standard and create opportunity for all it will tackle low pay poor working condition and job insecurity create long term growth and investment to support business insight gain from our ongoing engagement with business will help we ensure proportionate and effective policy our plan to make work pay will ensure a level playing field so that employer that be try to do the right thing be not undercut 
 i send a survey about how the government have treat business to every register company in the weald of kent and they be terrified some of they in be less likely to hire follow soar taxis and the truly dire employment rights bill the regulatory policy committee find the government ’s own impact assessment for the bill not fit for purpose will the minister conduct a proper assessment of the damage the bill will do or should i send he mine 
 i be always grateful for advice if the hon lady be conduct survey she might look at the that say that of her constituent support the plan in the bill to bring in day right for sick pay the importance of this bill can not be overstate we have a plan to bring business up to a standard where work be respect and people have security and dignity if the hon lady can not understand that then she need to get out a bit more 
 what step his department be take to support trade union recognition in the workplace 
 the government be commit to simplify the process and law around trade union recognition so that work people have a more meaningful right to organise through trade union of course i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests in this respect through the employment rights bill we be reform the process for statutory recognition application with exist threshold present too high a hurdle in modern workplace they be increasingly fragmented we be also take step to strengthen protection against unfair practice during the recognition process which we debate at length yesterday 
 in january bidfood a food wholesaler and major employer in my constituency announce overnight that it would derecognise the gmb and unite the union remove the ability of thousand of worker across the country to collectively bargain through their trade union the union fear that bidfood worker could now be leave at risk of fire and rehire before protection in this government ’s employment rights bill come into force do the minister agree that employer should not be try to dodge protection under the government ’s plan to make work pay and will he join i in support the gmb and unite as they seek to protect their worker at bidfood 
 my hon friend will understand that i can not comment on individual case but i be deeply trouble by what he have say i can be clear that the government be determined to reset industrial relation so that employer and trade union work together in partnership rather than in conflict as we have hear we encourage all employer to engage with union in the spirit of co operation and collaboration work in that way benefit employer and worker alike as he know the employment rights bill will end the unscrupulous practice of fire and rehire which have no place in a modern economy and workplace so if any company be think of do that it should think again 
 i very much welcome the minister ’s response after i work in my mum and dad ’s shop i join the firm henry denny and i be require to join the union i be not sure about join but when i do so i find out that the union back i as a worker against the employer whenever they be bring in thing that be wrong so i encourage everybody who join a workforce to join a union because it will protect they whenever they need help 
 the hon member could not have put it well he have explain the benefit of trade union membership which be something that member on the conservative benches clearly do not understand 
 i call the father of the house 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality industry 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality industry 
 we be create a fairer business rate system reduce alcohol duty on qualify draught product and our forthcoming small business strategy will set out our plan to far support small business on the high street and beyond in addition through the hospitality sector council we be address with business strategic issue relate to high street regeneration skill sustainability and productivity and we have recently save the pint 
 obviously the minister be work very hard but he look a bit tired so may i offer he some lincolnshire hospitality will he come and stay for a glorious weekend in of our farm cottage to enjoy our great sky and brace air and help our distressed farmer frankly they need the income the problem be that the government have abolish the furnished holiday let scheme which be a tremendous encouragement for the countryside i do not expect an answer now but will he consider approach his right hon friend the chancellor to see if we can reinstate that in the budget to help our farmer and the countryside 
 unusually for the conservative party the right hon gentleman have make an extremely generous offer i be almost as tempt by that as by the offer from my hon friend   the member for doncaster central sally jameson   to visit doncaster i be happy to look at the issue he raise and i will write to he with more detail 
 the crusty cob bakery have be a constant in east devon for the past year but last week the family run business close the door on all of its shop make over local people redundant the owner state a panoply of issue from manufacture cost to reduce high street footfall and energy price but the kicker be the decision that this business secretary ’s party have make to slam company with increase to the national living wage and employer national insurance contribution the effect of this labour government ’s decision be set in and literally destroy work family business will the business secretary and the minister please give a message to the crusty cob team who have just lose their job 
 i understand that this will be an extremely worrying time for employee of the crusty cob and their family i gently say to the hon gentleman that we be offer a discount to retail hospitality and leisure property as part of our business rate package we be go to reform business rate more substantially with a permanently low multipli in that while it clearly will not help the crusty cob and its employee will help other business on the high street 
 i be slightly surprised that the hon gentleman should be so opposed to an increase in the living wage i do not know whether that be his party ’s policy i also gently remind he of the datum from the office for national    statistics which my right hon friend the secretary of state point out show more people in job this year compare with last year 
 what step he be take to ensure that compensation be pay to people impact by the post office horizon scandal in a timely manner 
 in the past month we have treble the total amount of compensation pay and ensure that more than victim who have as yet receive nothing have now have some financial redress we be make up front fix sum offer and interim payment where possible to speed up the delivery of redress there be still a lot more to do though and we remain committed to ensure swift and fair redress for every postmaster affect by the horizon scandal 
 i thank the minister for that answer he and i will agree that the post office horizon scandal be of the great miscarriage of justice in modern time but the problem with the post office and its injustice extend far beyond that some case relate to the precursor system capture which bear the same hallmark as those in the horizon scandal have be refer to the criminal cases review commission i be afraid that the ccrc be famous for take year to come to obvious decision so can the minister tell i that it will deal with this in month if not will his department intervene directly 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the issue of capture as he will know we have publish our response to the independent kroll report on the capture software issue and the way in which the post office respond to the datum that come out of it we have be meet sub postmaster who use the capture system and who be the victim in that regard to talk through a redress scheme with they we be also work closely with the criminal cases review commission and have make it clear to the post office that it must co operate with request from the ccrc so that we can speed up its deliberation on the case 
 i recently meet a constituent who be a former postmaster affect by the horizon scandal he have apply for compensation but feel that the process be take too long with unreasonable ask give the legal ruling that postmaster should be afford the benefit of the doubt what step be the department take to ensure that compensation claim be process fairly and without delay that could far affect the victim 
 as my hon friend will know we inherit a compensation process that be perceive by many sub postmaster as be slow legalistic and adversarial so we have already take a series of step to try to speed thing up particularly in try to get out more fix sum payment for example we be move in more staff to support work on the compensation process if she would like i to look in more detail at her constituency case i be very happy to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the business secretary meet recently in japan with fujitsu which develop the horizon system and have offer to contribute to the compensation for victim can the minister tell the house how much the secretary of state have ask it to contribute so that taxpayer be not on the hook for £ 
 the hon lady be right to reference the discussion that my right hon friend have with the chief executive officer of fujitsu that company have agree to begin talk about its contribution to the cost of compensation she will understand that we also need to wait for sir wyn williams inquiry to conclude and for his recommendation regard compensation from fujitsu to be hear and understand i be sure she will also understand that i be not go to give a running commentary on the discussion with fujitsu but i welcome the fact that it have agree to begin talk 
 what step his department be take to support small business 
 what step his department be take to support small business 
 small business need a well deal certainly well than the they get from the last government and our small business strategy which be due this year be design to do that we have already provide more support through the british business bank we have work with the federation of small businesses to take action on issue such as late payment and retail crime and we have announce the creation of the new business growth service which aim to transform business support service later today i will attend a small business summit in sussex to progress those plan and meet small business leader 
 too many small and medium sized defence business in my community struggle to access the banking and finance facility they need often on the basis of self impose ethical criterion will the business secretary join i in welcome how many investor and financial institution have respond to the campaign i be lead with my hon friend   the member for york outer mr charters   and other labour parliamentarian call on our bank and fund manager to broaden their approach to defence investment will he call on investor to take action so that we can defend our country support ukraine and fire up our industrial base 
 i agree with my hon friend and thank she very much for her question she will know that my department alongside the treasury and the ministry of defence convene a roundtable in december to listen to these perspective and now all departments be work together to ensure that the problem she have articulate do not occur 
 it be essential that the british people do not think that the substantial significant and historic investment in defence that this government be make come in some way at the expense of domestic prosperity there be no prosperity without security but we should also acknowledge the tremendous economic contribution make by our defence sector there be not a foreign and domestic split in that regard i thank my hon friend for her outstanding leadership in galvanise parliamentary support for that campaign and i hope it will have unanimous agreement in every part of the house 
 as the secretary of state be aware the ceramics industry include in my constituency of stoke on trent south be face immense competition from imported counterfeit good many of those good contain false backstamp that mislead consumer and as the gmb union have raise with i threaten great british company such as dunoon duchess and many other will the minister meet i again to discuss in more detail create offence and table regulation to deal with import counterfeit ceramic good 
 my department have a very strong relationship with the ceramics sector through the energy intensive users group we have regular meeting with that group and i would also like to mention the british ceramic confederation and our old friend rob flello who be a strong voice for the sector there be many challenge for the ceramics sector not least decarbonisation but on the subject of consumer protection it be firmly against uk consumer law for firm wherever they be locate to give consumer false information such as through fake product marking we have strengthen the regime in this regard with new enforcement power for the competition and markets authority come into force next month but i will of course get my hon friend any meeting she require 
 a constituent in chorleywood recently contact i after need an emergency locksmith due to a broken key initially quote £ over the phone she be later charge £ and be only give the new key after make that payment while i applaud this government ’s ambition to reduce regulation can we ensure that there be appropriate regulation so that consumer be not unfairly overcharge as in this instance 
 i too have hear the kind of story that the hon gentleman have articulate there be definitely concern in that regard broadly the government ’s regulation agenda be not necessarily about deregulation but about effective and proportionate regulation i feel that our regulatory sector have grow a lot in recent year and that it do not always compare well to those of other country in term of timeliness and business response that be the agenda we be pursue but i will certainly write to the hon gentleman about the issue he have raise which be very relevant i appreciate the opportunity to do so and thank he for raise they today 
 many family be support by the work of my constituent alison and kevin who run a small care business they tell i that they already operate on tight margin in a sector under   huge pressure the hike in employer national insurance contribution will force they to make tough decision on staffing and simply reduce the amount of care they can offer kevin and alison rightly say that this hike make no sense at a time when the government tell we that they want to move to community care provision and get people out of hospital do the secretary of state not agree 
 i thank the hon member for her question and i thank alison and kevin for their important work we already talk about the difficult choice that the government face and the unenviable choice that have to be make health and social care be a beneficiary of the additional revenue that need to be raise to meet some of the challenge we face but we be not casual about the impact of that and we recognise the pressure that come from that i would say that i do not agree taxis have to apply to every sector and we can not carve out certain sector however i appreciate the pressure that she articulate that be why the rest of the government ’s agenda be set to address all those factor 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 small business be the backbone of the british economy up and down the country we have success story of innovative start up and family run business that should be part of the government ’s plan to get britain grow again under the conservatives the number of small business in my constituency decrease by between and the tories mess up our national and local economy be the minister concern that his government ’s national insurance rise will damage the economy just as the conservatives do 
 if we be list the difficult thing that small business have to deal with in the previous year we would be here for most of the day and the weekend if we be be honest whether it be how the conservatives handle brexit the mini budget or austerity we could go on and on i say to the hon member that we be not casual about what we have have to ask of business because of the unenviable situation we inherit but the fundamental of the uk be incredibly strong in political stability and openness to the world and we have the change we be make to planning skill regulation and energy to make sure we be deliver 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on small and medium sized enterprise 
 the treasury publish a tax information and impact note in november alongside the introduction of the bill contain the employer national insurance contribution change it set out the impact of the policy on the exchequer and the impact on business and that approach be consistent with previous tax change 
 the impact i hear from sme in my constituency predominantly in the visitor economy be that they be anticipate cut the hour of part time staff or lay they off and reduce the number of seasonal employee that they will take on will the minister take those concern seriously and work with ministers in the scottish government to ensure that the legitimate concern of sme in my constituency do not blossom into a full blow crisis of confidence 
 i be always happy to work with the scottish government and other devolve government on how we can improve the business environment i be sure the right hon member will join i in encourage the government in scotland to mirror the change we have make to business rate relief give the sizeable increase in the scottish budget it be somewhat surprising that the snp have not be willing to support the retail sector through an extension of retail hospitality relief 
 what step he be take to help increase level of international investment in scotland 
 the government be commit to support investment in scotland in line with our growth mission the prime minister recently announce that the national wealth fund will provide £ of investment in new opportunity in grangemouth in particular that announcement come alongside the recently announce £ grant for the port of cromarty firth the investment zone receive £ over the next year and our expand office for investment 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for that answer the national wealth fund have recently invest £ in pulpex ltd to construct a sustainable packaging facility near glasgow which be a welcome move and will support job and growth what further measure be plan to attract similar green industry investment in community such as my own in north lanarkshire which have scotland ’s fast grow economy 
 my hon friend be a tireless advocate for the community of coatbridge and bellshill i can assure he that the national wealth fund ’s strategic partnership trial will see each local authority within the glasgow city region include north lanarkshire be invite to submit project proposal include for project focus on i hesitate to say green job in coatbridge 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility

 finally we have engage closely with the new us administration include commerce secretary howard lutnick and the new us trade representative jamieson greer the new us trade policy be challenge but we believe that our decision to engage and seek potential agreement on a new economic deal between the uk and the us offer we an opportunity to ensure that the uk be the well connect market in the world 
 business across beaconsfield marlow and the south bucks village be face crippling cost from the government ’s national insurance tax raid and the employment rights bill can the secretary of state reassure or advise my business should they stop hire cut staff increase price or all of the above 
 i would say that business in the hon lady ’s constituency should contact their local conservative mp and say what be your plan because i think we have have oral question session where this have broadly be the only thing that the conservatives have to say i genuinely want to know what be the plan to pay for post office compensation what be the plan to pay for the steel industry when the conservatives commission the public sector pay body with the remit that they be give get the finding back hide they and do not tell the british people during the general election campaign what be the plan how would they have reconcile that the small business leader and business of every size in the hon lady ’s constituency know how to make difficult decision what 
 order look this be get ridiculous we be on topical and that be the bad example i have see of an answer to a topical 
 the south west have a huge number of innovative start up and scale up business but we attract only about of private equity and venture capital funding per year what be the department do to ensure that foreign direct investor be aware of and have access to the fantastic business infrastructure opportunity that we have in exeter and across the south west 
 i see many incredible business when i go to the exeter business park last year when i be in saudi arabia in january i be with a range of business that be promote investment include many from the south west there be more that we can do but there be some brilliant people there who be do brilliant thing i think we can go far and i be certainly very happy to work with my hon friend on that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 how have we get to this point after week as trade secretary week since the us election and an entire month since steel and aluminium tariff be announce the secretary of state be only now go to sit down with the secretary of commerce of our close ally while he have be correct his cv steelworker and business be hurt today this be a colossal failure of trade policy on his watch why have it take so long and when can we expect an agreement 
 the hon gentleman may have not see the news recently but the uk lead by our prime minister have have the good engagement of any country with the new us administration be it not good to see again a british prime minister who be respect on the world stage and deliver for britain we have have tremendous engagement with the new us administration and i be look forward to meet they in person next week 
 once again no answer come there forth over job in this country depend on trade with the united states include thousand of job in our steel industry the secretary of state do not know when he be go to get a deal will he publish his red line for that deal his objective and what he hop to achieve from meeting next week 
 on steel and aluminium tariff the us administration ’s position be that there be no exemption for anybody that be across the board i think they recognise the very strong case that we have but that be their position 
 no i will not publish my negotiate red line before a negotiation frankly that be the bad advice i have ever hear in the house of commons the conservative party fall out with the eu would not deal with china and could not do a deal with india it fall out with the united arab emirates and could not do a deal with the gulf it get nothing out of the us it do deal with australia and new zealand then disown they we will take no lesson from the conservatives 
 social enterprise contribute of gdp and town such as leigh and atherton benefit greatly from they will the minister outline what the department be do to support social enterprise and co operative so they can contribute to the growth agenda in the uk 
 my hon friend be a great champion of the social enterprise sector she will know that we be committed to double the size of the co op and mutual sector we recently meet the recently launch mutual and co op business council to begin work with business on our plan to expand the co op and mutual sector she may also be aware that our social enterprise boost fund be currently spend some £ on help to support social enterprise that be already up and run 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson 
 if the government have to push forward with retaliatory measure against the united states for its steel tariff they must strike at the political ally of the president to meaningfully move on the conversation can the secretary of state confirm whether elon musk ’s tesla be be consider as a potential target for retaliatory measure 
 we reserve the right to take any action in response to any change to our trading relationship but i do think we can look to the opportunity for the uk which be great than for any other country to get to an agreement that improve our term of trade with the us i reserve the right to take any action but i think we can look forward in a positive way to improve that trading relationship and that right now be my message and focus 
 i call chris bloore

 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests some of hospitality firm say they will have to cut staff or staff hour say they will cut investment and say they will increase price because of the chancellor ’s manifesto break national insurance increase what assessment have the minister make of the number of worker be drag into national insurance contribution for the time and if the government must continue with this disastrous policy will they at least delay it for month to bring it into line with the introduction of business rate reform 
 we have have or question on this topic and the hon member will therefore not be surprise by my answer i gently point out that the difficult decision we take on employer ’s national insurance contribution in the budget be a direct result of the mess the conservative party which he support so enthusiastically leave for this government 
 the big supermarket be act like a cartel force unfair price on farmer and pursue unscrupulous practice such as farm washing do the minister agree with i that we should look again at the groceries code adjudicator and consider whether it be fit for purpose

 the simple position be that we will represent the uk ’s national interest in this matter the us have objection about its significant deficit in manufacture good with china and the eu but that be not the relationship between the us and the uk so there be a chance for the uk to pursue a different policy that produce great benefit for every part of the uk than perhaps be available to other country of course we be cognisant of the overall impact no want to see this type of turmoil in the global economy but our job be to deliver for the uk and that be exactly what we be focus on do

 i be incredibly grateful to the chair of the business and trade committee for that question he be right to say that the challenge here be not just the direct trade we have with the us but the impact of trade diversion he know we already have anti dumping anti subsidy measure in place against separate product category once the annual tariff free quota be hit a tariff apply to those i can tell he and the house today though that i will support uk steel ’s application to the trade remedies authority for a review of the steel safeguard we do have to think about what will be come and a new for the aluminium sector

 i be sure the whole house will want to join i in recognise and thank the salvage and nature recovery specialist who be even now scramble to clear up after the disastrous collision in the north sea 
 they say a conservative be a socialist who have be mug by reality if that be so we be witness the extraordinary sight of a prime minister who be be visibly mug by reality in slow motion before our very eye the government ’s brand of socialism start well from their point of view if disastrously for the country we have the union pay off the rapid settlement of pay dispute in the public sector for apparent efficiency benefit and a heavily tax and spend budget the chancellor be even so bold as members will   recall as to announce to the cbi that she would not be raise taxis or increase debt over the course of the government as she say 
 i ’m clear i’m not come back with more borrowing or more taxis 
 however the budget start to unravel almost as soon as it be publish we have the bizarre sight of a government who be ever more committed to talk about growth while club growth to death across a variety of sector through the national insurance rise and the £ burden of the employment rights bill of course but also through their loss of credibility in the market which have push up gilt yield by since september great british energy be announce and do nothing the government make an unsuccessful attempt to claim credit for the achievement of the newly rebrande national wealth fund which have be set up only week before the system of infrastructure monitoring and planning have be dismantle and there have be no news for month on the decision on small modular reactor which be due on   december   or thereabout can the leader of the house update the house on when we can expect that decision 
 then president trump get elect despite or perhaps because of the special swat team of labour activist send over to campaign for his rival and then the mugging by reality really begin the energy secretary be force to pare back his ruinously expensive carbon energy plan the prime minister have to announce his plan for change the government be force to accelerate their defence spending plan in order to address the situation in ukraine and so it continue 
 this week we have hear of the government ’s so call operation chainsaw or should that be butter knife?—to reshape the civil service next week we will have hasty and almost certainly ill thought through cut to welfare labour be red under   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn become a gentle cerise for voter at the general election and now that reality be set in it be a pleasing shade of purple with more and more patch of blue the prime minister and the government be become more conservative by the day 
 in sharp contrast it be the government ’s policy towards rural area that be most striking we have see the family farm tax and the disproportionate effect on hospice and social care service in rural area arise from the rise in national insurance now in the same week we have see new compulsory purchase power to seize farmland and the abrupt and unexpected end of the sustainable farming incentive scheme the government be simultaneously reduce farm income threaten farm holding and force the sale of family farm through their inheritance tax change i be sad to say that even the £ allocate by the previous government to clean up the river wye of the natural glory of this country have be cut to just £ the labour message be clear do not be a farmer do not feed the country do not give we food security do not work every hour god send whatever the weather we do not care 
 the leader of the house have be very clear that it be her policy not to answer opposition question or even to answer question about her policy of not answer question she ignore my question yet again last week but perhaps she can have a go at these question now why have the government take such a punitive   approach to the countryside be they do so deliberately or be it just by accident finally will she come to visit some farmer in herefordshire with i so that she can see the actual effect of these policy for herself we will throw in some magnificent shepherds or rowlestone ice cream as well if that will make any difference 
 i start by congratulate young carer across the country on their day of action yesterday 
 i know the whole house will be as hopeful as everybody else in the country about ukraine as talk continue this week and over the weekend i be sure we all welcome the resumption of military aid and intelligence sharing between the us and ukraine this really be an important moment for peace in the region and the ball be now firmly in russia ’s court 
 the shadow leader of the house spend most of his speech last week and this week give a long lecture about why i do not answer his question while actually fail to ask i very many at all we have a couple of small question today at the end of another diatribe that as ever take we through various myth and misinformation he will know that this government have to take some very difficult decision to deal with an economy that no government would want to deal with high and rise debt stagnant growth low productivity low wage and public service on their knee that be why we have have to take some difficult decision to fix those foundation but most importantly to get that investment back into our public service as we desire to do 
 the shadow leader of the house again raise the point about national insurance but i must point out to the house that he be a treasury minister when his government raise national insurance not only on business but on work people as well i be sorry to tell he that this government absolutely back british farmer we be do what we can to support they we have increase the farming budget to £ over year which be far more than the conservative government ever do we have set out a new deal for farmer and we be invest in our flood defence we also have a plan for sustainable food and he know well than anybody that the sustainable farming incentive have a cap budget which his government do not announce they fail to spend any of it and give the action that we have take it have be oversubscribe in the meantime that be why we have close that fund but we be set out a new fund after the spring statement next week 
 i might give the shadow leader of the house an alternative point of view on recent history order paper aficionado will have notice that tuesday mark our sitting day of this parliamentary session hon member hear hear that be day of boost our public service invest in job and growth and reform the state in favour of people and against vested interest that be also day of change and day of put the government back in the service of work people 
 we have have the most ambitious king ’s speech programme of any incoming government bills have now receive royal assent include the passenger railway services public ownership act end the scandal of free cash go to fail rail company   and the water special measures act end bonus for water boss pollute our waterway very soon we will have martyn ’s law keep the promise that we make to figen murray and there be more on the way strengthen renter right switch on great british energy introduce new power to tackle phone theft seize off road bike create respect order ban knife sale and introduce strong protection against stalk and spike we be unblock house building and energy infrastructure which for too long have stall yesterday we complete our commons stage of the employment rights bill give people dignity and security in work and that be just a few of the thing that we have do 
 beyond that we be fix the big problem that the country face with waiting list finally come down more gp appointment breakfast club in school a increase in return of people with no right to be here more affordable housing and restrict the right to buy finally get rid of hereditary peer and crack down on mps job and the big devolution of power in a generation and that be just a snapshot of those day 
 mr speaker you will be pleased to know that in that time we have make statement to this place because like you i respect the house of commons and i respect that we make announcement here but what a contrast to the previous conservative government they have to be drag here to make statement their last king ’s speech be threadbare the pinnacle of their ambition be to ban pedicab in london and they be not do much well now be they mr speaker hardly any of they turn up to debate they be barely here for pmq although i do not blame they for that they be a zombie government and be not the truth that they be a zombie opposition now 
 i recently meet my constituent becky who be profoundly disabled after her mother be give primodos a hormone base pregnancy test that be popular in the 60 and 70 and take by roughly pregnant woman it be directly link to miscarriage and severe birth defect in a study commission by the university of oxford in will my right hon friend make time for a full debate on this scandal or join i in call for a full public inquiry 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue i be hugely sympathetic to family who have suffer from hormone pregnancy test she will be aware that baroness cumberlege ’s independent review highlight the healthcare system ’s failure to listen to patient concern around those test she will also be aware that the causal link have be review many time but i will ensure that minister get back to she with a full update 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as member of parliament we have many issue that demand our attention but few that can be more important than ensure child be well feed with healthy nutritious food i be sure that member across the house wish that all family be able to provide that every day for their child but we must face the tragic reality that many   child go hungry in government the liberal democrats be proud to introduce universal free school meal for infant we ensure that every child could access a healthy lunch each day because when child go hungry they make less progress and have poor behaviour and health outcome 
 a free school lunch may be the only healthy cook food that some child get or even their only meal of the day that be shameful in a country such as england that be why we have table amendment to the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill that would increase the after- tax threshold for free school meal to £ a year expand eligibility for free school meal to a further child we be also committed to introduce auto enrolment for those who be eligible for free school meal ensure that child be automatically consider eligible when their parent apply for relevant benefit or financial support 
 do the leader of the house agree that no child should go hungry in and will she ask the government to embrace cross party work to support the liberal democrats long stand call for free school meal when the child ’s wellbeing and schools bill return to parliament next week 
 i thank the hon lady for raise such an important issue which be of great concern to she and many other in the house i be sure that in the come day not just with tomorrow ’s private member ’s bill but with the day of debate on the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill we will have plenty of time to debate these sort of issue in the house 
 free school meal eligibility should be look at in the round that be why this government be develop a child poverty strategy which include free school meal in the meantime the hon lady will be aware that we be roll out free breakfast club in school because she be right that have a meal inside a child can stop they feel hungry but it can also help they to learn concentrate and do well at school that be why we be committed to those free breakfast club and to our child poverty taskforce which will also look at free school meal 
 this sunday mark disabled access day and the importance of accessibility and inclusiveness for all sadly disabled people in luton south and south bedfordshire can not access luton station because of the delay and failure of network rail in progress the access for all programme and instal lift at luton station will the leader of the house grant a debate in government time on how our plan for great british railways will improve infrastructure and ensure reliable affordable and importantly accessible train service for everybody 
 i be sorry to hear of the frustration and problem that my hon friend ’s constituent have have with station accessibility which get raise with i in business question regularly the government be commit to improve it they be difficult challenge and the rail minister be actively consider the good approach to the access for all programme but i will ensure that he have hear her question and that she get a full reply

 will the leader of the house join i in wish jewish people everywhere chag purim sameach and all hindus happy holi 
 i thank the chair of the backbench business committee as ever he have announce a number of important debate that will be popular among hon member on issue such as thames water and as have be raise with i a number of time include recently pelvic mesh and valproate may i join he in the advice he give to hon member and also in wish those celebrate purim and holi the good of time this week

 i join my hon friend in thank all those who run the pebble brook community cafe and all the vital work that they do perinatal mental health be a really important issue that people have come to know about more in recent year i be a long stand supporter   of the day campaign and the importance that that bring that be why we be so focused on the early year and some of the issue that my hon friend raise and i think that would make an excellent topic for a westminster hall debate 
 as a believer in parliamentary democracy i fully support the government ’s right not to exploit shale gas deposit in the uk on environmental ground however may we have an urgent statement from the appropriate net minister on the government ’s decision from next week to start fill in and put permanently beyond use the exist shale gas facility in this country rather than keep they in reserve for an emergency should a future government ever need to exploit they 
 may i thank the right hon gentleman for agree with the government that we should not exploit fracke that be in our manifesto and we be committed to not do fracke i will ensure that minister update he on those matter as they have be do come regularly to the house we have have a number of statement from ministers from the department for energy security and net who be keen to update the house as and when however i will ensure the right hon gentleman be update on that particular issue 
 the prolonged time that the disclosure and barring service take to check the many applicant for work in vital public service in education health and social care be impact ten of thousand of people across the uk indeed many applicant have have offer of work retract due to the significant delay they have experience will the leader of the house allow a debate in government time to address that critical issue 
 dbs check be an important part of many public service job and it be disappointing to hear of the delay that my hon friend ’s constituent have face in fact those delay have be raise with i previously minister be keen to hold the dbs to account where standard be not be meet so i will raise the matter with minister my hon friend should be aware that in some circumstance his constituent can request a hardship escalation where the delay be affect job application 
 may we have an early debate in government time on the ending of the radio teleswitch upon which many people who rely on electric heating and storage heating depend it be last debate in an adjournment debate on   december that spawn a ministerial roundtable on   february which promise further update but none have be forthcoming with just over day to go it would be good to know that there be a sense of urgency in government 
 i strongly hear what the right hon member say about the impending deadline and i be sorry if this house have not be keep as up to date as it should have be i will make inquiry and ensure that he and the rest of the house be keep update 
 in recent week many of my constituent have share their concern about the consett empire reduce its opening hour the empire be a real cultural centre of the community that make art accessible to local people and provide a hub to help combat loneliness i continue to speak with officer staff and trade union about the empire but can we have a debate in government time on what we can do to ensure that venue like the consett empire stay open and thrive 
 i be sorry to hear what be happen to the consett empire in my hon friend ’s constituency i agree with she that music venue and cultural hub like that be vital to our high street community and the cultural offer that we all want to see the government be commit to ensure that we maintain such asset but i will ensure that she get an update on this particular issue 
 i be concerned that the department for work and pensions have confirm that there be a backlog of more than pension credit claim still to process that be in spite of assurance from the minister in october that extra staff have be deploy at the point of the chancellor ’s announcement to scrap the winter fuel payment a further staff follow that announcement and in january it be announce that another staff would be recruit by my calculation that be staff and the backlog still remain will the leader of the house make government time for a debate or statement so that we can understand what be go on with the backlog i be concerned that pensioner be still wait for pension credit and winter fuel payment at a time when they desperately need they the winter be still not over 
 the right hon member will know that we see an increase in claim and the late statistic show a increase in successful pension credit application which i be sure be something she will welcome we have deploy an additional staff to process application and there have be a huge increase there which be to be welcome she will know that for any successful application the money will be backdate to the day the person apply for it so they will get that but i will ensure that the house be keep up to date

 an issue that be personal to i and to many of my constituent be parkinson ’s and world parkinson ’s day take place on   april   every year i pay tribute to parkinson ’s uk for all it do to support people with parkinson ’s research suggest that personal independence payment assessor do not have sufficient understanding of the fluctuation in symptom that people with parkinson ’s experience consequently people with parkinson ’s be deny much need support in fact in almost every instance in which parkinson ’s uk ’s expert social security adviser have assist a member of the parkinson ’s community to challenge an initial pip decision it have be overturn in the claimant ’s favour as such can we have a debate in government time on support people live with parkinson ’s and other degenerative condition and about the social security support available to they 
 i join my hon friend in thank parkinson ’s uk for its work he be absolutely right i be sure that every single of we will as constituency mps recognise the challenge for pip assessor in properly assess those with fluctuating and chronic illness it be vital that those assess access to benefit have the necessary training and understanding of chronic condition such as parkinson ’s i will ensure that minister keep he and the house update on that 
 dundee university in my constituency have of the world ’s lead life science department but it face a significant deficit that be be compound by nearly £ of employer national insurance contribution may we have a statement from a treasury minister as soon as possible and might a pause be put in place for establishment face serious financial difficulty that will be seriously compound by the rise in employer national insurance contribution
