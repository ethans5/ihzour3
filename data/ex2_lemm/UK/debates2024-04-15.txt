 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent progress his department have make on reduce net migration 
 i put on record my condolence for your loss mr speaker 
 the government have implement a number of measure to reduce net migration those include restrict overseas student from bring family dependant to the uk while they study stop overseas care worker from bring family dependant increase the salary threshold for skilled worker visa ultimately to £ and increase the minimum income requirement for family visa we recognise that level of migration have be too high and upon my appointment i immediately take action to bring those figure down 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer but of the main driver of immigration over the past year or so have be labour shortage cause by fall birth rate accord to projection by philip pilkington and paul morland if birth rate do not increase immigration will have to rise to over a of the population over the next year if we be go to maintain a sufficient working age population immigration on this scale have no democratic consent and obviously my right hon friend have promise repeatedly to reduce net migration so what discussion have he have with colleague in the treasury about this issue do he agree that the government must have a strategy to address fall birth rate to ensure that we do not always have to rely on ever increase rate of immigration 
 my hon friend make an important point birth rate be drive by myriad social and economic factor which i have to concede be beyond my control but i have speak with my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer about relate issue and recognise that gdp per capita be an important metric as be overall gdp we be ensure that we invest in a british workforce my right hon friend the education secretary be passionate about apprenticeship and lifelong learning we want to be a high skilled high income economy rather than a low skilled mass migration economy that remain the government ’s priority and we be take action through our immigration policy to reflect that desire 
 trhas teklehaimanot tesfay be of the elite female cyclist choose to lead ridelondon next month she be also an asylum seeker live in a hotel in my constituency where the food be so bad it make she sick and unable to compete last month an investigation by sustain find food for asylum seeker that be undercooked past its sell by date and infest with insect which in some case leave they malnourished and hospitalise could the secretary   of state investigate this scandal and the responsibility of the contractor clearsprings so that asylum seeker   such as trhas be not subject to such dangerous and degrading condition 
 mr speaker i can assure you the hon gentleman and the house that our contractor be expect to maintain standard and where they fall below those standard they will be hold to account i will absolutely take note of the case that the hon gentleman have raise 
 i welcome the measure my right hon friend have take to tackle the level of legal migration but could he inform i what assessment he have make of the expect impact of the new immigration salary list and what impact that will have on the net migration figure 
 my hon friend be at the frontline of our fight against illegal migration but legal migration be important we have recognise that for a number of reason the figure have be too high in the most recent couple of year and i have list measure we have take the combined impact of that be that by our estimation under the new regime that i have put in place people who would previously have be eligible will no long be eligible that be the order of magnitude of change that we will eventually see once these proposal be fully implement 
 the refusal to allow care worker from overseas to bring a spouse with they come at the same time as in cumbria we be find it impossible to fill at least a of all the social care job would the home secretary explain to constituent of mine who be unable to find people to care for they and their loved one why it seem sensible to make the life of people from overseas so miserable in come over here to care for our love one that they do not come at all 
 i recognise that in rural community recruitment and retention of staff be difficult and in the hon member ’s constituency a wonderful beautiful but very rural constituency there be particular pressure i can assure he that the global supply of potential care worker be very significant actually the issue about where in the country those people work be more about the internal dynamic within the uk economy than the quantum of people around the world who would seek to work in the uk there be plenty of people who would wish to work here recognise that they be not allow to bring their dependant with they but the issue of where in the country those people work be actually a broad issue 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the cruel conservative hike to the visa minimum income threshold have cause deep distress deep deep distress to many do the home secretary understand the pain that these change have cause and what message do he believe it send out to those who would do we the honour of make their home in these island that he put such a high price on love and family life 
 it be absolutely right that any nation in the world put conditionality on the people it accept within its own border this country have a long stand tradition in fact i be a product of this as be the prime minister the business and trade secretary and many other in the government of be open and welcoming however when we see the order of magnitude of legal migration that we have see over the last couple of year it be incumbent on we to take action we have make it clear what action we will take and we have give notice of the change so that people can make their plan accordingly when there be special case there be a special case exemption so that we can both control immigration and do our moral duty to protect those people who seek our protection and be an attractive place for people to come and work 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the level of funding allocate to the safe street fund 
 since we have support project through our safe street fund and the safety of woman at night fund invest over £ include £ that have be designate to merseyside the objective of the fund be to improve public protection particularly that of woman particularly at night and independent evaluation show that it be more than achieve its objective 
 i do not think the minister answer the question about the impact of the reduction merseyside have now receive a combine reduction of £ to our safe street fund in round our police and crime commissioner emily spurrell have call this ill consider and short sighted because project have already begin and delivery be under way but the funding have be restrict yet again so will the minister agree today to   reinstate the lost funding so that merseyside police and other can continue their great work keep our street safe 
 may i just gently tell the hon lady that in the last round of funding round merseyside receive £ through the safe street fund that be quadruple what it have receive in round and over half a of that be designate specifically to cctv and street lighting in liverpool city centre round should be see in the context of record funding to the merseyside police who receive an unprecedented uplift of £ a uplift i be confident that merseyside will still be able to deliver its scheme include the safe home card provide safe transport to help woman get home from nightspot in this round 
 in essex the police fire and crime commissioner roger hirst have use the safe street money to pay for cctv and safety measure in the bunny walks to pay for safety improvement around chelmsford prison to keep resident safe and more recently for cctv camera in central park and the avenues and extra safety measure around the cathedral despite all this the local lib dems want to take credit for all of roger ’s work so will the home secretary pop down to chelmsford to come and see i and roger and make sure we say thank you to roger for all he have do with this government money to keep people safe 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question she be correct roger hirst have an exceptional track record as a police and crime commissioner he have do outstanding work drive down antisocial behaviour and domestic burglary and the example she give be exactly what the safe street fund be for bespoke local dedicated service that will improve public protection i know that essex police have high number than at any point in their year history and i will certainly urge the home secretary to pay they a visit at the next available opportunity 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker and on behalf of the whole shadow home affairs team may i place on record our sincere condolence on the loss of your father 
 follow the horrific killing of kulsuma akter in bradford who be tragically stab to death in broad daylight while push her year old son in a pram west yorkshire and greater manchester police have refer themselves for investigation because of prior contact with kulsuma and her husband who have since be arrest for her murder case of multiple contact with the police before violent escalation be all too common labour will mandate domestic abuse and wide violence against woman and girl training for every police officer in the country and we will introduce raneem ’s law to overhaul the police response when report be make so i ask the minister how many more woman will have to die before the government can do the same 
 the hon lady be right to mention the case of kulsuma akter what happen to she be appalling i obviously can not comment on any specific   in relation to the case but the hon lady will know that the bail condition that the perpetrator have be release under contain restriction that be breach themselves so it be not a case of the court refuse to apply condition he breach they in relation to her wide point of course every single of these case be a tragedy she will know because we have work on a cross party basis in the past how much time and attention we dedicate to this at the home office but i simply say this we now have domestic abuse training that have be roll out to over of force and the home secretary and i be work very closely with the outstanding one they be on a timetable for delivery i want to reassure the hon lady of that and we now this month have train rape specialist in every single police force in england and wales 
 what recent assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the level of the security threat from china 
 i thank my hon friend enormously for raise this question let i be clear that the hostile activity we have see from chinese authority and state affiliate group pose a serious threat to the security and wellbeing of the british people and to our partner and ally across the world the deputy prime minister come to this chamber last month to speak about the pattern of malign activity include the targeting of our parliamentarian and malicious cyber campaign by chinese state affiliate actor we must never be afraid to stand up for ourselves and to call out this kind of activity that have target both my hon friend and i 
 mr speaker may i add my personal condolence to you on the loss of your father 
 i say to my right hon friend that we have the scandal of the hacking of mps email account back in march and we subsequently learn that the fbi inform our government as well as foreign government who have legislator who be affect about these incident year ago why have it take year for we to be tell about a serious security breach will he now with his colleague in cabinet make sure that china be absolutely treat and label as a threat not just an epoque define systemic challenge and everything be do urgently to put china in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme 
 my hon friend who have give this house and our country exceptional service over many year and who will sadly be stand down at the next election have again make some strong point on the he know the language that i use and he have hear the word i have say the reality be that we face threat from around the world and many of they sadly be emerge out of beijing today we know it we have see it and many of we in this house feel it it be not something we be shy away from the reality however be that there be many different way of answer it he have raise an important aspect on firs which of course be be look at but he will have hear the   word of the deputy prime minister in this chamber only a few week ago and how clearly he make himself hear 
 i be sorry but i be not convince by the government ’s attitude on this when the deputy prime minister come to see we a few week ago he do not say anything new he announce thing about event that happen year ago the security minister himself know of attempt by the chinese government to undermine the work of the foreign affairs committee of this house why be we only ever tell about thing that happen year ago if we be to take these issue seriously we surely have to have an up to date and present account of the activity of the chinese state 
 the hon member will well know that when there be a reason to act quickly and draw something to the attention of the house we do as be the case with christine lee which he will remember involve the payment of money to a certain member of this house the reason we take that action be because we need to expose it fast 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner say last year that our policing and security service be technologically vulnerable because of their use of chinese make equipment include cctv drone and body camera can the minister say whether the digital asbestos of chinese make technology be still use in our policing and security infrastructure yes or no 
 my friend the hon member will know well that the work of fraser sampson before he retire or end his mandate last year have be fantastically important to many of we in make sure digital asbestos i approve of the term be get out of our institution this be something that be ongoing it have get out of the most secure site already but there be other area where there be work to do because an awful lot of site buy technology that would now be problematic it be not just static site there be potential that some electric vehicle could be easily turn into mobile intelligence gather platform by hostile state so it be about look not simply at the past but at the future 
 what recent progress his department have make on return illegal migrant to their home country 
 in we deliver a strong removal performance with overall return back to pre covid level in total be return an increase of at an average of remove every week last year 
 i be grateful to the minister for his response can he update the house on how his department be prioritise the return of foreign national offender to their home country to keep the street and community of the united kingdom safe 
 may i pay tribute to my hon friend and the work that go on in his constituency as he know i visit gatwick recently and see for myself the good work of the border force team there he will be pleased to know that removal of foreign national offender be up last year by we be committed to the removal of foreign criminal and those with no right to be in the united kingdom 
 on that point i sadly see many asylum seeker in newport who be stick in limbo due to this government ’s incompetence however can i draw the minister ’s attention to the case of a man in newport who lie about his name and country of origin and be a convict sex offender who have breach the term of his licence the court want he return home he want to return home and will even pay for his flight but for some unfathomable reason the home office seem incapable of authorise or allow that it have be year why 
 the removal increase last year it be interesting to note that opposition member include the leader of the labour party have campaign to ensure they be prevent the deportation of foreign criminal those on the government benches be determined to see foreign criminal remove and there be an increase in removal of last year 
 i call the shadow minister 
 under successive conservative government since return of fail asylum seeker have collapse by and return of foreign national offender have fall by almost over the same period for all the government ’s tough talk only of those arrive on small boat since have be return anywhere yet minister be still resist labour ’s plan for a new return and enforcement unit to ensure the swift removal of those with no right to be here meanwhile over the weekend more people cross the channel in small boat than will be cover in the entire year of the government ’s fail rwanda scheme will the minister stop the headline chase gimmick and instead commit to set out his plan for the of people currently stick in the asylum system who will never be send to rwanda 
 the fact of the matter be that nearly foreign national offender be return between january and december the fact of the matter be that opposition member include the leader of the labour party have campaign to prevent the deportation of foreign criminal while government member welcome an increase of with an average of people be remove every single week 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of neighbourhood policing level 
 what step he have take to increase police visibility in local community 
 what step he have take to increase police visibility in local community 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of neighbourhood policing level 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of neighbourhood policing level 
 what step he have take to increase police visibility in local community 
 i be happy to remind the house that last year we reach record number of police officer in excess of which be over more than at the previous peak under the last labour government in term of local policing we achieve as of march last year 
 under this government neighbourhood police officer have disappear since and have yet to be replace on the frontline give the government ’s proclivity for lift labour ’s policy may i gently encourage the minister to adopt labour ’s plan to recruit new neighbourhood police officer allow for a name contactable officer in every ward in the country 
 the hon member be use figure that go up to of course the reason he be use figure that be year out of date be that the number have go up since then if we take neighbourhood policing as a whole we see an increase of from in the year he mention to i be surprised that he be not join i in welcome that 
 antisocial behaviour have be a big problem in holyhead almost £ of uk government safe street funding have be use for cctv improve lighting self defence training for local woman and girl deliver crime prevention pack and outreach work will the minister join i in thank chief inspector robert rands pc lisa thomas and many other who work so hard to improve the life of people who live and work in holyhead 
 i certainly join my hon friend in thank those officer as well as countless thousand of other around the country who do such good work on asb in addition to the safe street money that she mention from the beginning of this month we have an extra £ of funding for antisocial behaviour hotspot patrolling every single of england and wales ’s police force will get that and that will make an enormous difference in combat the scourge of asb 
 do the minister agree that get extra officer out in our community should be top of the list for any police and crime commissioner unfortunately in durham we see that the labour pcc be more interested in increase her back office staff and oversee a decline in standard with the late police effectiveness efficiency and legitimacy report show area require improvement for the time ever   in durham do he agree that the soon we get an ex beat cop in place such as the conservative candidate rob potts the soon durham will return to be an outstanding police force 
 i completely agree spend money on thing such as flowerbed and diversity staff instead of frontline police officer be the wrong priority former frontline officer such as rob potts run for pcc in durham will do a good job of get priority straight 
 kulsuma akter from oldham be murder by her estranged husband on a busy bradford street in the middle of the day in front of their baby son research have repeatedly show that regular foot patrol especially in crime hotspot lead to reduce offending and increase public confidence particularly if combine with community base prevention greater manchester police and west yorkshire police want to learn lesson from this tragic murder what lesson have the home secretary learn about reduce neighbourhood policing and the prevalence of such appalling crime 
 that be a tragic case and we will study any finding by the independent office for police conduct very carefully the hon lady mention hotspot patrolling i mention in a previous answer that the government be provide £ this financial year on top of the regular police funding settlement to fund hotspot patrolling which may help in such situation to repeat a previous point local policing number have go up by about since selectively quote figure that be year old do nothing to help public debate 
 halesowen police station be under threat of closure thank to decision take by the labour west midland police and crime commissioner tom byrne the conservative candidate for pcc say that he will stop that closure programme do the minister agree with i and tom byrne that keep halesowen police station open be critical for community confidence and for the effectiveness of neighbourhood police 
 i agree very strongly the labour pcc ’s police station closure plan in the west midland be shocking this year west midlands police be get an extra £ a increase and well above the rate of inflation tom byrne would do an excellent job of make sure that that maintain frontline service which be exactly how that money should be spend 
 northumbria police force have lose officer and £ from its budget since even after the uplift it will remain officer short compare with level will the minister support the call from northumbria ’s pcc kim mcguinness for further investigation into police resource as clearly not all area of the country have benefit equally from the uplift programme 
 i be pleased to tell the house that for this financial year which start just a couple of week ago northumbria force ’s funding have go up by £ a increase and more than double the rate of inflation the resource be there but use those resource   wisely be a matter for police and crime commissioner conservative police and crime commissioner tend to spend those resource most wisely 
 what step his department be take to help tackle violence against shop worker 
 violence and abuse towards shop worker be not and will never be acceptable last october the police publish a retail crime action plan which the government have embrace and enhance last week we launch the fight retail crime action plan which include a commitment to create a new offence of assault a retail worker as the sector have be call for 
 last week i meet a shopkeeper in hounslow who have be repeatedly target by shoplifter the family who own the shop can not afford security guard or to lose a large amount of stock unlike the big chain it be welcome that the government have finally back labour ’s year campaign along with the union of shop distributive and allied workers and other campaigner to introduce a stand alone offence of assault against a shop worker but will the minister go far and scrap the unfair £ minimum which leave offender get away with impunity 
 shoplifting be still a criminal offence irrespective of the financial value of what be take we have make a clear commitment to ensure that shopkeeper be protect and that the retail environment be safe that be why we have put in place fund to put more police officer on the street and why as my right hon friend   the member for croydon south chris philp   just mention neighbourhood police number be up we have commit the police to pursue all reasonable line of inquiry and i be proud that we have put in place a specific criminal offence of assault against a retail worker 
 for our high street to thrive people need to perceive they as safe place to be but there be real concern that the mayor of london be fail to get the met to take retail crime seriously enough do my right hon friend agree that we need a new mayor for london susan hall to ensure we have more effective policing on our high street 
 quite frankly the mayor of london have be a massive disappointment when it come to the policing of london the met be the only police force in the country to see its police number reduce it have fail to meet its recruitment target quite frankly londoner deserve well 
 as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on retail crime i welcome the announcement as i be sure will shop worker everywhere when will the announcement   be operationalise and what be the monitoring process so that we can all judge whether they be not just word but action 
 the hon gentleman make an important point we be put the change through as amendment to the criminal justice bill the soon it make its passage through the house the quick we can put these specific change in place but we be not wait for that we have have conversation with police force to ensure there be visible police on our high street and that they respond to every reasonable line of inquiry send a signal to retailer and potential criminal that we take this issue incredibly seriously and that the police will respond to this important type of crime 
 i realise the home secretary may be sick of hear from i about assault on retail worker but i welcome the huge and comprehensive package announce last week to support they will my right hon friend implement the measure as quickly as possible to benefit retail worker across stockton south and the rest of the country 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who have campaign vigorously on this issue and meet i on a number of occasion to go through the specific of the proposal work closely with the secretary of state for justice my right hon and learn friend   the member for cheltenham alex chalk to ensure that both the police response and the criminal response send a very clear deterrent to those who may be tempt to assault retail worker it be not acceptable and we will take action 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in january the government vote down our late attempt to introduce a stand alone offence tackle violence against retail worker continue a pattern of year of fail to address this issue while such violence reach epidemic proportion last week surprise surprise they u turn and an offence be now to follow when will the government follow that up by steal the other idea they keep deny a restoration of neighbourhood policing which be down between and not the response officer they have be talk about but proper neighbourhood policing and get rid of the £ limit 
 member should recognise that just because a clause might have a similar sound name it do not mean it be the same the simple truth of the matter be that the opposition clause be deficient in many way the clause that we will put forward in the criminal justice bill will address the issue on local policing the hon lady should recognise that there have be a uplift 
 what step his department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour 
 last year we launch the antisocial behaviour action plan back by £ worth of   funding and over hour of police and other uniformed patrol undertake to target antisocial behaviour hotspot extend to every single police force in england and wales we ban nitrous oxide increase fine for fly tipping litter and graffiti and be strengthen power to tackle antisocial behaviour through the criminal justice bill that be make its way through the house 
 of the aspect of antisocial behaviour that really annoy my constituent be persistent cannabis smoking by people in their own home particularly but not exclusively in block of flat when i raise the matter with the police they tell i that they be not go to go into people ’s home and deal with it i do not think that that be good enough do the home secretary 
 the police should take action when there be credible reporting of criminal behaviour i have have this conversation with police leader from area around the country and it be a conversation that we will continue to have with the police people need not only to be safe but to feel safe in their community and in their home 
 my condolence to you mr speaker 
 protester who recently create an obnoxious stunt outside the home of the leader of the opposition belong in jail as do the trust fund vandal who cause ten of thousand of pound worth of damage outside the ministry of defence last week the truth be that frontline politician of any political hue and our military personnel be prepared to put themselves forward to serve and protect this country which be of course a concept that the vandal would know nothing about when it come to this type of antisocial behaviour will my right hon friend consider increase visibility at high profile location such as those that i have mention 
 my right hon and learn friend have raise a couple of point it be completely unacceptable to try to intimidate parliamentarian whatever their political hue and i will stand shoulder to shoulder with they regardless of their political party in defend their right to do and say what they believe to be in the good interest of their country and their community without fear of intimidation that be an absolute red line and it will be enforce secondly these petulant act of vandalism in the name of protest be unacceptable when criminal damage occur it will be pursue and in the criminal justice bill we be take specific action to remove the veneer of a defence that criminal behaviour be somehow justify because people be not get their way at the ballot box 
 too many resident in nottingham south tell i that antisocial behaviour be make their life a misery they never see a bobby walk the street and under the lawbreaking tory police and crime commissioner nottinghamshire police have be place in special measure with his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service say that the force be let victim down my constituent tell i that they will be vote for labour ’s gary godden on   may in order to   rebuild neighbourhood policing and adopt a tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour they be right be they not 
 they would be very wrong if they vote labour expect that that would increase a police presence across the country we have see over and over again that the well perform police area be typically control by conservative police and crime commissioner i know the situation in nottinghamshire very well and i have speak directly to its police and crime commissioner who have a clear plan of action to ensure that she continue to put police officer on the frontline labour run police force in the area have be sadly lack in that regard 
 follow an increase in antisocial behaviour in tunstall i be proud to work with more than local resident to gain support for new cctv new alley gate and well street lighting through the safe street fund however when i meet the labour leader of stoke on trent city council she tell i that there would be no money for tunstall and to make matter bad she have dump some undesirable in the sneyd arms hotel in the town centre which have lead to further criminal activity that be blight high street store throughout our community do the home secretary agree with i that thank god ben adams staffordshire ’s police fire and crime commissioner be listen and ensure that we receive that safe street fund so that those in our community would feel safe and that people should vote for ben on   may 
 i could hardly have put it well myself i recently visit the wonderful town of stoke and see the passion of its people this be a classic example of local leadership in the hand of the labour party fail people and local leadership in the hand of conservatives defend they 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of introduce a visa scheme for palestinian refugee 
 we be all concerned about the plight of those live in gaza currently we be not consider establish a separate route for palestinians in any humanitarian situation the uk must consider its resettlement approach in the round rather than on a crisis by crisis basis 
 it be not surprising that the upper tribunal find the decision to require biometric datum for people from gaza to be irrational and unreasonable because most of we find that to apply to most decision make by the home office be it not also irrational and unreasonable for the united kingdom to offer humanitarian visa to people catch up in the conflict in ukraine syria and afghanistan but not to offer such visa to people flee the conflict in gaza 
 i will not give a running commentary on ongoing litigation but i can say that we be support british national with dependant in gaza to get those individual out of gaza safely work in collaboration   with foreign office colleague there be also mark difference at play here of course the right of return be fundamental as part of effort towards a state solution and other factor be at play in respond to the ukrainian situation the dynamic be very different which directly affect the relationship we have with the ukrainian government particularly in respect of the ability to carry out check on individual 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 gaza families reunited ’s petition for a palestinian family visa scheme have garner signature and i hope it will soon be debate in parliament gazan be stick in a cruel and irrational catch-22 situation they can not cross the border to egypt because they do not have visa as they can not get their biometric register but they can not get their biometric register because they can not get to a visa application centre in egypt the government have the power to waive the requirement for biometric to be register and it be in the minister ’s hand to do so why will not he 
 the hon lady will appreciate that the security of the system be imperative we must act in accordance with the requirement which we put front and centre i will not comment on ongoing litigation but i can say that we will continue to work with foreign office colleague in the way that we have describe element of the peace process be at play in relation to these issue but we will keep our response to this crisis under review as matter develop 
 what progress he have make on reduce the number of asylum seeker accommodate in hotel 
 what progress his department have make on close asylum hotel 
 the home office have be clear that the use of hotel be a temporary and short term measure to ensure that we meet our statutory obligation to accommodate destitute asylum seeker we have make significant progress in close over asylum hotel as of the end of march our action mean that there be over few asylum seeker in hotel today compare with month ago 
 do the minister ’s ambition extend to close all the hotel 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right that the government ’s ambition be to close the hotel we close by the end of march and we be work towards close by may fundamentally the objective be to alter the way in which people be accommodate and to introduce more cost effective and appropriate approach but also to reduce the flow of people come into this country illegally which be the very good way of alleviate the pressure 
 i welcome all the effort that my hon friend be make to deal with and speed up the asylum process however will he outline what measure he consider when decide which hotel to close in each tranche 
 my right hon friend will recognise that value for money be a critical consideration that inform hotel closure decision as be operational deliverability and the notice period on contract it be also about recognise the need in particular location and the challenge that these site present we have a plan we be closing hotel and we will continue to deliver on precisely what we promise 
 for almost year the sandpiper hotel in chesterfield have be use as a hotel for asylum seeker the north derbyshire refugee support group have tell i that not a single person who have stay there have be ask to go back to their country in fact the vast majority of they have have their application approve which undermine the government ’s suggestion that all these asylum seeker be not entitle to be here actually the government approve the vast majority of application so their approach be a waste of money why do the government continue to fail in this way for the minister to celebrate the extraordinary usage of hotel just because it be diminish slightly be hopeless when will we get the sandpiper back in public use 
 i think it be interesting that a labour insider say to the times last week 
 we need a viable answer to what we ’d do differently other than just smash the gang 
 and that 
 we can not currently say how we be go to tackle the demand side of the issue 
 they be absolutely right i suspect we will be wait a very long time for the answer that go right to the heart of the point that the hon gentleman raise he say that we ought to be close the hotel but it be only this government that have a credible plan to do just that 
 mr speaker may i pass on the condolence of myself and my party on the death of your father we know you love your father and we know that your father love you 
 when it come to reduce the number of asylum seeker i want to suggest option to the minister that we could certainly do in strangford for those people who be in hotel there be company in my constituency that wish to employ they and to give they accommodation at the same time if we want to help the asylum seeker in the hotel in my constituency and in the consistency adjoin mine then let they get the job and let they get the accommodation 
 while i be always very willing to engage with the hon gentleman he will appreciate that the difficulty that we have in respect of that approach be the pull factor that it would present it would potentially encourage people to make dangerous journey via small boat to get to the uk we do not want to do anything that play into the business model of the evil criminal gang responsible for that miserable trade what we   want to do be put they out of business on the wide accommodation point i be very happy to engage with the hon gentleman 
 in middlesbrough have the high ratio of asylum seeker per head of population of anywhere in england i welcome the closure of hotel but i worry about report in today ’s daily mail that the home office be buy up large amount of property in some of the poor area of england which risk take we back to the situation we see in will the minister reassure i that that be not the case because my constituent be clear that that place an unacceptable strain on the community and indeed an unhappy strain on community cohesion 
 my right hon friend be a strong supporter of the work the government be do to get a well grip on the flow of people come across to our country who inevitably need accommodate while they be here we have a mixture of accommodation to meet those need and get the number down be critical to be able to reduce that dependence i be able to say however that we be not actively pursue procurement in the local authority cite in the article that my right hon friend reference and that include middlesbrough 
 my sincere condolence mr speaker 
 the government promise some considerable time ago that a hotel use in my constituency would no long be use to house those seek asylum that be not the case it have almost become de facto permanent could the minister speak to i not necessarily on the floor of the house but separately and give i an assurance that there will be a manage closure of that facility 
 what i can not do on the floor of the house be make commitment about specific hotel but i would be very happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss this what he could do to help i with this particular challenge be to get behind the work that the government be do to reduce the flow of people come to the uk which fundamentally and crucially would help we to be able to close hotel such as the in his constituency 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we have increase the volume of asylum case process we successfully meet a ministerial commitment to close over asylum seeker hotel by january and we have close over by the end of march 
 last year i bring forward measure to make legal migration fairer and to radically reduce the number people who come to the uk last year would not now be eligible to do so anyone who want to bring a family from abroad must be able comfortably to support they financially 
 in the budget the government put forward £ to roll out violence reduction unit and hotspot police across england and wales and £ for technology that will save the police time and money and make sure that police officer be on the frontline do the job that they be recruit to do 
 may i add my condolence mr speaker 
 my right hon friend will be aware that police number in essex be at record level and that overall crime be down however there have be a rise in vehicle theft will he therefore welcome the effort of our excellent police fire and crime commissioner roger hirst in establish a steal vehicle intelligence unit that have so far recover £ worth of vehicle will he look at what further support can be give to roger hirst to tackle this crime 
 my right hon friend be right to highlight the fantastic work of roger hirst and the steal vehicle intelligence unit a number of large scale seizure have be make against attempt vehicle export the government have reduce vehicle relate crime by since and we seek to go far through the criminal justice bill we want to see more innovative approach like the take by roger hirst which be why i be very proud to campaign alongside he he have do fantastic work to protect the people of essex 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 mr speaker i remember the kindness that your father show i and our long discussion on rugby league i add my condolence 
 the hillsborough tragedy be year ago to the hour we remember the who be lose and support the family campaign for a hillsborough law

 the right hon lady will know that we keep our response to iran under constant review and of course we have do so in the light of the attack in wimbledon we do not speculate about future designation or sanction but she will know that the irgc be sanction in its entirety and a number of its member be sanction as individual as she know we will keep this under constant review 
 the home secretary will know that we have raise this many time i understand the complexity of the issue the proscribing legislation be draw up more than year ago to address terrorist threat such as al qaeda rather than state sponsor threat that have both domestic and international security objective our bottom line must be keep this country safe which be why labour have propose new security legislation to allow the government to put appropriately target   proscription style restriction on the operation of state link organisation such as the irgc the government previously resist this but will he look at it again in the light of recent event and work with we on any legislation that be need to keep this country safe 
 we have the national security act and a range of tool at our disposal defence against state threat be of the department ’s priority and my right hon friend the security minister lead on its practical implementation i can reassure the shadow home secretary and the house that we constantly review the range of option at our disposal and deploy those that be most appropriate protect the uk and the people live and work here against state threat will always be a priority of this government 
 will my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire support the excellent initiative of a number of conservative police and crime commissioner to include fill in pothole as part of the community payback initiative for convict offender will he apply pressure on the ministry of justice to get this up and run as soon as possible 
 my hon friend raise an excellent idea that have my enthusiastic support i will do exactly as he ask straightaway

 the former chief inspector of border and immigration recently produce a report state that certificate of sponsorship be grant to a company that use forge document and purport to be a real care home such home office failure clearly leave people at risk of exploitation and modern slavery so what step be the minister take to make the system more robust and to protect vulnerable people who come here to work in our care system 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for that question we respond within the week deadline to that icibi report and accept the recommendation make to we in it we be work through they but work be already in train particularly in collaboration with the care quality commission on well accreditation practice for care provider when we be match people to those visa 
 outdated law be allow child sexual predator and offender to enter or leave our country while in possession of illegal material on their digital device because border force do not have the power to access they will my right hon friend work with his colleague in the ministry of justice to consider the merit of   a new offence of wilful obstruction under which an individual could be prosecute if they fail to unlock their device to allow they to be properly search 
 i thank my hon friend for her work in this area the issue that she raise be of direct importance to intelligence gathering   and child protection my official have be work closely with border force to ensure that its power keep pace with the digital age when the next legislative opportunity arise if not before we will carefully consider give border force power to compel individual to submit to search of their device if they be suspect of hold child sexual abuse material 
 the murder of gracie spinks in chesterfield send shockwave through the town and the report on derbyshire police ’s handling of this desperately unhappy situation be salutary there be still far too much inconsistency in how stalking and violence against woman be handle so will the home secretary back labour ’s plan to bring in mandatory national standard and mandatory training on tackle violence against woman so that we see consistency in police on stalk right across the country 
 i reassure the hon gentleman and the house that under my leadership the home office and police across the uk will maintain its focus on prevent violence against woman and girl we have a roll out of police guidance and training when it come to woman and girl i will listen carefully to the proposal he have put forward because we want to make sure that woman and girl feel safe in this country 
 this government champion fantastic animal welfare standard my constituent would like to see alternative to animal testing wherever possible and would be keen to hear a vital update from the department 
 give that interest be about to switch in this house to a different matter i will be brief i promise to write to my hon friend on this but she should know that this government have already double spending on find alternative to animal testing we will continue to make sure that the inspection regime be as strict as possible to make sure that when animal need to be use the condition be as humane as possible 
 will the home secretary tell we what level of auditing there will be of the hundred of million of pound be send to rwanda in particular will he guarantee that no uk taxpayer cash will either directly or indirectly be use to fund the m23 militia in the democratic republic of the congo 
 all our overseas expenditure whether it be through official development assistance or through contractual relationship such as the one with rwanda be always robustly police to ensure that it be spend exclusively on the issue that it be design to address we have a strong good work relationship with the government of rwanda who be absolutely committed to be the exporter of solution to global problem rather than the exporter of problem 
 the people of romford be angry that they be not get the police cover from the mayor of london that we pay for we be see a crime wave across romford include in gidea park and we have see a stabbing in the town   centre we have have enough will the minister please ensure reform so that essex town such as romford get the service that roger hirst give to the people of the historic county 
 my hon friend be quite right to draw attention to the contrast between the excellent work do by roger hirst in essex and the appalling job be do by sadiq khan in london sadiq khan be the only of the police and crime commissioner to have miss his recruitment target and tragically police officer number be fall in london in contrast to the rest of the country londoner will have a chance to cast their vote on   may and i hope that they kick he out 
 my constituent maysara be a british citizen and his parent live in gaza his parent successfully apply for   visa to visit he in the autumn last year but they be unable to travel after october and their visa expire i contact the home office on maysara ’s behalf to ask if those visa could be extend but i be tell that his parent would have to make new application however there be no function visa application centre in gaza so will the minister explain what exactly my constituent ’s parent should do 
 i be more than happy to look at the detail of the case the hon gentleman have to understand that the circumstance on the ground change dramatically after hamas brutal mass murder rampage on   october and our security posture in the region have have to be enhance i be not make any implication about his constituent ’s family but he and the house will understand that we must be careful in everything we do when it come to accept people who be leave gaza in these circumstance 
 mr speaker before i start i would like to express my deep sympathy and i be sure that of the whole house on the death of your father he be a true giant of not just this house but the other place too 
 i also want to express my solidarity with our australian friend after the horrific and senseless attack in sydney in recent day our thought be with all those affect 
 on saturday evening iran seek to plunge the middle east into a new crisis it launch a barrage of missile and attack drone over iraq and jordan and towards israel the scale of the attack and the fact that it be target directly at israel be without precedent it be a reckless and dangerous escalation if it have succeed the fallout for regional security and the toll on israeli citizen would have be catastrophic but it do not succeed 
 in support of israel ’s own defensive action the united kingdom join a us lead international effort along with france and partner in the region that intercept almost all of the missile save life in israel and its neighbour we send additional raf typhoons to the region as part of our exist operation against daesh in iraq and syria and i can confirm that our force destroy a number of iranian drone we also provide important intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance support for our partner our pilot put themselves in harm ’s way to protect the innocent and preserve peace and stability i speak to the raf early today they be the good of the good and i know that the whole house will join i in express our gratitude 
 with this attack iran have once again show its true colour it be intent on sow chaos in its own backyard on far destabilise the middle east our aim be to support stability and security because that be right for the region and because although the middle east be thousand of mile away it have a direct effect on our security and prosperity at home so we be work urgently with our ally to de escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed we want to see calm head prevail and we be direct all our diplomatic effort to that end 
 yesterday i speak to my fellow g7 leader we be unite in our condemnation of this attack we discuss further potential diplomatic measure which we will be work together to co ordinate in the come day i will also shortly speak to prime minister netanyahu to express our solidarity with israel in the face of this attack and to discuss how we can prevent further escalation all side must show restraint 
 our action reflect our wide strategy in the middle east which i have set out in the house previously i believe there be vital step to put the region on to a well path we must uphold regional security against hostile actor include in the red sea and we must ensure israel ’s security that be non negotiable and a fundamental condition for peace in the region in the face of the threat that we see this weekend israel have our full support 
 secondly we must invest more deeply in the state solution that be what we have be do over the past month include work closely with the palestinian   authority so that when the time come they can provide more effective governance for gaza and the west bank it be significant that other regional partner actually help to prevent a much bad attack over the weekend it remind we how important the attempt to normalise relation between israel and its neighbour really be and they hold out precious hope for the region 
 thirdly the conflict in gaza must end hamas who be back by iran start this war they want not just to kill and murder but to destabilise the whole region this weekend they reject the late hostage deal which offer a road to a ceasefire it be israel ’s right and indeed its duty to defeat the threat from hamas terrorist and defend its security i want to be clear nothing that have happen over the past hour affect our position on gaza the appalling toll on civilian continue to grow the hunger the desperation and the loss of life on an awful scale the whole country want to see an end to the bloodshed and to see more humanitarian support go in the recent increase in aid flow be positive but it be still not enough we need to see new crossing open for long to get in vital supply 
 i want to take this opportunity mr speaker to pay tribute to the british aid worker who be kill in gaza john chapman james kirby and james henderson they be hero the child of gaza whom they be risk their life to feed need a humanitarian pause immediately lead to a long term sustainable ceasefire that be the fast way to get hostage out and aid in and to stop the fighting israelis and palestinians alike deserve to live in peace dignity and security and so do people across the entire region 
 in conclusion saturday ’s attack be the act not of a people but of a despotic regime and it be emblematic of the danger that we face today the link between such regime be grow tel aviv be not the only target of iranian drone on saturday putin be also launch they at kyiv and kharkiv and who be the sole voice speak up for iran yesterday seek to justify its action russia 
 the threat to stability be grow not just in the middle east but everywhere and we be meet those threat time after time with british force at the forefront it be why our pilot be in action this weekend it be why they have be police the sky above iraq and syria for a decade it be why our sailor be defend freedom of navigation in the red sea against the reckless attack of the iran back houthi militia it be why our soldier be on the ground in kosovo estonia poland and elsewhere and it be why we have lead the way in back ukraine and we will continue to back it for as long as it take when adversary such as russia or iran threaten peace and prosperity we will always stand in their way ready to defend our value and our interest shoulder to shoulder with our friend and our ally i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for an advance copy of his statement and for the regular briefing on the develop situation in the middle east i also thank he for his warm tribute to your father mr speaker doug hoyle   be a great servant of our party respect by all who know he i also join the prime minister in offer our solidarity with the victim of the horrific attack in sydney and in recognise the heroism of the british aid worker kill in gaza while work for world central kitchen 
 turn to the event of this weekend we support the defensive action take by the uk alongside our international ally against the iranian attack on israel and we welcome the prime minister ’s call for restraint once again we all salute the professionalism and bravery of our armed force we also support the raf plane be send to the region to bolster operation shader their effort be vital for a safe world 
 there can be no doubt that the attack perpetrate by iranian force this weekend have leave the world a more dangerous place it target innocent civilian with a clear intent to destabilise the region it must be wholly condemn by all but let we also be clear that a full scale conflict in the middle east be in no ’s interest it be a path that can only lead to more bloodshed more instability and the unleashing of force that be beyond the ability of anyone to control 
 the combine defensive action this weekend be a success and because of that life be save as a result escalation be not inevitable in repel the attack israel show strength and courage it must now show the same strength and courage to de escalate that have to be the primary objective and that be the responsibility of all side and every partner we must be resolute and unite in our support for the collective security of israel jordan and other partner in the region 
 but tension remain very high we must proceed calmly carefully and with restraint because if diplomacy take centre stage and it must we also need to be clear that diplomatic premise should not be target and attack that be a point of principle but as the condemnation from our g7 ally rightly note iran ’s response this weekend be unprecedented a further step towards the destabilisation of the region and the risk of escalation nobody in this house should be or be under any illusion this be a regime that sponsor terror across the middle east and beyond that murder and repress its own people and support putin ’s war effort in ukraine so can the prime minister update the house on any new step he be take with our international partner to pursue sanction against the regime and can he clarify what step he be take to limit the power of the revolutionary guard to glorify terrorism here in the uk 
 while there be no justification for iran ’s action we can not be naive to the fact that of the driver of tension in the region be the ongoing war in gaza month on from the horrific hamas terror attack hostage remain separated from their family thousand of innocent palestinians have be kill and now more than a people face the imminent threat of famine so i urge the government again to use every ounce of diplomatic leverage that we have to make sure that aid to gaza be unimpeded and drastically scale up alongside that we reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire for hamas to release hostage and for a return to a diplomatic process that can rekindle the hope of a state solution 
 it be right that we condemn iran ’s action it be right that we work with other to defend the security of our ally and it be right that we seek the end of conflict in gaza but this be a moment for restraint because escalation will only lead to further destruction and for the sake of all those still catch in the horror and violence that must be avoid 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for his support of the government ’s action with regard to what might happen go forward ultimately israel have a right to self defence as any state do the g7 leader speak yesterday and unequivocally condemn iran ’s attack and express full solidarity and support for israel and its people but as the foreign secretary say this morning this be a time to be 
 smart as well as tough 
 israel have incredibly successfully repel the iranian attack and iran be even more isolated on the world stage as other have say we urge israel to take the win at this point we want to avoid further escalation and bloodshed the right hon and learn gentleman be right that that would be deeply destabilising for the region and would risk more life and all our diplomatic effort at this point will be gear towards that goal in partnership with our ally 
 as i have say previously the behaviour of the iranian regime include the action of irgc pose a significant threat to the safety and security of the uk and our ally yesterday at the g7 we agree to work together on further measure to counter the iranian regime and its proxy it be agree that we should co ordinate those action and that work be now under way obviously at the appropriate time i or ministers will update the house as the right hon and learn gentleman will know we have already sanction over iranian individual include the irgc in its entirety we put in place at the end of last year a new sanction regime that give we more extensive power to designate sanction and of course the national security act create new offence for espionage and foreign interference and mean that our security service have the power that they need to deter disrupt and detect threat of a more modern nature from state such as iran 
 lastly with regard to diplomacy for israel and the region we be absolutely committed to a state solution we have be work very hard and use all our effort to bring that about particularly over the past few month by build up the capability of the palestinian authority as i have say so that they have the necessary technical and administrative capability when the moment come for they to provide effective governance in the west bank and gaza it be absolutely my view and that of the government that israelis and palestinians should have the opportunity to live side by side in peace with security dignity and opportunity and i be proud of the role that the united kingdom be play 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 my condolence mr speaker on the loss of your father 
 this remain a dangerous moment yet over the weekend we see a demonstration of unity and purpose we see the depth of will for normalisation and for a secure   future for all people of the middle east restraint be vital if we want to build on the momentum to get hostage home to their family and to get improvement to continue aid but to well protect our people will my right hon friend commit to launch with our ally a new consensus on iran and a new effort with combined diplomatic military and wide expert area to limit the extent of the atrocity of iran we need to end the compartmentalisation of threat when we deal with iran we must deal with it as whether on its nuclear ambitious the arming of the militia femicide or transnational repression only with a new consensus will we see that progress so will he please commit to lead that internationally 
 i can give my hon friend that commitment that be exactly the subject of our discussion among the g7 leader yesterday she mention nuclear iran ’s nuclear programme have never be more advanced than it be today it threaten international peace and security there be absolutely no justification at a civilian level for the enrichment that we be see and which the international atomic energy agency have report in iran i want to reassure she that we be consider next step on the nuclear file with our international partner and we be commit to use all diplomatic tool available to ensure that iran never develop a nuclear weapon include use the snapback mechanism if necessary 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i echo the prime minister in pass on our thought not only to you mr speaker but to the family of the aid worker who have be kill in gaza 
 i condemn the act of violence by the iranian regime they be no more than a cynical attempt to exploit the suffering pain and turmoil be experience by people in palestine right now while we rightly condemn the violent act of iran so too must we condemn the violent act of israel from listen to the interview that he have be give the foreign secretary be correct in his attempt to uphold the principle of proportionality but if fire missile in retaliation for an isolated attack on an embassy be correctly consider disproportionate so too must be israel ’s day bombardment of gaza 
 we know that the agenda in tehran be to bring about as much instability as possible we all have a responsibility to ensure that that do not happen there be not go to be a military solution to the conflict in the middle east there must be a political and diplomatic solution so what be require now be the same as what be require month ago we need de escalation and for the cause of conflict in the region to be review the big continue cause of conflict be the siege of gaza hence the need for a ceasefire can the prime minister outline what he be do to ensure that the ceasefire mandate by the un security council become a reality 
 it be important not to try to draw any equivalence between israel ’s absolute right indeed duty to provide security for its citizen in the face of an appalling terrorist atrocity and what happen over the weekend those thing be not remotely the same   more broadly though as i have say repeatedly from this dispatch box we urge israel to abide by international humanitarian law we have be very clear that too many civilian have be kill and we be deeply concerned about the impact on the civilian population in gaza our diplomatic effort be gear towards alleviate that suffering i will continue to raise those point with prime minister netanyahu when i speak to he but as i have say draw an equivalence between those thing be absolutely not the right thing to do 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 notwithstanding the sheer scale of the iranian attack multi layered air defence prove effective be we ensure that we be pass any learning we have pick up on to ukraine for the use of its own defence and in a more hostile and dangerous world with the ever increase proliferation of missile and drone technology be we review our own air defence asset and capability to support our ally and indeed close to home if ever require 
 i thank my right hon friend for his excellent question he be right about the importance of air defence which be why it have repeatedly be of the key capability that we have seek to provide to ukraine that be something we have lead on for some time ditto some of the new contract that we have place to replenish uk stockpile most recently this year also cover air defence missile more broadly my right hon friend be right that we need to ensure our industrial production here in the uk be gear to produce the capability we need whether for our own use or for ukraine ’s i be pleased to say that the defence secretary be work with the industry to ensure that supply chain be there to meet those need 
 mr speaker i send you and your family our deep condolence on the loss of your father and associate myself and my colleague with the comment of other about the appalling murder in sydney and the death of the aid worker in gaza 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement the liberal democrats join he in condemn iran ’s attack on israel this be an alarming escalation in a conflict that have already see far too many death and far too much suffering we support the action take by the raf to intercept iranian drone as we stand up for israel ’s security 
 we also worry about what prime minister netanyahu and his government will do next the prime minister have rightly say that we must prevent further escalation so do he agree that the good way to achieve that be to press all side to agree to an immediate bilateral ceasefire in gaza to get the hostage home get the aid in and put we on the path to a last peace for a state solution 
 we have repeatedly call for an immediate humanitarian pause so that we can get the hostage out and more aid in and use that as the foundation to build a more lasting and sustainable ceasefire but it be worth point out this have not be mention by colleague so far that hamas yet again have reject another offer to release hostage it be   important that we do not lose sight of that we must have the hostage release as part of any of those conversation and over the weekend it be hamas who yet again reject the late round of those talk 
 i thank my right hon friend for the leadership he have show on this issue and i echo his call for the need to avoid a spiral escalation however we have see a military attack by iran on a nation that its regime believe should not exist at all iran have directly or indirectly engineer a war in gaza with the aim of thwart well relation between arab state especially saudi arabia and israel we now have death and destruction in gaza in a conflict that no can win and where the only beneficiary be iran its proxy and its ally we have see an iranian journalist attack on british soil and we have see an international vessel be pirate by the irgc in international water another vile example of hostage taking so i ask my right hon friend again why be iran air still operate out of heathrow and why be iranian bank still operate in the city of london when will the snapback mechanism be invoke and what can be do to stop the export of iranian oil to russia and other country which be now keep the regime afloat 
 i thank my right hon friend for his leadership on this issue over a consistent period of time and he be right to highlight the threat that iran pose to we i want to reassure he that on all of the area that he mention active work have be undertake by the government as i mention in my statement we discuss yesterday on the g7 call the need for and benefit of co ordinating further measure perhaps include some of the thing that he talk about among ally in order to have maximum impact both on the regime and the ultimate designation of any future sanction i be pleased that our new sanction regime which we implement at the end of last year give we extensive new power i be keen to make sure we use they to good effect but where we can co ordinate those with ally i know he would agree with i that that would be preferable and i can reassure he that that work be happen at pace 
 mr speaker could i too pass on my condolence for the loss of your dad doug i be of those who on many occasion benefit from his wise advice 
 as the prime minister have say there be no moral equivalence between the side in this what be happen in gaza and what happen in the attack by iran on israel but israel have make mistake in the past and should be hold to account for they would the prime minister agree with i that as thing move on the importance of neighbouring state particularly for example jordan be go to be vital in resolve not just the current difficulty but a long term future that bring about a state solution 
 in a word yes i pay tribute to the king of jordan for the leadership role that he have play over the past several month we be fortunate to enjoy a strong work relationship with the jordanians which be on display yet again over this weekend and i commend he and his country for what they have do 
 mr speaker please accept my condolence on the loss of your father 
 week ago i be in israel at the northern border with lebanon of course we have all see what happen this weekend but since   october   iran back hezbollah have fire over rocket into northern israel displace over israeli civilian i meet some of those family they be under siege and they have be uproot but they be brave and defiant in the face of terrorism and antisemitism we have know for year that the islamic revolutionary guard corps be the world ’s chief sponsor of terrorism fund and promote terrorist plot radicalisation and hostage take both in the middle east and at home we have proscribe hamas and we have proscribe hezbollah prime minister why do we not put the uk ’s national security by now proscribe the irgc 
 as my right hon and learn friend know we do not comment on any potential proscription decision but of course we recognise the threat from iran and have take measure to counter it at home and around the world i obviously refer she to my previous answer but i be confident that the police security service and court all have the tool they need to sanction prosecute and mitigate the threat from iran we strengthen our sanction regime recently include sanction the irgc in its entirety 
 despite the call for a ceasefire here in our parliament and from across the international community the war in gaza have rag cost life as well as the kill by the hamas attack and a humanitarian catastrophe that be now turn into a famine for month many have raise concern around the spectre of regional escalation precisely what conversation be the prime minister have with lead figure in the israeli government as well as through various party to influence the iranian regime to de escalate as quickly as possible give the seriousness of the crisis 
 both the defence secretary and the foreign secretary have speak to their counterpart over the weekend and the foreign secretary have speak to the iranian foreign minister specifically to urge de escalation and condemn what happen over the weekend i will be speak to prime minister netanyahu shortly and i can reassure the hon lady and all member of the house that we will continue together with our ally to urge calm head to prevail and de escalation that be the right course forward and across all level of government that be the message we be take to everyone 
 there be another country that be under almost constant daily bombardment by iranian make drone ukraine some year ago i plead with the israelis to help ukraine against russia and they refuse even though russia be spend half a dollar in the iranian drone programme i know the prime minister will be speak to the prime minister of israel later today now that raf pilot have quite rightly go to the defence of israel could he perhaps ask that israel now decide it be time to help ukraine in its hour of need and we can see off both russia and iranian aggression 
 i thank my right hon friend for the role he have play in ensure the security of the uk and our ally over previous year my statement   allude to the fact that the ukrainians be suffer from iranian drone over the same weekend that this happen not only will i as always be take up his point with all our ally in urge they to do more to support ukraine but i know he will have welcome the recent announcement a few week ago of more support from the uk to ukraine specifically in the area of uncrewed platform on autonomous warfare to make sure the ukrainians have the ability both to protect themselves and to conduct their operation the majority of the new platform we be deliver to the ukrainians have be develop in the uk which my right hon friend be keen to ensure we see the benefit of here at home i be glad that have be realise both support ukraine and its security and bolster the british defence industry here at home 
 there be rightly consensus across the house to call for restraint from the israeli government but we have call for restraint before we call for restraint with regard to the attack on gaza yet the indiscriminate bombing take place we call for restraint on the settlement in the west bank yet the settlement have expand we call for restraint so that food could be get to the child of gaza yet malnutrition be kill some of they so what action will the government take if israel do not show restraint because we be in danger of the middle east be set alight by the decision take by the right wing faction within the netanyahu cabinet 
 i be sorry but i miss the part of the right hon gentleman ’s question where he condemn iran and hamas for what they have do we will always encourage de escalation in the region and i be proud of the role the uk be play to bring that about 
 the prime minister be right to authorise the defence of israel and the avoidance of violence and death but violence have also erupt in the west bank over the last few day as he will know what concrete step can we take to protect those civilian 
 i have personally repeatedly raise with prime minister netanyahu the issue of settler violence in the west bank as have my colleague include the deputy foreign secretary we have join with ally in sanction the activity of particular individual where it have be bring to our attention and we will continue to ensure that the israeli government do everything they can to reduce tension in the west bank it be not conducive to long term peace in the region and that be why we have take action where we can as well as be explicit with the israeli government about our concern 
 mr speaker i know your father well for a very long time he be a fine man and i be sincerely sorry for your loss 
 there be not single word in the prime minister ’s statement of condemnation of the israeli destruction of the iranian consulate in damascus which be the proximate reason for the event everyone be here in concert condemn he be not even ask to do so by the opposition   front bench kay burley be the only person so far to demand that of a government minister we have no treaty with israel at least not that parliament have be show the iranians be not likely to listen to the prime minister when britain occupy iran loot its wealth and overthrow its democratic socialist government in my lifetime 
 whatever may have happen a few week ago it be absolutely no justification for launch more than drone and missile from sovereign state towards israel it be as simple as that in the hon gentleman ’s question not once do he condemn that action or indeed the action of hamas in the region there be no equivalence between these thing whatever and to suggest otherwise be simply wrong 
 i thank my right hon friend for his strong support for the state of israel last year as israel and saudi arabia be about to strike a transformational agreement iran back hamas carry out its massacre on   october   with the aim of torpedo the chance of peace between israel and the arab nation last saturday ’s drone attack by iran be thwart by israel and her ally include jordan demonstrate that our country can work alongside israel after this new period of contention do my right hon friend agree that this represent a new opportunity for israel and the arab nation to rebuild relation in the aftermath of   october   and bring the hostage home 
 i agree with my right hon friend it be significant that other regional partner help to prevent a much bad attack over the weekend it remind we how important the attempt be to normalise relation between israel and its neighbour it hold out precious hope for the region it be exactly that hope that iran and its proxy be try to snuff out and we should work hard to combat that 
 my condolence to you and your family mr speaker 
 prime minister i condemn iran and hamas let i start there but we must not lose focus on the situation in gaza where there be a humanitarian crisis and famine it be just destruction that people be see in front of their eye if we want to ensure that the hostage come home like the hostage who have be adopt in brent noa argamani we must argue for a ceasefire not a pause will the prime minister clearly state that we should be call for an immediate ceasefire on all side 
 it be wrong to suggest in any way that we have lose sight of what be happen in gaza indeed the g7 statement yesterday specifically reference our desire to co operate to end the crisis in gaza to work towards an immediate humanitarian pause where hostage can be release to get aid in to build the condition for a sustainable ceasefire and crucially to deliver more humanitarian assistance into the region it be welcome that we have see an increase in that flow over the past few day and week but far more aid have to get in and that be pressure that we will continue to put on all partner concern 
 my condolence mr speaker 
 can i commend my right hon friend ’s statement it be clear as have be say already that all road lead back to tehran when it come to the terrible violence and war that take place in the middle east every country not just israel but other arab country fear what tehran be do in their country as well which be something we forget we know that iran be commit murder at home and have execute thousand of protester while this war on hamas have take place 
 with all of that know when my right hon friend sit down with our international colleague and look for other restriction to place on iran will he please consider proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps and do so in a way that make sure it can no long foment extremism here in the united kingdom as well 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question as i say in my statement we be urgently work with our ally to see what step we can take together in a co ordinated fashion to deter and condemn what iran be do with regard to destabilising activity here in the uk he will know that the charity commission recently open an investigation into a particular organisation we will continue to use all the power at our disposal to ensure that people be not foment hate and undermine british value here at home from abroad 
 i have notify the office of   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns who chair the foreign affairs committee that i would reference she in my question it be recently reveal that she tell a private fundraising event 
 the foreign office have receive official legal advice that israel have break international humanitarian law but the government have not announce it 
 i have a simple question for the prime minister if he can not answer it if he dodge and deflect our constituent will know that he be hide the truth be the chair of the foreign affairs committee tell the truth yes or no 
 i be happy to address that clearly we have of the most robust arm export licensing control regime in the entire world we have previously assess that israel be commit and capable of comply with international humanitarian law but as the hon member would expect we regularly review our assessment as the foreign secretary confirm last week the uk position on export licence be unchanged and follow the late assessment be in line with our legal advice we will keep that position under review and act in accordance with advice i also point out to the hon member that most like minded country have not suspend their exist arm export licence to israel 
 i too welcome the prime minister ’s leadership in this area in addition to the thank give to the raf which undertake exemplary action this weekend will he also thank those us service personnel base here in the united kingdom include many in my west suffolk constituency who be prepared to act as a moment ’s notice to defend israel against this attack which have be roundly condemn 
 i be happy to join my right hon friend in pay tribute not just to our colleague in america but to our partner across the region who participate in a joint international effort that be all in support of israel ’s own action its armed force also deserve enormous praise for the success with which they repel this awful attack 
 mr speaker may i pass my condolence to you and your family for the sad loss of your father doug 
 we live in deeply unsettling time and the prime minister along with our ally be right to call for a de escalation when he have his discussion with prime minister netanyahu this afternoon will he convey to he that now be the time to step back there must be no further escalation in the middle east now be the time to recognise that both israelis and palestinians must live in peace and for that we need the state solution in when we have an outbreak of violence in gaza the then prime minister david cameron unequivocally call for a ceasefire we must today put an end to the conflict and the killing in that region for the benefit of both these country 
 finally if i may say so i welcome the prime minister ’s comment on the situation in ukraine but we be all aware of the report of a build up of russian activity i say to the prime minister that we must do more today with our ally to protect our friend and give they the tool they need to defend themselves and to ensure that russia be defeat 
 i be happy to say to the right hon gentleman that we remain steadfast in our support for ukraine we will not allow putin to achieve his aim of eradicate freedom and democracy in that country we have announce significant support it be the trip i make at the beginning of this year and have encourage ally to do the same we be commit to support ukraine for as long as it take for ukraine not only to win the war but to emerge as a strong sovereign and free country 
 my thought and condolence be with your family mr speaker
