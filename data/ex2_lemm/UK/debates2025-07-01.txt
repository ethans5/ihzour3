i remember well the un rapporteur say that the conservatives be engage in cruelty towards people in this country who need help the most 
 what i can not fathom be why a labour government be not put in the support and then let it bed in which be what will reduce the welfare bill and increase employment level the impact of any cut would then not be as drastic the starting point should never be cut before proper support the review lead by my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability who i have a lot of respect for be start to look a little bit predetermine as the change in criterion will happen at the same time as the review conclude it remain unclear how exist claimant with fluctuating condition will be assess and the   impact that these change will have on the carer ’s allowance however we do know that disability living allowance claimant and those on other legacy benefit will be assess under the new criterion put almost disabled child at risk of lose support 
 the north east region have the high number of disabled people in england and the number of people search for work outpace the number of available job how on earth will cut the health element of universal credit incentivise those people to go out and find a job that do not even exist since pip be an in work benefit restrict the very support that could keep people in work will only help to increase unemployment all of this for £ of saving when we know that saving can be make elsewhere and when we know that those with the broad shoulder could pay more instead we be once again make disabled people pay the price for the economic mess that the conservative party leave we 
 as it stand we be be ask to vote blind today there be no new bill no new explanatory note and no fully update impact assessment there be no time for sufficient scrutiny and no formal consultation have take place with disabled people the majority of employment support will not be in place until the end of the decade and access to work remain bad than ever before we be create a tier possibly tier benefit system and we know for certain that disabled people be go to be bad off this be not a responsible way for any of we to legislate it be predict that disabled people will lose on average £ per year yet we know they already need an extra £ per month just to have the same standard of living as those in non disabled household there be a reason why organisation represent disabled people be against this bill and there be a reason why not a single organisation have come out in support of it 
 i be plead with mps today to please do not do this for those on my own labour benches stay loyal to your party today may feel good in this place but once you go home and be in your individual constituency the reality of this will hit and it will hit very hard 
 reading oppose and defer until   tuesday july   standing order no 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 whether she plan to review the barnett formula for scotland 
 there be currently no plan to review the operation of the barnett formula the barnett formula have stand the test of time because it be simple and efficient and it provide a clear and certain outcome it be a key part of the arrangement for pool and share risk and resource across the united kingdom 
 we know that if the government today pass their disgraceful discriminatory and some say illegal cut to disability support that will almost certainly lead to a reduction in the scottish budget as a result of the barnett formula that be a deliberate choice that scottish labour mps will be make if they support these cut and for which they must answer to their constituent will the chancellor or the minister tell they this house and indeed the nation exactly how many million of pound they will vote to take out of the pocket of disabled and vulnerable people in scotland many of whom vote for labour almost a year ago 
 thing i can tell the scottish people and indeed the house be that it be this labour government who have give the large real term increase in spending to the scottish government since devolution begin billion and billion of pound of extra money be go to the scottish national party government in holyrood on devolved matter it be for the snp government to be accountable for the delivery of public service to people in scotland where they be fail on everything from the nhs to welfare and the economy 
 in the recent spending review the chancellor outline plan for a multimillion pound investment in essential building work at budmouth academy in weymouth we welcome that new investment in local school in our town and it will enable budmouth academy finally to upgrade its school building look ahead will the chancellor work with i to speedily deliver the new investment and ensure that budmouth academy get a richly deserve upgrade as soon as possible 
 unfortunately i can not see the relevance of the question i call bobby dean 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the datum her department hold on high net worth individual 
 his majesty ’s revenue and customs use a range of datum source to monitor the wealthy population international exchange of information include the common reporting standard and us foreign account tax compliance act datum offer opportunity to develop deep insight into the international financial affair of some of the uk ’s wealthy taxpayer 
 the minister will no doubt be aware of report of the so call exodus of millionaire those report be from high profile individual and city spokespeople but there be rarely hard number behind they be treasury ministers able to verify the tax justice network ’s research that say that just of millionaire have exit the uk and that that number have remain low and stable over the past decade and will they publish their own figure as well 
 when consider fiscal measure or financial change the figure that matter be those provide by the office for budget responsibility the obr have certify that the non dom reform that the government have implement will raise £ in total revenue and that figure account for some non dom who be ineligible for the new regime choose to leave the uk 
 public investment make we all more prosperous but clearly that public investment in our road rail and energy infrastructure need to be pay for will the minister set out how we be fund that public investment by tax the very rich people in this country 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct that our change to the non dom reporting regime be essential to raise billion of pound to support the public finance and get our public service back on their foot i contrast that with some of the proposal set out by opposition party indeed reform uk ’s plan be for a tax cut for foreign billionaire 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in her budget last year the chancellor tuck away about £ over the next couple of year from reform to the non dom tax regime it be important to remember that the obr say in its fiscal outlook that that figure be highly uncertain and a high level survey by oxford economics find that fully third of non dom be consider leave the country in the next couple year as a direct result of those policy that imply not an increase of £ but a decrease of £ the chancellor have create a fiscal black hole of £ with just policy alone in this week of heroic u turn from the government front bench will the minister confirm whether they will be ax this tax when will it finally be condemn to the history book 
 i be not really sure whether there be a policy suggestion in that comment or not as the shadow minister will know the fiscal black hole that we have to address when we win the general election be the £ black hole that the conservatives leave after their mismanagement of the economy as i say the office for budget responsibility have confirm that our reform to the non dom regime with our removal of non dom tax status will raise £ over the year of the forecast it be the obr ’s figure that we will trust in that regard 
 what fiscal step she plan to take to help reduce the number of disabled and sick people in poverty 
 the government be commit to ensure that there be few sick and disabled people in poverty by help they into work and get they off nhs waiting list that be why at the spring statement we announce the large investment in employment support in at least a generation the government have already take action to tackle poverty include with the fair repayment rate which lower the cap on deduction in universal credit and we have increase the national living wage by beyond that we be invest to reduce poverty by expand free school meal and invest in a £ settlement for crisis support we will set out our child poverty strategy in the autumn we have invest £ in reduce nhs waiting list and since we take office there be more people in work 
 many disabled people be really struggle right now we know that in be live in poverty as i can see in my york constituency but i be particularly take aback by the women ’s budget group report which highlight that quarter of the people who will lose their personal independence payment and carer ’s allowance be woman how will the chancellor ensure that when fiscal decision be make we look in particular at the intersectionality between woman disabled people and other protect characteristic to ensure that they be not push far into poverty 
 my hon friend will know that nobody currently receive personal independence payment will see any reduction in the support they get in term of support woman into work recognise some of the   intersectionalitie she mention the government have increase the national living wage by 6.7%—sadly it be still too often woman who be pay the low wage and our employment rights bill will offer more security and dignity in work we be also roll out more childcare include new nursery at primary school and my right hon friend the business and trade secretary will today make a statement announce the launch of a review of parental leave which could benefit all work parent but particularly mum 
 do the chancellor accept that cancer be a major driver of poverty that be not only because people who be ill can not work during their treatment but because sometimes people who be happily cure find that they have collateral damage that mean they can not work at a full level throughout the rest of their life do she recognise that radiotherapy play a huge part in make sure that people be cure and then able to be productive in society give that the international average for people with cancer have radiotherapy be while in the uk it be only will she look at the economic advantage of invest in radiotherapy 
 in the spending review we invest an additional £ every year for day to day spending in the national health service as well as a record uplift in capital spending in the nhs so that there be more money for the equipment to do that vital work include in cancer treatment which the hon gentleman mention in our year in office we have deliver additional appointment in the nhs and reduce waiting list by that be only possible because of the decision we take in the budget last year those include increase taxis on non dom as well as the increase in national insurance contribution which have go into fund our national health service 
 st helens be rank as the most deprive area nationally and that poverty have an impact on health and sickness from pre birth to old age as a country we spend more on crisis intervention and less on early intervention after year of the tories will the chancellor please assure i and people in st helens north that this government will do all they can to properly fund council and health service to help more people live long healthy life 
 that be a really important point our prime minister be absolutely committed to early intervention to stop the cost of crisis emerge later on later this week on the anniversary of labour ’s creation of the health service my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care will publish the year health plan which will focus on ensure that young people especially and particularly those in some of our most deprived community be not let down and have a healthy start in life across the whole of government we be determined to achieve that 
 today ’s disastrous welfare debacle be all down to the chancellor ’s obsessive pursuit to stick to the grotesque tory fiscal rule yet people could still be save from poverty if all the scottish labour mps join those prepared to vote down the universal credit and personal   independence payment bill do she agree that if scottish labour mp go through the lobby to support the bill they would be as well not bother stand again 
 this government change the fiscal rule at the budget last year with a stability rule so that for the time we pay for day to day spending through tax receipt and an investment rule which enable we to invest in the thing that will help grow the economy such as energy infrastructure defence spending and transport and digital infrastructure as a result in the budget and then in this year ’s spring statement we unlock £ more to spend during the course of this parliament include the record settlement for the scottish government it be now up to the scottish government to spend that money wisely and to try to reduce waiting list in scotland as we have do in england and indeed in wales 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be a humiliating reversal of the chancellor ’s winter fuel cut now welfare cut that she rush to meet her fiscal rule have be shred leave unfunded spending to pay for in october the chancellor say that extend the freeze in income tax threshold 
 would hurt work people it would take more money out   of their payslips”—[official report   october vol c. 
 do she stand by the commitment to end that freeze from yes or no 
 it be the hon member ’s government when they be on this side of the house who freeze those allowance take more money out of the pocket of work people despite that they leave a £ black hole in the public finance i will take no lesson from conservative party which have oppose everything that be need to invest in our public service we be in the mess we be in because of the damage that it cause 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of plan increase in funding for transport infrastructure on economic growth 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of plan increase in funding for transport infrastructure on economic growth 
 the government recognise the critical contribution that transport make to our growth mission the government increase the capital envelope by over £ at the autumn budget last year and by a further £ at the spring statement take together that represent a big increase in capital investment as a result the transport capital budget exclude high speed will increase by per year in real term over the spending review period that investment will improve connectivity in our town city and village reduce journey time and increase transport reliability   for area of transport that be devolve it be up to the scottish and welsh governments to allocate their funding and be accountable to their respective parliaments for those decision 
 i welcome the announcement in the spending review that railway project in wales include new station east of cardiff will receive an extra £ in funding over the next decade will the chancellor provide more detail as to how the money will be specifically allocate and when work will begin 
 it be a pleasure to be in cardiff just after the spending review to look at the difference make by the investment that the labour government be put into transport in wales the spending review and the infrastructure strategy recognise wales ’s long term infrastructure need and how they have be neglect for too long by the tory party we deliver at least £ for rail enhancement which provide funding for continue to develop and deliver the station identify in the burns review include newport west and somerton plan for future rail investment in wales will be make in close consultation with the welsh government and through engagement with the wales rail board 
 i declare an interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on british bus our £ commitment to regional transport through the spending review should be good news for bus manufacturing however alexander dennis ’s ongoing consultation threaten job in falkirk put another major employer at risk just after the closure of the grangemouth oil refinery the scottish national party ’s scotzeb scheme famously fail to invest in scotland where thing be build and by who matter so will the chancellor act to guarantee that our investment in transport be of maximum benefit to scottish vehicle manufacturer 
 it be important that as this government put more money into infrastructure include transport it benefit company and job here in britain it be not right the scottish government spend more on bus make in china than on bus make in scotland there be nothing prevent the scottish national party from invest in job and growth in scotland 
 mp and council of all party across east and north yorkshire be unite in want to enhance connectivity in the area have green option and optimise the economic output of the area so will the chancellor work with we on a cross party basis to look at reopen a direct rail line from hull to york so that those great university city can be unite by effective transport infrastructure once again 
 i really welcome the fact that the right hon gentleman support the investment that this labour government be make in transport and infrastructure after the of year neglect by his party we have increase transport spending by per year in real term in every year of this spending review period benefit all part of the country include yorkshire where both he and i have the honour and privilege of be member of parliament 
 the prime minister the business secretary and the chancellor have the joy of come to my constituency to see the mira technology park last week they will have come via the a5 the previous prime minister talk about the funding that would be submit via the a5 but in the spending review that money seem to have drop so will the chancellor commit to the same funding for the a5 that we have from the last government because it be really important for my area 
 the irony be that the last government make a lot of commitment but do not put any money into deliver they that be the difference that this government be make with fully fund plan to upgrade transport the department for transport now have its settlement and it will look at a number of project the mess leave by the conservatives be something we have have to sort out the conservatives have not back any of the measure that we have take to bring in more revenue yet as we have see they be very keen on spend the money that be why we be leave with a £ black hole when we come into office a year ago 
 what step she be take to help increase economic growth in eastleigh constituency 
 what step she be take to help increase economic growth in monmouthshire 
 what step she be take to help increase economic growth in north gloucestershire 
 what step she be take to help increase economic growth in gloucestershire

 small to medium sized business be the backbone of the local economy in eastleigh create job and drive innovation however local business include the precision manufacturing firm g. w. martin have tell i that the increase cost as a result of the change to employer national insurance contribution have leave they with no choice but to pass those cost on to customer make uk manufacture less competitive globally what concrete step will the government take to help business in eastleigh 
 half of small business will not be affect by the employer national insurance increase as the hon member will know we will also be set   out a small business strategy in the government ’s plan to support those business across the uk later this year 
 as the minister know i be delighted with the spending review ’s investment in welsh rail of £ it show the power of labour governments work together and correct year of underfunding from the tories this investment in welsh community and welsh business be extremely welcome and it will be a brilliant driver of our government ’s mission for economic growth will she outline what step she be take with other departments to ensure that rural economy and market town such as monmouth abergavenny caldicot and chepstow and small business across monmouthshire can be help to thrive and contribute to that growth mission 
 i welcome what my hon friend say the government be support the rural economy with over £ a year for sustainable farming and nature recovery we be invest £ to improve digital connectivity which will be important to the small business and other that she mention as i say to the previous question we will set out a small business strategy later this year 
 north gloucestershire be ready to jump start economic growth with its exist advanced engineering and defence industry ready to drive the uk toward economic and defence objective babcock ge aerospace moog and safran be already develop world lead technology and the garden town project include a further hectare of employment area will the minister join i in gloucestershire so we can demonstrate this expertise and the potential for growth on the ground 
 defence company be an incredibly important part of the economy and the hon member will know that we be increase defence spending to up to by the end of this parliament it have only ever reach those level before under a labour government 
 the industrial strategy be right to highlight the potential for the national cyber innovation centre in my constituency if we be go to deliver that we will need to make sure that junction of the m5 be also do to enable the traffic to get around that development this be a development of national importance the strategic site accelerator have also be cite by the government can the minister advise i on how area like liberal democrat run cheltenham and gloucestershire can access that fund 
 i will ensure that the hon member get a meeting with the relevant transport minister but i hope that he be as excited as i be about the £ that we be invest in the state of the art golden valley development which will create high skilled job and new home and be close to the gchq headquarters in cheltenham i be sure that that be something he will welcome 
 do the minister agree that the new green book with its proposal on place base analysis will mean that left behind place like mine will start to get the infrastructure investment that they so desperately need 
 we pledge to reform the green book and we be do precisely that alongside the spending review we recognise the strategic importance of investment in every part of the country we want to realise the growth potential of place like the my hon friend represent she be a doughty champion for her constituency 
 after year of unfunded and undelivered promise from the conservatives on level up place like rochdale be finally get the fair share of money that they really deserve the minister expand a little on the green book but could she outline how its place base approach will help place like mine and advanced manufacturing in the atom valley 
 as my hon friend will know we launch funding of £ for transport for city region in his constituency i be pleased that this government recognise the potential of place like the he represent we be go to unlock that regional growth across the north and in other part of the country 
 i will just make the point again that we be a long way from eastleigh i do not understand how the question be group in this way other people list on the order paper be be leave behind and be miss out as a result 
 what step she be take to help increase funding for the clean energy sector 
 the spending review announce significant investment into clean energy to strengthen our energy security and our economy that include over £ for great british energy and great british energy nuclear and £ for sizewell c. 
 although my constituent in ealing southall be no doubt swelter in today ’s heat they be worried that come winter they will again face eye water energy bill to heat their home the previous government leave we with the leaky home in europe slash grant for loft and cavity insulation can the minister set out the work that this labour government be do not just to support the clean energy sector but to upgrade my constituent home to take that clean cheap energy and bring down bill in ealing southall 
 my hon friend be an excellent advocate for her constituent in ealing southall and i be sure that many of they will benefit from our warm home plan which will see £ invest across this parliament that investment will be allocate to scheme to support the roll out of heat pump alongside energy efficiency measure and other low carbon technology this will help with environmental goal but crucially it will cut bill and tackle fuel poverty 
 this week the tariff on import of us ethanol fall to through the litre quota negotiate by this labour government which represent the size of the uk ’s entire ethanol market that will have a hugely damaging impact on our rural economy uk job and the nhs with government effectively offshore the benefit of ethanol production and its by product to the us what conversation be the chancellor and her team have with this green energy sector in which a huge number of job be now at stake in teesside and hull 
 of course our colleague in the department for business and trade be have conversation with those business and industry that may be affect i hope the hon member welcome the trade deal that we get with the us an economic deal that be so important for our prosperity and will see we be the only country to avoid some of the tariff that be affect all other country around the world 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be become clear that year in the public still do not know what labour be all about and the same could be say for its so call national wealth fund not only have the national wealth fund invest less equity in clean energy than before its costly £ rebrand but it be also now rightly subject to a treasury committee inquiry at which expert witness could not name a single thing it be do differently the ceo of the british business bank now say the government do not understand what they be set up can the minister tell we why the national wealth fund have invest less in clean energy than before the costly rebrand and why the government u turn on incorporate the british business bank 
 the shadow minister forget to mention the fact that we have have £ of investment in green energy since the general election i be sure he have consult the spending review document closely i know he be a diligent shadow minister in that regard and he will have see the investment that we be put into great british energy sizewell c small modular reactor fusion nuclear r&d the warm home plan and carbon capture and storage all of this be to make sure we improve our energy security and bring down bill for good 
 whether she plan to provide additional barnett consequential funding to the northern ireland executive for the winter fuel payment 
 i can reassure the hon member that there will be an increase in the northern ireland executive ’s funding through the annually manage expenditure forecasting process this will be confirm at the autumn budget in the usual way more importantly to pensioner in northern ireland he will be aware that in june the communities minister in northern ireland confirm that winter fuel payment will be available in northern ireland on the same basis as in england and wales 
 i thank the minister for that very positive answer what assessment have be make of the impact of increase the winter fuel payment in line with inflation give the increase in the cost of living do he believe that current winter fuel payment be up to the standard in term of how far they will go to support those who be eligible 
 our priority at the moment be to extend eligibility for the winter fuel payment as the hon member and i have discuss on a number of occasion but obviously that sit within a wide set of support he will have see the extension to the warm home discount announce in recent day and the extension of the household support fund as he be well aware social security be a transfer policy in northern ireland 
 do the minister agree that it be only because of the barnett formula and a labour government that scotland include community in stirling and strathallan now have record funding of £ this year and it be deeply concern that the snp government in scotland have no clear plan to invest this funding properly in scotland ’s nhs scotland ’s school and scotland ’s local service 
 as so often my hon friend say it all we have see record investment in the scottish government ’s budget but we do not see waiting list fall in scotland as they be in england and wales 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of implement a flat rate of remote bet and game duty on the horseracing industry 
 we very much recognise the social and cultural value of horseracing which be why on course bet be exempt from duty and horseracing be the only sport to receive a government mandate levy we be consult on measure to simplify gambling duty and improve compliance no decision will be make on rate before the budget and we be work with the horserace sector to identify unintended consequence and mitigation 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests in doncaster we be incredibly proud of our historic racecourse which be home to the iconic st leger festival as someone who have attend the racecourse for a number of event throughout my life i can say that it be part of our local community and bring thousand of job will the minister confirm that he will continue dialogue with the horseracing industry note that it bring job to the country nationally and be the large spectator sport in the country and identify that this be very different from online casino and game of chance 
 it be excellent to hear my hon friend speak so passionately about doncaster racecourse and the wide sector and i reassure she that we will absolutely continue close dialogue with the horserace industry on these proposal i and my official be work   closely with the horserace sector to identify any unintended consequence and possible mitigation we intend to continue those conversation with the industry and we welcome further engagement 
 how do the government assess the implementation of a flat rate in term of improve fairness and simplification for all involve reduce administrative cost and encourage compliance 
 of the principle behind the reform that we be look to make to the gambling duty be to tackle issue of compliance by simplify the system the consultation be open at the moment and i encourage the hon gentleman and anyone else who be interested in contribute towards that to make their view know 
 what recent discussion her department have have with the trustee of the british coal staff superannuation scheme 
 my hon friend the minister for industry recently meet the trustee of the british coal staff superannuation scheme to consider their proposal and i have be monitor the development closely 
 i thank the chief secretary to the treasury for his answer last weekend i attend the anniversary of the bells mining disaster in in which man and boy die i meet mervyn frampton whose brother keith be kill in that tragedy mervyn be now and we talk about when he and his butty power our country and be member of the british coal staff pension scheme will my right hon friend please be mindful of those who risk their life for we and who be still owe pension fair play 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i extend the thought of the house to his constituent and the community that he represent he will know that i have always keep the service and sacrifice of the mining community in my mind both in opposition when campaign for change to the mineworker pension scheme which this government implement at the last budget and now in consider proposal from the bcsss i will be look at those issue in more detail over the summer and i hope to say more in the autumn 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the increase in employer national insurance contribution on business 
 the government protect the small business from change to national insurance by increase the employment allowance from £ to £ that mean that this year employer will pay no national insurance contribution at all and more than half will either gain or see no change to their national insurance contribution 
 give the recent trio of u turn this government have demonstrate that they be keen to change their mind as well as to create new multibillion pound black hole will the chancellor do the right thing and u turn on the increase in national insurance contribution to provide business with a much need boost in the sluggish economy that she have create 
 it be a bit rich for anyone in the conservative party to mention black hole after the that they leave for we to clear up the hon gentleman will have see the lloyds business barometer which have recently be publish and show that business confidence be now at a year high lead by increase in confidence in retail and manufacturing that report reference the impact of the spending review on boost business confidence a recognition that this government be back britain and back britain ’s business 
 the chancellor be quite right to mention that business confidence be at a year high do that not go to show that not only be the announcement in the spending review right for business but her emphasis on stability and certainty in the economy be exactly what be need moreover it be in sharp contrast to the chaos constant change of policy and complete disaster in economic policy that we see from the conservative government 
 the stability that this government have return to the economy have mean that the bank of england have be able to cut interest rate time in the last year take hundred of pound off people ’s mortgage there be such a big impact in that regard under the last government the reason for the increase in business confidence also include the industrial strategy publication the spending review and the trade deal all of which be boost business confidence and have help to create new job in britain since the last general election 
 i call the shadow minister 
 labour ’s job tax have really clobber british business the office for national statistics say that the number of available job be collapse perhaps the chancellor have not update herself on how british business think about confidence the institute of directors have say today that business confidence have plummet the bank of england be warn of significant decline in wage growth and the british chambers of commerce say that taxis on business can not be increase the chancellor have bungle welfare change eviscerate confidence in the prime minister and blow an even big hole in the public financing mean that she will raise taxis yet again this autumn will she avoid create the same damaging uncertainty she do last summer by rule out from the dispatch box today any further tax increase on british business 
 i be not go to take lesson from the conservatives they increase taxis time when they increase taxis it be always ordinary work people who pay the price in our budget last year we protect the payslip of ordinary work people by not increase their income tax their national insurance or their vat and we do not go ahead with the increase   in fuel duty that the conservatives have plan instead of talk down the british economy why do the conservatives not back the plan that be back by british business to grow our economy and make work people well off 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 non profit business and charity have be hit really hard by the job tax last week my local meal on wheel service tell i that business like theirs around the country be have to make redundancy and put up price for vulnerable people in the context of today ’s welfare reform that the government be pursue can the chancellor confirm whether the treasury will conduct any assessment of the increase cost of essential and charitable service rely on by disabled people and their carer at a time when their welfare support could be cut 
 as the hon lady know the change we have make to the welfare bill will mean that nobody who be currently receive personal independence payment will have a cut so i just do not think the premise of her question be correct when we debate the welfare bill today we will be vote for the big increase in the universal credit standard allowance for a generation and protect those people with the most severe condition from have to be reassess for their condition which be degrade we have get rid of the tories work capability assessment change which the court say be illegal and we be put £ into back to work support at the same time we be invest £ in the nhs that be possible only because of the rise in national insurance increase on business which the liberal democrats oppose and yet that be how we be fund our nhs 
 what fiscal step she be take to help increase growth in rural area 
 the government have commit £ per year to support sustainable farming and nature recovery support the rural economy we have also confirm investment of £ over year into digital connectivity as well as £ of local government transport funding for small city town and rural area 
 while i welcome the government ’s rural growth plan i be concern about the persistent poverty in many rural area the additional cost of live in these community know as the rural premium exacerbate hardship what specific step will the chancellor take to support those in or near poverty in rural area and will the treasury commit to revise the index of multiple deprivation to more accurately reflect deprivation in rural and coastal community such as west somerset and mid devon 
 the ministry of housing communities and local government will be come forward with further detail of funding for the most deprived community across the country include rural area 
 as of the most deprived region of northern europe cornwall benefit from objective structural and sustained prosperity fund funding can the minister confirm that under this government cornwall will not lose out on funding for economic growth and the investment that our community deserve 
 we be support growth across the country and we will publish further detail of how we will do that in the come week 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the year infrastructure strategy on economic growth 
 the year infrastructure strategy be a key part of this government ’s growth mission commit to a minimum of £ of investment over the next year in local transport affordable home and modernise school and hospital in every part of the country 
 i be pleased to see that the creative and digital industry financial service and clean energy be all include as priority sector in the government ’s industrial strategy those sector have huge potential in my constituency of bournemouth west focus on the latter as a fellow south west mp what assessment have the minister make of the dorset clean energy super cluster ’s potential for growth job and bring people ’s bill down not just in bournemouth west but across the region 
 i thank my hon friend for champion the dorset clean energy super cluster opportunity which be announce by her council at the uk ’s real estate investment and infrastructure forum only recently offshore wind hydrogen nuclear and carbon capture and storage be frontier technology and industry that be at the heart of our clean energy sector plan and they will create opportunity in every part of the country include in the south west 
 the infrastructure plan reiterate the government ’s support for a runway at heathrow a project that the chancellor have repeatedly state will be privately fund however give the vast amount of rail and road infrastructure that will be need to support a big heathrow as well as the huge risk a private company would take on which it would want underwrite by government could the chief secretary to the treasury outline to the house how much taxpayer cash have be earmark as need to enable a big heathrow 
 the hon lady will know that we be wait to receive detailed proposal from heathrow for the development of the runway the government will consider those proposal in due course and make further announcement when decision have be take 
 what step her department be take to help tackle tax evasion by high street business 
 what step she plan to take to close loophole in the tax system

 parental leave and pay entitlement play a key role in that we know that the arrival of a child whether through birth or adoption be a transformative time in a family ’s life we also know that the current parental leave system do not support modern diverse work family as well as it could parent group and campaigner have long argue that our paternity leave be too short and compare poorly with other country while share parental leave be available to family where father and partner want to take a long period of leave evidence show that take up be very low with the parental right survey report that of mother and of father use this entitlement the survey also show that of father do not take paternity leave for financial reason 
 we be committed to improve the parental leave system and be already take action improve the system will have the add benefit of increase workforce participation by help employer to fill vacancy and will contribute to increase productivity benefit the economy 
 the employment rights bill be vehicle through which we be improve the parental leave system the bill make paternity leave and parental leave day right mean that employee will be eligible to give notice of their intent to take leave from their day of employment it contain a number of other measure that will improve the support that work family receive it will put in place legislation that make it unlawful to dismiss pregnant woman mother on maternity leave and mother who come back to work for a month period after they return except in specific circumstance it will also make flexible work the default except where it be not reasonably feasible and require that all large employer produce action plan that contribute to close the gender pay gap

 the review will be co lead by the department for business and trade and the department for work and pensions the departments with the main responsibility for the current parental leave framework there will however be close work across government to deliver this review to reflect the wide influence the parental leave system have on policy in other department 
 the current system have grow up gradually over time the maternity arrangement be set out in the factory and workshop act which introduce the idea that woman who work in factory can not work for week after give birth subsequent entitlement have be add to support specific group as need have emerge which have create a framework that do not always work cohesively as a whole this piecemeal approach to parental leave and pay mean that the system have never have an overarching set of objective that it should deliver this review present an opportunity to reset our approach to and understanding of parental leave and pay and what we want the system to achieve 
 we will use the review to establish what britain need from a parental leave and pay system to support our modern economy and deliver improvement for work family we have set out objective as our starting point which we intend to test as we progress the review to ensure we be truly reflect the need of the nation 
 our objective be to support the physical and mental health of woman during pregnancy and after give birth to a child our objective be to support economic growth by enable more parent to stay in work and advance in their career after start a family this will focus on improve both woman ’s labour market outcome and tackle the gender pay gap 
 our objective be to ensure that there be sufficient resource and time away from work to support new and expectant parent wellbee this will include facilitate the good start in life for baby and young child and support health and development outcome our objective be to support parent to make balanced childcare choice that work for their family situation include enable co parenting and provide flexibility to reflect the reality of modern work and childcare need 
 cross cutting consideration will also be factor into our review the be to build a fair parental leave system between parent within a family different type of parent and parent with different employment status the consideration be to balance cost and benefit to business and the exchequer as well as to examine how the system can support economic opportunity for business and family as part of this the review will consider opportunity to make the process surround parental leave simple for both business and parent the final cross cutting consideration focus on improve our society for example by support the child poverty strategy and by shift social and gender norm include around paternal childcare 
 all current and upcoming parental leave and pay entitlement will be in the scope of the review this will enable we to consider how the parental leave and pay system should operate as a complete system to improve   the support available for work family this broad scope mean that the review will consider the individual exist entitlement and how good to ensure improvement can be deliver for work family as well as related wide issue and theme for example the review will consider whether the support available meet the need of other work family who do not qualify for exist statutory leave and pay entitlement such as kinship carer and self employ parent it will also consider how the pay system work more broadly 
 this will be an evidence base review that reflect and consider the perspective and experience of those who engage with the parental leave and pay system we welcome view from and intend to engage constructively with a wide range of external stakeholder include group such as trade union that represent both parent and family and employer or employer representative there will be opportunity for stakeholder to contribute view and expertise throughout the review include through a call for evidence which launch today this call for evidence seek initial evidence specifically in relation to the objective that will set the foundation for what we want our system to deliver 
 the review launch today we expect it to run for a period of month the government will conclude the review with a set of finding and a road map include next step for take any potential reform forward to implementation this be an important step forward to ensure that our workplace be fit for the century and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 from personal experience as a father of i understand the importance of father be able to spend time at home with their newborn and support mother in those early day have experience paternity leave both as a member of parliament in and as well as in very different circumstance in while self employ i be proud that the uk already offer some of the most generous maternity and paternity right but of course there be always room for improvement 
 the conservatives introduce share parental leave allow new parent to spend precious time care for their newborn it be therefore with interest that we digest the content of this ministerial statement today but i do have deep reservation about both its substance and its timing i understand that the government pledge that this review would be do and dust within a year another broken promise but it be curious that they have choose today of all day to launch it 
 i be in no doubt that today ’s statement have be rush into the minister ’s hand to deflect from what i suspect will be a difficult day of parliamentary business for the government that much be clear as the secretary of state be entirely incapable of confirm the current rate of statutory paternity pay on lbc this morning i welcome the fact that he apologise to nick ferrari in admit that he really should know perhaps the minister can set the record straight for his boss today 
 i wish to take this opportunity to make it crystal clear that conservative be not oppose to increase parental leave as long as it be proportionate affordable and do not increase unemployment therein lie the problem because this government have leave themselves no breathing room their political choice have impose the most significant headwind on business in a generation those choice have drive unemployment up by since july last year business across the land be contend with taxis on job that labour promise would never come and now they be star down the barrel of page of closely type union lead red tape in the unemployment bill which will upset a carefully balanced and fair relationship between employee and employer that have span decade even tony blair and gordon brown refuse to open that box no real business support that bill the big business group have warn against it it will make hire tough and force employer to take few risk on new starter disproportionately push young mother out of the workforce flexible working will be almost entirely eviscerate from britain ’s job market 
 the reasonable measure from which employer and employee have benefit for year have allow business to take a chance on new hire we already know that business across the uk have have no choice but to cut job reduce hour or put hire on pause because of the chancellor ’s toxic treatment of enterprise if it be helpful i can spell this out for the benefit of those on the government front bench it really be quite straightforward it be not possible to benefit from employment right if people do not have a job in the place with that in mind it deeply concern i that the minister ’s statement make only a passing mention of the impact on business that come as no surprise as not person around the cabinet table have any real business experience 
 the government have admit that this review which they say would be square away by now will take month over the next month we will watch the ravage impact of labour ’s anti business policy transform from a drip to a deluge with the job tax the business rate relief cut investment and capital force overseas the employment rights bill and the family business death tax unemployment will continue to rise business will close and any chance of growth will be sap from our economy it be all well and good that the minister announce this review in the house today but let we be in no doubt that when it conclude in month time britain ’s economy will have be strip of all sign of life because of the choice labour have make 
 i take it that the shadow minister be not in support of the review may i correct he on a few point of course it be not a coincidence that this be be announce today our manifesto be clear that we would launch the review within year of take office and of course this week we do celebrate that astounding election victory on his point about statutory paternity pay it be £ we know from representation that we have already receive that many do not think that that be the right level he mention how tony blair and gordon brown refuse to open this box but it be their government who give we the right to statutory paternity pay and a number of other family friendly right of which the shadow minister himself have take advantage 
 i think we know where the conservative party stand on these issue when their leader say that maternity pay have go too far i do not quite know what she mean by that but i think it mean that the conservatives would be roll back some of the well earn gain in family friendly policy 
 the shadow minister as i would expect do not miss an opportunity to mention the employment rights bill may i suggest that he have a word with his shadow secretary of state who clearly have not read it i refer to his recent open letter to business in which he mention a number of issue with the bill he complain that we be create the fair work agency conveniently forget that in both the and conservative party manifesto there be a similar pledge to create a single enforcement body he refer to an introductory measure on electronic industrial action balloting the conservatives of course will be big fan of electronic voting give the number of leadership election in which they have take part in recent year the shadow minister need to inform his shadow secretary of state that that be not in the bill i do not know where he think that have come from we be go to introduce electronic balloting but it be not in the employment rights bill because we already have exist power to implement it 
 in that open letter the shadow secretary of state mention most curiously that the bill will include 
 a trade union right to roam 
 i do not know if he be search for a new mobile phone contract at the time but no such right exist 
 the shadow minister talk about the effect on appointment but he need to keep up to date the late lloyds business barometer say that business confidence be now at a year high and that of firm expect high staffing level in the next year that be a sign that this government be get thing do 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 it be great to see so many hon member with almost every party represent but there be empty seat where the reform uk mps sit they like to bang on about family value but when it come to actually stand up for dad and for parent they be nowhere to be see 
 i thank the minister for act on the importance of share parental leave on paternity leave as someone who have a caesarean section i be so grateful to my husband ’s employer for grant he more than week leave as everyone know mother be not mean to lift even a kettle for week after a c section which make thing impossible however we also know that not everybody be that fortunate and that be especially true for self employ people the women and equalities committee take evidence on parental leave and hear that nearly a of self employ dad and other parent do not take a single day ’s leave follow the birth of their child so how will this review ensure that self employ parent need will be take into account 
 i thank the chair of the women and equalities committee for her contribution she raise an important point and we be study her committee ’s recent report on the issue with interest it be important   that we look at how people in different form of employment be able to take advantage of parental leave in form or another that be important not just for provide physical assistance in the circumstance that my hon friend mention but because the parent should be there if they can to bond with the child in those early week and the review will definitely consider that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of the statement the liberal democrats welcome the government ’s commitment to the much need review on parental leave every child deserve the good possible start in life and the opportunity to flourish no matter their background or personal circumstance too often parent struggle on inadequate parental pay and without good enough access to share leave childcare cost be eye watering and the balance between family life and work have only become hard to strike 
 the liberal democrats have be call for an overhaul of the parental leave system to give parent a genuine choice about how they manage their responsibility in the month of their child ’s life if i could gently correct the shadow minister   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith it be the liberal democrats who be proud to introduce share parental leave in government however year later million of parent be still be deny the choice to spend more time at home with around a quarter of father ineligible for paternity pay 
 as we welcome this review into parental leave i urge the government to look more broadly into the prevalent inequality in care responsibility what step be they take to support the million of family carer who be look after disabled or elderly relative and who have no pay leave at all will they commit to a similar review into provision for unpaid carer and to make carer ’s leave pay will they commit to review the need of carer and those of the family who have take on kinship care responsibility i welcome that commitment in the statement today but do the government plan to introduce statutory kinship care leave 
 we call on the government to use the review to finally deliver meaningful reform that address the long stand concern of carer and their loved one as well as make change to the circumstance of work family that can make parent a joy rather than a burden and end the dilemma of have to choose between work and family 
 i welcome the liberal democrats support for this review the hon lady be right to point out that it be the coalition government who introduce share parental leave although that be the time in a long time that we have hear anyone admit that they be part of the coalition government she raise some very important point a number of which will be cover by the carer ’s leave review which be also take place kinship caring will be a part of that i know that the liberal democrats have a long stand policy on carer ’s leave and pay and the review will be cognisant of that 
 as i welcome the minister ’s announcement i think of the hgv driver who i meet recently who say that he be not able to take time off to be with his partner and their   newborn baby will the minister assure i and all my constituent that the new right will work for working class people as well as people on high income in professional job do he agree that today ’s announcement along with our announcement on free school meal childcare and housing make it clear that the labour party be the party of the family 
 of the real achievement of the last labour government be to recognise that give child the good start in life be fundamental to rebuild our society and that be at the heart of what we have propose today my hon friend raise an important point that these entitlement have an element of income inequality to they which we will bear in mind message we hear very clearly be that many father would like to take more paternity leave but simply can not afford to do so and we will be look at that as part of the review 
 have a child be a personal choice and it be a blessing that i have enjoy time become old sick or disabled be not personal choice yet we have have cut to the winter fuel allowance and we be about to discuss a controversial bill that would remove a large element of the support that we currently give to sick and disabled people what do that say about the government ’s priority 
 the right hon member will know that the winter fuel allowance have be restore for many people in this country and the chancellor have give a clear commitment that any exist pip claimant will not be affect by the measure in the bill as part of the review by sir charlie mayfield we be look in the round at how we ensure that people be able to be support to stay in work and i hope that the conservatives would support that 
 i warmly welcome the minister ’s statement as a dad i know from very recent experience how valuable paternity leave be for father good company also know that as tesco and other good employer have already increase their employee paternity leave offer because they know that a good workforce be a happy workforce may i encourage the minister to actively pursue those company to ensure that their datum and insight be feed into the review with a view to permanently increase paternity leave 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his recent parenthood and pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for york outer mr charters who i understand be on paternity leave as we speak my hon friend make an important point about good business understand the importance of treat their staff well i draw the house ’s attention to a quote from the chief people officer for aviva which operate a progressive parental leave policy he say 
 the chance to spend more time with a new arrival during the important few month have prove to be hugely beneficial for thousand of our aviva parent from support their partner to the positive impact it have on mental wellbeing and engagement with family life equal parental leave have be literally life change for our people 
 we want to encourage business to look at those sort of thing i be sure some other firm will be do equally well and we be happy to hear any evidence on those matter 
 as someone who be about to welcome their child into the world—[hon member hear hear thank you very much i be delighted to be discuss parental leave and i welcome this review the minister say that objective of the review be to reset the relationship between man and woman i paraphrase and to make that more equal may i gently suggest that while the measure set out be necessary they be insufficient to get to the heart of that matter we need to look at early year fund when £ be provide by the government for early year provision but provider such as the little learning tree in my constituency say that it cost £ to deliver we have a problem the parental leave review will not get to the heart of that matter so will the minister consider include the department for education in the review to get to the heart of equality between man and woman 
 the hon member raise an important point the government have clearly do great work already in expand the availability of affordable childcare but there be always more to do this specifically will not be part of the review but i can confirm that we will be work with other departments to see how their input can help to achieve the outcome we want from the review 
 the father who meet i in haslingden will welcome the review and the minister ’s announcement but in conversation i have have i have be strike by the difficulty face by some of our public sector worker with teacher almost force back perhaps a week if they have be able to take that after a holiday period and police officer face particular challenge with parental leave and paternity right will the minister reassure i that those important issue will be squarely within the term of the review and that he will be look to make progress on they
