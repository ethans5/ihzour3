the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the parole board reconsideration mechanism 
 the reconsideration mechanism introduce in july be a vital tool for public protection allow ministers to intervene in broad case where there be concern that the decision to release be irrational or procedurally flawed or where there have be an error of law since this government have use the mechanism to have release decision retake by the parole board of those result in the board reverse its original decision to direct release include the recent case of colin pitchfork 
 the treasurer of his majesty ’s household my right hon friend   the member for nuneaton mr jones and i have both raise concern about the release of edwin hopkins the schoolgirl killer of naomi smith i know that the secretary of state can not retrospectively apply the law around parole but will he assure my constituent and resident in neighbour nuneaton that the new law in the victims and prisoners bill go through parliament at the moment put public safety at the heart of future parole board decision 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that extremely troubling case the murder commit by edwin hopkins be a truly dreadful crime and i understand the concern about the release of prisoner who have commit such heinous offence the reform in the victims and prisoners bill do ensure that public safety be at the forefront of parole decision include by codify the release test in law and introduce a new power to allow the secretary of state to direct a check on the release of some of the most serious offender 
 i thank the lord chancellor for his response and his clear commitment to ensure that victim be consider as the member of parliament for strangford many people contact i about those get early parole and decision that be make will he reassure i and the house that victim will be consider and contact before any person who have carry out an evil crime be actually release 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right it be thing be a victim of a crime in the place but another not be keep update on progress of the sentence of that individual or indeed a parole decision that be why we be absolutely committed through the victim code and other mechanism to ensure that victim be keep update include during the important parole process 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the time take to schedule court hearing for historical case of child sexual exploitation on survivor and their family 
 the house should be in no doubt as to how urgently we be work to accelerate justice we will have recruit new judge by the end of this year and extend the use of nightingale courtroom and we fund a record number of sit day in court last year we have transform how we support victim of sexual violence offence through the criminal justice system include with the use of nearly independent sexual violence adviser some of those be especially for child the nationwide roll out of section evidence procedure and pre court familiarisation for vulnerable witness 
 my constituent have to wait several year before her historical child sexual exploitation case be finally hear during that time the court date be cancel twice cause her immense distress there be a backlog of about crown court case a more there than in and nearly a be wait more than year compare with in i appreciate what the minister say about the additional barrister and judge recruit but give the sensitive nature of these case could she indicate what percentage of the backlog be down to that and what she and her team be do specifically to address it 
 i be grateful to the hon lady who have raise this issue before she will know that listing be a matter for the independent judiciary but i do not seek to hide behind that actually i would like to meet she to discuss the specific reason for adjourn the case she talk about because we might be able to do something to help 
 i draw the hon lady ’s attention to important thing a new police taskforce set up by the government to support historical child sex abuse investigation have lead to a increase in child sex charge in the past year alone in addition to that i will say this greater manchester currently have live investigation into child sexual abuse these be complex case involve multiple perpetrator and multiple victim in case that recently go all the way through the court the perpetrator do not even know each other they have never meet so even the decision about how the group be arrange how the case be allocate and the length of time it will need for list be particularly complex i would like to meet she for the reason i give 
 what step his department be take to support victim of crime 
 what step his department be take to support victim of crime 
 what step his department be take to support victim of crime 
 support victim have broadly element it mean ensure harmful behaviour be comprehensively criminalise that be why we have legislate to create new offence of stalking coercive and control behaviour upskirting revenge porn non fatal strangulation and cyberflashing secondly it mean ensure that the punishment fit the crime which be why the average sentence have increase by around since thirdly it mean support victim before during and after the court process that be why we be fund over independent sexual violence adviser and independent domestic violence adviser by we have set up   a rape support helpline and we be quadruple funding for victim service in cash term since 
 cuckooing be not a victimless crime the victim whose home be invade be frequently extremely vulnerable will the secretary of state consider a separate specific offence of cuckoo in the criminal justice bill to ensure not just that the punishment fit the crime but that the crime fit the crime 
 my hon friend have be brilliant in raise this issue time and time again at least in part because of the pressure she have put on we hold a stakeholder engagement exercise on this issue with the police criminal justice system partner local authority other government departments and so on the exercise reveal that there be civil order and criminal offence which be available to disrupt it it might be for example that the underlie offence be the possession of drug with intent to supply the possession of firearm or common assault however this issue be worthy of further consideration so i will invite a conversation with she in due course 
 last week i be contact by a constituent who have be name in the local press as a victim of domestic abuse against their express wish as my right hon and learn friend will appreciate naming have the potential to endanger their safety and harm their recovery what more can be do to safeguard the confidentiality of victim of domestic abuse 
 my hon friend raise an absolutely essential point because give evidence be a deeply traumatic experience power in section of the youth justice and criminal evidence act allow the court on application to make a decision about anonymity and to take account of the circumstance of the alleged offending the alleged offender the alleged victim and so on that be a matter for the court the court have to   weigh the circumstance of the case against the overarch interest of transparency that be a matter on which the court be well place to decide 
 carshalton and wallington be suppose to be of the safe part of london but it have be shock by a number of knife and violent crime incident recently include a knife attack in wallington sainsbury ’s on christmas eve which be traumatic not only for those involve but for those who witness it can my right hon and learn friend assure i that victim and witness of terrible crime can get access to help and support while they wait for the police to build a case 
 i thank my hon friend for draw the attention of the house to that appalling incident yes it be absolutely imperative that both victim and witness can access support in the aftermath of such shocking crime as i indicate we be quadruple funding for victim and witness support by on level this be important under the victim code that we inherit support be available only for direct victim we have change that so it be now available for witness who have suffer mental or emotional harm 
 the government leave the role of victim commissioner unfille for over a year and to this day have refuse to place any duty on public body to co operate with the postholder will the government and the secretary of state explain why they have not support labour ’s proposal to give the role the same power as the domestic abuse commissioner have over public authority such as the police 
 the victim commissioner play an important role and we be delighted that baroness newlove be take it on again she have an exemplary track record the role sit within a wide approach that we be take which be to ensure through the victims and prisoners bill and through the revise victim code and so on that victim go from be spectator of the criminal justice process to participant in it i know the victim commissioner will help we on that journey 
 what be be do to ensure that victim of crime particularly violent crime get the necessary mental health support they require particularly where they can suffer ongoing mental health issue and trauma beyond the period of the crime itself 
 the hon gentleman raise an absolutely essential point as i indicate we be quadruple funding for victim service on level part of that be direct through police and crime commissioner to procure and commission precisely the kind of support he have indicate what i be also able to say be that in those tragic case that result in a fatality the homicide service be now well resource to provide ongoing support that may be physical support but it may also sadly be the mental support that be desperately need 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the prison estate for the rehabilitation of prisoner 
 in december last year we complete an estate wide programme of survey to assess the condition of each public sector prison and i look forward to see the finding of those survey by the end of the current spending review period we will have invest nearly £ towards the delivery of an additional modern prison place to ensure that the right condition be in place for the rehabilitation of prisoner and in the last full financial year we spend more than £ on maintenance and upgrade alongside of course our continued investment in purposeful activity within the prison estate 
 i be delighted to receive an invitation from the minister ’s colleague the under secretary of state for justice   the hon member for orpington gareth bacon to join he on a visit to wormwood scrubs prison in my constituency this thursday but less delighted when the invitation be withdraw yesterday on the basis that it have be issue in error have i be permit to attend i would have raise the subject of the letter send to the lord chancellor on   december   by chair of independent monitoring board for london area prison include wormwood scrubs which state that 
 prison be overcrowded not safe and most of those in prison do not lead a useful life 
 in the absence of a reply to that letter can the prisons minister tell we how he intend to make prison fit for rehabilitation give that accord to trade union source there be a maintenance backlog amount to £ 
 if the hon gentleman would like to visit the scrubs with i and i be not issue this in error i shall be happy to accompany he on a visit to his local prison 
 as i have say we continue to invest in our prison estate we also continue to invest in increase the number of prison officer to whom i pay tribute for the work that they do day in day out i suspect that those on the opposition front bench would join i in that and to invest in purposeful activity the effort that we have put in across the estate be work as be show by the proportion of prison leaver who be in employment month after their release which have more than double in the year to march i look forward to discuss this far with the hon gentleman in his local prison 
 order as a member of parliament with a prison in his area i find it disappointing that that invitation be withdraw from a member of parliament with a prison in his own area that be not how members of parliament should be treat and i hope that the question of why a member of parliament have be refuse access to a facility in his constituency will be investigate 
 i understand from my hon friend the under secretary of state that the invitation be send in error by the office it be not mean to be send but i be happy to honour that invitation 
 i hope that the minister will look into this because i be concerned about access for member of parliament i now call the chair of the select committee 
 i will not go on about how i might have get people into wormwood scrubs in the past in way or another—[interruption]—and indeed get some of they out 
 i be sure the minister will know that a key point that come up time and again in report from his majesty ’s chief inspector of prison and when issue be raise by the justice committee be the lack of purposeful activity the physical estate be part of that problem but so be issue relate to staffing and access to education and other provision be it perhaps time for a strategy for the whole of the prison service with rehabilitation at its centre and might not solution to the problem be a statutory definition of the purpose of prison of which rehabilitation along with protection of the public would be a key part would that not be a way of hold people ’s foot to the fire in order to deliver rehabilitation in the public interest 
 i shall certainly be happy to have that discussion with my hon friend if he feel that it would be useful he be right to highlight the importance of adequate staff number but i should point out that they have increase by in the past year i be also happy to tell he that this month we be launch the national regime model which will require prison to set out ambitious plan for dedicated purposeful activity time out of cell that will indeed hold their foot to the fire because as we know such a regime be central to rehabilitation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the late figure show that the reoffende rate among those leave prison have increase that be partly because prison be fail to rehabilitate which be no surprise give how overcrowded understaffed and dangerously unsafe many prison be in case after heavy rain prison officer be have to wade through raw sewage while prisoner remain lock in their cell do the minister accept that the appalling state of our prison be not only fail to reduce crime but breed it 
 the hon lady will not be surprised to hear that i do not agree with her assessment i would highlight that reoffende rate be down on where they be when we inherit they in i have highlight to the hon lady the investment in new staff and in our building i would also highlight to she and i hope that we will enjoy her support on this the success of tough community sentence in reduce reoffende compare with sentence of few than month i look forward to her support in deliver those change 
 i be go to remain on the subject of the prison estate the minister make a valiant attempt to defend the conservative woeful record on prison but they be fail to build the prison space we need to reduce this cycle of crime just last week it be reveal that the government have build only of the pop up prison cell that they promise by the end of therefore can the minister at the very least confirm when the remain pop up place will be build 
 i would gently say to the hon lady that we will take no lesson on prison building from the labour party the party that promise titan   prison with place how many be build this be a government who be commit to build new state of the art prison place prison have already be build be in construction have just receive planning permission and i be hopeful that the other of the will receive that in due course 
 what step he be take to increase early access to legal advice 
 last year we spend £ on civil legal aid to support the most vulnerable and we recognise the potential benefit of early legal advice in support people to resolve their problem early for example last year we launch a £ housing loss prevention advice service we invest in advice for welfare benefit issue and early legal advice be also available for victim of domestic abuse in private family law proceeding subject to the relevant mean and evidence requirement we will continue to invest in legal aid where we can see a benefit 
 i thank the minister for that response like many member across this house i regularly have constituent come to i with many legal issue need legal advice and support obviously many member be not appropriately qualified to offer that legal advice and support citizens advice in stoke on trent be do an excellent job try to support many of my constituent with legal issue but do my hon friend agree that it be vital that member of the public get timely and affordable legal advice when they need it 
 my hon friend be right to praise the work of voluntary organisation such as citizens advice and as i say in my original answer we agree that investing have benefit that be why since we have invest more than £ to support litigant in person include our current grant funding of around £ for improve outcome to legal support grant that be support organisation across england and wales enable they to provide urgent legal support and advice to help people resolve their legal problem that be in addition to the investment in provide support on domestic violence special guardianship order housing loss prevention and immigration 
 in its green paper publish in october the law society set out reform to legal aid to help more people get early advice can the justice secretary confirm what discussion he have have with the treasury in advance of the budget in march regard potential increase to the legal aid budget and that scotland will receive its share through barnett consequential 
 i can confirm that follow the bellamy report and the implementation of what be know as clair the criminal legal aid independent review we have invest over £ extra in the legal aid system address many of the concern that legal practitioner include the law society have raise   i can reassure the hon gentleman that i be in constant dialogue with the law society on how we can improve legal advice for citizen 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of human right legislation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of human right legislation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of human right legislation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of human right legislation 
 the united kingdom have a long stand tradition of ensure that right and liberty be protect domestically and of fulfil our international human right obligation we remain committed to a human right framework that be up to date fit for purpose and work for the british people we have take and be take action to address specific issue with the human rights act include through the illegal migration act the victims and prisoners bill and the overseas operations service personnel and veterans act which address the vexatious claim against veteran and the armed force 
 the rwanda bill be the piece of legislation that this government have introduce that they can not guarantee will comply with vital convention right do that not illustrate the total inadequacy of uk human right legislation any old government even a crumble tory government can rip up fundamental right without constraint do over the supreme court in the process 
 no i reject that characterisation the european convention on human right under article provide a right to an effective remedy we think there be a perfectly respectable argument that our legislation fulfil that we be committed to human right and we think we have a route that safeguard those right and deliver on the interest of the british people 
 the human right campaign organisation just fair have say that a human right bill for scotland would provide a blueprint for how the uk as a whole could enshrine social economic and cultural right in domestic law i be certain that the scottish government would be happy to share their experience and expertise in this area so will the secretary of state commit to engage with they with a view to bring forward equivalent uk legislation follow their example 
 i completely agree on the common interest we share across the united kingdom in want to advance social and economic right put another way   ensure good job and good public service of course that be right what be questionable be whether it be sensible to make those right justiciable as we would find people pursue all sort of action that clog up the court leave they unable to deal with other matter the hon gentleman be right on the principle we all want to achieve for people in our country be he right in want more litigation and more legislation i think we have different view on that 
 the scottish government will bring forward a human right bill for scotland which be the right thing to do give the justice secretary ’s previous statement in support of human right and the echr will he confirm his support for the scottish approach surely put human right at the heart of government and the wide public sector be the right thing to do 
 it be important not to conflate those thing we be a member of the european convention on human right i have already mention article but that do not in and of itself determine how should give effect to those right we already have the human rights act it be not at all clear to i that scotland ’s propose human right bill would advance human right across the united kingdom but of course we will listen carefully to whatever the scottish government decide to introduce 
 i be sure that the secretary of state be aware that the echr and the hra be integral to the good friday belfast agreement set out a framework for the policing and the very governance of northern ireland do he agree that any attempt to overhaul the echr and the hra from this place could have serious consequence for the community of northern ireland 
 we have a human right framework that we consider to be important we be mindful of the point that the hon gentleman raise we be satisfied that we can deliver on the priority of the british people it be a perfectly reasonable priority to want to ensure that we have warm heart but an open front door and we be satisfied that we can do so within our international legal obligation 
 it be reveal yesterday that despite the good effort of the home office an albanian speak migrant who have spend half his life in serbia and who have be jail in this country for month for cannabis farming after have enter the uk illegally have be allow to remain in britain after he successfully claim that he can not be deport to serbia because he no long speak serbian this be despite albanian be a recognise minority language in serbia and despite he live in this country with his serbian brother do this not demonstrate why we need urgent reform of the asylum system and human right law to allow the rapid and effective deportation of such dangerous criminal 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that those who come to our country and betray this nation ’s trust by act illegally should not expect a warm welcome that be why of the thing i be most proud of be sign a further prisoner transfer agreement with   the albanians to ensure that the british people have suffer the initial crime do not suffer the double punishment of have to pay £ a year to house they in bed and breakfast accommodation in the united kingdom we will send they back and that be exactly what we be do 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 may i take the justice secretary back to his interesting observation on the rwanda bill he have say that the whole debate around the echr 
 have be taint by a misunderstanding of what the actual right be as though they be a foreign import that do not reflect some of the cultural norm in our country nothing could be far from the truth ”—[official report   february vol c. 376wh 
 when it come to the rwanda bill why be he fail to uphold the echr and the human rights act which embody so many of the legal principle that the people of these island hold so dear 
 respectfully i completely reject that characterisation we be remain within the corner of our international legal obligation our legislation be novel and contentious but it remain within the corner of our international legal obligation and deliver on the proper insistent requirement of the british people which be that we protect our border and ensure fairness for all for not only the british people but those who have play by the rule and do the right thing when they have come to the uk they will always have a warm welcome in our country those who act illegally can expect short shrift 
 of course the government state on the front page of the rwanda bill that they can not guarantee that it comply with the echr as the justice secretary well know the bill also make direct intrusion into devolved area because human right be devolve to the scottish parliament so will he confirm that a legislative consent motion will be seek from the scottish parliament on the safety of rwanda 
 the point the hon gentleman be refer to be about the section 19(1)(b statement and such statement be not unusual the much miss tessa jowell take through in the bill that become the communications act there be nothing unusual about this which be precisely why this provision be put in the human rights act as for further lcm we will of course proceed in the normal way and i will give that matter further consideration 
 if he will make a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of short custodial sentence and sentence serve in the community 
 a ministry of justice analysis of a match cohort of offender show that those serve sentence of immediate custody of less than month reoffend more often than similar offender   serve a sentence in the community—55 of those sentence to less than month immediate custody be convict in the follow month which compare with among those serve their sentence in the community 
 for year i be a visitor at the scrubs and at hmp wandsworth persuade i that community sentence can be really tough 
 i suggest that the outcome speak for itself 
 i call the shadow minister 
 many many more offender will be serve their sentence in the community as a result of the measure in the upcoming sentencing bill we all know that the government have have to rush these measure out to deal with the prison capacity crisis that they have create but it be essential to recognise that these measure will rely heavily on a function probation service with only of the probation delivery unit inspect be rat as good and all other be rat as require improvement or inadequate what additional resource have be put in place to ensure that potentially dangerous criminal be be properly monitor 
 we have recently increase the budget for probation by £ and ramp up recruitment with an additional staff recruit over the last period of time 
 that be a year old announcement dress up as something new and give the extensive change in the sentencing bill i be afraid that it will just not cut it under the conservatives our vital probation service have be take to the brink of collapse and on current performance it simply can not handle the additional pressure that these measure will bring and keep the public safe so will the minister commit to ensure that the measure in the bill will not come into effect until there be not probation delivery unit still rat as inadequate 
 i thank the hon lady for her question we will keep this under review as the bill pass through the house and we will make further announcement on it in due course 
 what step he be take to improve the effectiveness of the probate registry 
 the past month have see the large volume of probate application receive by the service since and that follow year of above average receipt in response we have increase staffing level by more than people and streamlined process we have see some improvement in that the level of grant issue have be run at about more over the past month than receipt the average mean length of time for a grant of probate follow receipt of all the document require be now week 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests back in november i lead a westminster hall debate highlight the failing of the probate service the service be once excellent but that be no long the case i could give many example demonstrate its continue failure i appreciate the minister ’s effort to improve the service but enough be enough if the service have not materially improve in the next month will the minister take the appropriate action and remove those who be clearly underperforming so that the service can return to the level it once be at 
 my hon friend and i have have some interesting discussion on this topic over the past few month follow a recovery plan to address the concern that he and other have raise i can reassure he that a new management team be in place and we be now see a distinct improvement in recruitment competency productivity and call handling and for the past few month disposal have outstrip receipt i appreciate that the service be not yet where we would want it to be but i can reassure he that we be start to see some impact as a result of the measure we have introduce i be more than happy to have conversation with he so that we can work together to improve the service far 
 what step he be take to reduce the backlog of case in the crown court 
 what step he be take to reduce the backlog of case in the crown court 
 we remain committed to reduce the outstanding caseload in the crown court and have introduce a range of measure to achieve that aim we fund over sitting day in the last financial year and plan to deliver the same this year thank to our investment in judicial recruitment we expect to recruit more than judge across all jurisdiction we be invest over £ over the next year not just to improve maintenance but to ensure that the number of court take out of action for unplanned maintenance be reduce 
 i be reassure by that answer but can i press the minister on other delay in the justice system i have speak to police officer who be incredibly frustrate by the delay in prosecute those who they have arrest for multiple offence of shoplifting what reassurance can the minister offer to police officer in those circumstance 
 it be a concern to hear that police officer remain concerned some of the late performance statistic suggest that the gap between charge and list be fall the late datum show it be down day to day i be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss any local issue he may have identify that be cause delay magistrate who tend to deal with shoplifting case be among the most efficient part of our justice system and list clear case incredibly rapidly but i be more than happy to discuss this far 
 in the light of the post office scandal do my hon friend agree that it be imperative that we not only clear the backlog as quickly as possible because there have be death involve but enable the justice secretary to strip the post office of its power to independently prosecute 
 my hon friend raise a good point it be vital that the delivery of justice be swift we appreciate that the wait for trial can be extremely difficult for victim so we be do all we can to ensure that case be hear more swiftly we be urgently work on the detail of how to clear the name of the postmaster as quickly as possible and further detail will be announce in due course there should be no disparity between the standard of justice in private and public prosecution and we will carefully consider the finding of sir wyn williams ’s inquiry 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the late criminal court statistic show a crown court backlog of case once again break record the next quarter have just end so do the minister expect the figure to break record again 
 in addition to the measure that we have already take unlimited sitting day recruitment of judge investment in court to ensure they be resilient and extend nightingale court i can reassure the hon gentleman that we be build new court room to ensure we have capacity i have not see the figure on the backlog but the late figure for the number of disposals—[interruption our court and our judge be work flat out as be all member of the criminal justice system i reassure he that the level of disposal be undertake by our judiciary be up and the work of our judiciary be exemplary 
 what step he be take to reduce reoffende 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question between and the overall proven reoffende rate decrease from to the government continue to take action to drive down the reoffende rate even far by invest in initiative to get more offender into work stable accommodation and substance misuse treatment on their release 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the key to rehabilitation and end reoffende be employment and stable accommodation he have speak already about purposeful activity today but may i ask he to look at make the subsistence payment available to all prisoner on release because that would ensure access to the sort of settle accommodation that be require 
 my hon friend make an interesting suggestion i be happy to meet he if that would be helpful to discuss far his idea 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests which concern my involvement with organisation relate to addiction and recovery 
 i acknowledge the positive of roll out incentivise substance free living wing but they do not offer recovery as part of the process recovery wing offer a far great chance of rehabilitation as they get people into recovery while they be in prison and before they be release currently there be only plan across the prison estate and i think that it will take ministers to challenge civil servant and nhs fundholder to see those roll out will the minister examine the benefit of expand recovery wing across the whole of the prison estate 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for both his question and the tone in which he ask it he be absolutely right to highlight the importance of this scheme as he will be aware those wing be a relatively new step forward we be see how they operate i think if i recall they be initiate by the former deputy prime minister my right hon friend   the member for esher and walton dominic raab when he be in post in the ministry of justice i continue to look at this very carefully but i be watch to see how those wing operate but i do so with an open mind 
 what step his department be take to help ensure the safety of victim after violent offender   be   release 
 protect the public be our top priority offender be subject to strict licence condition on release which can include tag and exclusion zone and they can of course be return to prison if they breach those condition victim of violent and sexual offender serve prison sentence of month or more be legally entitle to request protect licence condition on release include exclusion zone the probation service work with partner include the police under the multi agency public protection arrangement to closely manage the risk present by the most serious offender 
 rhianon bragg ’s attacker be convict of stalk possess a firearm and make threat to kill only month ago the parole board decide that his probation release plan could not ensure public protection yet he will be automatically release next month i have send numerous letter to ministers on this matter but have receive not a single reply give that the victim live in a remote area which make conventional surveillance method virtually impossible will the secretary of state finally provide a credible response to the urgent safety risk face by victim such as rhianon 
 i thank the right hon lady for raise this case i do know about the case of rhianon bragg in the interest of complete transparency i should say that i be at school with she the government introduce extended determinate sentence in order to   well protect the public from dangerous offender by make their early release dependent on the parole board offender on extended determinate sentence must be release as the right hon lady know there be no legal power to hold they for long at the end of that custodial term however they face year of strict supervision by the probation service with strict licence condition such as exclusion zone and curfew and they will be return to prison if they breach they i be aware of the letter that be send on the to my right hon friend the minister of state he will of course be happy to meet the right hon lady to discuss those point 
 what assessment he have make of the sustainability of probation officer case load 
 we have increase funding for the probation service by £ a year to recruit more staff bring down caseload and deliver well supervision of offender in the community we have also accelerate recruitment of trainee probation officer particularly in area with the most significant staffing challenge as a result more than trainee start on training course between april and march of last year 
 probation workload be too high which be have a terrible impact on both staff morale and retention as well as public safety what consideration have the minister give to the very reasonable proposal agree between his majesty ’s prison and probation service and the probation union to free up staff time by abolish the post sentence supervision which be bring in under privatisation and be see as simply a waste of time by those probation officer and their employer 
 the hon lady raise an important point although on partial datum for this year caseload be go down she be right to highlight that they be still high she make a good point about the post sentence supervision requirement which i be happy to reflect on carefully i understand that the lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice   the right hon and learn member for cheltenham alex chalk   have meet representative to hear their view on the matter 
 whether he be take step to help improve the safeguarding of prisoner with mental health need 
 we be committed to improve mental health outcome for prisoner include recruit additional staff because have adequate staffing in prison be important invest £ of funding in the samaritans each year until march which include the delivery of the listener scheme and work alongside nhs england which be responsible for deliver mental health support service in the custodial estate to ensure that they be join up and effective 
 i have be work with a constituent whose son sadly take his own life in pentonville last year although it be well establish that there be a high rate of mental health problem among prisoner the provision of support be insufficient and even reliable datum on the scale of the issue be lack will the government commit to a full review of the support and safeguarding for prisoner with mental health problem 
 i be grateful to the hon lady and i hope that through she i can pass on my sympathy and condolence to her constituent i be not aware of the detail of that case but if she want to write to i i would be happy to look at that specific case sadly there be too many death in custody and every be a tragedy so i be always happy to look at way in which we can well improve the support available to those with mental health condition or other health condition that might make they more vulnerable within a custodial environment 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i thank the many his majesty ’s prison and probation service and his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service staff who continue to work hard over the christmas period to deliver justice and keep we safe since the last justice question the victims and prisoners bill have pass its reading in this house it will enshrine the overarch principle of the victim code in law it will establish a permanent independent public advocate for victim of major incident and it will enable a check on parole board decision in the interest of public safety the sentencing bill which be crack down on the bad offender by extend whole life order for any murder involve sexual or sadistic conduct also pass its reading as do the criminal justice bill which will ensure among other thing that criminal face up to the consequence of their appalling action by require they to attend their sentencing hearing 
 finally in december i take part in a park run at hmp onley alongside prison staff and serve prisoner congratulation to all who take part except perhaps my private secretary who have the audacity to beat i 
 the minister mention sexual offence but it frustrate i beyond belief that my constituent have to wait on average day for their case to be hear be the distress cause take into account or be the system too break 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the issue of victim of serious sexual offence we take that incredibly seriously and that be why we have introduce measure such as section which enable evidence to be take and record in advance we have increase the fee for barrister to make that more straightforward we have also increase the number of independent sexual violence adviser who accompany as it be those victim on that journey that be very important to prevent dropout rate this be an important point the sentencing level be much high up by compare with 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests in that my wife be an education lawyer parent appeal decision in relation to education health and care plan and health need be force to wait between month and month from appeal registration to hearing that be far too long in term of a child ’s development do my hon friend agree with that do he also share my concern that some school be delay provide education health and care plan in the knowledge that it will take a year or more to have an appeal 
 my right hon friend be right despite special educational need and disability appeal and disposal be up by and respectively i do share his concern and systematic reform be require that be why through the send and alternative provision improvement plan the department for education and ourselves will be work hard to ensure that it be improve i be more than happy to meet my right hon friend to go through the detail

 the children ’s commissioner ’s report on family contact in the youth estate state that at the weekend in young offender institutes boy spend only up to hour outside their cell each day we can clearly see why that have lead to an increase in violence what be the minister go to do about it 
 it be important to note that since when we come into power the number of under-18s in custody have drop dramatically the cohort now in young offender institute be to put it politely highly complex we take that extremely seriously and want to ensure there be sufficient staff we do not give up on people but it be important to recognise that that cohort will have be convict of extremely serious offence and we want to ensure there be sufficient resource to try to get the good out of they 
 i recently meet the senior coroner for my area about concern over health service in north wales and to discuss preventable death as part of that work he point i towards the preventable deaths tracker set up by dr georgia richards in oxford will the secretary of state commit to meet dr richards and i to discuss the potential benefit of the tracker

 numerous study have find that the number of minoritised and migrant woman be hold on remand be disproportionately high for example of female black and asian defendant be remand in custody    by magistrate court compare with of white woman what step be the government take to address those clear inequality in the use of remand 
 i be grateful to the hon lady she will be aware of the work be do across the criminal justice system through both the race disparity review and the lammy review in that context decision on remand be take by the judiciary so it would be wrong for i to comment on judicial decision but i be happy to meet she to discuss this far if that would be helpful and so be the minister for disparity in the justice system my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer 
 can the secretary of state confirm that the director of public prosecutions could take over a private prosecution and discontinue it 
 the crown prosecution service can take over any criminal prosecution it may then carry out the prosecution or it may end or discontinue the prosecution if it do not believe it should have be bring in the place 
 i be pleased to say that the late scottish crime and justice survey have show that the volume of crime in scotland include incident not report to the police have fall by in addition we have of the low level of record crime in scotland since 1974—50 year i add my thank to all those who work in police scotland tayside for their duty and service on behalf of my constituent in dundee will the justice secretary join i in congratulate police scotland and all the community safety partner who have contribute to that success 
 we of course welcome any reduction in crime and i be happy to congratulate police scotland on its work it be encourage that across the united kingdom and certainly across england and wales crime and reoffending be down however i urge the hon gentleman to ensure that scotland do not anything that would be regrettable such as roll back on jury trial which be a critical part of maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system 
 have work in a&e at christmas over the year i have see the outcome of alcohol relate violence and the injury it cause i know the department have be look at fitting alcohol monitor tag for offender during the festive season what assessment have the government make of their effectiveness in reduce alcohol fuelled crime 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point alcohol tag be hugely valuable and be be use increasingly to tackle alcohol relate offending include violent crime successfully around individual be wear an alcohol tag at the end of november more than in the same period the year before and alcohol ban impose in community sentence be comply with for of the day monitor since their introduction in october they be a vital crime fight tool 
 in may my constituent tallulah cox be diagnose with brain stem cancer she be leave catatonic from the radiation treatment a side effect that her parent zoe and richard be never inform about they then have to fight constantly for the support and care that she need from her local council and nhs that support never come little tallulah pass away on november last year 
 order this be topical question i have to get everybody else in if the hon lady be go to ask a topical question it must be short and quick to allow other to ask theirs have the minister be brief on what be be ask 
 no 
 okay very quickly then please just ask the question 
 little tallulah pass away aged on   november   last year after those service fail she how can her parent get some justice 
 this sound like an absolutely appalling case and my heart go out to tallulah and her family i be unaware of the detail of the case but if the hon lady write to i she will get a response 
 dozen of business have sign up to torbay council ’s safety of woman at night charter which be be champion by councillor hayley tranter what step be the government take to ensure that those who pose a threat to woman for example by spike drink get the type of deterrent sentence that such disgraceful behaviour deserve 
 i congratulate torbay council and councillor tranter on their excellent work to keep woman safe in torbay spike be a disgusting crime that carry a maximum sentence of year in prison depend on the harm that result we be change the offence against the person act to define the offence of spike specifically and comprehensively in law with a view to encourage more people to come forward however the big barrier to conviction remain the fact that toxicology test be often conduct after the substance have leave a woman ’s body that be why we be invest in research for rapid drink testing kit so that spiking will be easy to prove and we get more of the offender behind bar 
 my constituent be the victim of a violent attack but because the perpetrator get a sentence of less than month she be not tell when he be release from prison the police say that it be impossible for they to go through the record of everybody who be release in order to advise she so there be a gap in victim support will the secretary of state commit to resolve that 
 the hon lady raise an important point i take that extremely seriously certainly under the victim code the right of victim to be keep inform   be far tight than ever they use to be if we need to go far that seem to be a sensible conversation and i would be happy to have it 
 for too many year this house have be witness to wrongful conviction in the post office fujitsu scandal there remain post office conviction base on bad datum until those conviction be overturn the victim can not claim compensation we could do something good together if the justice secretary bring a simple bill to quash all conviction immediately 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend who with his customary precision put his finger on that appalling injustice the suggestion that he make be receive active consideration i expect to be able to make further announcement shortly 
 i add my support to the comment make by   the hon member for hertford and stortford julie marson cuckooing be a terrible activity and make it a specific crime not only make sense but would i suspect lead to the prosecution of other crime such as drug dealing 
 as i indicate i will have a conversation with my hon friend   the member for hertford and stortford julie marson   about that there be very likely to be a substantive underlying offence be it handle steal good possession with intent to supply or firearm matter this have be consider by way of discussion with criminal justice partner but if there be further matter to consider with my hon friend and indeed with the hon gentleman i would be happy to have those conversation 
 january be often consider family breakdown month anybody take the terrifically difficult decision to separate this year will face not only a divorce cost over £ on average but month or potentially more than a year of resolve child and financial dispute we need reform of focus in a range of area will the lord chancellor kindly agree to meet i and the formidable baroness deech and baroness shackleton to look at our campaign 
 my hon friend raise an important point i know that she campaign tirelessly on this issue i be more than happy to arrange a meeting with my noble friend lord bellamy who lead on this issue to update she and the noble baroness deech 
 order i call richard burgon 
 to reduce reoffende we need a strong locally focused and stand alone probation service similar to how thing be before privatisation so why be the government move in the opposite direction with their hmpps programme which have trigger a formal dispute with the probation union because it subsume probation still far into prison 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question it be nice to answer question from he again as i do when he be shadow secretary of state 
 the hmpps programme be about different part of the system work well together to create a system that deliver the outcome that society want to see i take the opportunity prompt by the hon gentleman to pay tribute to all the staff in the probation service i have the pleasure of visit some of they in southwark recently and i pay tribute to all the work they be do 
 in a perfect world the victim of the horizon it scandal would have their case individually assess by the criminal cases review commission and the court of appeal but we be not in a perfect world the scale of the miscarriage of justice be enormous and there be hundred of victim who understandably do not want to come forward because they have lose faith in the process will my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor now consider the exceptional and unique step of legislate to quash the conviction 
 i be grateful to my right hon and learn friend who speak with such authority the circumstance be truly exceptional when i be a back bencher i go on the record as say that horizon be the most serious miscarriage of justice since the guildford or the birmingham but the clue be that there be in the guildford case and in the birmingham case we be talk about hundred of people the situation be truly exceptional and unprecedented and it will need an appropriate resolution 
 under the illegal migration act victim of human trafficking who arrive in the uk via irregular route would not have legal recourse to receive support under modern    slavery provision be ministers comfortable with that they do not look like monster so i assume not if they be not what will they do about it 
 i will have to write to the hon gentleman and check exactly what the provision be for legal aid under the illegal migration act i be more than happy to provide he with the detail and meet he if necessary 
 precisely because legislate to overturn conviction would be so unprecedented will my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor make sure that before such a step be take he be satisfied from conversation with the senior judiciary that the mean of triage and consolidate appeal that currently exist may not be capable of deliver justice within an acceptable timeframe 
 that be precisely the point and my hon friend have put his finger on it of course we would not want to stray into the normal lane of the judiciary we have huge respect for our independent judiciary who do an exceptionally good job of ensure that there be fairness on the fact before they as i have say the case be wholly unprecedented and we will want to have exhaust all alternative before take radical action 
 spending on housing legal aid have fall by more than half in the past decade from £ to £ be this a proper response to grow insecurity overcrowding and poor condition in the housing market or might it be a contribute factor 
 i have to say to the hon gentleman that just last year we invest an extra £ in housing legal aid so i think we be address the issue 
 on a point of order mr speaker the financial times be report that teesworks ltd the so call public private partnership to redevelop the former steelwork site on teesside have report an exceptional year triple its profit to £ sadly the public will see very little of that hard cash as under the tees tory mayor of share in the company be hand over to local businessman that mean they get £ and the public get just £ personally i think that be scandalous 
 when my hon friend   the member for middlesbrough andy mcdonald   and i raise question about the way that business be do at teesworks the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities order an inquiry which be expect to have report by now will you please advise i mr speaker on whether you have hear of any plan by the secretary of state to come to the house to make a statement about why that report have be delay and when we can expect it 
 i have have no indication from the government that the secretary of state intend to make a statement on this matter but i be sure that those on the treasury bench will have hear the hon gentleman ’s remark and i be sure he will pursue it in other way no doubt if nothing be forthcoming it might need an urgent question that be a possible suggestion 
 on a point of order mr speaker for the convenience of the house it may assist right hon and hon member if i give some advance notice of thursday ’s business statement 
 the business for the week commence   january   will include 
 monday january committee of the whole house and remain stage of the animal welfare livestock exports bill 
 tuesday january committee of the whole house on the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill day 
 wednesday january committee of the whole house on the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill day 
 i will announce the business statement on thursday in the usual way 
 while that be not a point of order for the chair i be sure the house will have hear the announcement by the leader of the house with great interest i call the shadow leader of the house 
 far to that point of order mr speaker be this not just another example of this government make it up as they go along with no real plan scrabble around and try to make something of this fail unworkable plan we have have at least business statement or question since the bill begin to be timetable would you not expect mr speaker such an announcement to be make in a business statement in the usual way 
 far to that point of order mr speaker it may be helpful if i explain to the house that if i have wait to announce this for the time on thursday there would have be very limited time for people to table amendment ahead of the normal tabling deadline we be make this announcement to facilitate right hon and hon member in table amendment if they wish to do so we do not wish to bring forward legislation that will not be successful this be a matter of great importance to the general public and we wish it to be successful i hope the house will understand why we have give it a head up of the business for next week 
 far to that point of order mr speaker normally business statement allow back benchers as well as front benchers to ask question of the leader of the house this be a difficult precedent because it do not give the back benchers a voice say that it be just a matter of convenience for amendment be not good enough when the government be in charge of the business and could have do this in a more organised way to give everybody a say i think this be a deplorable development 
 in general i would expect the house business to be announce via a statement or in response to the business question it would of course be in order to ask question about the timetabling of this business during thursday ’s business statement but you have make the point and at least you have get it on the record let we move on 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision to require every school to have access to a qualified mental health professional and for connected purpose 
 mr speaker 
 he use to be such a lovely happy little boy and now he ’ so sad i ’m terrified for his future all i ’ve ever want be to help my son and i ’ve fail and fall at every hurdle 
 those be the anguished word of a constituent of mine who be mother to a year old week in and week out i speak to parent whose child be struggle with their mental health and struggle to access appropriate support when i speak to headteacher they tell i that some of the most pressing challenge face our education system come from outside the classroom and mental health be among the big teacher often feel as though they be the emergency service fill the gap leave by under resource service across the country 
 let we be clear mental health service for young people before the pandemic be inadequate since the pandemic despite the good effort of everyone work in the sector service be on their knee the current generation of child have have to contend not only with rise pressure and judgment bring by social medium but with the huge consequence of a global pandemic it be unsurprise that such challenge have take their toll on child ’s and young people ’s mental health 
 it be estimate that in child between the age of and have a probable mental health disorder if child in every classroom be diagnose with a physical condition such as diabetes there would rightly be a public outcry and there would be no discussion about urgently put both proper treatment and preventive measure in place we would just do it mental health be no different and should not be treat any differently 
 we must do everything in our power to ensure that every child arrive at school happy healthy and ready to learn and thrive my bill provide of the tool to help to achieve that it would place a dedicated qualified mental health practitioner in every school primary and secondary give every child in school access to care and support from the moment they start to need it 
 early intervention be crucial research tell we that half of all lifetime mental health disorder start before the age of step in as soon as warning sign start to show can often help to prevent condition from become more severe when nicole now age be struggle with her mental health she have to wait a very long time before she could access any support describe that time she say 
 wait for suitable mental health support mean that my whole life feel like it be pause and erase i be leave without suitable support and my mental health leave to deteriorate 
 this story be not unique nor be it unusual i know that colleague across the chamber be aware of many similar story in their own constituency 
 the state of our child and young people ’s mental health be a significant and urgent challenge face our country and frankly this government be not take it seriously enough in december the health and social care committee warn that the combination of unmet need before the pandemic and additional need create by the pandemic be significant it say that the government ’s plan 
 be simply not sufficient for the task at hand 
 in the year since there be no indication that their approach have improve last month when i ask the mental health minister   the hon member for lewes maria caulfield in a write question what proportion of mental health funding have be allocate to child and young people i receive an answer that such fund be not separately identifiable how can a government begin to take a problem seriously when they do not even know how much money they be spend on it 
 sadly in the eye of the treasury child and young people be too often see as a financial burden and a drain on government resource and that be just wrong spend on education and service to support our child be an investment in their future and our country ’s future and it be time that the government recognise that 
 the introduction of mental health support team have be an encouraging step forward but they be under resource and overstretch last year i visit carshalton boys sports college i meet mhst staff as well as some of the pupil they be support the boy talk about how the team have help they to learn cop technique for anxiety and how to identify the technique that work for they the staff mention how important it be that they could intervene early before thing escalate and child need other service such as child and adolescent mental health service but what strike i be that the team be stretch thinly across many local primary and secondary school which mean that their valuable skill and service be available only for half a day to day per week in each school 
 furthermore research by the liberal democrats reveal that by the end of this year half of secondary school and quarter of all primary school in england will still have no access at all to mental health support team instead the role of support child ’s mental ill health fall on teacher who be already manage a heavy workload at the same time as contend with extremely overstretch budget with many school struggle to afford the basic sadly some of those that have find their own money for mental health support be be force to cut back which be why school must not have to fund the provision themselves 
 my bill make it clear that funding need to be make available for the propose statutory duty for all state school use the polluter pay principle liberal democrats have propose fund mental health practitioner through triple the digital service tax on our big social medium company give the harm that they have contribute to our child ’s mental health 
 a big challenge currently face school be persistent absence with the most recent government datum reveal that a of child miss on average a day of school every fortnight last term of the most significant causal factor of absence be mental ill health accord to new datum from youngminds more than in child wait for mental health support have miss more than month of school 
 absence have a huge impact on a child ’s education and ultimately their prospect quarter of these child say that they have stop exercise do hobby and even see friend these child should be carefree enjoy themselves and spend time with love one instead their life be be put on hold and their life chance be diminish because they can not access the support they have so bravely ask for 
 just last week i hear of a pupil at a school in my constituency who be stick in exactly that limbo despite desperately need mental health support they be stick on a long camhs waiting list in the meantime not only have the child stop attend school but their mother say that they have not leave the house in more than month a teacher at the school tell i that they strongly believe that have there be the possibility of see a mental health professional at school on a regular basis that pupil would still be attend school instead their mental health be rapidly deteriorate leave those around they worried sick sadly this be not uncommon alarmingly the headteacher of this pupil tell i that it be just example of many 
 there be a tidal wave of mental ill health among our child and young people which be jeopardise their wellbeing education prospect and long term health a report commission by the local government association and undertake by the children and young people ’s mental health coalition assert that there be 
 a miss opportunity to significantly ease pressure on the system by increase the availability of preventative and early intervention support 
 that be exactly what put a mental health practitioner in every school would do it would make mental health support accessible to every pupil regardless of their age where they live or their background it would save our nhs money in the long term by tackle issue before they become more severe and it would ensure that child ’s mental health be support early on give they the tool they need to be resilient and thrive into adulthood 
 the bill be an investment in our future and that we must make not just because it be sensible but because we owe it to this generation of child and young people a generation that so often feel let down and neglect i would like to end by thank the young people parent and teacher who have share their story with i as well as the organisation that have support i with the bill include youngminds the centre for mental health barnardo ’s place2be the british association for counselling and psychotherapy and the sutton trust they be all dedicate to ensure that every child have the right support in their time of need the bill would be a significant step towards achieve that 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that munira wilson ed davey daisy cooper helen morgan layla moran sarah dyke richard foord sarah green sarah olney tim farron and wera hobhouse present the bill 
 munira wilson accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday june and to be print bill 
 i inform the house that i have select the amendment in the name of the prime minister 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i beg to move 
 that this house recognise that nhs dentistry be in crisis with in dentist in england not take on new nhs patient and vast part of the country consider so call dental desert where no dentist be available regret that this have lead to people resort to diy dentistry or attend a&e to access urgent care be concerned that tooth decay be the most common reason child age to be admit to hospital and therefore call on the government to provide an extra urgent appointment a year introduce an incentive scheme to recruit new dentist to the area most in need and a target supervised toothbrushing scheme for to year old to promote good oral health and reform the dental contract to rebuild the service in the long run 
 happy new year mr speaker 
 after year of conservative neglect and mismanagement 
 nhs dentistry in england be at its most perilous point in its year history 
 that be the conclusion of the nuffield trust think thank and who can blame it in nhs dentist no long take new patient accord to the nhs no dentist be take on new adult patient in entire constituency such as broxtowe bolsover stoke on trent south and stroud patient try but fail to get an appointment in the past year million more need dental care but do not bother try to book an appointment because they know it would be impossible tooth decay be now the no reason why child age to end up in hospital we face the moral outrage of in brit say that they have be force to attempt dentistry themselves because the nhs be not there for they when they need it this be dickensian diy dentistry in century britain be there any great example of the decline that this country have be subject to under the conservatives 
 may i add rotherham to the list that my hon friend be quote to give an example of my constituent have be try for more than a year to register with an nhs dentist he have now have to go private for the consultation which say 
 your tooth be in a very poor condition with most of your remain tooth decay and unsaveable all your tooth except need extract 
 he have be live for more than a year on painkiller and soup i have raise this with the minister and get no satisfaction this be what tory britain be do to dentistry 
 i totally agree with my hon friend we have hear so many heartbreaking story like the she mention from her constituency a service that once be there for all of we when we need it be almost go for good 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will so that the hon gentleman can explain why that be the case 
 be there any great landmine of a labour legacy than the contract that it design which be pull we down labour member need look no far than their own design on the nhs we be sort out their mess 
 the sound you can hear mr speaker be the scraping of the barrel how have the hon gentleman get the brass neck to stand up after year of his party in government and say that a contract agree in be the problem if only the conservatives have be in government for year to sort it out 
 here be the other rub we do not pretend that everything be perfect under the last labour government in fact reform of the nhs dentistry contract be in labour ’s manifesto because we recognise that it need to change have we be elect in we would have deliver it be also in the conservative manifesto and manifesto it be probably in the and manifesto too and they have not deliver we have year of conservative failure how dare the hon gentleman have the brass neck to stand up and blame someone else 
 it be of great interest be it not that there be not member from the govern party in scotland present for this debate i can tell the house that dental service in my constituency in remote scotland have go backwards in a big way and i be shocked that none of they be here to hear this 
 it be deeply disappointing let i assure the hon gentleman that as with the last labour government—13 year that create a rise tide that lift all ship across the country when we have an nhs with the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history the next labour government will deliver a rise tide to benefit people across the country 
 the british dental association highlight that 
 hormonal change during pregnancy can make gum more vulnerable to plaque 
 and 
 change to dietary habit and morning sickness 
 can also impact on oral health after be tell of the importance of see a dentist after suffer multiple miscarriage a constituent tell i that she have be struggle for year to see a dentist within a mile radius of her home dentist say that they be go private and be help only with emergency surely that be evidence of a colossal failure of tory government dental policy and even the most vulnerable be suffer 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend in fact he have the ability as the labour mp for stockton north to speak for his resident if only other people across the country have mp stand up for they chris webb labour ’s candidate in blackpool   south report to i that pregnant mother have be tell he they can not get an nhs dentist despite be entitle to free nhs check up and treatment alice macdonald labour ’s candidate in norwich north report similar conversation to i expectant mother have tell she that they have be travel hundred of mile to see a dentist when we know that pregnant woman probably need that support more than many other what an indictment of year of conservative government 
 do my hon friend see the report in today ’s times that show that nhs dentist be perform only of the procedure they be contract to do in devon and somerset where the situation be the bad in the country it be only and not only have this government deliver an nhs desert in devon and somerset but they be waste mass of public money what be my hon friend go to do about it when he be health secretary 
 i strongly agree with my right hon friend thing be so desperate he mention the south west in particular and devon and cornwall have be particularly poorly serve jayne kirkham labour ’s candidate in truro and falmouth for this year ’s general election report to i that a local dentist hand their contract back before christmas mean that people lose their nhs dentist overnight there be currently no dentist in truro and falmouth take on adult nhs patient contract reform be urgent so where be it they have have year so where be the recovery plan that the health secretary mention in her amendment 
 rise 
 i must make some progress 
 turn to other part of the country keir cozens labour ’s candidate in great yarmouth have be run a campaign on the state of dentistry in great yarmouth he have hear heartbreaking story of broken tooth leave for month with people in pain of child unable to be see of at least person a day go to accident and emergency with dental issue and of people perform diy dentistry at home after buy kit from amazon no should be do that but people be desperate diy dentistry do not work and before you know it people be back in a&e wait for expensive emergency dental treatment i have hear similar story from kevin bonavia labour ’s candidate in stevenage he tell i that people turn to diy be shockingly common 
 no vote for this none of the conservative prime ministers the conservative chancellors or the conservative health secretaries tell the public that this be what the future hold but this be what they have do to dentistry it be the way all our public service be go and it be why the conservative party can not be allow more year to finish the job 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for bring this debate forward the stat from the british dental association can not be ignore in its survey of practice owner and of associate dentist say that they would like to leave nhs dentistry as soon as possible this debate will resonate with many people out there do he agree with the chair of the northern ireland dental practice   committee that now be the time for the funding allocation to pay for a well contract and for train more dedicated dentist who will commit to the nhs rather than private practice 
 i agree with the hon gentleman about the urgency of the situation there be a different path available to we we can revive our public service and give our country back what we use to take for grant labour ’s plan would take immediate step to rescue nhs dentistry with more urgent appointment and the recruitment of new dentist in the area most in need we would also take the necessary step to rebuild nhs dentistry over the long term include reform the dental contract and introduce supervised toothbrushing for to year old in primary school so that poor oral health be prevent and demand on the service reduce 
 in fact some of my labour colleague be not even wait for the general election to start make a difference labour ’s candidate in stroud simon opher himself a gp have spearhead a campaign work with local dentist and the integrated care board from opposition he have more than treble the number of emergency appointment available each day across gloucestershire pioneer a new dental stabilisation scheme for people not know to a local practice open up more than appointment a week and introduce supervised toothbrushing in local primary school if that be the difference simon be make in opposition imagine what he will be able to do as a labour mp work with a labour government that government can not come soon enough 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech do he agree with i and my constituent in crouch end who have not have a check up since that the link between poor oral health and oral cancer be serious that could be contribute to the terrible problem we have with cancer waiting time 
 i totally agree with my hon friend prevention be well than cure it be a truism and it be also the foundation pillar of what would be labour ’s year plan for reform and modernisation of our national health service a part of that plan be before the house today and government members will have to explain to their constituent only month if not week away from a general election why they be refuse to support it 
 the government ’s amendment to the motion promise that the dental recovery plan be come soon but it be due last summer now they can not put a date on when the plan will arrive when it will be implement or even say what it be conservative ministers have take a look at the state of nhs dentistry at the million of people across the country who can not get an appointment to see a dentist and at child in their own constituency whose tooth be rot and their conclusion be what be the rush let i tell they why they should get their skate on 
 a year old boy in plymouth have to undergo emergency surgery on an abscess in his mouth last year he spend month try to book an nhs dentist he   say that he be on hold for about hour per day accord to figure on the nhs website no dentist be take on new nhs patient in the plymouth moor view constituency it be leave too late and when he finally get the healthcare he need he require emergency surgery which have leave he scarred for life 
 in worthing west labour ’s candidate dr beccy cooper tell i of an year old great grandfather on pension credit who tell she that he will not be go back to an nhs dentist before he die he try to get an nhs dentist in worthing but no will take he on the nhs to receive low cost treatment dr beccy cooper also tell i that resident who can not get a dentist be be tell to look for in hampshire more than mile away from where they live 
 on that important point a couple who move into new housing in my constituency try to get an nhs dentist for over a year without any success whatsoever they have get option they either go private or use their previous dentist who be mile away that be wholly unacceptable will my hon friend simply explain how labour ’s plan will eradicate this unacceptable issue 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we will have appointment make a difference straightaway supervise toothbrushing for to year old to reduce future demand on nhs service and reform of the nhs dentistry contract so that we can rebuild an nhs dentistry service worthy of the name that change can not come soon enough 
 my constituent amy have be in contact with i about the difficulty that she and her child have have get nhs dentist appointment she explain that her husband be in the military and therefore they have to move home frequently and each time they move they find it hard to get an nhs dentist do my hon friend agree that that be a shameful way to treat people who have serve and give so much to our country 
 i agree i be afraid that when it come to serve personnel and veteran there be a gulf between what the government say and promise and what they do that be not the only example 
 thing not in the government ’s amendment to labour ’s motion be a pledge to protect the nhs dentistry budget that be odd because the prime minister promise to do exactly that month ago the truth be that the prime minister break that pledge in november when he give the go ahead for dentistry underspend to be raid effectively wave the white flag on the future of the service can you believe it despite everything we have hear there be dentistry underspend and the prime minister think that other thing be great priority than this crisis the consequence of that decision be now be feel the budget in some area of the country be run out and dentist be have to stop nhs work for the remainder of the year it be so deeply frustrating 
 nhs dentist want to do more nhs work it be the government who be stand in their way the nuffield trust ’s stark report into the crisis suggest that nhs   dentistry may have to be scale back and make available only to the least well off such an approach would be the end of nhs dentistry as a universal public service yet that be exactly the approach that the government be pilot in cornwall child the over-80s and those with specific health need be give treatment everyone else have to go private or go without they will not admit it but this be the future under the tories further neglect decline and patient make to go without 
 bad still nhs dentistry be the ghost of christmas yet to come under the tories that be not partisan overreaction on our part that be accord to the lead author of the nuffield trust ’s report he write 
 for the wide health system the lesson be troubling without political honesty and a clear strategy the same long term slide from aspiration to reality could happen in other area of primary care too 
 what have happen to nhs dentistry under the tories be come to the rest of the nhs if they be give another year that be not the continuity that the country be look for it be look for change with labour 
 my bath constituency be also describe as an nhs dental desert the only option for people be to go private the hon member have already say that it be dickensian do he agree that it be not just a health problem but an equality issue that the government fail to recognise 
 i totally agree in fact claire hazelgrove labour ’s candidate in filton and bradley stoke next door to the forthcoming by election be tell i about problem in her constituency and that exact challenge of people be leave without or have to go private patient tell she that her dental practice be now only see private patient that same patient care for her year old dad with dementia who need a tooth removal to allow he to eat his appointment be also cancel that be what be happen before our eye 
 what of those who can not afford it anna dixon labour ’s candidate in shipley tell i of a woman in her town who have be turn away as an nhs patient and could not afford to go private she be struggle with pain it be affect her eating and she be at her wit end with the tories if you have not get the money you have not get the care 
 as a neighbouring mp i thank my hon friend for mention claire hazelgrove our candidate in filton and bradley stoke who be do tremendous work on this i have do a survey of my constituency and have find that about of bristol nhs practice be not take on new patient issue i have also come across be that even when people do have access to an nhs dentist they can not afford even those low fee and as a result they be be remove from the active patient list and lose access to that we can understand how during the cost of living crisis people might delay a check up for a few month because there be so many other press demand on their budget 
 i totally agree and i do not think we should be complacent about this as a country the nhs be already become a tier healthcare system where   those who can afford to go private be pay and the rest be leave with an increasingly poor service for poor people government members protest now but they admit their goal once they leave the department for health and social care the health secretary ’s predecessor may not have say it when they be in her place at the dispatch box but as soon as they be out the door of the department the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock and for bromsgrove sir sajid javid say what they really believe patient should be charge for gp appointment well why stop there with this conservative philosophy why not go far that be the future for the health service if the conservative party be give another year that be the risk face patient across the country and that be the choice face voter at the next general election further neglect mismanagement and decline under the conservative or change with labour and a decade of national renewal 
 on nhs dentistry the need for change could not be clear by the conservative party ’s own admission it do not have a plan just the vague promise of come in the future all it do have be a record of year of failure if we stick to the current path full universal access to nhs dentistry may be go for good the conservatives may be happy to wave goodbye to this vital public service but that be not the labour way with labour there be a clear plan with immediate step to tackle the crisis and long term reform to rebuild dentistry there will be more appointment more dentist more support for child and long term reform to put the service on a sustainable footing pay for by abolish the non dom tax status that be because labour believe that people who live and work in britain should pay their taxis here too it do not matter whether they live on downing street or any other street if they make their money here in britain they should pay their taxis here too 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech abby lane in my constituency have contact over dental practice not be accept she and her year old child who desperately need dental treatment be it not the case that we now need to reform the system so that local commissioner can ensure that dental commissioning be happen in local area where there be need and not just have this patchwork system where dentist be flee because it be not pay well enough 
 i totally agree the tragedy be that if we look at the system as a whole and think about the pressure the whole system be under and if we get nhs dentistry right we would not only be save patient untold pain but save the nhs money as lucy rigby labour ’s candidate in northampton north report to i in tooth decay force of her local patient to a&e bad for they and more expensive for the taxpayer 
 if tory member disagree with charge non dom their fair share maybe they could explain in their own contribution why they disagree i be sure that their constituent would love to hear their defence of the non dom and we would be happy to give they space on labour leaflet to quote their argument back at they and let the public decide i would particularly like to know why the prime minister be so wed to this tax break for the wealthy 
 while tory member be set to oppose labour ’s rescue motion today i understand that our plan on supervised toothbrushing for to year old have receive an endorsement from an unlikely source on his podcast former conservative chancellor george osborne say 
 that really be the nanny state in action
