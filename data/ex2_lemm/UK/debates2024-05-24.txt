 my colleague ’s story remind i of another particularly in this week when we have finally right the long stand injustice of the infected blood scandal i remember alistair burt stand around here talk about it at the end of the parliament and that be very recently in relation to the length of that scandal and the post office horizon scandal i remember that as i leave the public accounts committee in after some year tony collins the renowned computer journalist telephone i about it luckily because i be then involve in other matter to do with housing james arbuthnot and many other in this place take it up very seriously 
 as we finally correct those wrong this week and be remind of other huge wrong over many decade such as the correct by the work of those include andy burnham the hillsborough scandal and of other great work by many other great colleague i be remind of another story consider the following 
 investigation into the allegation have reveal they to be a mixture of unsubstantiated rumour incorrect information or repetition of early allegation which have be fully investigate and find to be unsupported by the fact 
 a question be that official statement aim at refute public disquiet about the efficacy of measure take against foot and mouth the reliability of the army ’s s80 rifle and radio set in kosovo and sierra leone a government order that police should keep protester out of sight during the state visit of the president of china the possibility that bse can cross the species barrier to human the loss of an raf chinook helicopter and security personnel on the mull of kintyre the existence of illness collectively know as gulf war syndrome the export to iraq of machine tool capable of arm manufacture 8) the circumstance surround the torpedoing of the belgrano the radiation sickness claim by some participant in the british atomic test of the 1950s 
 which my hon friend   the member for basildon and billericay mr baron   have so assiduously campaign on have even join by telephone a surgery that i have with my constituent because i know that he know more about that matter than anyone else 
 experiment carry out at porton down during the same period the denial of full pension to thousand of disabled ex servicemen and their widow for over year or the loss of the carrier hms glorious and her escort in 
 the answer be that the statement be make by the ministry of defence in december to refute a body of opinion that there might indeed be a condition refer to as gulf war syndrome but it could just as well have be those other 
 we all know this it be a phenomenon that tim slessor in his book ministry of deception”—which i be quote from here refer to as the whitehall loop 
 at its simple this be the closed circuit procedure where in reply to question ask of a government department or minister the answer be put together by the very same civil servant whose early judgement be both the subject and the cause of the inquiry in the place 
 i remember bump into simon burns who be at the time the health minister responsible for the national programme for it in the health service the npfit as it be call there be at least other ministers during that period i track it closely from to i would not recommend that anyone read it unless they have a particularly masochistic disposition but in the book that i write about government i devote an entire chapter to the npfit where i lovingly detail the many way in which what be then call connect for health manage to conceal information about how badly thing be go day simon burns come up to i in the tea room and say richard i be sick and tired of be tell thing by you and then find out month later that they be true 
 the truth be that whether it be on the child support agency the criminal records bureau the tax credit scandal the rural payments agency scandal which have lead some farmer sadly to commit suicide the student loans company or the recruitment of junior doctor or many many other thing it be our constituent who through we as their member of parliament keep government honest they so often know far more about how government be actually work than the government themselves do that be why we need members of parliament who see their chief job as represent and protect their constituent and as require the government of the day of whichever political complexion to justify themselves and to keep explain their action 
 i be delighted to see my friend   the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge   back in her place of the various thing i have do in the year i have be here i have not find any more consequential or more fun than the work we do together when i be her deputy chairman on the public accounts committee between and she perform an extraordinary service and by the way write a great book about it call to account which hon member may wish to read 
 it say next in my note dame eleanor say but that be because when i write they you be not in your seat madam deputy speaker as you yourself say yesterday mps of all party be the people who do not just shout at the television but 
 get up and do something about it ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 it be an honourable estate it be an honourable calling it be of the most important thing we can do it be worth devote oneself to to the point of exhaustion in order to keep our people free and to keep our government honest 
 it say here self commission housing so i suppose i have well say a word about that before i conclude it be well know that for the past year or so since i steer through the self build and custom housebuilding act i have work very hard to try to implement that i see the former prime minister my right hon friend   the member for maidenhead mrs may nod   i remember bounce up to she in the lobby many year ago when she be prime minister and say be it true that self build housing be discuss at cabinet this morning she say yes 
 i be sorry to report that there be still more to do i see   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   in her place i nearly succeed in coax she into give evidence for the report i do in for the then prime minister it be several prime ministers ago we have have quite a few there be some excellent recommendation in there some of which have even be implement i write to the current housing secretary on   march   with some detailed suggestion about how the recommendation might be implement 
 i will sit down in or minute but i must place on the record my huge gratitude to the culture secretary my right hon and learn friend   the member for south east cambridgeshire lucy frazer who when she be housing minister allow i to introduce she to of the nation ’s lead planning silk silk to silk they talk through the issue and the thing i be propose my right hon and learn friend say to her official what ’ wrong with this and they could not provide she with an answer so that now sit on the statute book as section of the levelling up and regeneration act i hope that a future government will do their good to implement it and i shall certainly be encourage they to do so 
 in conclusion i will just say this it have always be an article of faith to i that there be no they just us if there be thing we want to fix and change it be we who have to do it as karl popper put it i be not jealous of many thing but i be jealous of the right hon member for barking because she be at the london school of economics when he be still teach there 
 progress depend on we on our watchfulness and our effort on the clarity of our conception of our aim and on the reasonableness of their choice instead of pose as prophet we must be the maker of our fate 
 it be a great honour to be the last speaker on the back benches in this debate we have hear great emotion from many people and i realise that it be such a wrench for many people to leave parliament it have be an honour for all of we to serve but particularly for i to serve as the member of parliament for hendon i have be intimately involve in parliamentary election in the past year in many way in some seat it be no great achievement for someone to be elect it be in the marginal seat that it be an achievement we be the one that have change government 
 i thank my constituent in hendon for elect i on occasion at the last election i receive vote the high number of conservative vote in the constituency since it sometimes irk i when i be elect in that i have a majority of and over people have elect i while there be other sit on different benches who have receive few vote than i but have huge majority that do not feel quite right 
 each and every member present will claim that their constituency be different from everyone else ’s but hendon just like london be very diverse as someone who be   bear and grow up in the south of england and never see a person of colour until the age of be in hendon do not come as a great shock to i but it have teach i a huge amount i have a large jewish constituency a large muslim constituency hindus the large chinese community outside of soho and manchester and the large iranian community in the whole country 
 there be many issue that connect those different religious group which i have always campaign on but there have also be a huge amount of diversity in the local economy we have see huge development mean that the boundary change that have be apply will make a difference under the previous conservative council when i be a councillor we introduce development that create the stonegrove estate the grahame park estate beaufort park west hendon upper fosters and the peel centre all make home for people in their local area and we should be very grateful for that 
 as i say i have work on issue that have bring community together but the reason why i have focus on the jewish community be that they be a small number in this country about the number of muslims in this country be more like and their voice will be hear by the different members of parliament in this place my hon friend   the member for brigg and goole andrew percy   raise issue of concern to many of my constituent issue about antisemitism and education but i be pleased that this week lord pickles publish his report of the alderney expert review lay to rest the issue of a concentration camp on british soil during the world war 
 my hon friend the member for brigg and goole have see other thing as well a particular issue of concern to my constituent be that of israel which be understandable my hon friend and i visit israel a few week after the   october   attack we visit kfar aza and i only wish that each and every member here in parliament could experience what we do i have not say this before but my hon friend say to i that he could not take picture during that day and i tell he that we must just as bert hardy and other photographer go into bergen belsen and the other concentration camp i say we have to go there and take picture so that the world know this really do happen we have have people say that it do not happen but i can assure you madam deputy speaker that it do 
 i would be of those hawkish members who want to see the issue in gaza resolve but i do not believe a ceasefire now would achieve that i do not want to see any death on any side but when member say recently in a debate that there have be civilian death i try to challenge that we do not know how many of those people be civilian and how many be hamas fighter the foreign office say that it have not make a prediction of that number but we do know that of people in gaza support hamas and hamas have get to be remove 
 the decision of ireland norway and spain this week to recognise an independent palestinian state be not only wrong but allow the conclusion to emerge that terrorism work and we can not allow that it be simply impossible to recognise a state that have never exist in any meaningful form so what exactly be those country recognise i gently say to the premier of spain and ireland that they have never particularly recognise their minority community 
 my right hon friend   the member for maidenhead mrs may   say that you should never ask a question in this place if you do not know the answer there be an occasion when i ask the former prime minister now lord cameron if he would visit israel i have to say that of the good experience of be in parliament be the moment when i visit lord cameron in his suite at the king david hotel we walk past the guy with machine gun guard he and we sit and drink whisky with he i have to say that it be not that different from sit on the throne in saddam hussein ’s palace in baghdad of course without saddam hussein and with whisky 
 we have live through an extraordinary period in this parliament people often ask i what be the good part of be an mp i find that easy to answer it be the people particularly the constituent the story that they tell be sometimes heart wrench often annoying regularly amusing and always interesting i have have great people work with i in the constituency some political some not i particularly think of people like val duschinsky and hugh rayner who work with i in the hendon association as well as rabbi ginsbury simon rea and mushtaq rehman the respective leader of their religious community activist such as rupa monerawela richard nash and manubhai makwana have be a great support to i there be also individual such as ari leaman who have do so much for the teenage community and lorraine bushell for the grandparents association 
 i be ask what be the big mistake that i have ever make as a member of parliament that be easy to answer it be on the military action in libya when i walk past my hon friend   the member for basildon and billericay mr baron   and think how ’s he go to explain why he ’ vote against this but we not only create a fail state but significantly contribute to the current immigration and asylum crisis that be my big mistake and i bitterly regret it 
 the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge   say that be an mp be not what it use to be and she be correct several year ago i be on a boat and the skipper say what be it you say that you do for a living i say i do n’t before long of the other crew say well it can not be as bad as be a member of parliament it be still vital to be a member of parliament those who come after we will recognise that 
 i leave on note that i be particularly sad about for year i have complain about sewage in our river and our sea not much have change over the last year all that have change be that the government have implement a scheme for monitor the amount of sewage that go into our river and our sea the lib dems be make this a central plank of their election campaign they should be advise that their mp vote against the super sewer here in london so they do not have a good record on the issue in my opinion the eu directive be never fit for purpose so while minister have repeatedly claim that water quality be improve it be simply not it be the way that water quality be measure such claim lead i to conclude that this be the same kind of behaviour by ministers that be witness in the contaminated blood scandal 
 have be elect continuously for the last year for the last as the member of parliament for hendon have take a huge toll on i that be why i    have decide to step down but i would not change it for a thing i be look forward to ameet jogia the conservative candidate take forward what we have achieve he be not only bear in the constituency but be a local candidate 
 i have to thank my staff for the work that they have do over the last few year in this parliament alone they have undertake piece of casework i have have a good staff who have remain friend begin with laura pike hannah evans ness hirst and katherine toone and now with eamonn walsh george bose carolynne fisher and steve martin who volunteer and hilary smith who have be with i for the last year they have really be true public servant as be say they be the one who ensure that the work be actually complete of course i can not forget maximus decimus meridius my jack russell max who still attend parliament on occasion he have enable i to concentrate on animal welfare issue so in the spirit of a roman language i say veni vidi vici

 presentation and reading standing order no 
 bob seely present a bill to establish a regulator of ferry service operate in the solent to make provision about the power and duty of that regulator and for connected purpose 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday july and to be print bill 
 i beg to move 
 that the sanctions eu exit miscellaneous amendments and revocations regulations si no date   may a copy of which be lay before this house on   may be approve 
 in recent year the uk have transform its use of sanction we have deploy sanction in innovative and impactful way include in our response to russia ’s invasion of ukraine we have take a rigorous approach carefully target to deter and disrupt malign behaviour and to demonstrate our defence of international norm this statutory instrument cover several measure that will strengthen our sanction regime across the board and allow we to continue the work already be implement across government i will run through each measure in turn 
 in october the government add a new type of sanction the director disqualification sanction to the sanctions and anti money laundering act this instrument use that power to amend the uk ’s autonomous sanction regime which will mean that the government can apply it to individual designate under these regime it will be an offence for a designate person subject to this new measure to act as a director of a company or to take part in the management formation or promotion of a company this will far prevent those sanction from deriving benefit from the uk economy it be an important addition to the uk sanction toolkit this instrument provide ministers with the flexibility to apply the new measure on a case by case basis the government will ensure that the measure be target and operate alongside the uk ’s full suite of sanction power 
 this instrument also enable the government to issue licence to person to allow they to undertake activity that be otherwise prohibit the foreign commonwealth and development office have be work closely with the department for business and trade companies house and the insolvency service on the implementation of this measure 
 the si will also clarify the sanction enforcement remit of his majesty ’s revenue and customs hmrc have well establish responsibility for enforce trade sanction in its capacity as the uk custom authority in recent year however the scope of trade sanction have evolve beyond import and export prohibition to include matter that be outside hmrc ’s custom remit such as sanction on stand alone service 
 last december the government announce the decision to establish the office of trade sanctions implementation within the department for business and trade in order to enforce these new type of measure under the civil law once it start operate otsi will also be able to refer serious offence to hmrc for criminal enforcement consideration hmrc will continue to have both civil and criminal enforcement responsibility for sanction within its custom remit this legislation be need to clarify the sanction measure for which hmrc be solely responsible for enforce and those which it   will investigate on referral from otsi or another civil enforcement organisation 
 the sanctioning of the shadow fleet be an issue of great importance to the foreign affairs committee so i thank the government for introduce this really important legislation may i also thank you mr speaker for your support of the foreign affairs committee during this parliament and put on the record my thank to an incredible committee that it have be an incredible honour to chair i thank in particular my clerk chris shaw who be truly incredible as well as the rest of the committee who have be wonderful on behalf of the committee i also thank the government for all they have do on ukraine show the leadership that mean that ukraine be still stand and fight 
 will my right hon friend the minister confirm that this be not just about tackle money and profit go into the russian coffer but about violation of maritime law and that be why today ’s sanction be so very important and why the government be show yet again that we will always stand by ukraine 
 i thank my hon friend for her intervention and indeed for her very kind word towards those who do a huge amount of work behind the scene to enable we to bring forward a rolling level of sanction legislation which have continue to degrade putin ’s ability to fund his war we believe that sanction across the piece have take some £ out of his capability it be a continuum and today ’s legislation continue that she be absolutely right the sanction will continue to be tool that help we in many way to keep ahead of those who wish we harm and who wish to support putin in his illegal war in ukraine and to continue to hunt they down and to restrict their capacity 
 the minister and i have work on various thing over the year those of we in all party who be passionate about sanction be still extremely worried about certain significant people in this country a recent article in the times suggest that a hereditary peer in the house of lords be a main channel of russian money help certain political faction not only in this country but in the united states be it not about time that we do something about the upper house which seem to have a small group of pro putin member 
 the hon gentleman have as he say be an incredible champion and supporter of all the work we have be do cross party to keep ahead of the sanction i know it be frustrating but as i always say people should pass evidence of any sort about individual they consider be supportive of or enable putin his regime or any military activity to the team in the fcdo which look day in day out at be able to bring forward a package of evidence that would withstand judicial review we stand ready i will never comment on what we be take in and what might come next but the team be work flat out to look at the evidence wherever they can that be a continuum i say that not only to member of this house but more widely to those out on the frontline or work with business where they see area in which they believe that be happen they should bring the information   to we 
 will the minister accept some evidence i have about the earl of oxford and asquith that i think should be urgently consider by all of we careful and worried about sanction 
 if the hon gentleman would like to write to i later today i will make sure that the team look at the information as soon as possible 
 order i know it be the final day for   the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman but we still have rule in this house about be critical of member of another house could he still use that caution even on his last day in the house 
 thank you mr speaker 
 this legislation be need to clarify the sanction measure for which hmrc be solely responsible for enforce on those it would investigate on referral from otsi it will therefore establish a consistent approach to the enforcement of trade sanction it will facilitate hmrc and otsi work in close partnership so that they can robustly enforce all trade sanction against russia and other target country use civil and criminal power 
 on the financial sanction side the statutory instrument also include new obligation for person designate under the belarus regime to report any asset they own hold or control in the uk or worldwide as a uk person to the relevant authority the measure be another step in improve the transparency of asset own hold or control in the uk by designate person and will strengthen the ability of hm treasury ’s office of financial sanctions implementation ofsi to implement and enforce uk financial sanction 
 importantly the measure will act as a dual verification by enable the comparison of disclosure by designate person against exist reporting requirement that bite on firm such as financial institution under the new requirement the government will be able to penalise those who make deliberate attempt to conceal asset to escape the effect of sanction an equivalent reporting obligation be place on designate person under the russia regime in december the extension of this requirement to belarus ensure alignment between the russia and belarus regime which be particularly vital give the frequent overlap of the belarus and russia sanction regime and the co operation between the state in relation to russia ’s invasion of ukraine 
 we have also include several sanction on belarus on the export of so call battlefield good which include good such as electronic equipment integrated circuit and firearm and aerospace technology these new measure prohibit the import of belarusian aluminium into the uk both the metal itself and aluminium product aluminium product be a sector of strategic importance to belarus and have be its top export to the uk although the uk nexus with the belarusian economy be limited the signal impact of our sanction on belarus be and will remain important we keep these sanction under constant review and reserve the right to introduce further measure so that the lukashenko regime continue to feel the consequence of its lack of respect for human right and its support for putin ’s war 
 finally we be also revoke the burundi sanction regime that will remove an empty regime from the statute book the decision in not to transpose   into uk law designation under the original eu sanction regime reflect the improved political situation in burundi we do not have the same level of concern about the widespread political violence in burundi that lead to the original decision to impose the regime so we have make no designation under it as we set out in the recent uk sanction strategy the government keep their regime under review and respond to change circumstance we be commit to lift a regime out of a specific measure or revoke a designation when the original objective be no long serve by its continuance 
 to conclude sanction continue to play an important part in the uk which continue to build on its already impressive sanction capability in the year since the landmark sanctions and anti money laundering act our approach to sanction have evolve considerably to respond to the change in the world we will continue to work on sanction to meet any new challenge i commend the regulation to the house 
 may i echo your comment mr speaker about the deputy speakers who be sadly step down at the snap general election i also thank the minister for set out the purpose of the regulation for her general cross party working and for her assurance that the security minister and the treasury be look at such sanction because they need a cross government approach i also echo her comment about the excellent work of official at the office of financial sanctions implementation 
 labour support the necessary and common sense step be take in the statutory instrument we will not seek to divide the house on it although it might have be nice to have consider it last week rather than this morning from the point of view of ’s nerve as a party we have consistently support the government in expand the uk sanction regime as it relate to a variety of country but particularly russia since the unlawful and barbaric invasion of ukraine 
 we have also be candid and honest where we think that minister be not go far enough or have act too slowly in hold global actor to account or where there be considerable loophole in our regime that they continue to exploit when it come to the integrity of our sanction regime we have make it clear that labour will work assiduously with partner and ally to counter the plethora of threat pose by actor across the world will ensure proper enforcement and will bring about the seizure of russian state asset for the purpose of support ukrainian reconstruction 
 before turn to the measure i will raise a more general issue that my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty the shadow minister for europe have bring to our attention on several occasion on the enforcement of monetary penalty for breach of the uk sanction regime the ofsi website show that only penalty have be issue against the russian regime since the start of the war in ukraine can the minister elucidate whether that be the case be the website out of date or be there another reason why our enforcement be woefully low in comparison with the usa for example i hope that she can supply clarity on that 
 labour support the measure they will prevent a designated person be a director of a company or oversee the promotion formation or management of company which be a necessary step in dismantle the ecosystem of illicit finance in which designate person skirt sanction and retain access to their wealth 
 i ask the minister for clarity on point concern have be raise by hon member on both side of the house about the issuing of licence that grant designate person dispensation to become exempt from give provision can she clarify whether there will be ministerial oversight of the granting of those licence will the treasury the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for business and trade work in lockstep to ensure cohesion and co ordination when it come to their granting last year revelation come to light regard a licence issue to none other than yevgeny prigozhin that allow he to sue a uk journalist that be what can happen when licence be issue without proper scrutiny i hope that the minister can provide clarity on their granting 
 we also support the measure relate to the mandate of his majesty ’s revenue and customs on belarus as well as the new reporting obligation on person designate under the asset freeze to disclose the value and nature of any fund or economic resource that they own hold or control in the uk we also support the prohibition of export from the uk of item critical to russian weapon system and military development in addition to certain aerospace good the prohibition of belarusian aluminium import and the ban on the provision of ancillary service 
 why have it take so long to bring in those prohibition measure it seem unconscionable that well over year since the onset of the war in ukraine do not forget that the house ’s belarusian concern be raise before then uk item that could be use in russian weaponry be make their way via belarus to the frontline potentially aid and abet russia ’s war effort against the people of ukraine we understand that any sanction regime be a work in progress but we can not continue to countenance uk export filter through to putin and the crony who facilitate his war machine especially give the situation in and around kharkiv at present 
 i thank the minister for set out the measure though as i say they could have come early i hope that she can provide clarity on the concern that i raise labour will continue to support further expansion of our sanction regime but it be become ever clear that the action that we take today will have lasting ramification in devise such action in the next parliament we will strive to be even bold swifter and more ambitious

 this place matter in term of the way the uk compete with our adversary and those who challenge we all around the world it be not just what the government do through the foreign commonwealth and development office our embassy and other departments it be important that parliament show its resolve as any colleague in the house who have have the pleasure of travel to do the government ’s business overseas will know we be routinely beat up by ministers in foreign country for thing that be say on these bench therefore the resolve of the house to give resolute support to the government of the day on our foreign policy be enormously important we do that through not just the employment of our military with whom it have be my great pleasure to work during the past year but the way we pull all the lever of government to achieve effect through both hard and soft power all around the world therefore at the back end of this parliament these be important measure before we today and it be right that they be be put through with cross party consensus

 i thank all colleague on both side of the house when we have disagree it have always be with courtesy and respect not enough people beyond this place see that that be the way the affair of this house be mostly conduct most of all i wish all good fortune and success to all those who will arrive here in july in particular my successor in the new seat of wells and mendip hills have be return to represent their community and to make a difference on behalf of   this country in what will be incredibly challenging time it have be a great pleasure and a real honour to serve here 
 it be a sad day i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 i congratulate   the hon member for blackpool south chris webb   on his maiden speech normally after a maiden speech we stand up and say i be sure the new member will be a doughty campaigner for his constituent and i be sure he will for a week i wish he all the good and hope he be return to this place i also send good wish to his son and his wife portia be the spouse of a politician be probably the bad job in the world it be incredibly difficult and i can not imagine the rollercoaster she have be on in the past few week so i send my solidarity to she particularly as she be deal with the joy and otherwise of have a very young child to look after i congratulate the hon gentleman 
 if you do not mind mr speaker i would like to offer some brief thank yous i will probably be speak on the tribunal measure later but now would be a more appropriate time for this give the mood of the house i thank a few of my colleague who will no long be in this place after the election i thank my hon friend   the member for glasgow north patrick grady who during my time as deputy leader be the chief whip of the snp he be my confidante and my rock we have many late night session plan parliamentary mischief not least in advance of the snp walk out that i think a number of people will remember very well i appreciate everything he do for i during that time 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for glenrothes peter grant who be probably not someone who will be remember for set the heather on fire in this place   but he have do absolutely everything that have need to be do and everything ask of he he have deal with some incredibly technical legislation and he have always be there with word of advice whenever they be need i also thank my right hon friend   the member for dundee east stewart hosie who have be in this place for a long time he will be step back from frontline politic but i be sure not from the snp he have similarly be a huge source of advice and although we have have some very good natured disagreement i have huge respect for everything he have do particularly for the snp as a whole and i have no doubt he will carry on do that 
 on a very personal note i thank my hon friend   the member for paisley and renfrewshire south mhairi black who have be of my close friend in this place and whose departure i have not quite reconcile myself with and i be not sure i will ever get over i will miss she incredibly i intend to come back to this place and she do not i will miss she a huge amount 
 on this specific debate and the sanction regime my hon friend   the member for glasgow central alison thewliss   be not here today but have do a huge amount of work as i be sure member across the house will recognise particularly on issue such as beneficial ownership and scottish limited partnership we have concern   in relation to sanction and this legislation represent   a good step in close some of the loophole that   friend and colleague have be raise in about scottish limited partnership be start only of which be start by scot we have be campaigner on scottish limited partnership and have massive concern still about the slp regime and the fact it be use for money laundering in significant number despite their be call scottish limited partnership they be technically nothing to do with scotland which be why we need westminster to take action it would be great if whoever be in the next government could crack down on the abuse in slps 
 we be pleased with some of the action take on beneficial ownership but we do not think we be there yet we need to ensure that the sanction regime and everything associate with they be apply appropriately if we do not know who actually own something it be very difficult to say that they can not own it 
 progress be be make on the companies house issue that we have mention before but again my hon friend the member for glasgow central would make it clear that thing have not go far or fast enough in the reform of companies house again that be about transparency when the minister be speak she very much stress transparency in the sanction regime and i be pleased with any move that improve transparency clearly we will not be oppose the si today i think it be a good thing but there be still more to be do to ensure that sanction regime work appropriately so that those people who should not be able to have directorship or ownership or to money launder or make money through the uk because we have designate they as responsible for or aid war crime or human right abuse can not do so there be more to do to increase that transparency so that those people can be crack down on 
 lastly on sanction we be still concerned that the uk government have be too slow to increase the number of individual who have be sanction other   jurisdiction have significantly high number of individual who have be sanction particularly from area such as russia i appreciate the number of statement that the uk government have make and the number of action they have take particularly around ukraine and the hard work that have be do to support its people which i know be appreciate by people in the ukrainian government however i still think more could be do to ensure that this place be say to russia your action be inappropriate and we be go to hit you where it hurt financially by increase the number of individual who be sanction who be subject to those financial penalty and the inability to move money or have company in these island 
 i thank the minister for bring this si forward today and make clear that the snp be absolutely supportive of it follow the election we look forward to significantly more work be do to tighten those loophole and increase the number of individual who be subject to sanction 
 question put and agree to 
 resolve 
 that the sanctions eu exit miscellaneous amendments and revocations regulations si no date   may a copy of which be lay before this house on   may be approve 
 i beg to move 
 that the draft coroners suspension of requirement for jury at inquest coronavirus regulations which be lay before this house on   may be approve 
 before i address the purpose of the statutory instrument i would also like to congratulate   the new hon member for blackpool south chris webb   on his maiden speech his effort to avoid be the subject of a pub quiz honourable though they be may be slightly forlorn i can not recall too many occasion on which an hon member make their maiden speech on the same day that parliament rise for the next election so i suspect that he may still be the subject of pub quiz into the future 
 this instrument be an important part of the government ’s ongoing support for coroner service in their continue recovery from the covid-19 pandemic it extend for a further year the disapplication of the statutory requirement for any inquest into a death involve covid-19 to be hold with a jury which will have practical benefit for the coroner service although the real time impact of covid-19 have diminish they be inevitably delay in the coronial context as inquest backlog some of which be build up during the pandemic in order to manage wide pressure continue to be work through 
 natural covid-19 death would not normally be report to the coroner however where the cause of death be unknown or suspicious or have occur in state detention covid-19 may be suspect as a contributing factor save for the provision that we be seek to extend section of the coroners and justice act would require any inquest into such death to be hold with a jury because covid-19 be a notifiable disease 
 as the minister may be aware i have tragic case in my constituency involve an inquest do he not think it be about time that we modernise the whole system and give it more resource if somebody have lose a love wait for or year and never get resolution be not good be it not about time that we look at the process and the training and do something a bit fast for people 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i will take this opportunity to say farewell to he his leaving will be a loss to the house he make a good point the propose measure will combat some of what he talk about but there be a wide possibility for review as time move on we want coronial inquest to be carry out and expedite as quickly as possible 
 as part of covid-19 easement the coronavirus act remove the requirement for inquest into such death to be hold with a jury and the result resource pressure on coroner service throughout the pandemic to support continued pandemic recovery in the coroner court parliament sanction the replacement of the emergency measure with a provision in the judicial review and courts act to amend the act so that for the purpose of jury requirement and inquest   relate to notifiable disease covid-19 do not count as a notifiable disease that do not prevent the coroner from call a jury in a covid-19 related inquest they retain the discretion to do so as with any other inquest 
 the act provision include safeguard to ensure that covid-19 inquest be not treat differently on a permanent basis any extension be limit to year be subject to parliamentary approval and must be justify by an assessment of the impact on coroner service be the provision to expire 
 to evidence the need for extension of the provision the ministry of justice ask all coroner in england and wales to estimate their usage of the disapplication provision since june and to assess the impact on their case management if it be not extend the response rate be only around but even among that small number of coroner it be estimate that this provision have remove the requirement for a jury in around inquest over the past year without it even that small sample would have increase the annual number of jury inquest across england and wales typically around by about about half the respondent predict a significant impact for their case management if this provision be allow to expire this be because as the liverpool and wirral senior coroner put it 
 for each day of list for an inquest without a jury it take a week ’s list with a jury 
 that wide context be important parliament be concerned about the impact of inqu backlog on the bereaved as   the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman   highlight the extension of this measure for a further year will support coroner in their continue effort to reduce those backlog thereby promote the government ’s objective of put the bereaved at the heart of the coronial process that should mean that subject to any assessment close to the time i do not expect any future justice minister to need to seek parliament ’s agreement to a further extension from june 
 may i too put on record my thank to you mr speaker and to the deputy speakers for look after our interest during this parliament i congratulate my hon friend   the member for blackpool south chris webb   on his brilliant maiden speech we learn that his wife be call portia that be quite appropriate as we be discuss a justice bill give that portia give of the most famous speech on justice in the merchant of venice 
 the quality of mercy be not strained 
 it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
 upon the place beneath it be twice bless 
 it blesseth he that give and he that take 
 i be glad he aptly remind we of his wife ’s name during the course of his speech i congratulate he and i be sure we will be see each other again soon without be complacent in any way about the electorate 
 we will not divide the house on this measure give the state of the backlog impact the coronial system this be a sensible measure and the opposition will not contest it today however it be worth discuss very   briefly the reason for the backlog and the government ’s complete inability to get a grip on any aspect of our justice system 
 after year of conservative rule we have significant and in some case record high backlog across the whole of the court and tribunal system victim and their family be wait year for answer and for justice it have become the department of justice delay and we all know what that mean labour will work at pace to tackle the backlog that be grind our justice system to a halt and to restore public confidence in the justice system but we do not seek to divide the house on this measure 
 mr speaker i hope to catch your eye later in today ’s proceeding in order to thank you and other but now i will confine my remark to this measure and to congratulate   the hon member for blackpool south chris webb 
 this be a sensible measure and i be delighted to see my hon friend the minister who be my constituency neighbour at least for a couple more day in his place on the treasury bench he will know that the justice committee publish a substantial report on coroner some time ago and that we recently do a follow up this measure be wise and sensible but there be broad issue that need to be tackle in the coronial system i hope that either my hon friend the minister if we come back into government or any future government will look again at our report because the thing that we have not do and that we need to do be tackle the root problem of the coroner system which be that it be piecemeal and sit outside the rest of the normal judicial framework 
 i hope that a future government will revisit our recommendation that we should move to a national coroner service that would ensure great consistency and that the same service be provide to bereaved family right across the country which be currently not the case it would be a small investment but would do the right thing there be of course a role for jury particularly in important matter i welcome the change that the government have make to the representation of family at inquest but again i hope that we can go far particularly where state agency and public body be concern 
 this be a sensible measure in the right direction but i hope that we will grasp the nettle and have a proper national coroner service something that have be recommend overwhelmingly in the evidence to the justice committee and champion by both chief coroners with whom i have have the pleasure of working his honour judge mark lucraft and the recently retire his honour judge thomas teague both have do a fantastic job as chief coroners and i want to pay tribute to both of they 
 may i begin by echo the comment by the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill in do so i pay my respect to he for his leadership of   the committee over the good part of a decade we see so much change and churn in this place i pay tribute to he for his knowledge his experience his humanity his enthusiasm and his ability to get thing do on the justice committee of which i have be privileged to be a member for the last month and to bring positive change to many aspect of the justice world i have no doubt that whatever he do next in his professional career he will continue to make great wave for those who be touch in some way by the justice system 
 as my hon and learn friend say part of the justice committee ’s work have include look at the coronial system in and more recently last year we have look at all aspect of the coronial system not least the impact that covid have have on its ability to function in the way that we would all want the minister be right to take a pragmatic approach by provide some breathing space and capacity within the coronial system so that many of the case that need to move through the court in a timely and compassionate way be able to do so as have be allude to there be of course many other issue that need to be address 
 unfortunately due to the sudden end to this parliament the report that the justice committee be on the very cusp of produce for the government will now be in the form of correspondence that have go to the department i hope that it will be look at carefully in the next week by ministers who will still be in post as well as by official who whatever hue the next government happen to be can put it straight on to the table of the next minister hopefully it will still be my hon friend sit on the front bench so that we do not lose any of the momentum that hopefully the report will be able to achieve 
 i agree with what the hon gentleman my select committee colleague have just say about the chair of the committee   the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill everyone know that he be a good friend of mine we co chair the all party parliamentary group on miscarriage of justice and he have be a brilliant champion against such miscarriage i hope that the hon gentleman agree that the hon and learn member will be miss dreadfully by the house of commons indeed what will the house do with bob and i both stand down 
 the hon gentleman my friend be my select committee chair back in when i join the children schools and families committee a baptism of fire as it turn out i have be fortunate enough to serve under a number of excellent chair over the year i wish he well in whatever come next in the varied and colourful life that i be sure lie ahead of he 
 some of the detail behind this statutory instrument need the continued attention of ministers and the ministry of justice my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst touch on the need to look at the potential unification of the service the funding model how it be resource we do not want to imperil the rule of law by make the service unworkable potentially the need for an inspectorate so that we know how well the service be function and as the minister rightly say ensure that we put bereaved family at   the very heart of the process i hope that this measure will be part of enable many of those change to take hold in the ensue year 
 mr speaker as you will know this be my   time around in parliament often call a retread unfortunately but unlike arnold schwarzenegger this time i will not be back this be the last time i will be stand up in this place so i want to take the opportunity to thank you and all your team for your support and friendship over out of the past year i also thank my staff up in cheshire in eddisbury and in crewe and nantwich my previous seat roz dan lynn joel amy and quite a few other who come before they include sean who have recently get on the candidate list and i suspect have a reasonable chance of find a seat as we still have about or so that have yet to find a candidate if he be select i wish he and his campaign extremely well as i do my own candidate successor aphra brandreth who will be stand in the new seat of chester south and eddisbury she be a class candidate i very much hope that she will be able to join colleague here after the general election 
 with characteristic modesty my hon friend have not mention his own very significant contribution on the justice committee and as a minister and the contribution that he and his family have make to the justice system everybody know the work that he his brother and his father do to deal compassionately and humanely with those who go through prison they and he be absolute role model i be deeply grateful to he for his friendship and support and we wish he all the very good for the future 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon and learn friend i probably ought now to declare my interest which be on the register not least my brother ’s chairmanship of the prison reform trust they be there for all to see it be true that there be clearly a gene in the timpson family that make we want to reach out beyond our own family to help other whether that be through foster or help ex offender into work that be something that beyond parliament i want to continue to do 
 finally i congratulate   the hon member for blackpool south chris webb   on an excellent maiden speech it take i back to mine in a nerve rack moment but he deliver his superbly i wish he and his family all the very good i have a very young child when i come into parliament and actually i have another young child when i come into parliament again it be obviously a route to success in this place 
 i want to thank my own family my late mother alex and my father john for all the inspiration and guidance that they have give i my wife julia and my child sam elizabeth lydia and nell i hope that they will see a bit more of i now and i hope that be the right thing to do 
 question put and agree to 
 on a point of order mr speaker i wish to raise the statement that the prime minister make to figen murray the mother of martyn hett who be murder in the manchester arena bombing she have walk mile from manchester to london to mark the   anniversary this week of that terror atrocity the prime minister rightly meet figen at o’clock on wednesday this week as you know mr speaker figen have be campaign for martyn ’s law for several year and in fact she give evidence to the home affairs committee during our pre legislative scrutiny of the draft terrorism protection of premises bill we publish our pre legislative scrutiny report in july and we have not have a response from the government despite there usually be a requirement for a response within month 
 the prime minister tell figen at lunchtime on wednesday that the bill would be rush through parliament before the summer recess that be at pm as i understand it have you have any explanation mr speaker from the prime minister about why he would say that when hour later he call the general election clearly no bill could be rush through before the summer recess and about the fact that he mislead figen murray

 the lords amendment do crucial thing they impose a duty on the government to establish a uk wide infected blood compensation scheme within month of royal assent they establish a new arm ’s length body name the infected blood compensation authority to deliver the compensation scheme and they impose a duty on the government to make interim payment of £ to the estate of deceased infected people where previous interim payment have not be make 
 i be grateful to the minister for all the work that he have do on the amendment but could i ask he about the final group who have receive not a penny the parent who lose child and the child who lose parent the government have announce an additional £ for those who be infect to be pay within day there be no timescale for payment to people who have not receive anything yet can he help the house understand when the payment will be make 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady and i know that   the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens   have raise similar question previously i know that the right hon lady and other be in correspondence with my right hon friend the prime minister and the minister for the cabinet office 
 the question raise be complex and detailed my understanding be that robert francis will be spend june have those conversation with community and with victim and family so that he can work out the detail of the answer to those question from the basis of what those family and community want to see rather than a minister or anyone else pre empte that of the key lesson that i and i hope the government    and this house have take from the work the right hon lady have do be the need to listen to those affect and that be what sir robert will be do i do not want to pre empt that from the dispatch box 
 rise 
 i suspect that the right hon lady will want to enlarge on the point in her speech but of course i will let she come back now 
 i be grateful i just gently point out to the minister that sir brian langstaff tell the government in april over a year ago to get on and make these payment i have to say that work could have be undertake in that period to get to the point where payment could be make quickly and it be very regrettable that that have not happen 
 i entirely note and the house and country will have hear the point make by the right hon lady she participate in the statement by the prime minister and the subsequent statement by the minister for the cabinet office which set out the work that he have undertake at pace to make thing move forward what we see in this bill be a hugely important step forward and i look forward to robert francis work at pace to ensure that the view of those affect be genuinely reflect in the detailed answer to the question that the right hon lady have pose 
 the government amendment demonstrate our absolute commitment to deliver long overdue justice to the victim too many people whether they be infect or affect have see their life chance take away watch love one die needlessly and endure the most terrible stigma none of which should ever have happen i can only hope that with the inquiry ’s report publish and with our firm commitment to compensate those touch by the scandal the infected blood community know that their cry for justice have finally be hear as i have say a lot of that be a tribute to the right hon lady ’s work 
 the government have also table amendment to make reform to provision on those serve imprisonment and detention sentence for public protection we will be far reduce the qualifying period to year for those who be convict when age under we will also allow the secretary of state to have discretion to decide that recall should have no effect on the year automatic licence determination period as well as require that an annual report be lay before parliament on the support for those serve these sentence i be grateful to member of both houses for the constructive way in which they have engage with the bill and i be delighted that we will be able to complete its passage ahead of prorogation 
 i will set out the detail of the motion that we be bring forward today in response to those outstanding issue in respect of lords amendment we be seek to amend the measure on the issuing of guidance about victim support role in clause victim support role operate across different setting some of which be   devolve the senedd do not grant legislative consent for this measure as previously draft i be therefore table an amendment so that the duty to issue guidance apply to england and reserved matter in wales only i have consequently remove the requirement to consult welsh ministers on any guidance issue i be grateful for the constructive discussion that have take place in relation to the important principle that sit behind this clause which aim to improve the consistency of support service provide to victim i be confident that we can continue to work together so that victim have that consistency across both country 
 lords amendment be a technical amendment to move the clause on child victim of domestic abuse to the right part of the bill 
 we have accept the principle of lords amendment which will place a duty on relevant authority to co operate with the victim commissioner when request we hear the strength of feeling that a response to the victim commissioner as they do their important work should not be see as a favour instead there should be clear and open co operation as an integral part of enable the independent scrutiny that victim deserve 
 the government ’s amendment make a few   minor change it extend require co operation far than to simply assist the commissioner in   monitor compliance with the victim code instead it require co operation in relation to any of the victim commissioner function which include promote the interest of victim and witness secondly it add important safeguard to make clear that any co operation must be not only practical but appropriate this protect against potential interference with activity that be rightly independent such as the exercise of prosecutorial discretion thirdly it future proof the clause by put this duty on the agency that deliver service under the victim code rather than include a specific list of body which may become out of date 
 lords amendment seek to require training to be provide to those with obligation under the victim code of course agency should and do have training in place to deliver the legislative duty to act in accordance with the code but that training must be tailor to the specific function that each person be discharge and agency be well place to do that we consider that in place an additional burden on the secretary of state to implement a strategy for training this amendment would be costly and inefficient it would not be proper for an amendment from the lords to place financial burden on public authority we also consider that the more effective approach as have be commit by the government in the other place be to include a requirement for agency to report on the adequacy of their co training as part of evidence in delivery of code entitlement this give we a route to identify and address ineffective training if it have lead to non compliance with the code 
 lords amendment seek to establish an immigration firewall and prevent the police from share with immigration enforcement datum relate to immigration status we disagree with this amendment because it would be inappropriate to impose a blanket restriction on the use of personal datum in the circumstance to which the amendment relate it would not prevent the perpetrator from inform immigration enforcement about the victim ’s immigration status and would impact on the ability to investigate crime and support victim 
 lords amendment seek to place a statutory duty of candour on all public authority public servant and official after a major incident have be declare in writing by the secretary of state the government share the desire to see an end to unacceptable institutional defensiveness but we can not accept the amendment in the current form because it would not sit neatly on top of the exist framework it be not well suited to replace what already exist for major incident and beyond it do not take into account the nuance of different profession in the sphere of the public sector and it could entail significant legal uncertainty 
 this be a complex area so we believe that it would be unwise to rush forward with an amendment but we have table an amendment in lieu to require a statutory review to determine whether additional duty of transparency and candour should be impose on public authority and public servant in relation to major incident the review will need to be complete by the end of the calendar year and follow its completion a report will be lay before the government it will be for whichever government be elect in week time to determine what to do with that 
 we be also bring forward an amendment in lieu of lords amendment and the government amendment will ensure that those convict of control or coercive behaviour who be sentence to at least month imprisonment will be automatically subject to management under multi agency public protection arrangement or mappa that will ensure that we effectively manage and target the most dangerous domestic abuse offender 
 a previous amendment be table in the other place to add domestic abuse and stalk perpetrator to those who qualify for automatic mappa management although there be a legal definition of domestic abuse a specific domestic abuse crime do not exist with the exception of control or coercive behaviour therefore although well intentione the amendment would still have require criminal justice agency to decide case by case whether a defendant be eligible for mappa management consequently the amendment would have not achieve the intention of reduce or eliminate any scope for local discretion
