thank you madame deputy speaker for invite i to speak like many colleague i stand on the bank of my local river the river trent during the general election campaign and   look out over the murky water i promise resident that the next government would change a broken system this broken system have enable our water quality to drop to the point where only of river and lake in england have a good ecological status accord to the environment agency since be elect hundred of resident of rushcliffe have contact i to say they be concerned about our broken water and sewerage system describe it as symptomatic of a break britain i be therefore pleased that today ’s bill mark the start of a significant turnaround process for the health of our nation ’s water 
 local to rushcliffe the datum have be consistently go in the wrong direction there be sewage dump in my constituency in and this more than double to sewage dump in the absolute number of sewage dump be of course a crude indicator but sadly the cumulative impact have also grow from hour in to hour in the direct impact on rushcliffe resident be palpable especially in village such as east leake that be susceptible to flooding which frequently include rural sewage i welcome the work that severn trent be start to take by upgrade a nearby treatment work double processing capacity by the end of march however for many resident this investment be far too late and should have be make year ago in an era when water company be cream off profit and fail to act as true and honest custodian of the national water network 
 to that end i encourage the secretary of state and his team to think carefully about who we want to be the future custodian of our water network if water and sewage company go under i believe we the state should always be prepared to step in to offer a genuine public alternative to hedge fund and the like as with rail and energy we should be prepared to start a process whereby the state once again offer to play a more active role in run basic universal service challenge private sector organisation that have happily pay out dividend while allow litre of water every day to be lose through leaky pipe 
 fundamentally i believe it be the right of each and every of we to be able to enjoy our beautiful river lake and sea without the fear of get sick so on behalf of my constituent in rushcliffe i welcome the many positive measure in this bill as it seek to enhance enforcement power and to start clean up our water for good move forwards there should be no more stick plaster fix because quite frankly the very least that my constituent deserve be a water and sewage system fit for the century 
 my hon friend will be aware of the consultation run by the previous government on the criminal injuries compensation authority i have be review those consultation and we be look to publish the government ’s response in the new year but we be aware of the concern from the sector and from victim and survivor about the scheme we be look at how much more we can do to support victim and survivor as a whole on these issue 
 let i come to a close by again thank my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend for secure this debate and all the hon and right hon member who have contribute to such a thoughtful discussion sexual offence leave devastation in their wake victim be often leave traumatise and the very least they deserve be swift justice but too often that justice process serve only to traumatise they far whether it be because they be not get the right support or because they be face an agonising wait for their case to come to court as we have hear so powerfully this evening we have inherit a criminal justice system and a criminal court system in particular in crisis but the rebuilding effort be under way we have an ambitious package of reform we be think boldly and while i be realist enough to know that change will not happen overnight i can assure you all that this government be up to the challenge 
 question put and agree to 
 house adjourn 
 we do keep the asylum process under review but i would be happy to look at the detail of this particular case and perhaps meet the hon lady and her constituent if that would be helpful 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on level of unemployment 
 the budget make the choice need to fix the foundation of our economy take those into account the office for budget responsibility forecast that unemployment will fall to next year and remain low until we be take action to support job and growth and to transform employment support to get britain work 
 will the minister answer a simple question since the budget have unemployment rate go up or down 
 i have just give the obr ’s assessment it be worth note that there be still a significant number of vacancy in the economy we be determined that the department for work and pensions will be reform to serve employer well so that they can fill those vacancy 
 many disabled people in ealing southall be unnecessarily unemployed purely and simply because their employer refuse to respond to their request for the reasonable adjustment that they need to do their job will the minister consider strengthen the right to reasonable adjustment so that worker receive a response within a specified number of week in line with the recommendation in the groundbreaking disability employment charter 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question i know she meet my colleague the minister for social security and disability recently and i be sure that their conversation be productive on this important point 
 i recognise what be behind the increase in the national minimum wage for to year old but i have be surprise by the reaction of business in my constituency those business have tell i in term that they will reduce the number of to year old they employ because there be a high failure rate associate with their employment as they be new to the workforce yet employ they will cost the same as employ those who be old do the minister recognise that issue and what will she do about it 
 anybody who see that in the british economy there be nearly young people out of work or training not do anything would say that be a dreadful legacy leave by the previous administration that be why the youth guarantee be at the heart of our get britain working plan 
 order before i call dr jeevun sandher may i offer he my congratulation on his engagement 
 that be incredibly kind of you mr speaker 
 young non graduate be find it far hard to get good well pay job the number of young people not in education employment or training have nearly double since and youth unemployment be at its high rate in almost a decade because young people be not get the skill they need on top of that they be become far sicker in young people currently have a mental health problem and that figure be rise what be the government and the department do to give young people the skill and the health support that they need to get good well pay job 
 that question demonstrate the quality analysis i would expect from recently engage economist on the labour benches the minister for skills and i have be work closely on the youth guarantee because we know that it be only by college and jobcentre work in hand in hand that we will get young people the skill that they need to succeed 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the run up to the election labour clearly commit to an employment rate target of but in the past few week i have notice a shift in language from target to ambition will the minister clear this up for we be the government still commit to the employment target or will that be another broken labour promise 
 i make no apology for have ambition for people in our labour market the figure be always an ambition because labour member want our jobcentre to shift away from pointless admin towards real ambition for everybody who step through the door 
 i think we all hear that loud and clear labour have ditch its employment target that be already another broken labour promise however i feel for the minister how can she be expect to boost employment when her chancellor be busy tax job and then shrink the economy the government have destroy business confidence have put up taxis on job and be pile red tape on employer which of those measure will help she to deliver that employment ambition 
 i have bring forward proposal to get britain work together with the secretary of state for work and pensions the secretary of state for education and secretaries of state right across government that be how we will plot a course towards our ambition of an employment rate i thank the shadow secretary of state for be kind enough to refer to our get britain working plan as 
 rearrange the deckchair on the titanic 
 it be very brave of she to acknowledge that the last government ’s legacy for we be a sink ship 
 what recent estimate she have make of the number of people who will be support into work through the proposal outline in the get britain working white paper 
 our ambition be an employment rate over a decade of national renewal we will get britain work by create a new job and career service in our overhaul of jobcentre we will bring forward a new youth guarantee so that every young person be earn or learn and will give local area the power to join up work health and skill support to help the people who be out of work due to long term health condition 
 i thank my right hon friend for her response not least give the dire inheritance from the previous government the bad performance of an employment rate in the g7 since the pandemic i see that inheritance in my community in barry in the vale of glamorgan where individual carry not the indulgence and not the offence but the misfortune of ill health what be the secretary of state do to tackle economic inactivity so that we give hope again not just to those individual but to my community 
 in the vale of glamorgan the economic inactivity rate be almost in people that be high than the rate for wales as a whole and certainly high than the uk average from spring next year we will launch trailblazer to support more people with long term health condition into work include in wales that be back by £ of additional funding we will design the programme jointly with the welsh government and we aim to launch it in the spring we be determined to boost job and growth in every corner of this great country 
 fedcap a national organisation be run a scheme to get economically inactive people to become the next generation of solar panel engineer more such scheme will be necessary to plug the skill gap that developer report especially if the government be to meet their ambitious housing target will the secretary of state commit to continue funding for scheme that be deliver by such organisation via jobcentre 
 i congratulate organisation such as the that the hon lady mention for their brilliant work not only to keep energy cost down but to support people into work i will work closely with the minister for energy consumer and other in the department for energy security and net to support those organisation include through jobcentre more job and low bill be key to improve people ’s living standard 
 in community like mine in east thanet there be above average youth unemployment it be important to be reassure that the get britain working white paper will be design to help young people particularly in coastal community like mine where we need a year round economy and support and activity to get young people into work 
 my hon friend be exactly right we have to deliver well job in every part of the country include coastal community like her we need to give young people the skill that they need and job opportunity so that they can build a well life i look forward to work with she as we deliver our youth guarantee and get britain working plan 
 can the secretary of state confirm whether she will maintain strong sanction against those who be capable of work but choose not to 
 if you can work you must work and if you repeatedly refuse to sanction will remain but i know from young people in my constituency that they be desperate to get the skill and opportunity that they need unlike the conservative party that be what our youth guarantee will deliver 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be good to hear front benchers be so positive about their white paper much of which we be pretty familiar with let we look through some of the measure the integration of employment and health support we be do that when we be in government it be call workwell my hon friend   the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately   lead on it what be the youth guarantee that we have be hear about accord to the white paper it 
 bring together a range of exist entitlement 
 it be a very familiar set of policy the fact be that the government ’s white paper be just a rehash of exist support and a bit of money with no string attach there be however thing that the last government be do that this government be not strengthen the conditionality for benefit the secretary of state say that she will continue the exist sanction but what new measure will she introduce to ensure that people who can work will work 
 i be not sure where to start if the conservatives programme be so successful why do we have a record people out of work due to long term health problem and young people not in education employment or training i love the workwell pilot but we want to join up health work and skill support in every corner of the country not just a few place 
 there will be a different approach for young people under our youth guarantee there will be the opportunity people need but also a requirement to take they up not only for those on unemployment benefit but for those young people who can work but be out of work due to a health condition that be the difference a labour government make there be work for those who can and proper opportunity 
 i applaud that soundbite but we do not hear about any new measure that will be introduce or any additional sanction that we need the right hon member talk about what the last government be do we be reform the work capability assessment the office for budget responsibility say that our reform would have see few people on long term sickness benefit save £ over this parliament the labour government have pause that work while they hold a review they have have year i do not know what they be do to plan for government not very much it look like interruption they have all that time what be they do i do not know where their plan be the chancellor be count the saving   to the welfare budget that our party would have deliver will the minister commit to implement the reform and if not how will she make the saving that she be count on 
 the hon member be laugh at his own chutzpah i be happy to talk about the past year but the work capability assessment be not work it need to be reform or replace that be what we say in our manifesto and we will bring forward our proposal in a green paper in the spring that have to be part of a big programme to help people with long term health condition and disability into work that be what our get britain working white paper do and i be happy to discuss it with he more in future 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i hope the secretary of state will join i in congratulate chris mccausland and dianne buswell on their victory on strictly this weekend in the light of that victory how do she plan to make the access to work scheme more fit for purpose so that it can help more people with disability reach their full potential 
 i absolutely join in the hon gentleman ’s comment it be a great joy to see that victory at the weekend we want to see access to work work well we want to get the backlog down and for that support to be available to more people 
 labour members believe that disabled people have the same right as anyone else to work socialise and take part in life that be what we be determined to achieve not just through the department for work and pensions but through every part of government the hon gentleman will know that we recently announce lead ministers for disability in every department that show how important we take this issue to be 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of trend in inflation on pensioner living standard 
 due to the government ’s steadfast commitment to the triple lock pensioner will see an above inflation increase of in their state pension next year which mean that they will be up to £ well off and over the course of this parliament over £ well off 
 i thank the minister for the insight in mid dunbartonshire nearly a quarter of my constituent be of pension age many have place their hard earn income into private scheme yet despite their financial planning they face the harsh reality that inflation be outstrip the modest yearly increase to their pension erode the value of their lifetime of saving what step will she take to prevent the erosion in value of private pension and to mitigate the problem of the growth in the value of pension fund not be pass on to pension holder 
 the chancellor launch a landmark pension review in july which i be lead it have objective to boost return for future pensioner so that when they save into private pension they get well return the like of which we see in australia and canada and to boost investment in the uk economy 
 the poor pensioner in our society be those who be eligible for pension credit but do not claim it and those who be just a few pound above the threshold and miss out on passporte support mean testing by its very nature be simply not the good way to get help to those who need it most so will the minister reconsider the recent decision to mean test the winter fuel allowance 
 we will not reconsider that decision because as a result of the £ black hole that we inherit from the conservative party we have have to take tough decision in a very tight fiscal environment however my hon friend have give i the opportunity to remind people that they have until saturday to make a pension credit claim which can be backdate and will passport they to winter fuel payment and other related benefit 
 i call chris murray 
 edinburgh be a booming and oh sorry 
 question 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the get britain working white paper on employer and business 
 we have all be there mr speaker business be cry out for staff yet only in employer use jobcentre our get britain working white paper will revolutionise employment support to give employer the workforce they need the support will include a new job and career service design around employer need we be also launch an independent review of the role of employer in promote healthy and inclusive workforce 
 some of we be still get our head around our new job mr speaker edinburgh be a booming economy that have all the raw material to thrive in the year ahead especially because we have some of the growth industry that the government have identify as be key to the future of the economy however business in my constituency be cry out for worker with the skill that they need what be the government do to ensure that the workforce have the skill that business need 
 my hon friend describe exactly why we need a local tailor service so that all employer can properly engage with jobcentre and work together to find the skilled member of staff that they need i agree with he that edinburgh offer so many opportunity   to our young people i know that all my dwp colleague in edinburgh will work with he to get business the skilled staff that they need 
 e commerce be a grow part of our economy will the minister spare a thought for small scale employer in my constituency and throughout northern ireland who since friday have see their supply chain clobber by the imposition on northern ireland of the eu ’s general product safety regulation because of the extra paperwork and the need to pay an agent in northern ireland many supplier in great britain be now refuse to sell to northern ireland will this government ever take step to reintegrate northern ireland into the internal market 
 order we have to shorten question a little so that i can get other in 
 i be not entirely sure that the issue the hon and learn gentleman raise be completely within my responsibility however dwp colleague in northern ireland work closely with business and i be sure that they will continue to do so whatever the prevail economic circumstance 
 what plan she have to review universal credit 
 we be commit to review universal credit to ensure that it be do the job that we need it to we have start by announce the fair repayment rate in the budget and we will keep parliament update 
 per cent of working age people in tipton wednesbury and coseley rely on universal credit i welcome the fair repayment rate announce in the budget but a major reason for benefit debt be the design flaw in universal credit which mean that claimant must wait week for their payment will the minister confirm that the week wait will be consider in the review of universal credit 
 i can assure my hon friend that advance of up to of potential universal credit entitlement be available urgently during the assessment period of a claim but she be right to raise concern about the week wait i commend to she the excellent report on this subject publish by the work and pensions committee in the last parliament the point she have raise be definitely that we need to consider 
 some of the farmer who work so hard to put food on our table find it difficult to put food on the table themselves and need additional government support that use to happen via tax credit but the transition to universal credit have be hugely challenging for farmer give the seasonal nature of their work will the minister meet i to hear some of their concern so that we can incorporate those concern into the government ’s review 
 we be watch very carefully the progress of migration from tax credit to universal credit which will be complete in the early part of next year but i would be very happy to meet the hon lady and discuss some of the difficulty she be see 
 what step she be take to help reduce level of poverty 
 more people in good job be the foundation of our approach to tackle poverty that be why we have set out the big reform to employment support in a generation on top of extend the household support fund introduce a fair repayment rate for universal credit and the extensive work of the child poverty taskforce 
 in my constituency of hemel hempstead accord to figure give to i by the local charity dens there have be a increase in the number of people need to use food bank over the past year meanwhile another institution the hemel hempstead community fridge see queue an hour before it open in scene akin to something out of soviet russia do the minister agree that there be few more shameful example of the last government ’s record on poverty interruption i can not quite hear the muttering of conservative members mr speaker i think the word they be look for be sorry will the minister also outline further step that we can take to reduce the need for food bank to exist at all 
 the statistic my hon friend have read out be i be sorry to say consistent with those of the trussell trust which distribute emergency food parcel in last year the figure be that be not acceptable which be why we have commit to triple investment in breakfast club to over £ and as i have say introduce our fair repayment rate for deduction from universal credit because if a person be out of debt they be out of danger we be increase the national living wage to £ an hour from next april which will boost the pay of worker that be also why the child poverty taskforce be work very hard 
 benefit such as pension credit and disability living allowance be important in assist people to stay out of poverty but delay in processing application push people into poverty constituent of mine be an year old gentleman who have spend more than week wait for his application to be process and another be the mother of a disabled child who have wait more than week and be now be tell that it will take an extra week for a mandatory reconsideration what step be the minister take to reduce delay in processing application for pension credit and other state support in order to help lift household out of poverty 
 i thank the hon lady for the question that she rightly put to this house we have increase the number of staff work on pension credit by over and be work very quickly to deal with those backlog and delay as she say we need to get through those backlog 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of jobcentre launch outreach initiative in local community 
 jobcentres work with a range of external provider to offer a wealth of outreach support in berkshire this include work coach support for customer with complex need deliver by read college outreach deliver by the slough homelessness team and at windsor homeless project location and employment support deliver by the probation hub in reading outreach work be something that we not only strongly support but actively encourage 
 the minister have name a number of project in berkshire none of which fall within my constituency of newbury would he welcome community interest company such as lambourn junction host jobcentre in their facility to make sure that people in rural constituency such as mine have access to a jobcentre rather than have to travel into the main town centre for that support 
 i would very much welcome such an initiative be bring forward in the hon member ’s constituency of newbury he may also be pleased to know that there be the potential for a youth hub to open in newbury similar to that in oxford which be grant fund and be already in operation 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of level of pension contribution for auto enrol pension for low earner 
 due to the introduction of auto enrolment which be at least policy that have cross party support it be legislate for by the last labour government and be take forward by the coalition government there have be a increase in the number of employee save into a workplace pension scheme since which be over people save for a pension who be not save previously 
 the minister will be aware that around of people automatically enrol into workplace pension scheme choose to opt out often due to low pay and cost of living pressure leave they lose out not only on build up their contribution but on the top up of their employer would the minister consider a simple tweak and allow employer contribution which would have be due in any event to continue in such opt out circumstance 
 i thank my hon friend for that question which be indeed an interesting idea it be that be put forward recently by the institute for fiscal studies and i will consider it in the pension scheme bill which we will introduce next year low earner with multiple small pot will have those pot consolidate so that the money work well for they and give they a well retirement in the future 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer both party the now in opposition and the in government have always encourage people to buy pension contribution in every way they can however the fact be that for many people who be low earner it be not possible to have a pension scheme and at the same time to live give the age we be in and the cost of living what can the minister do to encourage people to do so in a way that do not impact on the money they have come in 
 i thank the hon member for that question a number of idea have be put forward by think tank and research institute such idea be a sidecar saving account which could be use for a pension but could also have some money set aside for a rainy day should somebody fall into debt we be consider that he raise a very important question because some of those on low income sometimes can not afford to put in those contribution but there may be a way between opt out and remain in the scheme and we be look at that 
 what step her department be take to support people newly recognise as refugee into work 
 once people be grant refugee status they have immediate access to dwp employment support and service work coach work with refugee customer to understand their individual employment need and provide tailored support as appropriate include with cv writing interview preparedness and help secure work experience those who require more intensive support can be refer to dwp employment programme or other contract provision 
 the government be seek to clear the very unacceptable backlog the huge backlog of asylum application they inherit from the previous government as a result we be already begin to see an increase in the number of newly recognise refugee who rightly now have the right to work and to contribute here can the minister say a bit more about the strategic planning and cross departmental work that be happen on provide tailor support he talk about tailor support but the exist scheme of course come to an end in june so that refugee who have every right to be here have the ability to take a job pay taxis and contribute here 
 the hon member be entirely correct to recognise the important role of refugee in contribute to our economy there be a range of tailor support available with thing such as language support and as i mention early with cv writing and interview preparedness but there be also support with ensure that their qualification earn elsewhere be transferable to this country i would of course be very happy to meet he to discuss far the support that could be put in place as we look as he say to clear the asylum backlog we be in constant communication with the home office and other departments to ensure that there be a holistic approach in do so 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of level of maternity and paternity pay and allowance 
 the government keep the rate of parental pay under review follow the secretary of state ’s announcement in a write ministerial statement to parliament on   october and subject to parliamentary approval parental pay will increase in line with the consumer price index at the rate of from april 
 at less than half the rate of a full time national minimum wage maternity and paternity pay be so low that most parent simply can not live on it and they be often force into debt or force back to work soon than they would like a poll of father find that third of they would take more leave if paternity pay be high if we want to give family choice in how they care for their child in those precious early month will the minister discuss with colleague in the treasury and the department for business and trade how we can boost rate of maternity and paternity pay 
 i understand the point that the hon lady be make but request for a significant uplifting of benefit come with a price tag and i hear no suggestion as to how that would be pay for on support for parent the government commit in their manifesto to review parental leave to ensure that it well support working family further detail of that review will be announce in due course 
 recent damn statistic highlight that just of parent make use of share parental leave in the past year with uptake skewed towards the high earner give the importance of break down barrier to equal parenting for employment will the minister ensure that he work with the department for business and trade as part of the upcoming review to ensure that enhanced parental leave be consider include strengthen paternity leave entitlement 
 my hon friend be correct to highlight not just the importance and benefit of share parental leave but the disparity between those who make use of it i will of course maintain dialogue with the department for business and trade as we go through that review but i would also welcome a discussion with my hon friend about his ambition and idea for how we could take that forward 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the rate of universal credit 
 no assessment along the line that the hon gentleman ask about have be make benefit rate be review each year increase by last april and by from next april in line with inflation 
 i thank the minister for his answer but i would like to focus on the age differential in the rate he will be aware that people under receive a different rate of universal credit the government announce that they will try to abolish the age differential for the national living wage if it could also be abolish for universal credit that would be really good for young care leaver will the minister look at potentially phase out the age differential in universal credit 
 the hon gentleman make an interesting suggestion that be not something i be consider at the moment but as he will have hear i say early we will be review universal credit over the course of the next year or so we certainly want to support young care leaver he will know of the recent announcement that we make about change to carer ’s allowance and we be keep all those matter under review 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the youth guarantee on young people in harlow constituency 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the youth guarantee on young people in derby north constituency 
 our new youth guarantee will ensure that every young person be earn or learn tackle the scandal that we inherit of almost young people not in education employment or training young people in harlow derby north and across the country deserve the opportunity to work get skill and build a well life and that be what this labour government will deliver 
 in my constituency of harlow lot of fantastic organisation provide transferable skill for young people and i thank   the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden   for remind i of the name jason shaves who be an incredible champion for that kind of work do the secretary of state agree that give local area such as harlow the flexibility power and funding to engage with young people in the way that good work for they will get they back into employment quicker 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend that be why we be go to give new power responsibility and funding to local area to deliver our youth guarantee they know their community well they know the voluntary organisation school training provider and business and the mental health and other support that many young people need in harlow i know that that approach will be key to give young people the opportunity that my hon friend want and that they deserve 
 mel be out of work and homeless but ymca derbyshire see only her potential not her disadvantage now she be at toyota and on track for a   leadership role its work asset programme have a success rate in support homeless young people into employment how will the youth guarantee help the government join up with enhance and champion local programme like that 
 that sound like a fantastic programme by the ymca in my hon friend ’s constituency that be precisely why we need to join up with what local college be do with the support provide by local council and with support employment programme run by the nhs if we join that up and base it on local need her young constituent and many other like she will get the chance they need and deserve to build a well life 
 what step she be take to reform the health and disability benefit system 
 we want to reform the system to do a much well job in help people to enter and stay in work we will publish a green paper next spring and we will be discuss our proposal with disabled people 
 to protect those in need and to deliver for taxpayer we need to take tough decision reform health and disability benefit will require ministers to make difficult choice but so far the plan rely on reduce nhs waiting list which the office for budget responsibility have say will have hardly any effect on economic activity be ministers willing to make unpopular decision to solve this issue and if so when 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that we will make the right decision and they will be set out in our green paper in the spring there be a need to reform the health and disability benefit system there be no question about that and we want to talk to disabled people themselves about the detail in order to make sure that we get it right 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the get britain working white paper on people with a long term health condition or disability 
 disabled people and people with long term health condition deserve the same right as everybody else include the right to work many of the people out of work due to long term sickness say that they want to work if they can get the right help and support that be what our get britain working plan will deliver 
 a core objective of the get britain working white paper be to support disabled people into employment as the secretary of state know the blue badge scheme be an important provision in enable people to get to work but datum release this month show a sharp rise in blue badge theft with badge   be sell on by criminal for upwards of £ to people who use they to avoid parking charge will the minister back my campaign to tackle this injustice 
 yes i think it be disgusting that some people think it be all right to steal the blue badge that so many disabled people rely on to work but also to socialise and to see family and friend i know that the minister for future of road my hon friend   the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood who be responsible for this issue be a strong supporter of the campaign by my hon friend   the member for beckenham and penge liam conlon i will contact she to stress my support and that of my entire department 
 the get britain working white paper rightly say that 
 people deserve the opportunity to thrive and that sport art and culture be crucial to achieve this goal 
 especially for those with disability the sovereign centre in eastbourne where i learn to swim provide vital sport and leisure opportunity that will help serve that aim with the future of of its pool be consider do the minister agree that to well honour the aim of the white paper eastbourne borough council should engage with all interested provider who may be able to protect our fun and training pool at the centre before make any final decision on the next step 
 order i be not sure that be a relevant question as well as the hon member shoehorn it in secretary of state do you want to answer it be up to you 
 i believe that sport as well as art and culture can play a huge role in engage and inspiring people help they on the pathway to skill confidence and job i want to see that provision enhance in future because we be determined to have that at the national partnership level and it need to happen locally too to get people work and earn again 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help reduce the number of people in low pay work 
 our plan to get britain work be crucial to tackle low pay and increase living standard in every corner of the country when only in people ever fully escape low pay the labour party believe that be not good enough so our new job and career service back by £ of additional funding next year will kick start our reform to help more people get work and get on in their work so that they boost their living standard too 
 average wage in my constituency of crewe and nantwich a place with a proud industrial heritage lag behind the regional and national average at just £ a week before tax will the secretary of state outline how the get britain working white paper will support growth as well as high skille well pay job in my constituency not just the big city 
 the government share my hon friend ’s determination to boost the living standard of his constituent so the get britain working white paper will ensure that every local area include in his constituency produce its own get britain work plan alongside our industrial strategy our plan to make work pay the national wealth fund and skills england that will help people to get work and progress in their career with good opportunity for employment right across the country 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of means- test the winter fuel payment on level of pensioner poverty 
 under the last conservative government an estimate of the poor pensioner eligible for pension credit be not claim it we have launch the big ever pension credit awareness campaign and write to pensioner on housing benefit urge they to apply as a result claim for pension credit have more than double and those who receive pension credit will also receive winter fuel payment and other related benefit 
 before the last general election the labour party suggest that removal of the winter fuel payment would mean an extra pensioner a year die freeze in poverty how many will die under the government ’s policy this year 
 the government remain absolutely committed to support low income pensioner we be support they through the household support fund which local authority can use to help people on the low income with their bill the minister for energy consumers my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh have also raise £ from energy supplier to help those most vulnerable consumer in debt we also have the warm home discount and the warm home plan to help those on low income to heat their home 
 under the conservatives billion in pension credit go unclaimed the burden for drive up claim often lie in fantastic organisation such as christians against poverty the falkirk and clackmannanshire carers centre and citizens advice falkirk and denny as well as the brilliant falkirk council welfare benefit team in my constituency what assurance can the minister give i that beyond   december   her department will work tirelessly to prevent billion in benefit from be leave unclaimed 
 indeed we have take forward the big awareness campaign for claim pension credit that have ever be see we be determined that those on the low income should claim pension credit and be award it which will passport they to winter fuel payment and other related benefit 
 the scottish government be bring back the winter fuel payment because we be aware what an awful disaster this have be for the labour government people be terrify   to switch on their heating will the minister please explain to pensioner live in poverty circumstance but not eligible for pension credit what they should do this winter should they just wear an extra blanket 
 the scottish government have be give a record settlement in the recent budget as the hon member know winter fuel payment and other benefit be devolve to the scottish government 
 i thank the resident of york for donate to my thermal collection on saturday but i know that old people in the city of york will really struggle this winter will the minister say how many people across the country have sign up to pension credit since july and what additional step will be take to ensure that those who miss the   december   deadline will still be able to get support to keep warm this winter

 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as a lifelong champion of family carer deal with the problem of carer ’s allowance overpayment be a priority for i and for my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability last week we set out the next step in our independent review lead by liz sayce the former chief executive of disability rights uk it will report by the summer and will look at how and why overpayment be build up the change we can make for the future and how good to help those affect along with the big ever cash boost to the earning threshold for carer ’s allowance announce in the budget it show our determination to give family carer the support they need and deserve 
 in bognor regis and littlehampton more than people have lose their winter fuel allowance more than of former claimant do the secretary of state think that it be fair that someone who have pay tax all their work life will now be tax on their state pension as well as lose their winter fuel allowance 
 the hon lady talk about the winter fuel payment but she fail to mention our determination to ensure that the pensioner who do not claim pension credit but be eligible claim it so that they can get their winter fuel payment the £ allocate from the household support fund to west sussex which cover her constituency can be use precisely for those pensioner just above the pension credit threshold who have work hard all their life but need extra support with the cost of heating 
 i welcome the review into the overpayment of carer ’s allowance which will come as a huge relief to many people in east worthing and shoreham can the minister confirm that the department will do everything it can to prevent family carer unnecessarily get into debt 
 yes i can confirm that we place a very high value on the contribution of family carer as my right hon friend the secretary of state say the budget announcement on the carer ’s allowance earn threshold will help avert inadvertent overpayment and will make an additional carer eligible for carer ’s allowance we be determined to do everything we can 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 how many people who should get the winter fuel payment will get it this winter 
 we intend to ensure that everybody who be entitle to pension credit and therefore the winter fuel payment claim it and get it we have see a increase in claim far more than be ever achieve under the last government if the hon lady be so concerned about that perhaps she should have take action during her party ’s year in government 
 unfortunately the right hon lady simply will not give a straight answer she will not tell the house what she know she know that the government ’s choice would push pensioner into poverty and she do not tell the house that either let we try this question instead the government ’s own figure show that pensioner apply now will have to wait until the spring to find out whether they will get winter fuel money what be her advice to a pensioner sit in the cold and wonder if they can afford to turn on their heating this christmas 
 if the hon lady care so much about pensioner in the cold why do her government leave not claim pension credit why do they promise to bring together housing benefit and pension credit in and never deliver it this government be take action—42,500 more people be receive pension credit now than when she leave government we be determined to act perhaps she should apologise for her failure 
 many of my more senior constituent be concerned about their finance and winter fuel payment especially those just above the threshold in slough household be currently eligible for pension credit but not claim this vital benefit so what step be the department take to increase the uptake and ensure that those who be not eligible be not leave out in the cold 
 i place on record my thank to the local authority that have work with the department for work and pensions to raise awareness of apply for pension credit and also to the various charity around the country that have work with we   the number of people claim pension credit have double a record number and we be process those claim at pace 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 a report by the national audit office last week highlight how cliff edge in the care allowance system have result in people owe £ in the light of that will the minister ensure that we stop this injustice and stop the demand until a fair system be introduce 
 i welcome the nao report which i ask for last may when i be chair of the work and pensions committee we be determined to address the problem of carer ’s allowance overpayment the cliff edge could be deal with through the introduction of a taper instead of the current arrangement as the chancellor mention in her budget speech in the autumn if we do that it will not happen quickly because it will be quite a major project but it be something that we be look at closely 
 my constituent gary have see his real term income fall because the pension he build up before in a define benefit scheme be not subject to indexation even though of define benefit scheme be in surplus will my right hon friend ask the pensions regulator to look at this issue 
 i thank my hon friend for represent the concern of his constituent the department be work closely with the pensions regulator we be look to gather information on the number of scheme that provide discretionary increase on pre-1997 benefit and those that do not at the moment the trustee of those scheme have discretion over the decision to index those benefit 
 over the weekend james reed the chief executive of of the uk ’s large recruiter say that job vacancy be down compare with the same period last year which should be a red light warning that high unemployment and recession be just around the corner will the secretary of state plead with the chancellor to reverse the job national insurance tax raid that be devastating employment figure before that warning become a reality 
 we still have more than vacancy in this economy and business be cry out for staff that be why through our reform programme we be determined that the dwp will serve business well i look forward to work with member across the house to make that happen 
 on friday my constituent andrew price and matthew whitmore come to my surgery to share their anger and distress at their pension be steal by a so call investment company they be thousand of pound out of pocket will the pensions minister say what protection be in place against this and will she meet i to discuss how my constituent can get their money back 
 there be unfortunately many such case in which people be prey on by scammer i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the case far 
 why do the office for budget responsibility estimate that the budget would cost job 
 i refer the right hon gentleman to the obr report that say that overall employment will go up 
 how do the secretary of state envision the future of jobcentre in my constituency and across scotland and what role will technology play in that 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that any reform to our jobcentre must come with digital transformation we be currently explore scheme such as a jobcentre in your pocket app as well as look for way in which jobseeker can self serve in term of meet the condition of their conditionality regime 
 on december my hon friend the member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter ask the prime minister about the waspi women against state pension inequality campaign woman and be tell that the government be work at pace since then or more woman have die without justice or compensation will the minister tell we what work at pace mean and give we a timeline 
 i be the minister for year to meet the waspi campaigner to listen to their concern the ombudsman take year to investigate case we be work at pace on this issue we hope to come to the house soon if the hon gentleman will listen to my answer to update he and the public on what we will do next 
 young people in supported housing include in my constituency effectively pay a marginal rate of tax of on their universal credit when they start work mean that earning of just £ a week see their housing benefit taper to nil that mean that work do not pay will the minister look at the economic benefit of reduce that taper and increase the applicable amount ensure that work do pay and improve housing security 
 my hon friend raise a very important point there be a problem in the interaction between the universal credit taper rate and the housing benefit taper for people in support and temporary accommodation we be at the moment look at option for how to tackle that quite serious work disincentive problem 
 this christmas over in child in this country will be live in poverty that could be partly address by scrap the child benefit cap and pay for simply by reverse the tory tax cut on the bank what be more important hungry child or banker bonus 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise the condition of child live in poverty in this country that be why as i mention early the child poverty taskforce be do extensive work on the issue 
 accord to the migration observatory report over child be likely to be in family with no recourse to public fund as the work and pensions committee report highlight those family face particularly tough circumstance without access to benefit will the minister confirm whether the child poverty taskforce be engage directly with affected family to understand the challenge they face 
 the child poverty taskforce be consider all child across the uk in all aspect of our child poverty strategy we recognise the distinct challenge of poverty face by child in particular group such as migrant child disabled child and other we be engage directly with family affect by poverty we recognise that the cause of child poverty be deep rooted and we will look at all lever to make change 
 in epsom and ewell local charity such as the sunnybank trust be see a lack of employment opportunity for people with learn disability in fact only of people with learning disability be currently in pay work what measure be the dwp take to support employer to help individual with learn disability to get into work 
 the hon member raise a very important point she will probably be aware of the buckland review publish before the election which look specifically at employment support for people with autism the minister for employment and i meet sir robert buckland recently and we be look at how we can take forward the idea he propose in his report 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 a recently publish freedom of information request indicate that ai tool use to detect dwp fraud be    biased and disproportionately discriminate against people by age disability marital status and nationality obviously that have cause considerable concern what assurance can the minister give that the procurement and use of such tool will be cover by strict governance standard include test for fairness 
 my hon friend will know that we face a significant challenge with fraud and error cost the department almost £ a year it be right that we look to utilise all available tool to tackle it however i understand her concern although i would remind she that the final decision on whether someone receive a welfare payment be always make by a human that be the most robust safeguard that we can have in place although of course it sit alongside a broad suite 
 my inspirational constituent bells lewers have terminal bowel cancer when she be undergo treatment she be initially turn down for personal independence payment despite the significant impact on her ability to work and carry out basic daily activity have the minister consider incorporate clinical diagnosis alongside function in eligibility assessment and will he meet bell to discuss the assessment process 
 we do keep the assessment process under review but i would be happy to look at the detail of this particular case and perhaps meet the hon lady and her constituent if that would be helpful 
 an astonishing £ have be lose to benefit fraud and error since the pandemic will the minister outline the plan and the timeline for recoup that money 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the enormous cost to the department upwards of £ of fraud since the pandemic she will be pleased to know that the fraud error and debt bill be due to come to the house early in the new year this government be serious about tackle fraud it be just a shame that we inherit the mess we do 
 order before i call   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith i will make a short statement 
 the house of commons respect the jurisdiction of the court for example in our sub judice rule the sub judice rule apply to all criminal case include case involve espionage which be currently before court it be important that nothing we say should prejudice a fair trial before a jury the sub judice rule also apply to the majority of civil case but it do not apply when a ministerial decision be in question such as the decision in this case by the home secretary to exclude the person know as h6 from the uk on the basis that his exclusion be conducive to the public good on ground of national security 
 i understand that this afternoon the administrative court decide to lift the anonymity order the government be responsible to this house which hold ministers accountable for what be do on their authority although it be important that member should be able to question ministers i remind they of the rule set out in paragraph and of erskine may that it be only in order to criticise the conduct of a member of the royal family when debate a substantive motion draw up in proper term which be not the case in this urgent question i hope that the house now have a feel for the way in which we will debate this subject 
 urgent question to ask the government if they will make a statement on the extent of the operation of the united front work department within the uk 
 the duty of any government be national security and we therefore welcome the court ’s decision to uphold the home office ’s position with regard to the exclusion of h6 who can now be name as yang tengbo the special immigration appeals commission conclude that there be a basis for the conclusion that h6 
 have be in a position to generate relationship with prominent uk figure which could be leverage for political interference purpose by the ccp include the ufwd or the chinese state 
 where there be individual who pose a threat to our national security we be absolutely committed to use the full range of power available to disrupt they when we encounter foreign interference or espionage whether it stem from the united front work department or from any other state link actor we will be swift in use all available tool include prosecution exclusion sanction and diplomacy to keep our country safe 
 give the potential for further litigation it would be inappropriate for i to say any more but it be important to recognise that this case do not exist in a vacuum as the director general of mi5 make clear in october we be in the most complex threat environment that he have ever see alongside the threat from terrorism we face ongoing effort by a number of state include china russia and iran to harm the uk ’s security our response be among the most robust and sophisticated anywhere in the world 
 the national security act which be support by member on both side of the house and which strengthen our power to protect the uk be central to our protection against state that seek to conduct hostile act to date individual have be charge under the new act and the government have be work hard on the roll out of a crucial part of it the foreign influence registration scheme or firs we will say more about that soon but we intend to lay regulation in the new year and commence the scheme in the summer 
 the government have also set out our approach to china which will be consistent and strategic we will challenge where we must in order to keep our country safe compete where we need to and co operate where we can for example on matter such as climate change that be act in the national interest as the prime minister reiterate early today however the threat we face from foreign state be pernicious and complex the work of our intelligence agency be unrivalle in mitigate they and i want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to they for the amazing work that they do to keep our country safe today as ever they will be pursue those who wish to do we harm include those from foreign state we support our intelligence agency in their effort and we always will and they will know that at any point when the uk ’s national security be at risk we will not hesitate to use every tool at our disposal to keep our country safe 
 i want to put thing on the record it would have be easy for the government to come to the house with a statement obviously there be more to say than we have allocate time for 
 secondly i say to sir iain please do not tell the medium what you be go to do and how you be go to do it and do not try to bounce the chair into make a decision if anybody else have put in for an urgent question i would have give it to they on the basis that i be not dance to the tune of the medium 
 it would be helpful if the government come forward with statement rather than be drag to the dispatch box hopefully we can all learn from this and here be a good example of how that will be do i call sir iain duncan smith 
 mr speaker i apologise if that be the case 
 yang tengbo h6 be in fact not a lone wolf he be of some member of the united front work department which as the government know the intelligence and security committee report last year say have penetrate every sector of the uk economy include by spy steal intellectual property influencing and shape our institution our agent say they be now frustrate by the lack of action but they do not seem to have the tool they need to deal with the issue of those tool be star we in the face will the government commit to put china in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme and will they do it now there be no need for delay 
 the inter parliamentary alliance on china or ipac find that h6 yang tengbo be already well know as a united front member and that he be know to other who be already deep in the political establishment parliamentarian be expose to the united front on a   regular basis will the minister remedy this today and accept that china be our most prominent security threat and that all action must take priority 
 my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat who be the previous security minister have say publicly that the home office be ready to name china in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme which would have force united front member like h6 to register or face serious consequence give that do so be an available option why have we not do it yet be it true as be be report by paper include the times that behind the scene the government be now under pressure from bank the wide business community and government departments not to do it 
 when it come to a member of the royal family i simply say this how be it that somebody who be know to the security force be allow to get so close to a member of the royal family without proper scrutiny expose they 
 finally i note that the prime minister say today in response to the issue that we will co operate where we can particularly on environmental issue and challenge where we must particularly on human right issue if the prime minister mean that why be we still buy from china huge number of solar array that have demonstrably be make use slave labour surely his statement be clearly incorrect far from challenge china on human right it now appear that we be turn a blind eye why be that 
 let i come to the point the right hon gentleman make about firs upon our arrival in government we find that firs be not ready to be implement as have be claim since come into office we have ensure that more people than ever be now work on firs implementation and the case management team have be recruit and be now in place as i say in my opening remark we plan to lay the regulation that underpin the scheme in the new year ahead of the scheme go live in the summer as we have previously commit we will provide month notice of the scheme ’s go live date to give all those who will be affect by it adequate time to prepare 
 the scheme will be underpin by an it solution consist of a registration platform a case management system and an online public register the it programme develop under the previous government be not ready for the scheme to go live and plan be not sufficiently robust this government have progress at pace with the work to ensure that we be in a position to launch firs with the laying of the regulation in the new year with a view to the scheme go live in the summer work be also under way to identify which foreign power will be place on the enhance tier that will be base on robust security and intelligence analysis the home secretary and i plan to begin set out the government ’s approach for the use of the enhance tier in due course 
 the duty of government be national security and the threat that the country face be the most complex and evolve we have ever see give the range of threat we face from hostile state actor it be important that the government take action to protect our critical national infrastructure from cyber attack and ransomware   attack can the minister update we on the plan announce in the king ’s speech for a new bill on cyber resilience and other action to improve protection in this area 
 my hon friend make an important point we be work at pace with colleague across government include in the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for science innovation and technology to progress these matter there be a lot of work go on across government to ensure that we be as resilient as we can possibly be to the threat we face from a range of actor he can be assure as can the house that this government will use all necessary measure to protect our security and ensure that our critical national infrastructure be as resilient as it possibly can be 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 can i start by thank the security minister and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for the security briefing they arrange early today for the shadow foreign secretary and myself we be grateful for the assistance chinese infiltration of public organisation be of grave concern but this be not just about public organisation such as the government business and university be also be systemically infiltrate and intellectual property theft be often at the heart of what the chinese government be try to achieve when i be technology minister i see this in area such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing and i would like to hear the security minister say more about intellectual property theft of cut edge technology in a moment 
 last year the head of mi5 ken mccallum say that chinese activity seek to infiltrate our institution be take place on an epic scale last year there be multiple attempt by chinese company to get hold of sensitive technology and mi5 estimate that individual have be approach by chinese agent who be try to influence they or forge contact in some way it be likely that at some point either in the past or in the future an attempt to contact every member of this house will be make in form or another 
 the opposition will fully support the government in work to secure our nation ’s safety and i will ask the minister or question in that spirit would he consider expedite the implementation of the foreign influence registration scheme that he refer to i echo the suggestion from my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   that china should be place in the enhance tier of that scheme 
 secondly will the security minister review the wisdom of the government ’s approach to china give what we have learn and what we now know the very close relation that the prime minister be apparently attempt and the rather sycophantic tone he take with president xi at the g20 a few week ago may not be very wise 
 chinese infiltration and intellectual property theft be of very grave concern and i would welcome some further comment from the security minister as to what he will do to combat they 
 we be pleased to offer that briefing because these be important matter that should not divide we it will always be this government ’s approach that where we can work co operatively with all member of this house on matter relate to national security we will seek to do so 
 the right hon gentleman make some important point about matter relate to business high education and university he be a former technology minister so i know he speak with authority and expertise on matter relate to intellectual property theft and this be an important point for he to make i share his concern it be completely unacceptable that any entity whether they be a hostile state or otherwise should seek to draw intellectual property out of our country and this government take the matter very seriously 
 the right hon gentleman mention the comment of the director general of mi5 ken mccallum and i would say to he that the national security and investment act provide a framework for this government as it do for the previous government when deal with some of these matter 
 the right hon gentleman ask about firs and i hope i have be able to provide some reassurance on the government ’s intention to table the regulation as soon as practically possible in the new year with a view to have the scheme up and run by the summer 
 on the approach to china i do not agree with the right hon gentleman ’s characterisation of the prime minister ’s recent meeting i would just say very gently to he that at least the prime minister do not take president xi to the pub for a pint 
 will the broad china audit include an assessment of the number of chinese communist party operative work in the uk include through body such as the hong kong economic and trade office and will the minister ensure that everyone target whether they be member of this place member of the royal family or member of the public with british national overseas status who be originally from hong kong have access to tailor security support 
 we be work with other departments to carry out an audit of the uk ’s relationship with china this be be do to improve our ability to understand and respond to both the challenge and the opportunity that china pose it be vital that we have a thorough understanding of the bilateral relationship with china include where we need to challenge to protect the uk ’s national security the audit be ongoing and its outcome will guide a consistent and coherent approach to china 
 british national overseas status be a matter that i know my hon friend have rightly pursue for a significant amount of time this reflect the uk ’s historical and moral commitment to those people of hong kong who choose to retain their tie to the uk by take up bno status at the point of hong kong ’s handover to china in bno status holder and their family be make significant contribution to our economy and local community from the route ’s introduction on   january   to the end of september more than visa be grant 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for secure this urgent question on a crucial issue for all of we in this place because we be look for robust action from this government to keep our politic and democracy safe from the influence of foreign government 
 we should not pretend for a moment that the case of h6 be in any way unique or unusual because as we have hear the director general of mi5 ken mccallum have warn that body like the ufwd be 
 mount patient well fund deceptive campaign to buy and exert influence 
 we see it in our business world and we see it in our university 
 we have the chinese consulate in my edinburgh west constituency and i have on more than occasion be personally chastise by the consul for express my view about uyghur muslims or for speak up for hong kong resident in this country so it be a serious problem in fact i be once film by a mysterious drone while speak at a hong kong protest we need robust action to clamp down on thing like the police station that we have hear exist in this country the government say they be seek close relationship with china so how can the minister reassure we that they will not weaken their stance or robustness against chinese influence in this country or on human right and democracy in taiwan and hong kong how will they protect we all from china ’s insidious approach 
 i can assure the hon lady that this government be and will be take the robust action require to combat the nature of the threat that she rightly characterise she be right to say that the particular circumstance of the case we be discuss today be not unique the government be work with the intelligence agency and partner to combat a much wide threat on matter relate to china she will understand that the government have to weigh a number of consideration while national security will always be our primary responsibility and the thing we take most seriously there be as there would have be for the previous government a requirement to look for area where we can co operate in truth we have to balance that relationship but i can give she an assurance that we will take the robust action require include through the defend democracy taskforce which be a useful mechanism that we use across government to look more closely at these matter 
 member from across the house be right to raise concern about the security threat and attempt to undermine or infiltrate our institution that we face from china on behalf of all member of the house will the minister pass on our thank to all those who work in the security service for their vital work most of we will never know or see that work but it be constantly protect we from those threat 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for make that point by necessity the work that our intelligence service do be in the shadow but since come into this role a number of month ago i have be extremely   impress by the professionalism and dedication of those man and woman who work incredibly hard to keep our country safe we all across the house and the country owe they a debt of gratitude and i will ensure that be pass on 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 may i urge the minister to introduce the firs scheme as soon as possible and commence it at the early possible opportunity what step have the home office take to ensure the propose new chinese embassy at the royal mint site have proper oversight so that we do not allow it to become a new base for spy 
 i be grateful to the chair of the home affairs committee for her question i know the home secretary be look forward to appear in front of the committee tomorrow 
 on the embassy as the right hon lady will know the secretary of state for housing communities and local government have call in the application in line with current planning policy the planning decision sit solely with the secretary of state for housing communities and local government the deputy prime minister as the right hon lady will understand i be unable to say anything more about that but a final decision will be make in due course 
 the right hon lady also ask about firs i can give she an assurance that we be progress it at pace and it be the government ’s strong intention to introduce it as soon as practically possible to that end we intend to lay the regulation as soon as possible in the new year 
 the shadow home secretary refer to sycophancy towards the chinese but i think that charge be well direct at member of his own party it be less than year since theresa may go to beijing where she be praise by the state medium i know that because i be on that trip in a former career she be praise for sidestep human right issue in the furtherance of the wide necessity of the trip do the minister agree that that be not the right approach to the chinese 
 i agree that be not the right approach the current government ’s approach be the right i have lay out the strategic approach we intend to adopt with china we have to be clear head about the nature of the threat we face but we also have to look for area where we can co operate as well 
 last year as home secretary i make the decision to exclude yang tengbo from the uk because his presence pose a threat to our national security that decision be base on the advice of mi5 and i be very pleased that the high court have uphold that decision i say gently to the minister that it be regrettable that it have take a high profile case public outcry and opposition mp drag the minister to the chamber to finally get the government to commit to implement the foreign influence registration scheme a scheme that we enact and that be ready to go at the time of the   general election if the government be really serious about tackle the unprecedented threat pose by china malicious cyber attack transnational repression the confucius institutes chinese police station and of course human right abuse against the uyghur muslims when will they list china on the enhance tier 
 i be not go to make this point but give the way in which the right hon and learn lady have make her i will gently point out that the previous government have a significant period from the passing of the national 
 indicate dissent 
 the right hon and learn lady shake her head it be a statement of fact that the previous government have a significant amount of time many month from the passing of the national security act during which they could have choose to implement firs they do not implement firs it now fall to this government to do so and that be precisely what we will do 
 it be disappointing that some opposition members be try to turn what should be a moment of collective unity in the face of a share security threat into a political row do the security minister agree that it be pretty incredible for the party whose defence secretary be sack for leak vital intelligence about the huawei g contract now to pose as the protector of our national security 
 i agree this government ’s approach will always be to work constructively across the house on matter relate to national security but give the record of certain right hon and hon opposition members i suggest that humility might be the order of the day for some of they 
 i do not want to go over the readiness of firs again and again i will leave it at this i be assure by the same official who sit in the box advise the minister that it would be ready to go by the end of the year clearly the advice have change only thing in the department have change which be the party lead it so i can only assume that there have be a change of intent but i be delighted that it will be ready to go by the summer well late than never the real question of course be whether it will be worth have the advice from mi5 be very clear if china be not in the enhance tier it will not be worth have will china be in that tier 
 the right hon gentleman know that i take these matter incredibly seriously he and i have know each other for a very long time i therefore know that he will take on trust my assertion to he and to the house that the scheme be not ready to go when we arrive in government in july this year we be work at pace i have today give the house a timeframe and say that we be look very closely work with colleague across government at how we can well structure the scheme we will make announcement in the normal way in due course 
 weak point in protect our parliamentary democracy from hostile state actor be money in politic do the security minister agree that this late case show that it   be a priority to ensure that our electoral law be robust enough that only fund that be clean and source entirely from within the uk fund our political party because there certainly seem to be some confusion among some of the party in opposition 
 my hon friend make an important point and speak with great authority on this matter he will know that we have just appoint baroness hodge as the government ’s new anti corruption champion she will support the work that we do look very carefully at the impact of dirty money on politic he be right that the government will want to assure ourselves that the electoral law that govern the conduct of election be robust and ensure that there be no opportunity for people from overseas to intervene in our political process that advice should be take very seriously by all party across the house 
 in my constituency there be many hongkonger deeply concerned about surveillance from chinese agent in this country can the minister give my constituent any assurance that their legitimate fear be be address by the government 
 i be grateful to the hon member for raise the plight of his constituent yes i can give he those assurance the government take very seriously the kind of intervention he refer to through the defend democracy taskforce we be look carefully at the issue of transnational repression and we will have more to say about it in due course 
 can i ask the minister about the integrity of our democracy in particular what step be he take to ensure the integrity of the process and institution of our political process especially but not only with regard to china 
 my hon friend make an important point i briefly mention early the importance that this government attach to the defend democracy taskforce we inherit that body from the previous government we be work at pace to ensure that it work across government as effectively as possible fundamentally it seek to address the point he make about challenge those threat to the integrity of our democracy this government will ensure that no stone be leave unturned in seek to address the significant challenge that we all know we face 
 just a few day ago the head of mi5 talk about have to make uncomfortable choice and par back counter terrorism operation in order to deal with the huge rise in state threat if the government mean what they say about security be the priority of government will the minister undertake to ensure that mi5 and the security service as a whole have the resource they need to tackle all the threat by all mean blame the previous government for the state we be in but it will not get he far because i need he to answer that question 
 the hon gentleman make a fair point and a good challenge i can assure he that the home secretary and i work incredibly closely with mi5 and   colleague across government to ensure that they have the resource they need to do the difficult job they do i mention the remark that ken mccallum make in his annual threat lecture back in october the nature of the threat we face be more challenging and complex than at any point in our lifetime that do require resource and expertise the home secretary i as security minister and all the government will work to ensure that our security service have the resource they need to do the job 
 i be grateful for the urgent question and thank the minister for what he have say in particular about the defend democracy taskforce can he assure i not only that the government will do all they can to secure our national security but with respect to the activity of individual with know link to the chinese government and who be consider to be a national security risk that the full of investigation will be do to ensure the integrity of our national security 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance 
 the united front work department be say to have member globally and mr yang tengbo be surely the tip of the iceberg in the uk the department be task with cultivate relationship not only with high level figure that extend an influence to british national but with those in all walk of society that mean the public need to be much more aware of the risk to themselves what be the minister do to assess the number of those member in our society and what public awareness campaign will he make for my constituent in dundee and constituent across these island 
 the hon member make an important point about public awareness and i will take that away and give it further consideration with regard to the remark he make at the beginning he have essentially underline the importance of why we need the fir scheme as i have say a number of time before the government be commit to implement the scheme we be get on and will implement it in the new year 
 notwithstanding the somewhat chide tone of some of the comment from hon member on the opposition benches do the security minister agree with i that it be actually possible both to maintain a consistent and long term relationship with china as we must and to take the robust measure that he have set out today to defend our national interest 
 i do agree that be the challenge for any government regardless of their political stripe yes of course national security be the priority and we must defend against the threat that we face but we also have to co operate economically the government will seek to balance those responsibility 
 the security minister mention the breadth of the national security threat against the united kingdom he mention russia china and iran but unless i miss it he do not mention north korea will he comment on that follow on from the question that my hon friend the member   for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin ask about resource be the minister confident that the uk intelligence community across agency have sufficient resource to manage the increase threat that he have recognise today 
 the right hon gentleman speak with experience and authority on these matter and he be right to mention north korea on his point about resource i be not remotely complacent about that at all mindful of the nature of the threat that we face the home secretary and i will work with our colleague across government to ensure that our security service have the resource they need we have exceptional people step forward to serve and it be the responsibility of government regardless of political colour to ensure that they have the resource and technology they need not just to keep pace with the threat but to retain a competitive advantage we will ensure that they have the resource to do that 
 yang tengbo be the alleged chinese spy who have be stalk the corridor of power in our country rub shoulder with royalty prime ministers and business leader yet his name be withhold from the great british public do the minister agree that his name be withhold only to avoid embarrassment for previous prime ministers and for business leader and that that be not in the good interest of the british public 
 i be sure that the hon gentleman will acknowledge that i name h6 his initial anonymity be a result of a court order it be not a uk government decision 
 the west certainly learn a lesson about energy supply and where they come from when russia invade to build on what my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   say i want to press the minister on solar and renewable the government have an agenda to push this country quickly towards renewable energy yet china manufacture and process a lot of the material that we need for it before we accelerate towards that goal will the minister undertake an assessment of the risk to our energy supply that be a crucial piece of our national security 
 i be genuinely grateful to the right hon gentleman for his reasonable and constructive point which we will consider far he will acknowledge that the government must make difficult judgment about those matter but i assure he that we will look at they with a clear head view of what be in our national interest and in the end national security will always prevail 
 do the minister agree that it be not just the big scheme that need consideration but the small one too elite capture can happen at high education and infrastructure level peking university hsbc business school in oxford want to expand the local planning authority narrowly pass the proposal i ask the previous government to call it in but just last week this government approve the scheme that be a mistake the economic benefit will go primarily to the chinese communist party will the   minister ’s department ask the ministry of housing communities and local government to look again at the scheme what resilience be he offer local planning authority on such matter 
 the hon lady be right it be not just about the big scheme the small one be important as well i think what she refer to be essentially a planning matter but i will look at it far on matter relate to high education we work closely with colleague in the department for education and mechanism be in place across government so that when concern be express we will follow they up
