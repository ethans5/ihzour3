the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net on tackle the health impact of fuel poverty 
 the government ’s fuel poverty strategy recognise that warm home can help to reduce health inequality and pressure on the nhs that be a key reason why we be deliver a package of cost support worth £ per household on average from to and invest heavily in fuel efficiency 
 the recent institute of health equity marmot report highlight the negative effect of live in cold and uninsulated home include respiratory and circulatory disease and hamper lung and brain development in child last year the energy systems catapult and a number of nhs provider run a trial of warm home prescription with nhs practitioner identify vulnerable patient and support they with their energy need i think that the secretary of state have accept the link between cold home and health outcome if that be the case be the government consider expand this approach or look for alternative way in which the health system and fuel poverty prevention can go hand in hand 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that a number of local warm home prescription scheme have offer additional support to help people with health vulnerability to stay warm and well such scheme be excellent example of local collaboration between the nhs local government and other partner tailor of course to the local need of their area and i would be interested to see whether other part of the nhs choose to take up these sort of idea in the future 
 what step her department be take to improve urgent and emergency care 
 what step her department be take to improve urgent and emergency care 
 what step her department be take to improve urgent and emergency care 
 a year ago we set out a plan to improve urgent and emergency care and the plan be work performance this winter have be well with ambulance wait down by nearly a and we be learn the lesson from this year to make further improvement in the year ahead 
 it be welcome news that the brand new £ a&e campus at stepping hill hospital be near completion however other building on this age site be fail and urgently need replace will my hon friend ensure that stepping hill remain at the heart of hospital facility in stockport with rebuilt unit and support new hospital investment and specialist diagnostic hub across stockport 
 i be delighted that stepping hill hospital will soon have a new emergency care campus with all the benefit that that will bring to my hon friend ’s constituent i know that she be a great campaigner for her local nhs and have already meet the secretary of state about the concern she raise as well as make her argument so clearly in westminster i would encourage she to continue discussion with her local nhs integrate care board which be responsible for local decision on capital investment 
 up to £ for a brand new acute hospital be come to mid hampshire and health expert be make the case that it will make huge improvement in care despite some politically inspired and misinformed opposition can my hon friend reassure my constituent that those run our local nhs should be listen to and also that the doctor lead urgent treatment centre in winchester will continue to provide for quarter of urgent case include x ray mri scan and other test after the new acute hospital be build which we hope will be at junction 
 i commend my hon friend for her hard work on support the new hospital for the leadership she be provide and for her work on encourage resident to have their say in the consultation i can not prejudge the outcome of the consultation but i agree with she that the new hospital will be great for patient with its modern facility she be right to say that an urgent treatment centre can provide excellent emergency care for the majority of people who attend a&e. 
 northampton have be the beneficiary of many welcome new or improved facility in recent year include a child ’s a&e a main a&e and the announcement of a community diagnostic centre however the miss piece of the jigsaw be an urgent treatment centre for which i have be campaign for many year now will the minister inform i on the progress on that centre 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his successful campaigning for healthcare in northampton which be as he say benefit from upgrade to the child ’s a&e and the main emergency department and will soon have of our new clinical diagnostic centre he will know that his local nhs integrate care   board will decide whether to fund a new urgent treatment centre and i have every confidence in his ability to persuade it of do so 
 it be of the great success of the past few year that we now save the life of a lot more people with an acquire brain injury although we might save they in acute and emergency care however a national strategy for acquire brain injury be a really important part of ensure that people have the proper care thereafter the government appoint i and the minister for health and secondary care   the right hon member for pendle andrew stephenson he be just pass the hon lady a note to inspire she on the subject to try to publish when do she hope that there will be money available to ensure that that strategy be worth have 
 i know that the hon gentleman be a great campaigner on this issue he have work very hard on it with i in the past and he now do so with my right hon friend the minister for health and secondary care i assure he that we be in the process of revise the draft strategy take on board feedback from patient their family charity and the nhs and we will publish the strategy in due course i thank all stakeholder for their continue effort 
 in january the average category response time for west midland ambulance service be over minute we know that the problem be bad in shropshire follow story such as that of a lady who wait hour before see a doctor have contract an infection follow radiation therapy for her cancer treatment the situation in shropshire do not seem to be improve as fast as we would like what step be the minister take to resolve the problem 
 across the country ambulance response time have come down by a we have work very hard particularly with area that face great challenge include shropshire i have speak to leader in the local health system about the ongoing challenge we be learn lesson about what have work over the past year and from where we have not make so much progress to ensure that we do well in area such as the hon lady ’s over the year ahead 
 i thank the minister for her positive answer they be really appreciate bear in mind the pressure that gps be under which be lead to more pressure on emergency provision what step be be take to provide great incentive for medical student to take on position in gp surgery that would make a big difference 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to talk about the whole health system thing we be do as part of our work on urgent and emergency care be prevent people from be admit to hospital unnecessarily or from be bring to a&e in the place primary care be part of that in our investment in expand medical school place we be particularly encouraging medical school such as the new kent and canterbury medical school near i to train student to work more outside hospital include in primary care 
 i call the shadow minister 
 despite water down the target for ambulance response time and the a&e hour wait the government still can not meet they we have hear from member across the house this morning how patient be wait long the new target say that there will be further improvement in and the minister have say that again this morning can she let we in on what exactly they will be 
 i be not go to pre empt the publication of target for the come year but as i have say we will continue to learn lesson from the progress that we have make this year include on ambulance response time which be down by over a anyway i will take no lesson from labour because we know the state of the nhs in wales 
 what progress her department have make on reform social care 
 we be make great progress on our year vision for adult social care reform we have introduce the ever national career structure for care worker and we have introduce new assessment by the care quality commission which will shine a light on how well council be deliver their social care duty 
 i be most grateful to my hon friend for that reply in suffolk where the population be increasingly elderly social care be under enormous pressure and it be a significant challenge to recruit carer pay they fairly and provide they with a proper career path therefore i hear what my hon friend say but will she consider commission a long term workforce plan for adult social care equivalent to that for the nhs 
 my hon friend be right about the importance of the social care workforce social care be its workforce i can assure he that we already have a plan for the care workforce set out in the people at the heart of care white paper and now we be put it into practice our care workforce pathway be already be implement our new accredited qualification for care worker will be launch later this year and we be back social care with up to £ in extra available funding 
 i be concerned to hear that a constituent of mine be initially deny access to social care for his mother who suffer from alzheimer ’s despite her inability to administer her own medication will the government look to broaden the criterion of the care act to include those require support with administer medication 
 we very much want everybody who need care to get it and everyone who be eligible for financial support should get it that of course be assess by local authority we be introduce care quality commission assurance of social care commission by local authority to make sure people get the care they deserve and to shine a light on where local authority be do a really good job and where other could   do well 
 the idea of a social care cost cap have drop off the agenda slightly i know it be incredibly expensive but i continue to be contact by constituent who face lose everything when often their love one have dementia and it be already emotionally an incredibly traumatic time they have the add anxiety of how they be go to pay for care the only thing that should matter be what work and be good for their love but there be a cloud of anxiety hang over society which we all worry about will the minister confirm that this issue have not lose her attention and that we will continue to consider whether we can introduce a cap 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question on concern about the cost of care and how much it cost some people as he may know i remind he the charge reform be delay in by the chancellor after we listen to local authority 
 a of the social care role in westmorland and furness be currently vacant and unfilled coincidentally that be the same proportion of bed in morecambe bay that be occupy by patient who be unable to get a care package and therefore leave hospital the reason for this be blindingly obvious the pay and career structure be derisory for hard work wonderful people and there be a complete absence of genuinely affordable home for people in those sort of role to enable they to live locally do the minister agree that fix that crisis in my community and other should be the priority for the chancellor tomorrow not silly electoral gimmick 
 i recognise the challenge in the hon gentleman ’s area although nationally vacancy in social care have fall by over we be reform adult social care career to make care a career for the uk workforce we be put extra funding into social care up to £ over year and introduce cqc assurance to make sure local authority be do their good on social care i would encourage the hon gentleman to talk to his local authority and make sure it be pay a fair rate for the care it commission 
 what step she be take to help increase recruitment and retention in the adult social care sector 
 what step she be take to help increase recruitment and retention in the adult social care sector 
 what step she be take to help increase recruitment and retention in the adult social care sector 
 care be a skilled profession and i want care worker to get the support and recognition they deserve in january we take the next step in our ambitious care workforce reform launch the ever national career structure for the care workforce alongside our new nationally recognise qualification 
 i know the minister will want to join i in thank every single person who dedicate themselves to work in the social care sector include perhaps particularly those who have come to the uk from overseas to do so but it be not sustainable to rely on incoming worker forever the migration advisory committee have find that scotland be now less reliant on migrant worker in the social care sector than england through the simple expedient of pay a decent wage that might by the way also be a good way to stop doctor in england go on strike the minister might want to look at that have the minister ask the chancellor to provide funding in the budget so that social care worker in england can enjoy the same pay and condition as their colleague in scotland and if not why not 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that we be grateful to all who work in social care include those who have come here from other country to care for our love one we also agree that international migration be not a long term answer to our care workforce need that be why we be reform social care to work as a career and we be back that with extra funding up to £ extra for social care over year 
 i be afraid the minister ’s warm word about the social care workforce do not meet the reality check for most people the government ’s own statistic show that there be at least vacancy in social care in england alone leave my constituent wait up to week to be discharge from hospital the government have be use international recruitment to plug the gap and as a result have fill over vacancy in the past few year so can the minister confirm whether recruitment and retention in social care will be well or bad due to government plan to prevent overseas social care worker bring family member to the uk 
 as i say a moment ago vacancy have fall and the care workforce grow by more than last year we be see well retention of care worker as well but we need to go far that be why we be reform social care career introduce the ever national career structure for the care workforce and new qualification and training 
 edinburgh trade union council recently describe change to the healthcare worker visa route as cruel and inhumane many of my constituent who have relative in care share its concern as do i. we know the valuable contribution that foreign care worker make to the sector ideologically drive change to visa could far exacerbate the recruitment and retention crisis that other member have so eloquently describe give that the government skip consultation on these change will the minister commit to meet trade union and social care leader in scotland to understand the impact of these harmful change 
 i be grateful to international care worker who have come to the uk to look after love one their work have contribute to reduce vacancy and increase the supply of social care but we need to get the balance right between international recruitment and our homegrown workforce we be carry out   ambitious reform of our adult social care workforce and therefore it be right alongside that to ensure that we have the right number of people come here from overseas for social care that be why we have work with the home office on change to visa 
 the manager of the wonderful care home i visit in dunstable on friday be annoy by the number of job applicant for care place who be make the interview stage and then not arrive on the day can the minister have a word with ministerial colleague at the department for work and pensions to ensure that job coach be certain that jobseeker be not waste the time of care home it be not fair and those who work in care home be busy people with a lot to do 
 i work closely with colleague in the department for work and pensions on the recruitment of people look for job in social care and i will raise that point with my colleague in the department 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be the minister ’s party that promise to fix the crisis in social care once and for all with vacancy rate almost time above the national average and turnover rate for new staff at more than it be clear that the government fail labour ’s plan for a national care service with clear standard for provider and a new deal for staff will give social care the fundamental reset it need the government have do it with our workforce plan and they have half heartedly try it with dentistry do the minister want to copy our homework once again 
 let we be honest labour have no plan for social care whatever the shadow minister say it be unfunded there be no funding commit to it and it be not meaningful those of we on the conservative side of the house be reform adult social care we not only have a plan but it be in progress 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i have ask the secretary of state a number of time how she intend to recruit and retain social care staff particularly with the visa change come into effect next monday stop those from overseas come to fill skill gap from bring their spouse or dependant with they i ask again how do the secretary of state intend to improve the recruitment and retention of staff in the social care sector while her colleague effectively work to undermine she 
 we be grateful to international worker come to support we in social care and improve supply but we have to get the balance right between international recruitment and our domestic workforce in england we be reform social care career to make social care work a career for our homegrown workforce and i encourage she to make sure the snp do the same in scotland 
 what discussion she have have with the north central london integrate care system on the potential closure of maternity service in north london 
 improve maternity care be a year priority in our woman ’s health strategy for this year any decision around maternity service need to be focus on improve outcome for mum and baby however decision on the local reconfiguration of service be make by local integrate care board and local trust 
 the maternity unit at the royal free hospital in my constituency be face closure last week i meet with doctor from the unit who tell i that the royal free be uniquely place to help mother with diabetes pregnant woman with hiv and mother who require interventional radiology the royal free be the only local provider that offer this life change treatment hour a day day a week do the minister agree that the royal free maternity unit have to stay open for the sake of those vulnerable group of woman 
 i thank the hon lady for raise her concern but as i say this be a public consultation it run for week and will close on   march i urge she to raise her concern as part of that consultation it be absolutely crucial that we keep expertise in our maternity service but i understand that the local proposal by the trust and the integrated care board outline plan for £ of significant additional investment into maternity service those decision be for the local icb and the local trust the deadline be   march and i urge the hon lady to ensure she take part in that process 
 remain in north london can i bring to those on the treasury bench my concern over the quality of nursing care at barnet hospital an elderly constituent of mine who be in her 80 be admit there recently she ask to use the lavatory but be tell no could take she and be hand a nappy she wait hour until someone could actually take she to the loo she be a coeliac but be not offer any food for coeliac during her day stay because nobody have read her note she be also move around her bed by her arm despite have a broken shoulder which nobody know as nobody have read her note 
 i be very sorry to hear about the experience of my hon friend ’s constituent that level of care be absolutely unacceptable i know he have raise this particular issue with the patient safety commissioner henrietta hughes but i be very happy to meet with my hon friend and his constituent to discuss those complaint because that care be not acceptable 
 what step she be take to reduce waiting time for gynaecology treatment 
 at buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust the number of gynaecology patient wait more than week reduce by over between august and december but i sympathise with the many woman who be still wait too long nhs england have be do target work to help trust with the most long waiter to support gynaecology patient in the community where appropriate and to find specialist service that can treat they as quickly as possible 
 my local nhs trust recently state   that the average wait for a gynaecology appointment be week with patient start treatment within week but that do not include those on cancer pathway of my constituent who have be identify as have abnormal cell in her cervix wait more than week for a diagnostic assessment she be of many contact i with tale of long delay for gynaecology appointment and pay to go private out of desperation what step be the department take to reduce waiting time for gynaecology assessment and treatment for those on cancer pathway 
 significant investment be go in to reduce both general wait time and cancer wait time more patient on the cancer pathway have be see than ever before nearly patient be see last december follow an urgent gp referral for suspect cancer represent of december level we continue to keep this under review and continue to strive to make the system go fast and reduce the elective backlog 
 i call the shadow minister 
 nhs figure from december show that the number of woman wait for gynaecological treatment reach another record high of nearly that number have triple since a labour government will cut nhs waiting list in england by fund more appointment a year what can the minister say to the woman wait urgently for treatment 
 i would say that we be stick to our plan to back the nhs to cut waiting list and make our nhs fairer simple and fast when there be no strike action that plan be work we already eliminate the long wait and in november we see the big fall in waiting list outside of the pandemic in more than a decade alongside record investment in thing like woman ’s health hub we be prioritise woman ’s health 
 what step her department be take to improve access to primary care 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of primary care provision in rural community 
 we have meet our manifesto commitment to deliver a record extra gp appointment annually our primary care recovery plan address    increase gp access and expand community pharmacy service nationwide with pharmacy our nhs dentist reform plan also allocate resource for appointment target rural and coastal community 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response and i thank the minister for health and secondary care my right hon friend   the member for pendle andrew stephenson for visit the community diagnostic centre and minor injury unit at the herts and essex hospital yesterday and all the fantastic staff there 
 frontier estates commit to build a gp surgery as part of the wide stortford fields development however cite inflated build cost it now question the viability of the plan despite month of negotiation and effort by the local nhs to find a solution will my right hon friend work with colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities with whom i have already meet on this issue to ensure that frontier really engage with the process and build the surgery it promise my constituent 
 i congratulate my hon friend on the enormous amount of work she have do in her constituency to secure that community diagnostic centre we have roll out some or so of those centre across england we want to do more and they be supply some   test and scan for patient across england 
 on the important issue that my hon friend raise my official and levelling up official be already consider how primary care infrastructure can be well support in the planning process to ease the pressure on primary care estate particularly in area of housing growth i know that she will continue to be as conscientious in her campaigning on that as she be on other matter 
 rural community need local easily accessible primary care since long crendon surgery close during the pandemic patient in that village and surround village have be displace mainly to brill and thame for gp appointment for the vulnerable and those without private car the absence of regular bus service can mean an unaffordable £ at least in taxi to see a gp i have raise many time an innovative approach to build a new health centre in long crendon by the parish council which have the land and the agreement by the icb for the rent to put unity health in there we just need the money to build it will my right hon friend break down every barrier to help we get that health centre build in long crendon 
 again i very much admire the effort and determination that my hon friend be show to stand up for his constituent he will know that sadly i be constrain from comment on individual case but what i do know be that the innovation he be show alongside his parish council and indeed i would hope his local integrate care board be the approach we want to adopt across our rural and coastal community to ensure that they too have the access to primary care that we all expect 
 equal access to primary care be so important but the use of physician associate be downright dangerous do the secretary   of state agree that patient have the right to see a qualified gp and not be fob off with a tier primary care system 
 i understand the concern we have see they in the medium but please we in this house have a responsibility to our constituent and to professional work in healthcare include our clinician and physician associate in fact physician associate have be work in the nhs for some decade they be there to work with doctor to assist they free up doctor time to focus on the task that only they be qualified to do we have be very careful to listen to the concern raise which be why we recently announce intention to regulate they but please we must all take that responsibility for ensure that we be not spread concern actually these role can have a very positive effect on healthcare system 
 my constituent be feed up with battle to see a gp i have be work hard across party line with local councillor and the icb but i be surprised to hear from the prime minister in response to a question last week that only £ be allocate to my icb for primary care and that it should raid its hospital refurbishment budget instead could the secretary of state advise i which part of the much need hospital investment should be overlook to compensate for the failure to invest in primary care locally 
 again it be for integrated care board to assess the need of their area if there be concern about access to primary care we be keen to give they the autonomy to make decision about how they spend their budget we have set expectation of integrate care board in a couple of respect in particular we expect they to use the money that we have provide for dental care and we have set clear expectation that integrate care board will introduce at least woman ’s health hub in their area this year 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 while we be talk about the recovery of primary care and the secretary of state be at the dispatch box the recover access plan release last may talk about high quality online consultation text message service and online booking tool they be due in july but that become august and then december and i understand that it have now be delay indefinitely due to a claim make against nhs england in what be a £ project that delay be hit access to primary care will the secretary of state update the house 
 we be determined to bring not just primary care but the whole nhs up to speed with technology we be firm advocate of the idea that technology can help free clinician time and ensure that they be spend time look at their patient rather than at computer screen in primary care we be work to ensure the digital telephony service that have play such a critical role in provide those additional appointment as i describe i will take away my hon friend ’s point and look into they carefully 
 i have be correspond with the primary care minister   the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom and her predecessor about urgently need to protect general practice location in city centre from outdated treasury rule that potentially force they to move to ring road location the minister ’s late reply suggest that the icb could use capital funding to pay for new premise but my icb claim that that be against the rule would she and her official please urgently meet i and my local icb to bottom out what the rule be and urgently protect our city centre gp location 
 i will ask the relevant minister to write to the hon lady 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the simple fact be that the conservatives have be in power for year and general practice have never be in a bad state despite slog their gut out gps be struggle because this government have cut gps since make it even hard for patient to get an appointment give that why have the government decide that the nhs need what the institute for fiscal studies have describe as the big funding cut since the 1970s 
 it have be a very long time since labour be in government but even the hon gentleman know that ministers will never comment on fiscal event the day before they occur let i introduce some   fact into his analysis we have now deliver on our   manifesto commitment for more general practice appointment per year with book in the last month that compare with deliveredin the month to december interruption if the hon gentleman stop shout perhaps he would be able to hear i about more appointment be deliver per working day last december exclude covid vaccination we have our primary care recovery plan and it be work of course there be more to do but even the hon gentleman would not be so churlish as to deny those extra appointment 
 when she plan to introduce a tobacco and vape bill 
 the hon member will know that shockingly smoke kill people across the uk every year and cost society £ in ill health and loss of productivity the government will introduce the tobacco and vape bill shortly i be delighted to say that northern ireland ministers announce just this morning that we will legislate for the whole of the united kingdom 
 i thank the minister for that answer i just want to say that the age relate bill on the sale of tobacco product will create the generation of smoke free people in the united kingdom all politic be local and it be vital that we have the same legislation in northern ireland in northern ireland smoking contribute to at least smoking relate cancer   per year some of the people in my constituency continue to smoke irrespective of the guidance give i be glad to hear the minister ’s assurance on the legislation but will the government engage with the northern ireland executive to ensure it be on their priority list 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that the secretary of state meet the northern ireland health minister just yesterday i absolutely assure he that all part of the united kingdom will be include in the once in a generation public health intervention that will save million of life 
 i urge my right hon friend to get on with introduce the bill because every single day we delay more people die of cancer and other smoking relate disease equally in create the generation of people who will not be allow to buy cigarette or tobacco product that be excellent do she agree that concern be that young people be now take up vaping instead of smoking and that vaping be clearly a path towards nicotine addiction 
 yes my hon friend raise an incredibly important point there be no doubt that tobacco and vaping company be now try to recruit child put vape include many illegal vape next to the sweet counter with extraordinary flavour such as bubble gum and berry blast which be clearly not design as be originally propose for adult smoker to be able to quit smoking by move to vaping he be absolutely right and we will bring forward this once in a generation legislation shortly 
 what step she plan to take to improve the recruitment and retention of community and district nurse 
 we have deliver our manifesto commitment of more nurse month early there be now almost nurse work across the nhs as part of that community nursing have grow by over since 
 there have be a crisis brewing in community face nursing over the past decade with the number of district nurse down by and health visitor number in england and wales fall by almost a what guarantee will the minister provide that this vital workforce will be support when health budget in all the nation of the uk be under increase strain and nhs funding face a £ black hole and cut to spending in england have a consequential impact on budget in scotland 
 record funding be go into our nhs in addition to the increase in community nursing since we be invest over £ in education and training through the nhs long term workforce plan which commit to increase training place for district nurse by by the end of the decade since we have deliver over more nurse and midwive into our nhs 
 when she plan to respond to the joint committee on the draft mental health bill ’s report entitle draft mental health bill publish on january 
 i put on record my thank to the member of the pre legislative scrutiny committee which scrutinise our draft mental health bill we be look at the recommendation and will respond to the committee ’s report shortly 
 it be now over a year since the joint committee report on the draft mental health bill be publish despite repeat promise of reform the government have fail to act more than people be hold under the mental health act it be an outrage to they and to campaigner that reform have be de prioritise will the minister confirm when the government plan to bring a formal bill to parliament and what conversation they have have with the chancellor in the run up to the budget to ensure the reform be properly resource 
 as i have say we have publish our draft bill it have undergone pre legislative scrutiny and i shall respond to the committee ’s recommendation shortly but this be not just about legislative reform as a result of the £ that we have invest in crisis support we have already see less use of the mental health act because people be be see early our crisis cafés and crisis telephone service for example have lead to a reduction in the use of the act 
 it be a number of year since we promise to reform mental health legislation that reflect a time when people with severe mental ill health be view as problem to be manage rather than as individual i believe that we on these benches as conservatives should be do everything we can to empower people and respect their liberty it simply be not right that in the century people ’s health condition be be manage through the forced administration of drug which pay no respect to their liberty may i reiterate the urgency with which measure should be introduce particularly as people with live experience have relive their trauma to provide the benefit of their experience 
 i absolutely entirely agree that be why the government publish the draft bill in january last year and why it undergo pre legislative scrutiny i give evidence to the committee and we be work our way through its detailed recommendation and will publish our response shortly however that be in addition to our significant reform of mental health service particularly early intervention and crisis cafés we have see the impact of that few detention under the mental health act few admission to hospital and few admission from our mental health crisis telephone centre which be now available across england 
 what step she be take to improve healthcare for woman 
 woman ’s health be of my top priority as we approach international women ’s day we have already improve access to contraception and the treatment of urinary tract infection through pharmacy announce £ of funding for research on maternity disparity and other health condition affect woman and set the expectation that each integrate care board area will have at least woman ’s health hub operate this year 
 for more than a decade i have be raise the appalling often agonise treatment of many woman who need hysteroscopy in the nhs they be be leave with unnecessary trauma and be reluctant to engage far with doctor which be quite simply life threatening however the medical establishment continue to resist change and the government shirk their leadership role early this year the secretary of state set out her priority for the woman ’s health strategy and access to pain free hysteroscopy be not include why 
 i thank the hon lady for her work in this regard and i absolutely acknowledge the issue that woman be experience with this highly invasive procedure at what be often an extremely distressing time in their life we be wait for the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists to update its guideline on good practice in hysteroscopy follow consultation last year that be under peer review and be due to publish soon however as the hon lady know i be clear that it should not be the responsibility of woman in those very distressing circumstance to ask for pain relief clinician must assume that a woman want it and discuss that with she before the procedure 
 i welcome the government ’s recent refresh of the woman ’s health strategy and the addition to it of birth trauma however i be currently chair a national inquiry into birth trauma and we be hear from mother throughout the united kingdom about some of the severe mental health condition that they be face include postpartum psychosis i have be particularly concerned to hear about the risk of suicide among new mother what action be the government take to address this 
 let i put on record my admiration for my hon friend ’s action in share her own experience in order to improve healthcare for woman across the country she will know of yesterday ’s important announcement about suicide prevention element of which address exactly the concern that she have rightly raise thank to her hard work we have also announce that within week or so of give birth mum will be ask by gps whether they be okay and we hope very much that that will open up the conversation with woman who may be struggle 
 amma birth companions have just be recognise in the gsk impact award the charity be do really important work to support vulnerable asylum seeker   and refugee who would otherwise face give birth alone will the secretary of state meet the charity to discuss its work and research give the disparity that continue for this group of woman 
 the hon lady describe a very interesting piece of work i will ask my ministerial colleague to meet the charity as we want to support woman indeed part of our work across the woman ’s health strategy be ensure that maternity service be not just safe but trust by mum to be 
 with regard to healthcare for woman a gynaecologist who claim that hammersmith would be well if it be jew free have be rule as not racist but merely 
 comfortable with use discriminatory language 
 accord to the medical practitioners tribunal service he be merely suspend for month and be due to start see patient again in a few week i be concerned that this doctor may be a danger to jewish patient i be also concerned that the tribunal be defective and its decision be grossly unreasonable will the secretary of state instruct government lawyer to begin judicial review proceeding against the tribunal 
 i sincerely thank my right hon and learn friend for raise this issue as the prime minister set out on the step of downing street last week there be people whose ideology and dogma be in direct conflict with our country ’s share value just as we will not stand for that across the country nor will i stand for it in our nhs i have already write to nhs england and regulator set out their responsibility and our expectation of they and i can assure my right hon and learn friend that i will be look into this issue with great urgency and great care 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be committed to make our nhs fast simple and fairer for all include family which be why the government have recently introduce baby loss certificate nothing can diminish the pain of lose a baby but we hope that this formal recognition of a life lose can help family to live alongside their grief indeed since we announce the launch some week ago more than certificate have be request by parent 
 that same commitment to family be why we be roll out martha ’s rule across england give patient and their family the automatic right to a rapid review of their case—24 hour a day day a week family and carer know when something be not right or their love ’s condition be deteriorate martha ’s rule not only recognise this powerful instinct but allow anyone concern to act on it and to make sure that the nhs listen 
 with your permission mr speaker for which i be very grateful i would like to alert the house to a write ministerial statement and a detailed letter from   nhs england that have be lay this morning it address a historical issue whereby woman who receive radiotherapy above the waist to treat hodgkin lymphoma and who be therefore at a high risk of breast cancer be not give annual check yesterday the nhs write to the woman affect in order to inform they we expect all woman to be offer a scan within the next month and nhs england have establish a helpline and brief gps and relevant charity the vast majority of this group of woman will already have be receive screening on a yearly basis but nhs england want to ensure that they receive annual test in line with the clinical guidance 
 i want to alert hon member to that because with the letter have be send out yesterday it be perfectly possible indeed probable that they will start to receive query from their constituent i will of course keep the house update i emphasise however that what i have give be a summary and i would encourage hon member to look at the very detailed letter from nhs england in order to reassure their constituent that we be scoop up everybody we can to look after they at this very troubling time 
 like many people here i be delight by last month ’s nhs dentistry recovery plan how many new nhs dental appointment do the secretary of state expect to be available in my constituency of weston super mare and by when 
 i thank my hon friend for support our dental recovery plan indeed he be of many colleague who campaign hard for it i be pleased to inform he that dental activity as measure by course of treatment have increase by on the previous year in his local integrate care board area and our plan will support further increase to dental access through some additional appointment across the country include in his constituency the measure namely new patient premium go live on friday and we hope to have the result very soon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 with a general election in the air i welcome what the secretary of state have say about baby loss certificate and martha ’s rule there be genuine cross party agreement on this i also thank she for advance notice of today ’s important write ministerial statement 
 however with a general election in the air and give the secretary of state ’s principle vocal and consistent opposition to fund the nhs by abolish the non dom tax status on a scale of to be utterly shameless and be highly embarrassed how red faced will she be when the chancellor adopt labour ’s policy tomorrow 
 of the joy of be at the government dispatch box be that not only do we have to deal with very serious matter such as i have just set out but we get to have a knockabout on the labour party ’s electioneering the hon gentleman will know the conservative proud record on fund our nhs since i invite he to wait for tomorrow ’s budget to see what more this conservative government be do to support our constituent and to help our economy grow for a bright future 
 the under secretary of state for health and social care   the hon member for lewes maria caulfield have say that the policy will be 
 as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 as she speed down the a23 back to lewes to defend her constituency against the liberal democrats how on earth will she feel with all those ember of the conservatives year record blow in her face 
 be it not now clear that with the government have adopt labour ’s workforce plan labour ’s dentistry recruitment plan and now labour ’s nhs funding plan when it come to a record to be proud of and when it come to find the answer only labour can deliver an nhs that be fit for the future 
 the leader of the opposition be a former barrister and barrister like to rely on evidence so let i give some evidence on what the labour run nhs in wales look like people be almost twice as likely to be wait for treatment under the labour run welsh nhs—21.3 of people in wales be wait for hospital treatment after a consultant referral compare with in england patient in labour run wales be on average wait week long for nhs treatment than patient in england and the number of patient in wales who be escape to seek treatment in england have increase by in year but do not worry folk accord to the leader of the opposition this be the blueprint 
 order i remind everyone that these be topical question it be about the many member i need to get in rather than the ping pong over the dispatch box let we move on to andrew jones as a good example

 i hold my dental summit since the publication of the government ’s dental recovery plan which i have to say be meet with disappointment and frustration the reason for that be that be not enough funding or flexibility or the resolution to the contract will the minister set out the timetable for when the dental contract will be resolve 
 i be very surprised and disappoint to hear the hon lady say that we be deliver more appointment through the new patient premium which start last friday we will have information within a month to see which dentist have take up this generous new patient premium to ensure that many more people get access to dentistry not only that but we have golden hello to attract dentist to area that be underserved mobile dental van and importantly a new focus on smile4life that be go to ensure that all baby and young child have that fabulous smile for life 
 the pharmacy service have prove popular in amber valley but some pharmacist report confusion because the ear infection service apply only to under 18 and patient be be refer to pharmacy when they should not be will the minister either extend the service to over-18s or ensure that nhs communication be clear that this service be only for child 
 my hon friend raise an important point he will be aware that a decision be take that ear wax removal service be well do in the community and that ear syringing can cause problem   that area be under review and i be happy to write to he to address the specific point he make about over-18s and child 
 i absolutely agree that we should redouble our effort to recruit and retain more home grow carer as the welsh government be do by pay they all at least the real living wage but in the short term we have to rely on foreign worker from her early answer it appear that the social care minister be happy to deprive they of the enjoyment of their own family life while we expect they to give our relative love care will she think again and speak to home office colleague about drop this totally inhumane ban 
 as the hon lady will have hear i say early we be grateful to international care worker who come to care for our love one in this country we need to get the balance right between international recruitment and our home grow care workforce on the question specifically on dependant i say to she that every care worker who come here to do work in the uk have a choice as to whether to come here or not 
 i thank the health and secondary care minister for visit the new medical school in chelmsford yesterday this be the time that student have ever be able to train as doctor in essex in its history and the result be phenomenal this be live proof of the government ’s commitment to train the nhs staff of the future what progress be he make to increase work placement for student so that we can train even more doctor nurse and people for important role such as physician associate

 medicine shortage have double in the uk in the last year there might be some global pressure but issue have particularly affect the uk the post brexit regulatory framework and secondly the fact that the pound have tank make it more expensive to buy medicine what be the government do to undo that brexit dividend

 rural norfolk be experience a dental crisis and a generation of child be in danger of go without dental care i welcome the dental recovery plan but i notice that it will be    or year before we get more dentist last week nhs norfolk and waveney integrate care board announce a £ underspend on dentistry will the minister agree to meet with i and the icb to work out how we get more money out now to help dentistry in norfolk today 
 of the many way we have tackle access to dental care be to ensure that those dentist who have a contract to conduct nhs work be use they to the top of their licence we be encourage dentist to do that through the new patient premium and a high rate pay for unit of dental activity there be so much more to the plan labour keep try to claim credit for our plan but the truth be that our plan promise appointment while its plan promise a miserly 
 it be imperative that we tackle the scourge of mental ill health in child and young people labour will ensure access to mental health support in every school and establish an open access mental health hub in every community pay for by charge vat on private school fee why will the government not adopt that plan 
 i have a news flash for the hon lady we be already do all that work mental health support team be be roll out in schools—44 of pupil now have access to a mental health support team rise to shortly over school and college now have a train senior mental health lead only last week we announce early support hub for to year old they will not need a referral they can drop in there be helpline available that can be access through that be what we be do

 the hon lady will no doubt be extremely envious of the fact that in england there be more gp appointment now every year which be a fantastic achievement by this government she will want to look at what be happen in scotland which have some of the bad health outcome in western europe and challenge snp ministers over drug and alcohol death rate and fall in life expectancy 
 will my right hon friend explain an anomaly in the agenda for change pay deal as it affect non nhs provider people work in the nhs for non nhs provider may be eligible for extra money if the organisation they work for be in financial difficulty but not if it be not so badly run organisation be be reward and well run organisation be be penalise which seem to i to be perverse 
 i be happy to meet my right hon friend to discuss the matter we have reach pay settlement with the agenda for change union and we continue to reach pay deal with other union we be also support non nhs provider whose contract be dynamically align it be a complex area so i be more than happy to meet my right hon friend to discuss his concern

 on access to primary care provision will the secretary of state assure the house that she will liaise with health ministers in the devolved department to ensure that rural community do not lose out because of their isolated location 
 i be very happy to give that assurance i be delighted to meet minister swann yesterday to discuss his plan for northern ireland healthcare include access to primary care 
 i remind member of my entry in the register of members financial interests the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency ’s international recognition procedure will ensure fast access to innovative treatment but it will realise its full potential only if it be match by the national institute for health and care excellence ’s evaluation process what be my right hon friend the minister do to ensure that the process be align 
 my hon friend will be aware that there have be delay with approval by the mhra and nice we be keen to ensure that those delay be reduce and i be delighted to tell the house that significant progress have be make in both organisation i be happy to work with my hon friend and both organisation to ensure that progress continue to be make 
 figure obtain by the british dental association project that £ of the nhs budget in somerset be go unspent will the minister explain to my constituent who be suffer in dental agony why that be happen 
 i encourage the hon lady to hold her integrate care board to account we invest more than £ a year in dentistry and our dental recovery plan mean that significant money be available for nhs dentistry it be for the integrate care board to commission those unit of dental activity which now offer more money a minimum of £ per uda i be happy to meet the hon lady if she find she be not get anywhere with her icb

 wendy hart have a high white blood cell count when she be discharge from the royal devon and exeter hospital her husband terence describe a dreadful pointless mile round trip home and back to hospital before wendy die of sepsis will the minister consider distance between acute hospital and rural community when review hospital discharge guidance 
 i be very sorry to hear about what happen to the hon gentleman ’s constituent i send my condolence to her family and loved one clearly it be very important that discharge decision be lead by clinician who can make a clinical decision about whether somebody be medically ready to be discharge i have no doubt that the family may well take up that decision with local nhs organisation 
 no doctor want to be on strike so i welcome the new deal with the consultant union it show that by be reasonable pragmatic and act in good faith union can deliver for their member do my right hon friend agree 
 my hon friend know only too well the importance of industrial action and the impact it can have on patient and on the nhs as a whole i be pleased that the bma have announce today follow the previous settlement that be narrowly reject in its ballot that it have be able to get back around the table with my official and i we have be able to find a fair and reasonable settlement that the bma will advocate for and recommend to its member we hope that that show those who be choose to strike that constructive negotiation and try to sort out some of the concern that we know clinician have can be deal with in a reasonable manner which be of benefit not just to staff but to patient

 i thank the hon member for his point of order and for give i notice of it i understand that the chancellor have reply to his letter in the last few minute be that correct in any case those on the treasury bench will have hear what he have have to say he still have time to table a question for the chancellor at treasury question on   march   to follow up on this important matter i be sure that the table office will be able to advise he on how to else he might pursue it 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision about the scrutiny and approval by parliament of appointment to senior civil service role and for connected purpose 
 in this nation people rightly expect this elect and accountable parliament to oversee an impartial civil service the notion of distance and unaccountability have however grow among the populace like a spectre cause by unnecessary tension on both side and cast aspersion on the majority it be time something be do about it 
 we need this reform because nothing be more fundamental to our democracy than the relationship between parliament and the civil service this be the mother of parliaments and our civil service be hold to be the gold standard in the world of officialdom when elect member and the civil service row in the same direction we can produce startling result which have beat fascist build the nhs and win the olympic bid when the conduct between we become strained when confidence be undermine and when accountability trust or respect be lack we get cast iron assurance regard matter such as weapon of mass destruction and sub par personal protective equipment contract as a result perfectly sound policy get stall 
 i be sure all colleague will agree that our civil service be a great as be our parliament man and woman dedicate to the public good but have be plague in recent year by increase tension that have a fundamental impact on the discharge of governance and policy let we consider the issue we have see in recent year and how they tell of structural deficiency rather than be merely isolate accident under a particular administration 
 the sue gray affair should alarm we all whatever side of the house we sit on to have a civil servant preside over an investigation into a prime minister and then achieve escape velocity from the civil service to go and work immediately for the opposition have scar the view of impartiality that the majority rightly accept and expect the same could be say of the role of political appointee in many way we can view certain labour and conservative spin doctor as essentially the same entity unaccountable to the public but very much impose on the public beyond the advisory role for which they be initially intend 
 both those issue could be address through update to the constitutional reform and governance act which seek to well control apparatus such as special adviser but if we wish to fix an issue we need to amend the culture that go with it to do that we need to start at the top we need a culture that the majority of the service still respect 
 let we define that top and the route to it the great mandarin who hold vast power be often faceless that can not be right in a democracy if a person want power they must be subject to the sunlight of this place permanent secretary be appoint under a   scheme in which the prime minister have the final say in the recruitment process the prime minister alone choose directly from a list create by the civil service commissioner if any member present can without the aid of google name the commissioner who appoint people to hold power over their constituent life i would be amazed 
 it be not just the permanent secretary we must consider the transparency of lobbying non party campaigning and trades union administration act explain that a permanent secretary be a person serve in a range of government post that definition need massively expand to ensure that it encompass top official within state entity such as the nhs for instance the ceo of the nhs be often see as a godlike distant figure and not suitably accountable to this place let we be in no doubt horrific thing happen if a culture be enable where official feel they be above policy instruction from the elect at the current time advancement in the civil service come from appease the established network such as the commission and the minister for the civil service these people serve the nation so their fortune should lie with this institution not an elite few within it 
 i do not propose that we fix all the issue at once nor do i propose a baby out with -the bathwater approach but a modest solution that reset the relationship to a more traditional and may i say british footing by that i mean a process that be less invest in smoke fill room with those from the executive that empower this place i propose that a cross party committee of both houses be form to fold those appointment into understand due process appointment would be fix term and renewable by this place which will end at a stroke   the concept of a job for life this be hardly revolution it be a mix of establish democratic process in parliament and professional standard that industry outside this place would recognise it would only impact a few dozen people at the top it be hardly onerous i imagine that of the civil service would not be impact but the change to the culture at the top would cascade down if the upper echelon know they be well oversee by this place this cross party institution they would ensure that those they manage be correctly support mentor and hold to account 
 some siren voice claim that this work could be discharge by select committees hold more hearing or that well training of ministers could fix all the issue but the bottom line be that if a person have vast power over the machinery of government but do not feel a sense of fealty to parliament such idea be mere tinker what i have propose can be do now in a modest manner to gently course correct a few error and modernise and empower this institution if we do not do so eventually we could well need more radical reform the relief valve be simple and establish professional industry process via this accountable house let we act now because if a trend of unaccountability continue to make people question who be really run britain the gold standard i mention will soon be see as fool ’s gold 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that giles watling michael fabricant andrew rosindell and mr mark francois present the bill 
 giles watling accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday may and to be print bill 
 reading 
 relevant document report of the transport committee of session self drive vehicle hc and the government response session hc 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 as hon member know most journey take place on our road about be make by car taxi and van but in the over year since the invention of the car despite our vehicle become well safe and now clean aspect of driving have remain constant the driver have always control the vehicle in future thing may be different for all or part of a driver ’s journey self drive vehicle will free they from that responsibility improve the life of the million of people who be unable to drive boost connectivity for rural community across the country transform freight be it long haul or last mile and above all make our road safe 
 as the secretary of state know insurance premium have be go through the roof recently the cost be astronomical what impact do he expect automated vehicle to have on insurance premium 
 if the hon gentleman will allow i to make a little progress i will speak about how centrepiece of the bill and of our approach be the safety not just of the automate vehicle and its occupant but of other road user particularly vulnerable road user i will come on to that point if the hon gentleman do not feel that i have cover it he should feel free to intervene again 
 we be on the cusp of a transport revolution and britain be very much at the wheel of that decision british company be develop the self drive technology british lawyer be develop the robust new legal framework that be be use and british parliamentarian in this house and the other place can now agree regulation widely see as among the most comprehensive in the world the goal be clear we want to make this country the natural home for the self drive vehicle industry and this bill be the next stop on that journey 
 it will not surprise my right hon friend that i be speak up for milton keynes on this subject this be a huge global opportunity for britain worth £ and milton keynes be often the testbed of this technology it be a beautiful vibrant city that be go place except perhaps in the eye of the producer of last night ’s eastenders”—so do he agree that when we get this technology we will be able to roll it out because we have test it in place such as milton keynes 
 i thank my hon friend for speak powerfully for his constituency he be right those develop this technology will want to roll it out carefully and thoughtfully and they will want to do that in specific place in the united kingdom he have just make a powerful bid for milton keynes to be at the centre of that 
 gear britain up for a self drive future have be the work of year in our world lead code of practice enable self drive vehicle trial in the uk we pass the automated and electric vehicles act which codify insurance in this area for the time and recognise the importance of that as   the hon member for carmarthen east and dinefwr jonathan edwards   say early in that same year we kick off a law commissions review on a legal and safety framework for self drive vehicle 
 rise 
 let i just set out what that review do then i will take an intervention from the hon gentleman who be an esteemed member of the select committee it convene legal mind from across the country launch round of public consultation sift through hundred of write response and produce more than recommendation which now underpin this legislation 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for give way these be really important point as be the clarification seek by the hon member for carmarthen east and dinefwr on insurance liability can i ask the secretary of state about the arrangement for the compensation of victim of any collision that be cause by uninsured automate vehicle he mention the automated and electric vehicles act but that legislation do not mention this point this bill represent an opportunity to address that will the secretary of state set out how we be go to do that or be we miss an opportunity 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise that point we have arrangement in place for vehicle with human driver who be uninsured and we be work with the motor insurers bureau on the arrangement that will be in place i would envisage analogous arrangement for self drive vehicle that be uninsured to make sure that if they be involve in accident any victim of those accident be able to receive reimbursement in the same way as happen now for the victim of an uninsured driver we already have arrangement and i would envisage analogous arrangement we be already have those conversation but if the hon gentleman have more to say on that either today or in committee i will be delighted to hear from he 
 rise 
 i be happy to hear from he again now 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that clarification but this be a whole new world where we will be rely on ai software and so on how would an insurer prove that a vehicle be be drive autonomously rather than by a driver under the provision of the bill would the insurer have access to the datum so that they could analyse it and see whether an individual be in charge of a vehicle or whether it be be drive autonomously 
 i will come on to that in my speech but i will answer the hon gentleman ’s specific question from the point of view of any person need to make a claim the insurer will be liable whether the vehicle be in self drive mode or the user be in charge what happen subsequently regard whether the manufacturer   the software provider or whoever have to pony up the money be a matter for the insurer to argue about with they that will not impact the victim who will be pay by the insurer 
 on the hon gentleman ’s important point about datum we discuss this last week when i meet a roundtable of those involve in the industry include road safety campaigner and those in the insurance industry the bill will ensure that the datum can be share and the insurance industry be keen for that to happen so that it can properly price the risk i will say more about this when i talk about the safety framework but there be a real opportunity here because most road traffic collision be cause at least in part by human error the track record of self drive vehicle show that this be an opportunity to improve road safety which be important not just for those who use vehicle but for other road user there be a balance to strike here we need to capture that benefit but also ensure that we do not leave anyone expose without protection as the hon gentleman rightly set out 
 on the point the secretary of state have just be discuss presumably the detail of all journey undertake by automated vehicle will be record where will that datum be store and who will have access to it could someone access that information for non driving reason for example someone involve in divorce proceeding or an employer in an employment tribunal 
 my right hon friend should note that datum for these purpose will be protect in the usual way datum have to be use for the purpose for which it be gather there be legal process for who have access to it as well as those we will set out specifically for drive purpose the other thing he mention will be govern by the usual law that govern the use of datum i do not want to dwell on those specific but they be already cover by exist datum protection legislation for the device that people have in vehicle to monitor their progress or for mobile phone 
 i would like to start with safety anyone step into a self drive vehicle will reasonably ask can this car consistently drive safety will the law protect i if there be an accident be the manufacturer regulate and can they be hold to account under this legislation the answer to each of those question will be yes the bill have be build on a bedrock of safety protect not just the driver inside the car but road user outside the vehicle 
 as i mention in answer to   the hon member for easington grahame morris i chair a roundtable with road safety group last week and explain how we be hold self drive vehicle to a high safety standard than the average human driver guide by principle we will soon consult on how these vehicle must meet rigorous technical requirement before roll off production line and be authorise for our road and how we will tackle mislead marketing with new offence for company that seek to blur the line between true self driving and driver assistance 
 that get to the nub of the point because these vehicle be go to be automate they will be govern by an algorithm write by a human   be somewhere remote from where an accident might occur how do we determine whether the primary purpose of that algorithm be to protect the person in the car or someone outside the car such as a pedestrian or a child cross the road how do the algorithm make a choice in those circumstance 
 we will consult on the statement of safety principle which will set out the govern principle of the legislation on the specific this will be about make sure that the manufacturer those who create the software and those who put the car together have rigorous process for testing and decision making those system will have to be authorise to be use in our car and it will be important to look at their datum and their track record as i say in real world situation where these vehicle be be use for example in california the evidence suggest that they have a very good safety record that be much well than that of human driver there be a big opportunity here to have a safe road environment not just for the user of the vehicle but for other road user 
 i do not know whether the hon gentleman have have the opportunity to ride in a self drive vehicle but the datum they collect of their surrounding be interesting my personal observation be that the space they give when pass a cyclist for example be a lot more generous than that i have see many human driver give of course those parameter be go to be set and regulate and people will have to be assure that the vehicle be safe before they be on the road ultimately the manufacturer will be legally responsible if they turn out not to be 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for give way a time i agree entirely that overall road will be safe with automated vehicle but there will still be accident my question be specifically about where there be an accident and there be a choice to be make about protect the person inside the car and injure someone outside the car how do we determine what take priority in those circumstance 
 we will consult on the safety principle but with some of this stuff we have to look at the way the vehicle make decision we can not possibly legislate for every single set of circumstance in the same way when there be a collision involve a vehicle with a human driver the driver will make the good decision they can in the specific circumstance sometimes those situation lead to legal conflict and then people have to make a judgment we can not legislate for every single of those circumstance in advance what we can do be make sure there be robust system that make good decision base on the good datum and then look at the track record we will also set up a regulatory system whereby any accident involve an automate vehicle will be properly investigate 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point it be essential with this legislation that we earn the public ’s trust and win their confidence that be of the reason why we have be so clear and why we accept the amendment in the other place about put safety at the forefront of the bill if people be not persuade of that this technology will not make much progress 
 rise 
 i will take an intervention from my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller   and then make some progress before continue to take intervention 
 the secretary of state be take a safety approach to this legislation and that seem to be the will of the house i have use a driverless vehicle operate by waymo a driverless uber style service in the united states he will know that those vehicle have more camera more eye look in more direction more of the time than it would be possible to achieve even with driver sit in a single vehicle my concern be whether in his effort to put safety he be compromise the potential for economic growth in america most of the force for change with automate vehicle be be drive by the lead global technology company what discussion have he have with those company in preparation for the bill how comfortable be they with the government ’s approach 
 i have discuss the legislation with a number of those company both uk company and those in the us and i be pleased to assure my hon friend and the house that they too recognise that safety be incredibly important they all understand that they have to be able to operate within a legal framework set by legislator who be ultimately accountable to the public and that they have to take the public with they as ever with these thing whatever the track record of exist vehicle and driver because this be new technology people will be sceptical about it and anything that go wrong will have a bright light shine on it the industry be very aware of that and i think very happy to work with we on those issue 
 rise 
 i will take more intervention and then i will make some progress 
 i will be honest mr deputy speaker i be not very technically minded i like the idea of a manual car with or gear and reverse in the rural community that i live in i be very happy with that i have a bit of hesitation about automate vehicle think about young driver this be really important because the secretary of state mention blur line we have to make sure that everyone who learn to drive have full capacity to drive any vehicle and do not think they can get into an automate vehicle and just sit there and do nothing it be really important that everyone be subject to the same rule can he confirm for anyone who think that in future they will be able just to sit in the back of the car that that be not the case and that they will have to learn to drive in the way that we all have over the year 
 i will come to that in a it will become clear in the next section of my speech but i can tell the hon gentleman that the bill be about give people choice if people want as many will to carry on drive their exist vehicle in the traditional way that be absolutely fine and no be go to try to stop they to be very clear the hon gentleman can carry on drive for as long as he want to and be safe to and no be go to try to stop he certainly i be not go to try i would not dare 
 on the legal concern this will address the point about the drive test too the bill redefine our legal relationship with road transport as soon as someone turn on a self drive feature legal responsibility for how the car drive will transfer to an authorised self drive entity or asde not a very catchy acronym admittedly but that be what they be call that could be a manufacturer or a software developer but crucially it will not be the human driver who will assume a new status as a user in charge they will still need to ensure that the car be roadworthy and they will need to reassume control if necessary that answer the hon gentleman ’s question someone will still need to be in possession of a full drive licence and able to reassume control of the vehicle if require but they will be protect by law from any offence while the car be drive itself 
 some journey either in private car or on self drive transport will be fully automate and a human will never need to take control they will be in essence a passenger my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller   mention the example of waymo car in the us those be operate as taxi with no driver present and the human be never expect to take control it be class as a no user in charge journey in those circumstance someone would not need a drive licence because they would never be expect to drive the car in the same way we be not expect to drive a taxi or private hire vehicle those legal concept will have a seismic impact 
 this be the future and it be both quite exciting and quite scary we have to get our head around it and make sure that we get this right on what the secretary of state have just be describe be it basically the difference between someone take a taxi and drive their own car if there be an accident in a taxi the taxi company be responsible not the passenger 
 if someone be use a vehicle for a no user in charge journey for which they be in effect the passenger and there be an accident it will be totally the responsibility in all circumstance of the person operate the vehicle where someone who be drive the car for part of the time switch on the self drive feature and something happen while those feature be activate that will be not their responsibility but that of the manufacturer or the software developer if someone be in control of the vehicle and the self drive feature be not activate they retain responsibility 
 of the thing that we will have to do be educate people about the difference and we be be clear to manufacturer that there be a big difference between a self drive feature and driver assistance under driver assistance the driver be still fully legally responsible for the vehicle but with some technological help when the self drive feature be activate they no long have legal responsibility 
 be there not potential for a legal conflict between a driver who say i be in self drive mode and a company that say no it be switch off do the secretary of state see that it might be very difficult to establish what happen in such circumstance 
 potentially but that be exactly why the early question about datum be very important these vehicle generate a huge amount of datum and part   of the authorisation process will be make sure that that data be properly manage and there be proper access to it by the investigator of any potential accident and the insurance industry to establish exactly what have happen in such circumstance 
 rise 
 i give way to the chairman of the select committee on transport 
 i want to build on the question from   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   about the situation where a driver be in control of the car at some point and at other point the car be autonomous that will presumably result in driver become less experienced as they will not accumulate as much knowledge and experience of driving when the automated feature switch off and the driver need to take control those will be potentially immediate and challenging circumstance be my right hon friend assure that the drive test and refresher course will give driver sufficient capacity to take over in those circumstance 
 my hon friend raise a good point i be very comfortable with the driving test it continue to be update to make sure driver be familiar with feature such as satnavs and the new technology will be add the wide question about how often driver drive and how experienced they be of course arise now someone can take a drive test and not drive very much but occasionally hire a vehicle and we hold they to the same standard as those who drive day in and day out they be still responsible there might in these circumstance be a question about whether it would be sensible for people to take refresher course and do further training and we will want to monitor that and determine whether we should legislate for it or issue guidance it be an interesting point for we to keep an eye on
