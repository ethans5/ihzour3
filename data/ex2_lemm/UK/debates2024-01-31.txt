if the hon lady will let i finish the point the figure be now just under and that be the record of this party ’s year in power 
 i beg to move 
 that the draft guaranteed minimum pensions increase order which be lay before this house on   january be approve 
 i feel almost like a netflix series in that people can now binge watch episode of i in a row i hope none the less that this matter be worth equal consideration 
 the guaranteed minimum pensions increase order set out the yearly amount by which a guarantee minimum pension pot of an individual ’s contract out occupational pension earn between april and april must be increase occupational pension scheme be require to increase gmp that be earn during that period and be in payment by for the financial year 
 as this be quite a technical matter i will provide a little background information on gmp and what they be and be not gmp be create to help make occupational pension provision more affordable and more secure as many member present will be aware the state pension use to be make up of part the flat rate basic state pension and the earning relate additional state pension the flat rate state pension be fund through the national insurance scheme and pay the full rate to those with sufficient qualifying year of ni contribution or pro rata to those with a partial record the part of the state pension the earning relate additional state pension be link to a person ’s earning the national insurance contribution pay by both the employee and their employer give the employee the right to an additional earning relate state pension that be design to ensure that as many worker as possible be able to save for their retirement through a work base pension 
 however many employer already offer their worker a company pension through their own scheme so many people be already build up an occupational pension and an earning relate additional state pension in effect replicate that provision that be consider onerous and potentially unaffordable for both employer and employee it be see as double provision and over complicated in order to simplify the situation the government of the day introduce in the system of contract out and the provision of guarantee minimum pension which be the subject of this order 
 between april and april employer sponsor a salary relate occupational pension scheme could contract out their occupational pension scheme from the earning relate additional state pension people who be member of a contract out scheme be take out of the additional state pension so as a result both the employer and the pension scheme member pay low rate national insurance contribution in return salary relate contract out occupational pension scheme be require to take on the responsibility for pay their member a guarantee minimum pension as a part of their occupational pension from the scheme 
 the guarantee minimum pension that the member build up in the scheme would be broadly equivalent in value to the additional state pension that they would have receive have they stay in the state system the majority of employee would also have build up an   occupational pension over and above the guarantee minimum pension amount but the scheme pension could never be low than that guarantee minimum the crux of the idea be that rather than pay additional national insurance to the state in order to build up an additional state pension people could build up a similar amount of occupational pension through a workplace pension scheme the system run in that way from to have set out the detail which i accept be complicated let i turn to the order before we 
 the order provide a measure of inflation protection for the guarantee minimum pension part of an occasional pension build up between april and april legislation stipulate that when there have be an increase in the annual level of price as measure the previous september the order must increase the guarantee minimum pension part of the occupational pension by that percentage or whichever be low as the september figure be the increase for the financial year will be the cap of aim to achieve a balance between provide some measure of protection against inflation for member and crucially not increase scheme cost beyond what they can generally afford in order to avoid undermine the viability of some scheme and see they go into the pension protection fund 
 an obvious question come to mind what happen when inflation be above as it be currently most member who reach the state pension age before will still get the same inflation protection for their post-1988 guarantee minimum pension as if they have never be contract out that be achieve through an uplift that they receive in their additional state pension for those reach state pension age after april who be therefore receive the new state pension there be transitional arrangement in place which be particularly beneficial for people who be contract out these member will therefore still get the increase from their occupational pension scheme 
 i recognise that this be perhaps a very complex and technical area but i be satisfied that the order ensure that the burden place upon scheme be an appropriate but also that ensure that recipient get an increase in their pension that give they some measure of protection against inflation i therefore commend it to the house 
 mr speaker it will not surprise you to learn that i completely disagree with the hon lady ’s assessment i would point out that this government have provide the transition board with £ we have not see any of the £ that the welsh labour government have promise but indication so far be that move away from steelmaking would not have a direct impact on national security 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 the uk government fully recognise the challenge pose by cost of living pressure that have come about as a result of the covid pandemic and the invasion of ukraine that be why they be provide £ over to to support household and individual across the uk an average of £ per household 
 on monday evening itv news feature a bevan foundation study on pensioner poverty in wales with nearly a quarter of wales ’s population be over more pensioner be experience poverty in wales than anywhere else in the uk the make do and mend generation who experience impose rationing as child be now self deny with in pensioner skip meal and in go without heat at some point this winter what do the uk government intend to do about this dire situation 
 the uk government fully recognise the importance of support pensioner that be why we have commit to the triple lock and make sure that even through the difficult crisis we have face over the past few year pension have rise in line with inflation on top of that there have be an extra payment of £ for pensioner and the uk government ’s policy of bring down inflation be go to help everyone in wales and the uk include all pensioner i hope the hon lady will agree that that be a much well focus than for example bring in road user charging which be go to hit pensioner who want to drive car in wales 
 citizens advice cymru have state that during it refer over people to food bank in wales almost double the number for what do that say about the impact of the government ’s policy on ordinary people in wales 
 as i have just outline the uk government be absolutely focused on support those with the least in wales and across the united kingdom that be why the uk government ’s policy of bring down inflation to around half have help everyone and it be why the uk government have make sure that benefit have rise in line with inflation household where there be benefit have receive a £ payment and household where there be disability have receive a £ payment i do not for moment doubt the fact that many people be face serious difficulty at the moment but this government be commit to help they when i visit food bank i be tell that all sort of people have to go and visit food bank on a temporary basis they should not be use to score cheap political point 
 welsh labour ’s reduction of business rate relief from to be already have an impact with small business in wrexham say that they be go to fold despite the uk government maintain the rate at the welsh government be focus more on waste £ on a mph scheme and increase the number of senedd politician do the secretary of state agree that the welsh labour government should focus on what the people of wales need not what socialist senedd politician want to dictate 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be disgraceful that pub in wales be go to be pay on average thousand of pound more in business rate because the welsh senedd government have not pass on the money that have be give to they by the uk government and it be disgraceful that small tourism business be face a tourism tax levy if the welsh government want to focus on the priority of small business and community in wales they should indeed scrap the plan to spend £ on extra senedd members 
 do my right hon friend agree that of the good way in whichthe welsh labour government can help with the cost of living be by help business create job and support employer such as the iconic lobster pot on anglesey rather than increase business rate punitively and increase the number of senedd members by a staggering 
 my hon friend be absolutely right she be a huge champion of business in her constituency and it be a shame that the senedd do not look to her example of championing business instead of impose all sort of extra taxis while as she mention waste money on scheme such as create extra senedd members and bring in road charge on the m4 even my own labour council be suggest bring back severn bridge toll 
 i call the shadow minister 
 some homeowner in wales face the tory mortgage bombshell this month with household project to pay an extra £ per month as their fix rate deal come to an end despite the conservative party ’s opposition the welsh government have put in place measure to prevent    repossession and a uk labour government would require bank to protect homeowner what be the secretary of state do to help homeowner face massive bill cause by the conservative party ’s economic mismanagement 
 the uk government have put in place a number of measure to support any mortgage holder face difficulty at the moment but the most important measure have be to bring down inflation inflation actually peak at a high rate in europe than in the united kingdom inflation be now down at 4%—much less than half of what it be previously which will have a beneficial impact on mortgage interest rate over the long term i ask the hon lady whether in all fairness she think that her party ’s plan to borrow £ a year which be go to increase inflation and have a very bad impact on mortgage interest rate will be good or bad for homeowner 
 i call liz saville roberts 
 diolch yn fawr llefarydd the government ’s own estimate warn that new brexit border check will increase the cost of fresh import by £ and worsen food inflation the secretary of state use to dismiss warning of brexit border control as scare story will he now admit how wrong he be and recognise that the good way to reduce food inflation which sit at an eye watering would be to rejoin the single market 
 i make no apology for rubbish the scare story that come out before brexit take place we be tell that it be go to lead to the collapse of the economy to the collapse of house price to the end of fresh fruit and veg be sell in shop and even to no more magnum ice cream i think we be even go to run out of viagra as well at point the reality be that none of those scare story have happen but it be a bit ironic that the right hon lady the leader of the plaid cymru group be demand that we rejoin the european union while at the same time want to take wales out of of the most successful financial union 
 order secretary of state i be this way not that way and you be get a little carry away there be a few more question and liz saville roberts have another for you 
 that be a brexit fantasy and now we look at the wonder of the uk northern ireland be set to receive over £ and a fair funding settlement from the treasury which i welcome that include million of pound to help balance budget meanwhile in wales councillor face a budget black hole of £ which be set to decimate our social service over the next year these cut will be devastating for people leave without resource during the cost of living crisis as wales ’s man in the cabinet what have the secretary of state do to demand equivalent fair funding for wales 
 i must point out to the right hon lady that since leave the european union our growth rate have be well than that of germany and our manufacturing have now exceed that of france as far as fair funding for wales be concern we receive   more per head to spend on devolve service than be spend in england thing the right hon lady and i might agree on be that it be high time the welsh labour government explain why we have long wait list and low educational standard despite have more money to spend on devolved service 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of the energy mix in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of the energy mix in wales 
 that be lively mr speaker 
 the uk have a secure and diverse energy system and wales continue to play a key role the uk government be go far to ensure our energy security by support our oil and gas industry and invest to scale up our renewable energy production such as float offshore wind in the celtic sea 
 many of my constituent make the long journey round to work at hinkley yet we have have this government in power for year and we have see no new nuclear deliver in wales despite our proud history of generation with its significant opportunity to lower energy bill deliver high quality job and reduce carbon emission where on earth be their plan and why be they not get on with deliver it 
 i very much welcome the hon gentleman mention nuclear i seem to recall that when his party be in power labour do next to nothing to advance the cause of nuclear energy in this country it give i ample opportunity to pay tribute to the work of my hon friend   the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie who have commit the government to everything we have do on wylfa so far progress be be make in stark contrast to the record of his party 
 we have have year of successive tory governments who have all have the chance to invest in the transition to net instead they have choose to backslide on climate commitment and it be work people across my constituency of cardiff north who be pay the price with this government intent on issue new oil and gas licence what do the minister say to family in my constituency who be now pay treble for their energy bill 
 i would point out that it be this government who step in with £ of support to mitigate the impact of those energy bill i completely disagree with the hon lady ’s assessment of our record on net and i would point out that when her party be in power of our energy supply come from renewable source 
 year 
 if the hon lady will let i finish the point the figure be now just under and that be the record of this party ’s year in power 
 my hon friend mention the new industry of float offshore wind which have huge potential to create a large number of high quality job in place such as milford haven and port talbot the port both have bid in with the uk government to the flowmis port infrastructure scheme which will be key to see this vision realise when can the port expect to hear back about those bid 
 i thank my right hon friend the chair of the select committee for that question i be delighted that today the crown estate be host a bidder day to drive forward plan for innovative float wind project in the celtic sea the uk government be support flow through our contract for difference scheme secure a long term pipeline of project in the celtic sea i would be happy to write to he with a further update on when more progress can be discuss 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on the issue of the energy mix the tata worker i meet last week know that the virgin steel they make be vital to support our renewable energy aspiration such as offshore wind in the celtic sea so the loss of job be a kick in the tooth for our proud and skilled welsh steelworker it will devastate local economy and the sovereign steelmaking capacity that would build the wind turbine we need yet the business secretary tell we at the weekend 
 it ’ not about the job loss 
 do the secretary of state agree with her comment 
 i be sorry that the hon lady have i reply to that question not the secretary of state 
 it be important to recognise that the investment from this uk government have save thousand of job across the united kingdom of course the transition board be now work with the individual affect in port talbot which be the proper and right thing to do i be glad that both the uk and welsh governments be work towards that it be absolutely the right outcome we need to think about these thing in the wide context which be our responsibility 
 the minister boast about the transition board but that only exist because of the government ’s failure to protect job and vital industry each year port talbot provide enough virgin steel to deliver the uk ’s wind target by itself can she tell the house where that steel will come from when her government ’s intervention shut the blast furnace early will it come from india if so we will be surrender our ability to create job investment and cheap bill here in britain 
 mr speaker it will not surprise you to learn that i completely disagree with the hon lady ’s assessment i would point out that this government have provide the transition board with £ we have not see any of the £ that the welsh labour government have promise but indication so far be that move away from steelmaking would not have a direct impact on national security.[official report   february vol c. 4mc correction 
 whether he have have discussion with the welsh government on the introduction of a mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales 
 whether he have have discussion with the welsh government on the introduction of a mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales 
 the welsh government ’s policy on the blanket mph speed limit be damage community and business across wales all of we support mph limit if there be a safety reason outside school hospital or old people ’s home but the blanket mph limit be by the welsh government ’s own figure go to create a £ hit to the welsh economy 
 in my constituency bus service no long serve dyserth ’s high street or the tweedmill shopping outlet in trefnant which impact on some of the most vulnerable people arriva have state that the welsh government ’s mph policy be a key reason for that do the secretary of state agree that the welsh government have fail in multiple way to properly consider the impact of their policy and that they should repeal it in full 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct not only have the welsh government not consider the impact of this policy on the economy business and commuter but they have fail to consider the impact on user of public transport we be see bus timetable across the whole of wales be rip up because of this daft policy the welsh labour government seem determined to apply a handbrake to the welsh economy 
 blanket mph zone do not command widespread public support and as a consequence be widely ignore and unenforceable furthermore there be very little evidence that they improve road safety or air quality the roll out of the scheme in wales have prove to be an utter farce do my right hon friend share my concern that the labour party have not learn its lesson and would no doubt seek to impose this costly and disastrous policy in england be it to be elect 
 my hon friend be correct not only have the welsh labour government not consider this policy but they have ignore the fact that people have sign a petition call on they to reconsider the large petition in the history of the senedd he be also correct to say that if a labour government be ever elect in this country i certainly hope that will not happen it be inevitable that they would pursue anti motorist policy such as the mph speed limit a ban on new road be build and congestion charge and emission zone be set up all over the place 
 the south wales argus of   december   inform we that the secretary of state for wales outline his anger that the mph speed limit in caerwent be not be enforce properly by the police be he still angry 
 i begin my response early by say that all of we in this house support mph speed limit where there be an issue of safety and i could not be more clear about that what i do not support be a blanket mph limit alongside that blanket mph limit on mph road the welsh labour government be use underhand method to bring down the speed limit on perfectly safe dual carriageway from mph to mph that be what lie in store if labour be ever elect to government in the rest of the country 
 clearly the mph speed limit that be be enforce in wales will restrict people in their movement have the minister have any discussion with the welsh assembly on provide more bus to take people out of their car and will there be more provision for cyclist if there be not that provision this system can not work 
 unfortunately welsh senedd ministers do not seem interested in reconsider the policy frankly there be an anti motorist agenda with the welsh labour government which have see blanket mph speed limit speed reduction on dual carriageway congestion charge be consider and charge to use the m4 most shockingly of all my own labour council be consider bring back severn bridge toll 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of rail infrastructure in wales 
 i have regular discussion with colleague across government on rail infrastructure the uk government be commit to build a strong rail infrastructure network across wales which will improve connectivity and drive economic growth we have provide over £ for welsh rail in recent year and we recently announce a furth £ to fund the electrification of the north wales main line 
 the welsh affairs committee highlight the need for great connectivity between swansea cardiff and bristol which would be of huge benefit particularly for sport and music fan come to ashton gate in my constituency why have the wales rail board fail to initiate recommendation and other further improvement 
 the hon lady ’s constituent will be greatly affect by the project that she mention and by the performance of great western railway which be not sufficient the office of rail and road have launch an investigation into poor train punctuality and reliability in network rail ’s wales and western region and we await the recommendation of that review i add that industrial action have affect thing 
 will my hon friend join i in congratulate network rail and its subcontractor on complete the repair work on the long wooden rail bridge in europe across the mawddach estuary in gwynedd 
 i certainly will join my hon friend and i be delighted that he take such keen interest in welsh rail infrastructure and raise it here on such a regular basis he be right to flag that project which be an example of this government ’s record investment in rail infrastructure in wales i be pleased to visit the project and give it my full support 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales 
 the government be invest £ to secure the future of steelmaking in port talbot for generation to come it be of the large uk government support package for steelmaking in history and it will protect job directly with tata and many thousand more in the supply chain 
 last week the secretary of state state in the steel debate that he understand 
 the devastation that people will feel in port talbot the whole community but especially those people who face the loss of their jobs”—[official report   january vol c. 
 at the plant and beyond why be it then that the secretary of state or the business secretary do not put in a red line on job loss while this work be be do especially give that tata have this morning double down on those loss at the welsh affairs committee it be nothing short of a disgrace 
 as the hon gentleman know tata approach the uk government and say it be intend to pull out of the united kingdom if tata have pull out completely that would have immediately cost job and many thousand more in the supply chain the government therefore act to take the only deal available which be to build the electric arc furnace and save thousand of job 
 i do not think that thousand of job will be save at all the people of teesside who see the tory government abandon they and end virgin steelmaking at redcar lead to the loss of job will sympathise with those in wales the failure of the same government will see virgin steelmaking also end in wales with the loss of another job and leave the uk even more reliant on import as they be surrender the market to other country why would the government want to do that when steel be a foundation industry and with the introduction of new technology could have a bright future 
 i hope that the hon gentleman will be aware that of the material the iron ore and coke use to produce steel in port talbot be import from abroad at the same time we be export tonne of scrap steel so build an arc furnace to make use of that scrap steel will make we less dependent on other country for our steel 
 as far as job loss be concern the uk government have put aside a budget of £ combine with £ from tata to support anyone who lose their job thus far we have not have single penny towards that from the welsh labour government who by the way be able to find £ to create a whole load of extra senedd member in cardiff bay i know where my priority be with the steelworker 
 steelmaking be essential to our national security as be reach net the problem be that the welsh labour government can not make their mind up about which be more important after try to kill off the steel industry with their green measure they now complain that the uk government be not do enough to support that industry do the secretary of state think that they do not really know their acas from their nalgo 
 my hon friend make a good point the government have look carefully at this and very little steel be produce by port talbot be go into the defence industry but the defence industry be be supply with steel from an electric arc furnace by sheffield forgemasters there be absolutely no reason why an electric arc furnace build at port talbot use uk government support can not help support our defence industry in the year to come 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support victim of crime in wales 
 i have regular discussion with ministerial colleague on a range of topic include on justice matter the government be commit to support victim by we will have quadruple funding in england and wales for victim and witness support service from level 
 in crime go unsolved in wales in the last month what do the minister say to the victim of the unsolved crime 
 i would point to the government ’s record on crime last week ’s office for national statistics crime survey show drop in all major crime type with an average reduction of about violent crime be down by neighbourhood crime be down by and theft be down by that be due in part to the fact that the government have meet their commitment to provide extra police officer my own force dyfed powys have now get an extra officer 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of levelling up funding on welsh community 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague and delivery team in the department for levelling up   housing and communities on the progress of levelling up fund project in wales i look forward to hear more about the project take place in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 the môr i’r mynydd sea to mountain active travel route in the conwy valley receive an £ boost through levelling up fund the project will make a positive difference to community in glan conwy betws y coed and trefriw apart from unlock the conwy valley to visitor it will help young people get to school safely and worker to their job i meet regularly with conwy county borough council about the progress of those project what be my right hon friend do to ensure that levelling up fund be be deliver effectively in wales 
 i congratulate my hon friend on be such a champion of levelling up fund scheme in his constituency the levelling up fund have allow we to keep our post brexit promise to ensure that wales continue to be generously fund that be of many such project such as the levelling up fund the freeport and the investment zone that be ensure that wales level up 
 like the town and village i represent coalfield community in wales be still bear the brunt of deindustrialisation i be delighted that we will have a debate tomorrow on miner and mining community and i encourage welsh colleague to attend can the minister tell we what step he be take to ensure that levelling up funding in wales and across the coalfield in the uk be target at the most deprive left behind area which have suffer most 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say we need to target the area most in need but that be exactly what this government have be do it be not just about level up fund we have have growth deal across the length and breadth of wales round of level up funding investment zone freeport an electrify rail line in north wales and an electrify arc furnace in south wales the reality be that while we be commit to level up the welsh labour government be commit to levy further taxis on people and business on wales 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i want to say that recent exchange have   be lively to the point where it be become difficult   for colleague to hear what be be say clearly and there have be an escalation in unhelpful exchange across the floor of the house from sedentary position and the attempt use of prop some of the language use in question have also fall short of the standard of good temper and moderation that should characterise the proceeding of this house i know there be a general election approach but i urge hon member on both side of the house to exercise great self restraint in their choice of word and in their general behaviour both when they be ask a question and when they be not 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 on monday i meet the family of grace o’malley kumar barnaby webber and ian coates who be kill in nottingham i assure they that we would do whatever it take to get the answer that they want follow constructive dialogue over past month i welcome the significant step the dup have take to make restoration of the executive possible i also thank the other political party in northern ireland for the patience they have show after year without an executive there be now the prospect of get power sharing back up and run strengthen our union give the people the local accountable government that they need and offer a bright future for northern ireland my right hon friend the northern ireland secretary will be make a statement shortly this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 last week i meet a constituent who be employ not by the post office but by a supermarket that operate a franchise post office she be wrongly accuse of dishonesty as a result of the faulty horizon system and put through a disciplinary process by her employer the supermarket which have a profound impact on her life she be not alone there be other in her position yet there be no provision for compensate people who work in franchise post office as she do will the prime minister give i a commitment that he will include those victim in the horizon scandal compensation scheme 
 i be very sorry to hear about the hon and learn lady ’s constituent ’s case as i have say it be an awful miscarriage of justice and everyone affect deserve not only justice but compensation and answer i will make sure we look into the precise detail of her constituent ’s case surely there will be other like that and will make sure that the minister get back to she with all due haste 
 sustainable aviation fuel play a significant part in the sector ’s decarbonisation will my right hon friend the prime minister commit to further policy for a saf mandate to generate great demand and for a revenue support mechanism of the kind that other sector include solar and wind power generation have will he give a commitment that work will start by the end of next year on the promise sustainable aviation plant here in the uk 
 i can give my hon friend the assurance that we be committed to ensure the saf mandate will be in place by by mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel we will be able not only to   deliver carbon saving but to create a brand new uk market as of the step in introduce the revenue certainty mechanism that he talk about by the department for transport will be consult in the spring of this year on option for how that should work in practice 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 may i join the prime minister in welcome the dup ’s statement on the return of the northern ireland executive this be an important moment but we now need all side to work together to get stormont back up and run for the people of northern ireland i too meet the family of grace barnaby and ian on monday it be impossible to express in word the horror that they have be through and continue to go through we must all redouble our effort to do everything we can to help they with their campaign this week young lives—16 year old max and year old mason be take in bristol i know the whole house will join i in send condolence to their family and friend 
 of the most difficult experience for any member of this house be speak to those at the sharp end of this government ’s cost of living crisis nobody could fail to be move by the plight of   the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman his mortgage have go up £ a month and he have be force to quit his dream job to pay for it a tory mp count the cost of tory chaos after year have we finally discover what they mean when they say we ’re all in this together 
 thank to the mortgage charter that the chancellor introduce last year million of mortgage holder across the country be benefit from mortgage support rather than take the approach that the right hon and learn gentleman just do it be important to focus on the practical support in place to help people who need it someone on a typical mortgage be able to save hundred of pound thank to those reform recently we have see mortgage application at a multi month high as a result of confidence return if he really care about help people with the cost of living he would do more to celebrate and acknowledge the fact that thank to our plan million of work people will start to pay hundred of pound less in tax from this month ’s payslip we all know that be not a priority for he he say he want to back people on the cost of living but i read that he have describe tax cut as salt the earth it seem that his shadow chancellor be equally confuse in davos she say that she back tax cut but back here in westminster she call they a scorch earth policy she obviously can not decide which wikipedia page to copy this week 
 for every £ the prime minister say he be give people back he be take £ out of their back pocket through high tax he think they should be dance in the street and thank he there be people just like   the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman come off fix rate mortgage and pay more each and every month because the conservatives crash the economy do the prime minister know how much their monthly repayment be go up by 
 as i say someone on a typical mortgage of about £ with year leave be currently pay around £ as a result of the ability to extend their mortgage term or switch to a month interest only mortgage someone on the average mortgage will be able to save hundred of pound again the right hon and learn gentleman say that he care about the cost of living but what would have the big impact on everyone ’s cost of living be his idea to spend £ a shadow treasury minister confirm just this morning that they remain committed to that but he have no plan to pay for that £ no plan at all that be typical labour economic they want to keep the spending but drop the payment plan at the weekend i see the former labour leader the right hon and learn gentleman ’s mentor who be clear that labour will make their sum add up with tax rise on people ’s asset their home pension and business it be the same old labour party no plan and back to square with high taxis 
 the government have crash the economy mortgage be through the roof and they have double the debt and the prime minister think he can stand there and lecture other people about fiscal responsibility he do not answer the question hundred of thousand of people be come off fix rate mortgage and face huge mortgage increase and the prime minister will not even do they the courtesy of answer the question interruption no he do n’t so i will ask he again 
 order i be very clear at the beginning my constituent want to hear if your do n’t please leave 
 do the prime minister have any idea how much mortgage be go up by this month for those come off fix rate mortgage 
 again i point the right hon and learn gentleman back to my previous answer everybody ’s situation will be different someone on a typical mortgage of around £ who be currently pay £ will be able to keep their mortgage payment essentially the same by use the facilitation the chancellor have put in place that be what we have do to help people again it be incumbent on the right hon and learn gentleman to explain to the british public how his policy of decarbonise the grid by will be fund he will not give the answer but helpfully the shadow energy secretary   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband pop up at the weekend in an interview in the sunday times and say that labour do not need a plan to pay for it because in his word it will produce real saving and it make clear economic sense the leader of the opposition do not want to talk about it at all all these year later it be the same story the right hon member for doncaster north have carve a promise in stone and everybody else just look away in embarrassment 
 the prime minister just do not get it the government have crash the economy mortgage be skyrocket they be double the debt they say they be go to max out the government ’s credit card at the next budget—[interruption 
 order i think the chief whip be get very carry away he do not want to lead everybody for a cup of tea do he come on 
 the government have forfeit the right to lecture other about the economy somebody come off a fix rate mortgage will be pay an average of £ more each and every month a constant reminder that work people be pay the price for the damage the government have do to the economy 
 this week i meet an employee at iceland in warrington phil interruption 
 order mr gibson the same voice keep appear again and it will not appear any more i be just let you know now 
 laugh at an iceland employee who be struggle with his mortgage shame phil tell i his mortgage be go up by a staggering £ a month he do not want other average other people other story this be what be happen to he if the hon member for mid norfolk on £ can not afford this tory government how on earth can people like phil 
 thank to the management of the economy phil and million of people like he be now ensure that inflation be less than half the rate that it be when we be talk a year ago that be put more money in their pocket thank to this government phil and million of other worker not just at iceland but across the country be benefit this month in their pay packet from a tax cut worth hundred of pound for someone on an average salary 
 i hope the right hon and learn gentleman explain to phil the cost of his policy do he explain how phil be go to have to pay for the right hon and learn gentleman ’s £ green spending spree do he explain what it will cost phil in high taxis with more come out of his pay packet do he explain to phil that he would be well off stick with our plan rather than go back to square with he 
 i invite the prime minister to get in touch with phil and explain to he how pay £ more in his mortgage be make he well off because that be not how he feel the prime minister be so out of touch it be unbelievable find hundred of pound extra per month may not seem like a big deal to the prime minister but let i tell he that most people do not have that sort of money knock around 
 if that be not bad enough this week the prime minister tell every council in the country to put their council tax up by the maximum of that is tax rise now prime minister he say everything be fine and people be well off but when people see their mortgage go up their council tax go up and food price still go up who do he expect they to believe his boast or their bank account 
 again i be puzzle the right hon and learn gentleman resort here as always to the politic of envy i be genuinely surprised that after recently and repeatedly attack not just i but the government for lift the bonus cap the shadow   chancellor have announce just today that she now support the government ’s policy on the banker bonus cap i do not know whether he mention that to phil when he be have his chat but i be sure he can fill we in i can tell he that trust and economic credibility come from stick to a plan but it be become clear that we can not trust a word he say when the shadow chancellor claim that they will not borrow much or raise phil ’s taxis we now know that those promise be just not worth the wikipedia page they be copy from 
 i actually do not expect the prime minister to be laugh at phil i do not expect that—[interruption 
 order look i make the statement very clear it be very serious that we make sure that people hear both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition it matter to the people who watch the proceeding of this chamber the behaviour that seem to be carry on be not good 
 the prime minister just do not get how hard it be for million of people across the country like phil that be the primary problem they be struggle with their mortgage their bill and the spiral cost of living the prime minister ’s response be never to take responsibility and never to show contrition or even any level of basic understanding he be so detached that he think he can paint a world in which their problem simply do not exist the problem be that he can not even fool his own mp let alone anyone else the hon member for mid norfolk say he be exhausted and be look forward to new opportunity outside of parliament why do the prime minister not do he a favour and call an election so that he and the whole country can move on 
 whether it be phil or everyone else across the country the plan that we be put in place be work to help people and we be make progress just this week take action to stop child vaping just this week ensure that people can visit their pharmacy to get the healthcare they need free up million of gp appointment and just this week million of work people start to see hundred of pound of tax cut deliver in their pay packet that be a plan that be work all the right hon and learned gentleman be offer be £ of tax rise and that be the choice a bright future with we or back to square with they 
 the prime minister like to attend live sport so i wonder whether he will join i in welcome the planning inspector ’s decision to uphold rugby council ’s rejection of an application for development at brandon stadium in my constituency to keep the door open for it to remain a sporting venue so that future generation will enjoy the thrill and spill of motorcycle speedway and stock car 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute and be proud of britain ’s rich history in the automotive and motorsport sector the stadium he talk about be an historic motorsport venue while it have be a shame to see it fall into disrepair i hope that the   decision he refer to will enable the possibility of both speedway and stock car race to return i know that he will continue rightly to champion this cause 
 i call the snp leader 
 when the tories scrap the cap on banker bonus in the autumn during a cost of living crisis the labour party rightly oppose it yet here we be just month later and the labour party support scrap the cap shameful be the prime minister comfort by the fact that he be now no long alone in this house on be completely out of touch with public opinion 
 as i say at the time we support the decision of the independent regulator because it be the right thing for financial stability and because we on this side of the house have a set of conviction and we have a plan and we stick to it but the hon gentleman be absolutely right to point out the flip flopping u turning and no conviction of the party opposite 
 of course scrap the cap on banker bonus be only make possible because of brexit what the westminster party be now tell the public be that it be ok for banker to have unlimited brexit bonus but the public who be sit at home and struggle to feed their family have to suck up and deal with additional food cost as a result of brexit red tape that be the cost and that be the reality of break brexit britain be it not the case that the great achievement of this tory government be get the labour party to agree to that bleak future 
 we be actually deliver benefit for people across scotland not least the new free trade deal that be open up market for scottish exporter freeport that be attract job and investment and the brexit pub guarantee that be cut the cost of a pint in scottish pub the hon gentleman talk about the cost of living but what he could do to help the most be ensure that scotland be not the most highly tax part of the united kingdom and not just for high earner everyone earn £ or more be pay more tax in scotland than they would in england thank to the snp 
 punch throw day on life support then child leave without a father a year sentence be hand down and the perpetrator be release after but grieve mother have to live a life sentence of agony sentence for punch killer be not work in this country do the prime minister agree that now be the time to finally introduce a specific offence and a tough minimum sentence for punch manslaughter 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that she have do to bring attention to so call punch manslaughter and to highlight the anguish that as she know well those case cause to the family of the victim i know that the ministry of justice have look very carefully at the amendment that she have propose and that she will shortly be meet the minister for safeguarding to discuss both her specific amendment and how we might well address the wide issue 
 mr speaker—[interruption 
 order ed davey 
 my constituent millie a wheelchair user have a serious accident at a sporting event millie be leave wait on the floor in pain for over hour before an ambulance arrive during her month in hospital since then she have be drop badly multiple time leave stick in her bed for day on end and even tell to soil herself when there be no to take she to the toilet before all this millie be live independently and work but the prospect of she return to work be be destroy by the crisis in the nhs and care system i be sure the prime minister will agree that no should ever have to go through what millie have be through so will he look again at our proposal to ensure that every patient receive the high quality care that they need 
 i be very sorry to hear about millie ’s case and i be sure that if there be specific aspect of it that need to be examine the health secretary will follow they up with the right hon gentleman more generally we want to make sure that everyone get the care they deserve which be why we be not just invest record sum in the nhs but ensure that there be record number of doctor nurse and new innovative form of treatment such as surgical hub and virtual ward all that be show that ambulance time which the right hon gentleman mention be low today than they be this time last year 
 the no reason for child ’s hospital admission in my constituency be dental treatment but we have no nhs capacity and no orthodontist in barnstaple our dentist can not recruit even with a large golden hello the emergency dental plan seem to have be stick at the treasury forever might my right hon friend use his spare set of key and pop round to rescue it for we my constituent and i would be ever so grateful 
 my hon friend have rightly champion the provision of dentistry in her area we be invest £ a year and the reform contract in dentistry from the nhs have improve access while ensure fairer remuneration for dentist we be also provide more financial support for those who need it the most about half the course of treatment last year be deliver to those who be non paying both adult and child but yes more need to be do and that be why our dentistry recovery plan will be publish shortly 
 more than decade ago the then prime minister tony blair mislead this house by promote and endorse the post office horizon it system as perfect protect the large corporation that create it and cause untold harm damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he have promote in partnership with huge business as safe and effective that have ultimately harm the british people will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as tony blair and sit back do nothing and let the misery continue to pile up 
 we have be clear that the horizon scandal be a terrible miscarriage of justice and we be do everything we can to make it right to what the hon member be more broadly insinuating let i be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccine be safe 
 the shocking revelation of the horizon scandal highlight the post office ’s financial incompetence and my right hon friend will know that the public ’s confidence in the institution be at an all time low do he agree that as high street bank be close branch across the country we should look at develop new community banking solution rather than give the post office sole responsibility for provide access to cash and other banking service in poorly serve neighbourhood 
 i thank my hon friend for her question but i would just say that we should not make the mistake of conflate this scandal with the action of many hard work local postmaster and sub postmaster customer can access cash and banking service through a wide range of channel include a contract with the post office counters service which provide a valuable channel i agree with she however on the importance of access to cash which be why the government have legislate to protect that as part of the recent financial services and markets act to ensure that the vast majority of people should be no more than mile away from such a cashpoint 
 of the nolan principle integrity state that holder of public office should not act to gain material benefit for themselves their family or their friend on january the prime minister tweet a link to the conservative party website that seem to scrape people ’s datum and place unwanted cooky on their machine the good law project be now pursue this can he assure the house that no law have be break by his party 
 of course our party follow all law 
 a responsibility for government be to fix the housing crisis that young people do not cause year ago we drag house building in this country up to the high level since after the last labour government leave it at its low level since the 1920s but house building be weaken and we need to do more will my right hon friend consider use the budget to do as he and i do together during the pandemic cut stamp duty to boost housing start reignite the economy and support thousand of business across our country 
 my right hon friend be right to point out that since we have deliver additional home and we be on track to deliver just in this parliament and help over family into home ownership through scheme such as help to buy and the right to buy obviously tax decision be a matter for the chancellor but i would point out that our exist stamp duty relief for time buyer ensure that the vast majority of time buyer in our country pay absolutely no stamp duty 
 the all party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment have today publish polling that find that nearly half of employer exclude blind and partially sight people from their workplace and that in say that they would not be willing to make workplace adjustment the disability employment gap remain stubbornly at and the pay gap mean that blind and partially sight people effectively work for free for day of the year will the prime minister meet i and sight loss organisation to discuss how we can create a more inclusive workforce 
 i share the hon lady ’s ambition for an inclusive workforce the record in support those with disability into work over the past several year have be incredibly strong i know my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions be actively look at that and make sure that our accessibility plan be up to date and inclusive i will ensure that the hon lady get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 have visit recently i know that israel remain in shock follow the rape murder and butchery carry out by hamas all of we want to see a peaceful and demilitarised palestinian state however hamas remain in control in large part of gaza support for they be grow in the west bank poll show that nearly third of palestinians reject co existence with israel and the palestinian authority have continue to promote hatred of jews do my right hon friend agree that any recognition of a palestinian state must address these issue and can come about only as part of a negotiate settlement between israel and the palestinians 
 the government ’s position be clear my right hon and learn friend be right that step and condition need to be put in place on this journey and foremost the removal of hamas from gaza a palestinian lead government in gaza and the west bank a concrete plan to reform and support the palestinian authority a reconstruction plan for gaza and a state solution which we have long support let i be clear we stand with israel the terrorist threat it face must be eliminate and israel ’s last security must be guarantee 
 on november last year i appeal to the prime minister to choose de escalation and peace over violence death and destruction but he call i naive so far over soul have perish in gaza in a powerful and move open letter in monday ’s the jewish voice for peace rabbinical council cite deuteronomy 
 i have put before you life and death blessing and curse choose life 
 and accuse president biden of choose death if the prime minister will not listen to i or the international court of justice will he listen to the rabbinical council or will he call it naive too 
 i have be clear multiple time that we be deeply concerned about the impact on the civilian population of the fighting in gaza too many people have lose their life and there be a desperate need for increase humanitarian support in gaza i will not go over all the debate we have have about the condition that be necessary for an immediate pause lead to a sustainable ceasefire but i assure the house that we be do everything we can to get more aid into the region as quickly as possible 
 chatham dock support over local high value job which be at risk because the owner be continue in their pursuit to displace successful business such as arcelormittal kent wire the labour council be fail to honour the commitment it make before the local election to protect the dock and the job even the leader of the opposition say he be proudly back the save chatham docks campaign will my right hon friend meet i to see how we can protect the dock and save those job for my constituent be this not just another example of how labour and its leader change their position depend on which way the wind blow 
 my right hon friend have be a constant champion of chatham dock and i be disappointed to hear that the local labour council be fail to honour the commitment it have make as she point out i be not surprised that the leader of the opposition have say thing and then consequently do another the dock support hundred of job and i join she in call on the council to rethink its approach 
 with permission i shall make a statement on the launch of our pharmacy service 
 pharmacy be at the centre of our community they be an accessible front door to our nhs for million of people alongside general practice optometry and dentistry pharmacy be of the pillar of primary care in england in people in england live within a minute walk of a community pharmacy pharmacy provide fast fair and simple access to care and advice for the kind of illness from which people suffer every day our constituent can now walk in off the high street whenever it suit they whether they be at home at work or visit somewhere 
 our pharmacist be not only conveniently locate but highly skilled professional with year of training under their belt the number of register pharmacist in england have grow considerably under this conservative government up compare with none the less these skilled healthcare professional still represent a rather untapped resource in our nhs so this government be bring forward reform that will make the most of their expertise give people up and down the country a variety of quality care and wise advice quickly and easily save they a trip to the gp free up appointment for patient who need gps the most and drive our plan to cut waiting list the benefit be clear that be why this government have consistently take the decision that allow community pharmacist to deliver more clinical service and supply more treatment whether that be other part of the nhs refer patient suffer from minor illness to community pharmacist for advice and the sale of over the counter medicine offer lifesave blood pressure check in pharmacy or make it easy for woman to access oral contraception in pharmacy i be proud of everything that we have accomplish so far 
 to unlock the full potential of our pharmacist we need to go far and fast that be why i be delighted to inform the house today that we be launch the pharmacy service a personal priority of the prime minister who be himself the son of a pharmacist this will give pharmacist the power to supply prescription only medication include antibiotic and antiviral for common condition sore throat ear ache infected insect bite impetigo shingle and minor urinary tract infection in woman more than community pharmacy have sign up over of pharmacy in england which be a brilliant sign of their approval 
 the next time that anyone be suffer from any of those condition for most people their port of call will be a quick trip or a call to their pharmacist they will not need to see their gp they will not need to spend time make an appointment and they can turn to their pharmacist whenever it suit they that benefit everyone involve people get the care they need fast gps can focus on more complicated case and pharmacist can make well use of their knowledge and skill this be a common sense reform pharmacist see and advise people with these sort of condition every day but we   have now enable they to provide prescription only medicine where clinically appropriate so that they can help people more easily 
 all this will deliver result pharmacy will make it easy for million of people to get the care they need on the high street and together with the expand blood pressure and contraception service it will free up as many as gp appointment in turn reduce unnecessary trip to a&e reduce the pressure on gps and drive forward our plan to cut waiting list for patient 
 the investment that we be put into pharmacy will also level up digital infrastructure in community pharmacie up and down the country streamline referral to and from gps give pharmacist well access to relevant information from patient gp record and allow they to share relevant information quickly in return 
 pharmacy be not just about deliver care fast but about make care fairer by drive down health inequality that be because there be double the number of pharmacy in the most deprived community in our country get the right care the right contraception and the right test will now be fast and simple for all those people in our more deprived community than it ever have be before thank to pharmacy they will be able to take full advantage of their pharmacist expertise and use they to complement the care they receive from their gps and throughout the nhs 
 pharmacy be make possible only through close collaboration with community pharmacy england which i thank for all the work it have do and will continue to do to support community pharmacy to gear up and deliver this new service for our nhs 
 we on the conservative benches have a clear plan for the nhs get patient the care they need fast make the system simple for staff and make it fair for everyone that be our plan and i look forward to work with pharmacist up and down the country to deliver today ’s announcement as we build a bright future for family right across the country i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of her statement 
 let i start by pay tribute to the many organisation that have be involve in prepare for this launch and the thousand of pharmacy across the country that have embrace this initiative labour have long be argue that pharmacist should play a great role in the nhs so we support this move 
 as the minister have say pharmacy already do far more than just dispense repeat prescription and sell shampoo they be medicine expert within the nhs they be highly train they be easily accessible right across the country and as we see during the pandemic they be a highly trust part of their community but their skill and knowledge be often under utilise therefore bring more service to british high street for patient to get treat more quickly and   conveniently be absolutely right it be why as we announce last week we want to bring nhs out patient appointment close to people through high street opticians too 
 the minister be right to say that pharmacist can take pressure off gps however let we be clear this announcement will not make up for the pharmacy which have be close under the conservatives or the gps that have be cut since patient today be wait over a month to see a gp if they can get an appointment at all when labour be last in office people could get an appointment within hour 
 that be the thing with this government they give with hand and take with the other will the minister explain what have happen to the government ’s pledge to deliver more gps this year and what she be do to support community pharmacy which be already face a perfect storm of inflationary pressure for run cost recruitment challenge and an unstable medicine market 
 the government press release issue today claim that patient in england will be able to get treatment for common condition at their high street pharmacy from today i would like to dig down into whether that be actually the case healthwatch england have warn that it will take time for pharmacist to be train in order to provide the service that ministers have announce so can the minister tell we when she will be able to guarantee that the service advertise will actually be available 
 let i also ask about it integration to facilitate this roll out pharmacist be suppose to have access to gp connect so that detail of patient consultation would automatically be send to general practice through the clinical it system the government have have month to get that ready but from what i be hear this morning it be still not live pharmacist be tell i that they can access only a summary of gp record that they have to use another system to input what they have prescribe and that they then have to download that and email it across to the gp that be cumbersome what estimate have the minister make of the time that will be waste at a local level to address that issue and how long will it take before the system be ready 
 finally what be the government ’s plan in the long term to integrate the increase in independent prescriber who be be train as part of the long term workforce plan and do the minister agree with we that we should be accelerate the roll out of independent prescribing to establish a community pharmacist prescribing service cover a broad range of common condition that would support patient with chronic condition which be the big challenge face the nhs do the minister agree that community pharmacy will have an important role to play in support gps in the management of long term condition such as hypertension and asthma and in tackle the serious issue of over prescribing which be responsible for thousand of avoidable hospital admission every year 
 we agree that patient should be able to go to their local pharmacy to receive some service that they currently get at gp surgery such as vaccination free of charge on the nhs allow patient to be see fast and free up gps to see more complex case by bring healthcare into the community patient will have great   control the nhs should be as much a neighbourhood health service as a national health service with healthcare on the doorstep there when it be need and with labour it will be 
 well the very appointment under pharmacy happen at this morning 
 it be 
 oh be it i thank the secretary of state when will the service be available i should think that many more be take place already 
 i be afraid that while welcome this the hon lady be be a little pusillanimous with her praise a lot of her suggestion as she will know be simply not true already well over new gps and ten of thousand of nurse be work in our nhs many thousand of additional practice staff be work in gp practice and as she will know our brilliant gps have make more appointment available each year ahead of the target in our manifesto good on they they be do an amazing job and pharmacy will ease the ever increase burden on they 
 the hon lady talk about technology i be pleased to tell she that ensure that the technology be in place be key in decide when we could go live there be a very short window in which some system will have element of manual intervention but only for a few week the whole system will be fully automate and will provide the ability to inquire into gp record and to swap advice which be important for pharmacist to deliver the excellent service that they be already deliver 
 finally the hon lady will know that community pharmacist have for some time now be deliver blood pressure check which in some case be truly lifesaving this be amazing patient access and patient convenience the labour party should for once simply praise it and be glad that the government have stick to our plan and get on with it 
 i be so pleased to hear today ’s announcement that we be deliver it be of the key thing in our plan for patient that i want to ensure happen in particular many member of this house current and past have have infection and as a consequence of not deal with they have end up in hospital this be the sort of sensible approach that frankly meet some resistance during my time in the department with worry about over prescribing it be about treat pharmacist like proper professional and most important provide quick access to necessary care which patient will now properly enjoy 
 may i say a huge thank you to my right hon friend for her contribution to kick this project off i feel very fortunate to be at the dispatch box on the day we launch it because many other be involve in set it up she rightly highlight some of the problem with spot thing such as sepsis infection which pharmacist be train to spot they really can be the line of defence be able to walk in off the high street to see a pharmacist be incredibly valuable to we all 
 as a long stand supporter of the idea of pharmacy i welcome the right hon lady ’s statement and the specific reform she have talk about introduce she will be aware however that pharmacist in my constituency and far afield be very concerned that they be unable to do the job that they be already expect to because of lack of capacity and problem in access certain drug that they need to prescribe can she indicate how the exist problem will be deal with so that they can do what be promise in pharmacy 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his support for the programme there be around license medicine the vast majority of which be in good supply the department work very closely with the sector on find alternative and source supply of medicine and most of the time we be able to meet the demand occasionally there be challenge but that do not change in any way the ability of community pharmacist to be the expert medicine supplier that they be and to meet the need that member of the general public have for treatment and advice 
 i warmly welcome the statement this initiative have the potential to transform primary care and access to treatment but do the minister agree that to realise its full potential we need to invest in new technology she mention digitalisation to make sure that community pharmacy be set up to take advantage of these new opportunity we also need to invest in the pharmacy workforce as part of the government ’s long term workforce plan so that those in alternative role within pharmacy such as pharmacy technician have the capacity to take the opportunity she have outline 
 my hon friend be absolutely right invest in technology be vital but so be invest in the workforce we have see a increase in the number of register community pharmacist since and we aim in our long term nhs workforce plan to increase that by a further we have already increase the number of training place for both pharmacist and pharmacy technician 
 i too welcome pharmacy which i think be a very good initiative in recent week we have see the closure of pharmacy in my area on beverley road and chanterlands avenue i be also tell by leader in the humber pharmacy community that our area have of the large number of temporary closure because of problem access pharmacist will the minister look favourably therefore on my idea to attach a school of pharmacy to hull york medical school we need a school of dentistry too if we could have a centre of excellence in the humber area it might solve some of our specific workforce problem 
 i be always happy to speak to colleague on both side of the house about their idea for new dental and pharmacy school it be an ongoing interest 
 england be in fact bless with huge number of community pharmacy well over and in of we be able to walk to a community pharmacy   within minute the number of pharmacy in more deprive area be double the number in more well off area we be very well serve by our brilliant pharmacy and i hope the pharmacy programme will improve their footfall and their value in each of our community 
 i very much welcome this initiative to encourage our pharmacy to provide more frontline healthcare people need to know about this because they often do not think of go to the pharmacy what work be the government do in large population centre such as harwich and dovercourt which have over people but no out of hour pharmacy cover people have to make a round trip of more than mile to collect a prescription on a sunday for example be the government do any work on pharmacy coverage for large population area 
 my hon friend raise an important point pharmacist will keep their community pharmacy open for up to hour a week in most case and up to hour in some case which mean there be weekend accessibility we keep this under review but the availability be very good 
 the liberal democrats have long support call for pharmacy and the national pharmacy association base in my st albans constituency have be call for it since at least this be a welcome move but it be long overdue the minister will be aware that there have be almost permanent pharmacy closure since and the company chemists association now estimate that pharmacy a week be close include in my constituency what step be she take to make sure there be no more closure this week next week and every other week this year 
 the hon lady might remember that the liberal democrats be in government for a good part of that period she talk about pharmacy closure and we see pharmacy opening and closing there have be a small number of net closure but we be very well serve across england and we keep a close eye on that pharmacy be a new boost to community pharmacy across england 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on bring in this initiative i have fantastic community pharmacy in south derbyshire although sadly when the boundary change come i will lose hatton to derbyshire dales they be leader in their field and they be trust in their community this be a brilliant initiative and i can not thank my right hon friend enough 
 i thank my hon friend 
 rise 
 order that be a perfect answer i have to tell the house that we have a lot of business to get through today and i will therefore need short question and admirably short answer because otherwise not everyone who be stand will have a chance to ask a question 
 i do not agree with most of what the minister have say today we be all in favour of pharmacy but i think this statement be a distraction from the real problem in our health service our gp service and much else 
 order will the hon gentleman please ask a question 
 have the minister look at the number of pharmacy that have close in the poor area of our country lastly what be she go to do about company like boot it have even close its local branch in westminster 
 order because of his seniority i have allow the hon gentleman a little leeway question answer 
 the more deprived part of england be much well serve by community pharmacy than well off area be 
 we have amazing pharmacist in watford and i have champion community pharmacy such as sigma which be a fantastic local business can the minister provide an assurance that the general public will be make massively aware of this fantastic new service 
 yes there will be a significant communication package begin today 
 the minister do not appear to be concern about the record number of community pharmacy closure under this conservative government why do she think it be happen 
 there have be a increase in register pharmacist since with plan to increase that number by in the next few year 
 i commend my right hon friend for her excellent statement but how will she tackle the issue of funding for prescription community pharmacy be struggle and she will understand that the nhs tariff do not pay they the full price of product will she look at that as she roll out the scheme 
 the government currently contribute £ to community pharmacy quite apart from the £ addition for pharmacy we be about to start negotiation for the period 
 the pharmacy in shirley in my constituency have be there for decade they be very well known and very trust but they be all on the edge of have to close to stay open pharmacist be use their own saving and not pay themselves a wage i welcome your announcement but would you read a letter from they 
 order there may have be lax obeying of the rule at other time but would the hon lady please refer to the minister as she not you 
 forgive i madam deputy speaker that be an error 
 would the minister read that letter consider these issue and perhaps meet we to talk about it they be good people and we want to keep their pharmacy open 
 i be of course happy to read the letter but i would say that pharmacy offer a significant new boost to community pharmacy 
 my right hon friend will be pleased to hear that across cheshire and merseyside include my eddisbury constituency community pharmacy will be start the pharmacy initiative today particularly in rural area pharmacy be a lifeline for many people can she reassure patient of the clinical competence of pharmacist to make prescription and can she reassure pharmacist on the issue of clinical liability 
 i can assure my hon friend that pharmacist be highly skilled and well train than ever before in this country they be fully equip to meet the demand of their new prescribing role 
 i welcome the pharmacy initiative its roll out be long overdue but what expectation be we create in the mind of patient attend pharmacy will pharmacist be train in deny medication to people who turn up expect to be give a prescription of some sort clearly the initiative will encourage more people to present in order to get medication when it may not be necessary 
 the hon gentleman raise a good point of course pharmacist will be prescribe for common condition plenty of referral will be make to gps and from gps to pharmacist to give patient the accessibility and the appropriate level of assessment for their need 
 pharmacy in horsham have ask for such a scheme so they will very much welcome it as do i. however as the minister be aware from our on discussion for which i be grateful there be currently issue of access to pharmacy in horsham will she ensure that the sector be appropriately resource and have the right training in order to ensure that the scheme be the great success that it deserve to be 
 absolutely and i be always happy to discuss that far with my right hon friend 
 northern ireland ’s minor ailment scheme and this pharmacy initiative be acknowledgment that gps can spend up to of their work day on minor ailment but the scale in northern ireland be different from what have be propose for england be there capacity for a uk wide roll out of pharmacy to take pressure off our gp service if there be that would be the right thing to do 
 i seriously look forward to the re establishment of the stormont assembly so that it will be possible for northern ireland to implement such a scheme itself 
 i warmly welcome the statement i have be a strong champion of pharmacy in my constituency we be experience challenge however when the like of boots withdraw their service it be difficult to transfer or apply for licence despite the fact that we have a number of keen applicant who want to provide important pharmacy service what more can the government do to speed up and make the licensing application procedure smoother and well 
 i would love to hear more about that from my right hon and learn friend i will be happy to look into it 
 in recent month boots have close of pharmacy in the hampton area of my constituency that have leave hampton north which be of the most deprived ward in the london borough of richmond upon thames without a single pharmacy so elderly resident and those with long term condition have to walk for a lot long than minute to access a pharmacy local gps tell i that it be just not viable to set up a community pharmacy facility will the government review the pressure on community pharmacy and consider the community pharmacy contractual framework so that we can make this initiative work and take the pressure off gps 
 as i have already mention there be many community pharmacy start up all the time as well as close down the hon lady will appreciate that the pharmacy initiative be a real boost to community pharmacy i be happy to discuss it with she but i would imagine that there will be the capability to open new community pharmacy in her area 
 i congratulate my right hon friend and her front bench colleague on roll out this initiative the isle of portland have pharmacy both run by boot but be now shut can i meet my right hon friend and front bench colleague to discuss how we can ensure that deprive area such as portland retain the pharmacy that they desperately need 
 i would be very happy to meet my hon friend 
 with so many of my constituent wait a long time to see gps any boost to primary care capacity must be welcome so i thank the minister for today ’s announcement the gps and pharmacy staff i meet raise concern about recruitment to open role what assurance can the minister offer that this will not be another policy like the childcare announcement that lack the workforce or sectoral strategy to really gain the full benefit 
 as the hon gentleman will know our nhs long term workforce plan intend to increase by the number of register pharmacist that work be under way and include increase the number of pharmacy technician 
 it be great that people will be able to go to the pharmacy for their prescription as well as for the product that they need without the need to visit a gp chelmsford have some great community pharmacy but boot be close branch will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how we can ensure that the people of chelmsford will be able to get to a pharmacy in order for the initiative to work 
 i would be very happy to meet my right hon friend 
 the community pharmacy in wem in my constituency have struggle to find a full time pharmacist rely instead on locum that mean that opening time be erratic people can not rely on the service and the pharmacy be loss making because locum be so expensive how will the minister help pharmacy in rural area to recruit the full time pharmacist and reduce their reliance on locum 
 the hon lady will be aware that although a few be own by gp practice community pharmacy be usually private business we be train the registered community pharmacist that we need obviously it would be for that local area to put in place its own recruitment policy but i would be happy to meet she to discuss that far 
 i warmly welcome my right hon friend ’s statement and i put on the record my thank to all the pharmacist who work in my constituency the geography of my constituency can often mean that someone ’s near pharmacy be about a mile and a half away across the water so they end up drive mile around to get to it i believe that the mapping need to change will she meet i to discuss it 
 i be always happy to meet my hon friend just to let she know pharmacy in cornwall be sign up to pharmacy 
 this brilliant announcement have the potential to free up many thousand of gp place in area such as peterborough but the initiative will be the success that we need it to be only if more people know about my right hon friend touch on an awareness campaign but what effort will she make to ensure that it reach difficult to reach community such as those for whom english be an additional language 
 there will be a big communication plan which i be happy to share with my hon friend well over community pharmacy in his area have sign up to pharmacy which be brilliant news it be incumbent on we all and the purpose of the statement to ensure that our constituent know about this excellent new service 
 although my right hon friend and i share a common scepticism of the sclerotic state of the european union there be lesson to be learn from europe i be glad to see that like france we be now respect community pharmacy however i have specific question in her statement she say that thing on which the pharmacy can act be female urinary tract infection why not male 
 i wish my hon friend a happy brexit day i will have to come back to he on that issue the point be that the service be limit to minor urinary tract infection that might be why it do not include man but i will certainly get back to he on that point 
 i and many if not all of my constituent very warmly welcome the statement on integration with other nhs access service if an individual be to dial nhs with of the condition mention in the statement would they be divert to a pharmacy or to a gp 
 to a pharmacy nhs gps and urgent and emergency care can all refer to pharmacist for those particular common condition 
 i join other in welcome the new scheme will my right hon friend ensure as part of the communication that the nhs website be update to show which pharmacy have sign up to pharmacy and will she continue to encourage those that have not yet sign up to do so 
 what be brilliant be that over of all community pharmacy have sign up include in my hon friend ’s area 
 key to the service ’s success will be pharmacy actually offer it when patient turn up do my right hon friend know how many individual pharmacist have be train to provide the service and be there a way of gathering and publish datum on when pharmacy will offer the service so that patient will not have a frustrated journey and we can see where the gap be 
 as i say more than of all community pharmacy have sign up to the service and all their pharmacist have be train in how to deliver it 
 as someone who have champion the role of community pharmacy throughout my time in this house i warmly welcome today ’s statement i be particularly delighted that we be able to host of the pilot scheme in cornwall which be hugely successful result in consultation that take appointment away from gps and a&e appearance will the minister join i in thank all the pharmacy in cornwall that take part in that pilot which be so successful 
 absolutely it be only by try these thing that we can see how successful they can be and i do believe this service be go to radically improve patient access to care 
 with permission i will make a statement on northern ireland executive formation 
 this saturday would mark year without a fully function devolve government in northern ireland that be year without locally elect ministers able to take important decision on northern ireland ’s school and hospital and the broad economy and above all it be year in which northern ireland have be hold back from achieve the massive potential of this unique part of the united kingdom 
 it be nearly year ago that the then minister resign over the old northern ireland protocol the government recognise that the protocol do not deliver to the people of northern ireland the same freedom that leave the european union deliver for the rest of the united kingdom as the party of the union this conservative government have seek to address those concern by replace the protocol with the windsor framework i maintain that the windsor framework be and be a good deal for northern ireland that address the issue around the old protocol and set out a new way forward however it alone do not prove sufficient to allow the devolved institution to function with the cross community support that be such an essential bedrock of the belfast good friday agreement 
 as such for the past few month my team and i have be hold discussion with the northern ireland political party on how we could see the return of devolved institution those discussion have be long and necessarily tough but that be testament to the patience of all northern ireland ’s political leader who as i have see at hand work tirelessly to make sure that northern ireland be the most prosperous and safe society it can be of the people i have be talk to most be   the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson it have be a pleasure to work with he on these matter and it be also a pleasure to confirm recently that the government will support his bill that seek to create a dedicated route for eligible irish national who wish to apply for british citizenship if pass that legislation would support the close historical and geographical tie between ireland and the uk and i commend he on championing that cause
