it be a pleasure to speak on reading it be important when the animal welfare kept animals bill be set aside that a commitment be make to bring legislation forward and this be a key element of it it be a key element of our manifesto commitment that we will fulfil and frankly the other house should stop bleat about this element we will get the other aspect do i myself be take a private member ’s bill through that cover element of the keep animal bill we should not be play tit for tat on this it be about something that really matter the welfare of animal and this be a really important stage 
 the minister have read out a litany of what we have achieve in our time in office the person who can not speak in this debate be my hon friend   the member for west dorset chris loder who take through the animal welfare sentencing act with the support of the government as the chief executive of the rspca say that be a monumental moment for animal welfare legislation empower the court to hand out sentence that more accurately reflect the seriousness of these crime 
 i strongly support the bill i say to the house and to the other house that it be a simple straightforward bill and it could get through by the end of march and be do by easter without question this be not the moment to add other element leave right and centre let we keep it simple and keep our manifesto commitment i hope the house of lords respect the will of this house and i look forward to the bill not come back but become an act before the end of the spring 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent progress he have make on reduce the backlog of asylum application 
 what step he be take to reduce the backlog of asylum application 
 last year we clear the equivalent of legacy claim and process a total of more than claim the large volume in decade the total asylum backlog be now at its low point since december the improvement of process continue and we will continue to review and improve they to accelerate the decision making from hereon in 
 i be grateful to the home secretary for that update but there be still hotel in and around warrington housing asylum seeker will he give we an update on the closing of hotel and will he also tell we what step he be take to speed up the processing of refugee when they be in hotel await the outcome of their claim 
 my hon friend make an important link between the speed of asylum processing and the need for asylum accommodation in various form include hotel we be move away from use hotel as that type of accommodation thus reduce the cost to the public purse and we will maintain recruitment level and improve process so that the speed of processing that we be see now can be continue although i can not make commitment about the specific hotel in my hon friend ’s constituency he should rest assure that we be seek to drive down the number of hotel on which we rely 
 my constituent arrive in the uk month ago and be interview but have be wait for more than a year to receive a final response he be not alone accord to the refugee council   asylum case have be lodge in the last month alone put ever more strain on a broken system the home secretary say that the legacy backlog be go down but what about those more recent case what be be do to deal with they 
 the improved process and the increase number of home office official work on this issue mean that not only the legacy case but the current one will be deal with more quickly which will reduce the need for asylum accommodation of all type i can not comment on individual case because the circumstance be different in each but the hon lady should rest assure that the lesson we have learn about the increase speed of processing will benefit those who be already in the system of course we be also determined to drive down the number of people who come here in the place reduce the pressure on our asylum processing system in do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the shambolic incompetence of this government across every aspect of its disgraceful mismanagement of our country ’s asylum system know no bound but today i will highlight a particularly egregious example we already know that the number of removal of asylum seeker whose claim have be reject have collapse by since labour leave office in but over the weekend it emerge that the home office have lose contact with an astonishing of the people who have be identify for removal to rwanda where on earth be those asylum seeker who have go miss 
 will the home secretary drop all the smoke and mirror and acknowledge that the rwanda plan be just an extortionately expensive and unworkable distraction when will he adopt labour ’s plan to recruit additional immigration enforcement officer to a new return unit so that we can have a system that be base on common sense 
 order 
 thank you mr speaker 
 no it be not thank you i have to get a lot of people in and this be totally unfair the question be very very long and i be cough to get the hon gentleman to stop not to continue that be the signal we need to understand if the hon gentleman do not want a particular back bencher to get in i ask he please to point they out because this be give i that problem 
 the mask have slip the labour party have say that even if the rwanda scheme be to be successful it would not keep it that show what labour member really think about this they have no plan they have no commitment and they have even say that if something be work they would scrap it interruption 
 what step he be take to help reduce level of fraud 
 apology for my hesitation mr speaker i be so busy listen to the heckling opposite that it be difficult to focus on what be go on 
 this question be about something of which we should be very proud the fact be that fraud ruin live but this government have manage to get it down by year on year online and offline it be extremely important that we continue with that ambitious agenda and ensure that we continue to cut fraud so that we can bring it down completely by the end of the parliament 
 would my right hon friend agree that the key to reduce level of fraud be to help people to understand what might be a fraud so that they be not take in by it be there more that we can do to help people to spot the sign and not become a victim in the place 
 the question about what be a fraud be become all too prevalent we have hear of many different kind of fraud come up in many different area which be why in a few week time we will i hope launch a new comms campaign about it the truth be that fraud affect so many people in so many way and we be try to make sure that people know what be go on so they can claim the help and support that they need to make sure that we defeat this pernicious evil 
 we simply do not have the resource or expertise to tackle fraud i have a constituent who be still wait for a charging decision year after be the victim of fraud her retirement have be ruin wait for the police and the crown prosecution service to make the charge decision durham constabulary have a single forensic account do the minister believe as i do that a lack of specialist resource be lead to unacceptable delay in justice 
 i completely understand the hon gentleman ’s point and that be exactly why this government have introduce a new national fraud squad which be now almost fully recruit at and increase the funding available to force to fight fraud some force be do exceptionally well at this already avon be do extremely well and the city of london police be do exceptionally well in lead on fraud nationally 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on recent change to legal migration rule 
 the home office engage with the devolved nation through the inter ministerial group and recognise that each of the nation of the uk have vary immigration need reflect in the varied shortage occupation list for each nation immigration will however remain reserved it be not possible to operate distinct system without effectively create an internal uk migration border system 
 figure from the office for national statistics have reveal that the change to the minimum income threshold for family and skilled worker disproportionately impact scotland median earning on the west coast of scotland be £ a year which be far short even of the climbdown figure of £ do the home secretary even consider that this policy would effectively cut off migration to part of scotland that need and would benefit from inward migration 
 the government ’s position be clear the change that we be introduce be the right thing the number of dependent we be see come be disproportionate there will be an opportunity through the review of the composition of the immigration salary list in the phase and through the call for evidence for exactly those debate to be have and for those view to be make known 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the home office ’s knee jerk policy to raise the threshold and its sudden partial reverse ferret to bring it slightly back down again cause a huge amount of distress to people up and down these island who now do not know what the future hold for they and their family what equality impact assessment have be carry out on the policy which as well as affect scotland will disproportionately affect woman 
 when he announce the change the home secretary make a commitment to lay the information on the project volume in the house library it seem that the hon lady be criticise the government for not take the step that we have take to say clearly that the change will not be apply retrospectively we think that that be the right thing to do and that it have provide reassurance to people ultimately we need to get net migration under control and we think it be a pragmatic and sensible package to take forward 
 that do not answer the question that i put to the minister at all what equality impact assessment have be carry out on this policy what recognition of wage level in scotland have there be in relation to the policy he can not tell i 
 of my constituent tell i that they be worried about their spouse who work as a legal administrator come over from australia also a man be worried about his nephew and partner who will never be able to return from canada if they want to come back to live in scotland and there be many more who be guilty only of fall in love with somebody of what the government consider to be the wrong nationality will the minister apologise to they for the chaos that these policy have cause 
 the position be as i have set out we think the number of people come to the country in this way be not sustainable and that we be take forward a pragmatic balanced package as i have say the measure will not be apply retrospectively so they will not affect exist application that have be lodge 
 what the average length of time be between a theft be report and b contact with the police in the last month 
 the government take domestic burglary very seriously which be why just over a year ago we obtain a commitment from the police to attend every residential burglary that be deliver result and accord to the crime survey residential burglary have fall by year on year 
 i thank the minister for his response in the cost of rural theft in the south west rise by from the year before have the minister make an assessment of the success of the new national rural crime unit in improve police contact with victim of rural theft 
 i agree that combat rural crime be extremely important and the national rural crime unit be design to do exactly that we have also legislate of course and we will implement that legislation to ensure that thing like all terrain vehicle and agricultural equipment have to be mark or fit with an immobiliser overall domestic burglary have fall by since 
 what progress his department have make on implement the government ’s year drug plan from harm to hope publish on december 
 the commitment in the drug strategy be be deliver include invest more than £ in additional treatment capacity to create over extra treatment place we be also enforce hard such as by close down more than county line since 
 local police in and around weston super mare have have notable success in disrupt drug dealing and supply but new dealer quickly take the place of the old one the quantity of drug and the number of addict be not decline do the minister accept that although enforcement and education be vital they be not enough to solve this problem on their own and that the underlie legal framework we use to control these dangerous chemical have to be address too 
 enforcement be important besides close down those county line border force seize about tonne of cocaine in the year end march the large amount seize in a single year on record i have already mention treatment the most important thing be to get people out of their addiction entirely which be why we be invest so much extra money in treatment 
 there be no plan to change the legal framework drug be illegal for a reason they be highly addictive and harmful and the out of control public drug consumption in those jurisdiction that have liberalise significantly such as california san francisco and so on be not something we want to see in this country 
 we be see escalate consumption and movement of drug in northern ireland and the drug be come from england and the republic of ireland what discussion will the minister have with the republic of ireland to ensure that we stop drug cross the border we want to stop they come from england too 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point of course feature of the island of ireland be that there be essentially no border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland and he have allude to the various challenge that pose i would be happy to take up that issue and to see what more we can do to disrupt the supply of drug north south and east west i thank he for raise the issue 
 what recent progress he have make on end the use of hotel for asylum seeker 
 what recent progress he have make on end the use of hotel for asylum seeker 
 what recent progress he have make on end the use of hotel for asylum seeker 
 what recent progress he have make on end the use of hotel for asylum seeker 
 what recent progress he have make on end the use of hotel for asylum seeker 
 we be make significant progress on closing hotel with due to be close by the end of january and more in the come month we be also work to move asylum seeker into alternative cheap accommodation and have successfully clear the legacy backlog by decide more than case while maintain the integrity of the system 
 last year after the police the fire service and i raise concern the home office close the oyo hotel in earl shilton however leicestershire still have asylum hotel open include just over the constituency border in appleby magna for example and my constituent be concern will the minister set out a timeline for when the hotel may close or more likely will he set out how the least suitable hotel will be close so that as the backlog be deal with the closing of hotel fall in line too 
 as i set out we be make good progress i hear call from colleague from throughout the house for closure in their constituency we need to stick the course on deliver that take into account a number of factor include the ease of exit the speed of exit the fact that notice period come into play and crucially value for money which the taxpayer would rightly expect 
 in welcome my hon friend to his new position may i urge he finally to make good on his predecessor ’s promise to close the temporary accommodation centre in my constituency and restore the hotel back to their intended purpose will he also work with his colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities to ensure that the local link rule relate to social housing be amend to prevent erewash from be disproportionately burden by new application once resident be award asylum 
 i hear my hon friend ’s call for the specific hotel in her constituency to be close she can be reassure that we will continue to work closely on this issue with colleague from across government to get it right and make sure that we can exit hotel as quickly as possible 
 i thank my hon friend for his early answer as he know i receive official notification today that newton park hotel which be a star hotel in my constituency before it be take over entirely for use by asylum seeker be to have the contract end at the end of february that be an enormous relief to those in those in the small village there and to those in other village that the important v3 bus route go through i thank he for keep to the word of his predecessor that the hotel use for asylum seeker would end in the tranche of closure 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the representation she make on this issue the situation in her constituency demonstrate that the government ’s plan be work and we be see hotel exit happen that be a direct consequence of get on and make decision bring forward alternative accommodation and also crucially reduce in flow into the system in the place 
 i welcome the progress that have be make on tackle illegal small boat crossing which have mean it have be possible to end the use of the north stafford hotel in stoke on trent do my hon friend agree that it be only through the most unequivocable legislation on rwanda that we can deliver proper deterrence that will mean that number will come down far 
 the point that my hon friend make get to the nub of the issue of the most important factor in sustain the progress we have make be reduce the number of in flow into the uk particularly via small boat crossing of the channel that be why my message to the house be clear if member want to see hotel close and the progress sustain they need to be in the lobby to support the bill this week 
 my constituent and i be delighted at the end of last year to see the end of the ibis hotel in bramley be use to house illegal immigrant and its return to normal service will the minister reassure i that any forthcoming immigration legislation pass in this house will make sure that this situation will never happen again by ban the use of hotel outright and make sure that illegal immigrant be send to rwanda for processing 
 as i have say the key principle behind the bill be to help we to bring to an end the egregious crossing of the channel organise by evil   criminal gang it will help we to ensure that there be great control of our border and that there be not these in flow into the system which have undoubtedly have the consequence of our need to respond to that challenge through the opening of hotel that be precisely what we be try to put a stop to 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last week the times report that there be hotel bed go unused at a cost of £ a day that be in addition to the buffer of empty bed hold as a contingency in case of manston be overwhelmed be those figure actually correct 
 the right hon lady will recognise that it be of course important for there to be a buffer to make sure that operationally we have the bed space require in a contingency situation to be able to respond to any surge and particular challenge that be a difficult area but that we be look at carefully within the hotel estate we be of course maximise the use of bed space wherever possible which again help we to get on and close the hotel in a way that i think she would like to see 
 the downside of the volume of asylum application be grant be the pressure that that be put on the local authority homeless section will the minister have another look at the time give to asylum seeker from the date on which their application be accept to the date on which they have to move out of home office accommodation will he consider the issue of day versus day which be the recognise limit under the homelessness reduction act otherwise all we be go to do be transfer people from home office fund hotel to local authority fund one with all the extra pressure of financial problem that that create for local authority 
 on the date we be work with local authority to give they as early visibility as possible about the anticipated number of people with decision that have be grant that they should expect to see that help to forward plan and we be mindful of those point as thing stand there be no intention to change that day period clearly plan and work with local authority be critical but in many case people have more than day within which to vacate 
 oldham have a proud history of support the persecute as of march last year our town be home to asylum seeker of whom be in hotel accommodation but there the housing crisis meet the homelessness crisis people in temporary accommodation include child be it not time that the government review the dispersal policy to ensure that every part of england play its fair share i gently point out that braintree be home to just asylum seeker as oppose to oldham ’s 
 i can reassure the hon gentleman that i and my official be carefully consider what more can be do to ensure that there be equitability in   the approach to dispersal that be critical and we need to work carefully through some of the pressure and challenge that these issue present but i gently say to those on the opposition benches that a key part of the response be to get the flow into the system down and they do not have a credible plan for do that 
 there be currently asylum seeker in hotel the prime minister promise to close those hotel some time last year but since then the figure have go up by can the minister confirm that that figure be correct 
 i be clear in my mind that the figure that the hon gentleman have cite and that the shadow home secretary use last week do not represent the picture as it stand today they will recognise that there be periodic reporting on statistical release but the figure they cite be not representative of the position on the ground today 
 what step he be take to reduce legal migration 
 what step he be take to reduce net migration 
 what step he be take to reduce net migration 
 on   december i announce a new package of measure to far reduce legal net migration include limitation on family dependant be bring in by worker and student create a salary threshold and raise the minimum income requirement progressively over the next few year 
 my right hon friend will know that the net migration figure of over be completely unsustainable be it to continue that would represent the creation of new parliamentary constituency each year what co operation do his department have with the public service that have to meet the demand from the newcomer 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we must be conscious of the impact of the level of net migration on local population and local authority we recognise that the figure be too high and we be take action to bring it down we work closely with other government departments to deliver on that but while opposition front benchers criticise the headline figure they also oppose every single step we take to bring that figure down 
 i commend my right hon friend the home secretary and my hon friend the minister for legal migration and the border for all their work towards deliver on our manifesto commitment to reduce net migration my constituent be now look for the result of all their hard work will the home   secretary outline how his new legal migration package will make the most of our post brexit point base immigration system 
 this country have always have a global outlook the ethnic composition of the government at the most senior level be a direct reflection of our global connectivity and those human bridge across the world we want to ensure this country be able to benefit from the expertise knowledge and work of the bright and good from around the whole world in a manner that be control fair predictable and well enforce 
 it be good that the government want to ensure that the bright and good can continue to come to the uk to study but do my right hon friend recognise that the change to the family dependant rule for student risk cause enormous damage to some of our elite business school which compete in the global marketplace for experienced outstanding professional what work be he do with the sector to try to overcome some of those challenge 
 my right hon friend be right to highlight the fact that we be in a globally competitive environment when it come to this country ’s quality high education postgraduate offer i have no doubt that we be still highly competitive we will continue to work with the university sector on this and ensure that the people we bring to the uk be here to study and add value and that no institution in our high education sector mistake its role they be educator not a back door visa system 
 i beg the home secretary to spread those more enlighten view to some of his colleague migration should not be a dirty word i be the son of a migrant i migrate myself to the united states at stage my dna tell i that i be irish and swedish can every member of this parliament have their dna publish so that we can bring some sense to this discussion about migration 
 i be not sure that the government be able to compel such widespread disclosure perhaps the independent parliamentary standards authority might have a view on such thing both side of my family be of immigrant stock my mother come to the uk in the 1960 and my father ’s family in this country have benefit from control immigration in a fair system where people who play by the rule be reward and we say no to those who refuse to play by the rule 
 i be a legal migrant too bath have a vibrant hospitality industry that cater for local people and tourist from all over the world but many of our hotel restaurant bar and pub be already struggle to find enough staff or be under threat of reduce work hour and closure how will the home secretary ensure that the propose new salary threshold and measure to reduce legal migration do not worsen those staff shortage 
 we liaise very closely with other government departments to ensure that our system which be transparent and fair also support the british economy we work particularly closely with the department   for work and pensions to ensure that those who have talent and ambition but who for whatever reason be currently unable to fully engage in the job market be enable to do so i myself have a background in the hospitality industry and we want that industry to continue to thrive it be not the case that we should automatically rely on overseas labour for that we can have home grow talent as well 
 the home secretary talk about people come to uk university to study many people also come to our university to carry out ground break and economically important research and they be worried about the rise in the minimum income threshold because that mean they will be unable to bring their family with they what assessment have he make of the impact of the new change on our university important research work 
 we recognise the contribution of the international pool of talent indeed when i be foreign secretary i sign up to a deal with india for talented postgraduate to exchange experience in our respective country we will always look to support the genuine draw on talent but we will also ensure that the high education system be not use as a back door mean of immigration the system be about research and education not a back door mean of get permanent residence in this country 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of neighbourhood policing level 
 give the police the resource they need to police local community and fight crime remain a government priority we have deliver on our commitment to recruit additional police officer indeed we have surpass that decision about how they be deploy be of course a matter for discussion between chief constable police and crime commissioner and mayor who be responsible for their local community 
 the legacy of government cut have leave police force across england and wales with a £ cash shortfall and officer have now be take away from frontline policing duty in order to fill the role of former police staff can the home secretary start to acknowledge the effect of tory cut how will he rectify that and get more frontline police back into our neighbourhood across the united kingdom 
 as i say decision on how a police force balance its important back office role and frontline policing role be rightly decision for the chief constable we have give additional resource and we have deliver on our commitment to have more police officer of course we be look at police funding formula to ensure that they remain well resource but there be more than in fact additional police officer in england and wales that will ensure that there be more police on the frontline 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore   say to this day we be feel the devastating impact of the tories decision to cut police officer minister such as the home secretary seem to expect credit for desperately try to reverse it but the national police chiefs council be right that the effort at reversal have moor warrant officer in role traditionally fill by civilian again we have hear from the home secretary that we have never have it so good but there be still few neighbourhood police why will the government not match our commitment to get more police officer and police community support officer out on the beat 
 unless labour have a plan for pay for those figure it be just empty rhetoric the simple truth be that there be record number of officer in police force across the country include essex police which i visit this morning it have never have more police officer than it have currently it be right that chief constable decide how to deploy those police officer again unless we hear a plan to pay for those additional officer i will not trust labour ’s figure 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of propose change to visa income threshold on the university sector 
 we have be mindful of the need to balance the impact on individual sector with economic growth and the need of the labour market with the need to reduce level of immigration as part of our policy development we undertake analytical work across government that support our decision a regulatory impact assessment will be develop in due course 
 the director of universities scotland alastair sim have express concern that change to the government ’s visa income threshold could affect university ability to attract global talent international student and academic make a contribution in excess of £ annually to the scottish economy if the government recognise the contribution of international student and academic as they say they do why be they introduce a policy that threaten to prevent future cohort of they from make a similar contribution 
 individual will still be able to make a valid contribution in the year ahead but in a sustainable and manage way there be no immediate plan to introduce further exemption to the increase salary threshold but the salary discount remain in place we will continue to engage as the measure be introduce there be also opportunity domestically for recruitment at every opportunity we should be try to support domestic recruitment wherever we can 
 what progress his department have make on review the police funding formula 
 work to update the funding formula be continue and i will update the house as soon as i can the house should be aware that next year police and crime commissioner fund frontline police will see their budget increase by up to £ which be an increase of about 
 there be cross party agreement that the current funding formula be unfair for police in bedfordshire with the conservatives own pcc acknowledge that there be simply no meat leave on the bone for local police my constituent be feed up with be tell that they have never have it so good or be fob off with off grant will the minister commit to a date to finally deliver a fair funding formula for my community 
 what i will commit to as far as the people of bedfordshire be concern be an increase in funding of £ for next year that be an extra compare with this year they will also have police officer that be about more than bedfordshire ’s police force have ever have at any time in its history 
 it be not unusual to hear from bedfordshire mp when it come to the police funding formula because this go all the way back to the last labour government but there be a cross party view in bedfordshire that our police force be underfunded will my right hon friend agree to meet all bedfordshire mp so that we can press the case for increase in funding for bedfordshire police 
 i be always happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these issue as i say bedfordshire police will receive an extra £ next year an increase of about 6.5%—which i be sure will be welcome up and down the county but i be of course happy to meet my hon friend whenever he would like 
 i presume that be all of they be it minister i call the shadow minister 
 police force be not be listen to when they raise serious concern about the funding formula and how it limit their ability to tackle town centre crime the british retail consortium report that more than act of violence or abuse against shop worker happen every single day everyone have a right to feel safe at work so when will the home secretary accept that retail crime be out of control and accept labour ’s plan to introduce a new law to protect retail worker from violence and actually stand up for shop worker 
 theft offence be down by since of course those be the crime survey figure but we have recently launch a retail crime action plan where police be commit to prioritise attendance at incident of retail crime and always follow reasonable line of inquiry in relation to shoplifting assault against shop worker and other form of offend in addition we legislate in the police crime sentencing and courts act 
 order i call selaine saxby 
 what recent progress his department have make on reduce neighbourhood crime 
 what recent progress his department have make on reduce neighbourhood crime 
 this government recognise the impact of neighbourhood crime it be the crime that most affect people ’s confidence the confidence of individual business and community the strategic response to this be evidence base and target and get police right in this area be incredibly important for maintain community confidence 
 i have see for myself how successful the government ’s safe street fund be in barnstaple and i be delighted that it will be extend into ilfracombe this year will my right hon friend ensure that council have the funding to help support those scheme 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight that point i be proud of the fact that since neighbourhood crime be down by because of the kind of intervention that she highlight i reassure she that we will continue to look at what work to fund and support and to make every effort to drive down neighbourhood crime even far 
 police number across devon and cornwall be at record level and deserve our praise in a recent survey my constituent in east devon say that tackle neighbourhood crime be an absolute priority as range from burglary to theft from vehicle will my right hon friend outline what progress this conservative government have make on crack down on neighbourhood crime 
 i be very pleased that my hon friend ’s local community be feel the positive impact of the decision we have make since come into government we have see serious violence reduce by and neighbourhood crime down by since the start of this parliament we have see a reduction in domestic burglary an reduction in vehicle relate theft and a decrease in robbery we have reduce homicide by have take action on drug and be commit to 
 order secretary of state i say the same to the minister please you be very slow at the beginning you will not be slow at the end i be sure 
 on friday i visit co op store and every of they have daily experience of theft with lose £ worth of good over month and staff experience assault in light of labour ’s pledge to introduce more community police and a law on retail crime what be the secretary of state really do clearly his plan be not work 
 we have a retail crime action plan we have ensure that assault against shop worker be an aggravate factor and we have make it clear to police force across the country that we expect they to take action on neighbourhood crime like that and to pursue every reasonable line of inquiry we be determined to drive down retail crime 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the safe street fund on the safety of woman and girl 
 the objective of the safe street fund and the safety of woman at night fund be to enhance public safety in a direct and targeted way neighbourhood by neighbourhood since the government have invest £ across the fund and the evaluation of round of the safe street fund publish in january last year show that the investment be boost trust in the police and make community feel safe 
 do the minister justify the government cut of of the funding for project to reduce violence against woman and girl in merseyside they have cut £ and project will have to cease 
 what i can tell the hon lady be that under the safe street fund £ have be allocate to merseyside include for a project in st helens town centre let i remind she very gently of what that be fund it have go towards lighting signage and improvement to taxi rank and of the most radical measure of all be that it provide woman with a free taxi service home where the safe street fund will reimburse the taxi driver the money they would otherwise have receive so that a woman do not have to find herself stand at a windy bus stop or walk home 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we welcome the safe street fund which will go some way to support the night time economy that have be badly hit over year the government ’s effort to tackle spike have be completely undermine by the home secretary spike be a serious and devastating offence why do the home secretary think it be appropriate to joke about spike his own wife and can he confirm exactly how many drop of rohypnol he consider to be illegal 
 i thank the hon lady for her question i think it have be widely report that the home secretary be make a joke about not be good enough for his wife the point be that we be the government who have do something about spike it be not a new offence and the measure to change the statutory provision in the offences against the person act could have be take by the last labour government the reason we have seek to clarify the matter in law be that we do not think that enough victim be come forward and the reason there be not enough prosecution be the time lag in get effective toxicology report that be why we be invest   so much money in rapid drink testing kit so that hopefully we will be able to get the test do on site on the night and get more of those offender behind bar 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this year the home office will continue to build on our progress on the public priority a fall in small boat crossing last year arrest of small boat pilot arrest of people smuggler the big ever international operation result in boat seizure and outboard motor be seize the illegal migration package announce more than county line drug line smash and the introduction of the criminal justice bill to give police leader more power we be relentlessly focus on deliver community safety on behalf of the british people 
 now that we have the home secretary here to answer for himself can he tell we whether he be aware that the police be receive more than report of spike every month and in december the home office say that the reason the crime be so prevalent be that it be see as funny and a joke how can we have any confidence in the home secretary to deliver action on spike when he think it be a joke 
 i be the home secretary who have actually introduce action on this in my week in the job i visit holborn police station to see the work of the metropolitan police in tackle violence against woman and girl i make it clear to the home office that my priority be the protection of woman and girl i be take action on this issue and i be absolutely determined to continue do so 
 i be sure the home secretary would agree that anti extremism training in departments be extremely important what more can the government do to ensure that it be training to tackle extremism rather than anti government and party bias training 
 my hon friend will have see recently a pretty extraordinary report on allegation about extremism and the failure to train properly and what be go on in university around the united kingdom in recent problematic case it be say that it be very hard to define what a terrorist be we know what a terrorist be the law know what a terrorist be and this government know what a terrorist be and that be exactly why we have just proscribe hizb ut tahrir 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 we welcome the proscription of hizb ut tahrir 
 more life be tragically lose in the channel this weekend as criminal gang profit from those dangerous boat crossing it show how vital it be to stop they but we need the home office to have a grip the home   secretary give no answer early on the people he have lose from the rwanda list can he tell we if he have also lose the people he have remove from the asylum backlog how many of they be still in the country 
 i join the right hon lady in express sadness and condolence for those who lose their life in the channel that reinforce the importance of break the people smuggle gang the fact be that we be drive down the number of people in the backlog we be process application more quickly and ensure that decision be make so that those who should not be in this country can be remove either to their own country or a safe country that be why the rwanda bill be so important and why we will continue work on these issue 
 return have drop since the last labour government the home secretary be still not tell we where those miss people be he appear to have lose thousand of people who may have no right to be in the country and lose any grip at all in the ongoing tory asylum chaos we have cabinet ministers countless ex ministers and the deputy tory chair all say that they will oppose the home secretary ’s policy this week a policy that we know he and the prime minister do not even believe in if the deputy tory chair this week vote against the home secretary ’s policy will he be sack or be the prime minister so weak that he have lose control of asylum lose control of our border and lose control of his own party too 
 conservative members of parliament be absolutely united in our desire to get a grip of this issue i be not the person who have hold up a sign say refugee welcome i be not the person whose colleague oppose each and every rhetorical flourish until the labour party come up with a credible plan i will not take its criticism any more seriously than it deserve 
 the british people welcome people who come to this country to work and contribute to our economy but those who abuse our hospitality commit violent offence and be then send to prison need to be deport at the end of their sentence will my right hon and learn friend update the house on how many be deport last year and what action he will take to ensure that foreign national who be violent offender be automatically deport when they leave prison 
 we be clear that foreign criminal should be deport wherever possible and we will continue to do so in stark contrast to the call to stop the deportation of foreign national criminal from the leader of the opposition and the labour party my hon friend will be pleased to know that foreign national offender return have increase by in the last month 
 my constituent often have to wait month to elicit a response for their asylum or home office query give the conservative government ’s persistent failure to effectively manage the asylum system result in a backlog of almost case and the excessive use   of expensive hotel do the home secretary not feel that now be the time to adopt labour ’s comprehensive plan which would end the use of expensive hotel within month and significantly reduce the backlog 
 i think the hon gentleman mean labour ’s non existent plan the fact be that last year we make initial decision if the hon gentleman have specific case that he wish to raise with i as the minister i be very happy to have a look at those but the productivity improvement that we see last year carry through a lot of learning as we now get on and deal with the backlog a lot of positive work have go on and he should recognise that point 
 humber side police now have over more officer than in which obviously enable it to provide a well service to my constituent crucially it also have top class leadership currently provide by jonathan evison the police commissioner and until recently by lee freeman the former chief constable i be sure his successor will also provide that leadership do the minister agree that top class leadership be important and what be he do to ensure improvement be make to the present leadership training scheme 
 i join my hon friend in commend humberside police force on the progress it have make particularly under recent chief constable lee freeman in term of improve leadership of course lee freeman be now of his majesty ’s inspector and he can apply what he learn and put into practice in humberside across the whole country 
 on october the government pledge in the house to make change to the afghan citizen resettlement scheme pathway and when can the house expect an update and a plan 
 of course we be continue to work very collaboratively across government on the response to the situation in afghanistan fulfil the commitment we make to provide that sanctuary in the way that we all want to see we will say more about those effort as soon as we be able 
 we hear early about the effectiveness of the safe street fund falmouth in my constituency where most of the student live recently receive £ in addition our brilliant police and crime commissioner alison hernandez have be work with dawn dines who help to successfully change the law on spike can my hon friend demonstrate to my truro and falmouth constituent how those positive change will improve conviction rate in the devon and cornwall area 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and congratulate her police and crime commissioner on the excellent work she be do my hon friend will be aware that we have amend the offences against the person act so that the offence of spike be capture   specifically and comprehensively in law in part because we want more victim to come forward but we be tell time and again by the police that the most significant barrier to conviction be the length of time between the offence take place and a toxicology report be receive we be therefore invest in rapid drink testing research and we hope to bring testing capacity on site 
 ukhospitality estimate that of skilled worker visa that be gain last year would be lose under the new regulation that be a vital sector for my local economy in edinburgh and for scotland so when will the government recognise that the revision to the salary level be not sufficient and bring it down to a reasonable level 
 i disagree with the hon lady ’s interpretation of the situation we should be work in a collaborative cross government way particularly to support domestic employment wherever possible comprehensive step be be take through the back to work plan to help deliver on that and there be many people here on other route who be perfectly able to work and with the right support would be do so that be precisely where we be go to focus our effort 
 what step be my right hon friend take to provide advice to police force across the country to help they support community during the ongoing conflict between israel and hamas 
 my hon friend be right to ask that question because sadly we have see an absolutely vile upsurge in antisemitism on our street we have see people who claim to be speak out for equality and justice actually defend people who take slave who violate woman ’s and girl right and who here in our own country make the jewish community feel uncomfortable that be exactly why this government have commit £ to the community security trust very sadly we have also have to commit £ to academic security because there have also be a massive increase in antisemitism in university we be combat all of that 
 how many time must a demonstration in the same cause be repeat week in and week out before the well fund organiser become liable to pay for at least part of the police cost 
 of course we recognise that there be legitimacy to public protest we also recognise that the unprecedented and unwarranted pressure that this be    put on police around the country be have an impact on community my view be that the organiser have make their point and repeat it do not strengthen their argument unfortunately we be also see some deeply distasteful people weave themselves in among those protester who be protest on issue that they feel passionately about but whose good will be be abuse by other 
 will the home secretary urgently meet his hon friend and constituency neighbour   the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin   and i to speak about why it be that although the whole house pass the public order act with an amendment to ensure safe access zone for woman use abortion clinic this be now subject to a consultation that would gut the legislation can he meet we urgently the consultation be due to end on   january and it would not actually do what all mps in this house vote for 
 if the hon lady write to i on this issue i will endeavour to find out the detail of the point she have make 
 rise 
 final question tim loughton 
 last week the home secretary produce a report on safe and legal route to comply with section of the illegal migration act and the amendment i table last year it be very long and generous on the exist legal route but can he tell i how my year old orphan from an east african country with link to the uk who be a genuine asylum seeker will be help to come legally and safely to the uk by what the government have publish so far 
 my hon friend be a very passionate advocate on this issue and we have a conversation last week about this very point the fact be that since we have welcome over half a people through our safe and legal route we be introduce the cap precisely because we want to see that generosity extend in the year ahead but the pressure of illegal migration in particular make that very challenging and difficult this be precisely the sort of issue i want to study with he as we move forward with the cap to make sure that we continue to help the most vulnerable people from around the world work particularly with the united nations high commissioner for refugees and other 
 i would like to update the house on the action that we take on thursday night against houthi military target in yemen 
 since   november iran back houthis have launch over illegal and unacceptable attack on commercial shipping in the red sea and on   january   they mount a direct attack against british and american warship they fire on our ship and our sailor it be the big attack on the royal navy for decade and so we act we do so in self defence consistent with the un charter and to uphold freedom of navigation as britain have always do 
 alongside the united states with support from australia bahrain canada and the netherlands we order the raf to strike houthi military facility in yemen i want to be clear that these be limited strike they be carefully target at launch site for drone and ballistic missile to degrade the houthis capacity to make further attack on international shipping i can tell the house today that our initial assessment be that all plan target be destroy at the drone and cruise missile base in bani building be successfully hit a further building be hit at abbs airfield along with a cruise missile launcher catch in the open we have see no evidence thus far of civilian casualty which we take great care to avoid i know the whole house will join i in pay tribute to the incredible bravery and professionalism of all our servicemen and woman 
 the need to maximise the security and effectiveness of the operation mean that it be not possible to bring this matter to the house in advance but we take care to brief member include of course you mr speaker and the leader of the opposition before the strike take place and i have come to the house at the early possible opportunity i do not take decision on the use of force lightly that be why i stress that this action be take in self defence it be limited not escalatory it be a necessary and proportionate response to a direct threat to uk vessel and therefore to the uk itself 
 let i be absolutely clear why the royal navy be in the red sea it be there as part of operation prosperity guardian protect freedom of navigation as a fundamental tenet of international law the houthis attack on international shipping have put innocent life at risk they have hold crew hostage for almost month and they be cause grow economic disruption global commerce can not operate under such condition container and tanker be have to take a mile detour around the cape of good hope that push up price and imperil the passage of good food and medicine that the british people and other rely on 
 we have attempt to resolve this through diplomacy after numerous international call for the attack to stop a coalition of country give the houthis a clear and unambiguous warning week ago last week the un security council pass a resolution condemn the attack and highlight the right of nation to defend their vessel and preserve freedom of navigation yet the houthis continue on their reckless path 
 we should not fall for the houthis malign narrative that this be about israel and gaza they target ship from around the world we continue to work towards a sustainable ceasefire in gaza and to get more aid to civilian we also continue to support a negotiate settlement in yemen ’s civil war but i want to be very clear that this action be completely unrelated to those issue it be a direct response to the houthis attack on international shipping we should also recognise the risk of inaction it would weaken international security and the rule of law further damage freedom of navigation and the global economy and send a dangerous message that british vessel and british interest be fair game 
 there be another point here which be often overlook the houthis attack risk worsen the dire humanitarian situation in yemen itself the uk help to feed around yemenis every month with aid arrive via the very sea route that the houthis have in their sight the threat to shipping must cease illegally detain vessel and crew must be release and we remain prepared to back our word with action 
 but deal with that threat do not detract from our other international commitment rather it strengthen our determination to uphold fundamental un principle if our adversary think they can distract we from help ukraine by threaten international security elsewhere they could not be more wrong on friday i travel to kyiv to meet president zelensky and address the ukrainian parliament i take a message from this house to the rada that we will stand with ukraine today tomorrow and for as long as it take if putin win in ukraine he will not stop there and other malign actor will be embolden that be why ukraine ’s security be our security that be why the uk will stay the course and it be why i be confident that our partner share our resolve 
 far from our resolve faltering our military support to ukraine will increase this year we will provide the big single package of defence aid to ukraine since the war begin worth £ that will include more air defence equipment more anti tank weapon more long range missile thousand more round of ammunition and artillery shell training for thousand more ukrainian serviceman and woman and the single large package of advanced drone give to ukraine by any nation all of that be on top of what we have already provide to support ukraine 
 in total since the war begin the united kingdom will have provide almost £ of aid to ukraine we be the to train ukrainian troop the in europe to provide lethal weapon the to commit main battle tank the to provide long range missile and now we be the to keep the promise make at last year ’s nato summit alongside other country to provide new bilateral security commitment ukraine ’s rightful place be in nato and nato will be strong with ukraine in it but these commitment will help bridge the gap until that day come 
 under the new agreement that we sign with president zelensky we be build ukraine ’s military capability and if russia ever invade ukraine again we will provide swift and sustained assistance include modern equipment across land air and sea together with our ally the uk will be there from the moment until the last for all of this i bring a message of thank from president zelensky to the british people today i hope   that the house will join i in send a message back to the ukrainian people that we stand together as in support of these firm commitment hon member hear hear 
 we be build a new partnership with ukraine design to last year or more yes it be about defence and security but it be also about trade investment culture and more there could be no more powerful sign of our unique bond than ukraine ’s decision to adopt english as the language of business and diplomacy so through the british council we be go to fund english language training for the ukrainian people 
 in dangerous time we be invest in defence harden our critical infrastructure and build our alliance we be resolute in our principle international security the rule of law and freedom to determine your own future an attack on those principle be an attack on everything that we believe in and on which our life and livelihood depend as the home of parliamentary democracy and a leader in collective security it be our responsibility to defend those principle and to defend our people that be who we be that be what britain do and will always do i commend this statement to the house 
 we come to the leader of the opposition 
 may i thank the prime minister for the secure briefing last week and for an advance copy of his statement let i reiterate that labour back this target action to reinforce maritime security in the red sea we strongly condemn the houthi attack which be target commercial ship of all nationality put civilian and military personnel include british force in serious danger the houthi attack be unacceptable and illegal and if leave unaddresse could lead to a devastating rise in the cost of essential food in some of the poor country 
 the international community clearly stand against the houthi attack alongside the uk and the us other country be involve in non operational support over a dozen nation be part of the maritime protection force in the red sea and many other support the recent un security council resolution which condemn the houthi attack in the strong possible term the uk strike be limited and target and do everything possible to protect civilian life that be a proportionate response 
 military action must of course always be underpin by a clear strategy and it be the role of this house to ask the right question so i ask the prime minister what confidence do he have that his stated objective have be meet what process will he follow in the face of continue houthi attack what effort be under way to maintain the support of the international community will he confirm that he stand by the parliamentary convention that where possible military intervention by the uk government particularly if they be part of a sustained campaign should be bring before the house scrutiny be not the enemy of strategy 
 while we back the action take last week these strike still do bring risk and we must avoid escalation across the middle east will the prime minister tell we   how the uk will work with international partner so that our rightful action be not use as an excuse by those who seek to expand violence throughout the wide region or indeed reanimate the conflict in yemen 
 none the less our armed force across the region be show the high professionalism and bravery both in defend commercial shipping and in this target action we thank they we be proud of they they continue to show that britain be a force for good as do the uk ’s unwavere unity in support of ukraine and against russian aggression 
 on the labour benches we have back all military support for ukraine so again we back the prime minister ’s announcement of £ for ukraine next year and we strongly support the agreement on security co operation which will give ukraine vital confidence to plan for the year ahead i hope that it become a template for other ally to follow and that in time ukraine will become a full member of nato to those listen in kyiv moscow or elsewhere in the world let i be clear whoever be in government in britain the uk will stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 return to the middle east it be now over day since the brutal event of   october israel ’s right to self defence be fundamental as be its duty to comply with international law the long the conflict in gaza rage the great the risk of escalation throughout the entire region on the israel lebanon border we must urge constraint we must make it crystal clear to all party that the uk do not support this conflict extend far in lebanon 
 within israel and palestine in the west bank settler violence must stop immediately and in gaza we need a humanitarian truce now not as a short pause but as the step on a road away from violence the need for a sustainable ceasefire be clear to stop the killing of innocent civilian to create the space for the return of all the hostage and to provide urgent humanitarian relief to protect against disease and ward off a devastating famine from that step we can begin a big push towards peace a permanent end to the fighting and a last political solution the hope of a state solution be fragile but it be still there and we must fight for it just as we must remain resolute in the face of aggression that threaten global security whether in europe or in the red sea 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for his support for the action that we have take he be absolutely right to highlight the international coalition that over recent week have call out the houthis behaviour culminate in the un security council resolution strongly condemn the attack which he rightly reference our stated aim be to degrade and disrupt the houthis capability to launch attack on civilian shipping as i indicate our initial assessment be that our strike have be successful in the specific target that be select obviously that be an initial assessment but that remain our case at the moment 
 more generally we want a reduction of tension in the region and a restoration of stability that be our stated aim it be incumbent on the houthis not to escalate and not to continue what be illegal and unprovoked attack on civilian shipping that put innocent life at risk and damage the global economy and the price that   british citizen and other pay for their everyday good as the right hon and learn gentleman rightly point out 
 i assure the right hon and learn gentleman that it be necessary to strike at speed as he acknowledge to protect the security of the operation that be in accordance with the convention i remain committed to that convention and would always look to follow appropriate process and procedure and act in line with precedent he will know that there be strike in and when a similar process be follow 
 i also provide the right hon and learn gentleman with the assurance that he rightly ask for about our international engagement because there will be malign force out there that seek to distort our action and to turn it into something that it be not it be important that we engage with our ally and other in the region so that they understand what we do and why i provide he with the assurance that we have do that and will continue to do that because it be important that there be no linkage between these action and anything else that be happen this be purely and simply to respond in self defence to illegal attack by the houthis on commercial shipping 
 i welcome the right hon and learn gentleman ’s support for the announcement we make with regard to ukraine he be right to point out the importance of the security commitment we sign country at the vilnius summit promise to do so this house should be proud that the united kingdom be again lead by be the country to sign such a commitment which i believe will serve as a template for other to follow i can tell he of the enormous appreciation in ukraine for the uk do that so that there be long term certainty for the ukrainian people of our support as well as further deterrence to russia and other against future aggression 
 in conclusion the confluence of these event over the same hour serve to highlight the increase threat we face as a country the global environment be become more challenging and more unstable it be incumbent on we to respond to those challenge with increase investment in defence as we be do and by strengthen our alliance because ultimately we must defend the principle of international law freedom and democracy and freedom of navigation that we all hold dear this government will always stand ready to do that and to protect the british people 
 the prime minister be clearly absolutely justified to respond as he do particularly after the direct attack against hms diamond but give that at the time of the falklands campaign we have frigate and destroyer and be spend of gdp on defence whereas both those figure can be cut in half to describe our situation today do he agree that we certainly should not be reduce the number of frigate or destroyer and that we certainly should not be mothball or otherwise decommissioning our amphibious assault ship 
 i be happy to reassure my right hon friend that our intention be to increase defence spending from where it currently be up to when circumstance allow it be worth remind the house   that we have consistently over the past decade be the large spender on defence in nato large than other country combine our plan will continue to provide that leadership 
 within that there be a very strong equipment plan underpin by the £ extra that the ministry of defence receive in its most recent settlement which for the royal navy include type type and type frigate with regard to the specific vessel my right hon friend talk about the defence secretary have ask the sea lord to plan how the royal marines excellent work can be take forward so that they have the capability they need to continue their work and the ability to be deploy globally when that process conclude the defence secretary will of course update the house 
 i call the snp leader 
 i would like to begin by echo the prime minister ’s sentiment in relation to ukraine all of we on the snp benches remain firmly unite behind its struggle against vladimir putin ’s russia 
 when sir walter scott write that in war both side lose i be not quite sure he have factor into the equation the like of the houthis because they be of course the fundamentalist ’s fundamentalist unperturbed by be on the receive end of saudi arabia ’s bombing for many year they be the perceive wisdom would suggest not just content but perhaps even quite happy to be on the receive end of american bomb 
 that context pose an enormous question for all of we in this house as to what come next if as have be suggest by the houthis action over the course of the last hour or so the message that we seek to send have not be receive what do we intend to do what be the plan what be the prime minister ’s strategy will he come to the dispatch box and unlike his predecessor in relation to middle east conflict in iraq afghanistan and syria lie out when and how far he be willing to go in relation to military action clearly we need to understand his government ’s strategy in this conflict because we can not have an escalation that lead to further regional instability while we would all agree quite rightly that we should not fall for the houthis narrative that this be directly relate to the conflict in israel and gaza we can not escape the fact that a ceasefire in gaza be essential for that wide regional stability 
 let i finally say that although the prime minister have seek to defend his decision not to come to the house last week it be clear that the house should have be recall it be what the public would have expect and i urge he to do well in future 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment about ukraine and his support for our approach 
 obviously i will not speculate on future action what we conduct be intend as a single limited action and of course we hope that the houthis will step back and end their reckless and destabilising attack but we will not hesitate to protect our security and our interest where require we would of course follow the correct procedure as i believe we do in this case 
 although the hon gentleman be right to ask question we should also recognise the risk of inaction because do nothing would absolutely weaken international security and the rule of law would far damage the freedom of navigation and the global economy and perhaps most important would send the very dangerous message that british vessel and british interest be fair game and that be simply unacceptable 
 of course i be happy to answer question about the situation in israel and gaza but the house should make it very clear to the outside world that there be no link between what we have do last week and the situation there this be a specific action in self defence against the houthis who be conduct illegal strike against innocent civilian shipping that have nothing to do with what be go on in israel and gaza and we must never let anyone think that this house believe that there be a link 
 i commend my right hon friend the defence secretary for his excellent and wide range speech this morning in which he rightly point out that we face dangerous time do my right hon friend the prime minister agree that while how we spend defence money be important it be vital and without doubt that defence need a great deal more money more than and these arbitrary target if our brave man and woman be to fight a sustained conflict in the year ahead 
 i agree that the defence secretary make an excellent speech early he highlight as i do the fact that defence spending have consistently meet our nato obligation we have be the large defence spender in nato and in the last settlement defence receive the large increase—£24 since the end of the cold war my hon friend be right that the threat we face be increase it be right that we invest to protect the british people against those threat and that be exactly what the government be do and will continue to do 
 while not have a vote in this house be regrettable liberal democrats support limited strike against the houthis to open international shipping lane but we can not lose sight of the fact that this region be a tinderbox we have see attack on us soldier in syria and iraq the terrorism of islamic state in iran the rocket of hezbollah and the israeli strike in beirut all stem from the horrifying conflict in israel and gaza can the prime minister tell we what conversation he have have with our nato and european ally but also with leader of gulf country to ensure that these limit strike remain limited 
 as i have say we be engage extensively with our international partner include our gulf ally i speak to the president of egypt just last week and will continue to do so let i say again however that it be important that no take away the idea that this house believe on any side that there be a link between direct action in self defence against the houthis and the situation in israel and gaza they be entirely distinct we will do everything we can to bring more aid into gaza and to make sure that we work   hard for a sustainable ceasefire that be separate from our ability and necessary duty to defend our interest and our people 
 i commend the prime minister for his firm and principled response to event in the red sea but be it not clear from iran ’s support for hamas hezbollah and the houthis that it will do anything to stop a last peace between the arab state and israel because the iranian regime believe that israel should not exist at all would it not be a real defeat for iran to see it isolate by a meaningful resolution of the palestinian issue and the supercharging of the abraham accord in a process to bring peace and stability to the region all underpin by an international resolve to confront iran ’s proxy wherever they threaten our interest and value 
 i thank my right hon friend for his excellent remark and for his work on the abraham accord which have do much to bring more peace and stability to the region he be right to say that the behaviour of the iranian regime pose a significant threat to the safety and security of the uk and our ally and ensure regional instability where we want to see more peace and stability i can assure he that we be keep abreast of all the risk in the area that be why for example the royal navy last year and the year before continue to interdict illegal arm smuggling by the iranians to the houthis we will continue to keep in close contact with our ally to take all the measure we can to protect our people and ensure that the iranians destabilising influence in the region be reduce to the good extent possible 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement he have be crystal clear on the need to degrade the capability of this terrorist organisation the houthis that be cause havoc in the red sea he will also know that yemen be of the poor country in the world and be suffer a mass humanitarian crisis with over people in need of humanitarian aid and support what will he do to ensure that the civilian of yemen be not again engulf in a mass humanitarian catastrophe 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise an incredibly important point i reassure she and the house she will know this from her own experience that we be steadfast in our support to the yemeni people as of the large donor of lifesave aid to the un appeal we be also commit i believe £ in this forthcoming year over the last several year we have commit £ and that will help to provide food for at least people every month and deliver lifesave healthcare through facility the yemeni people be suffer and we be do everything we can to alleviate that suffering 
 early this century follow threat of access to the suez canal from somali piracy the international community unite with a widely base taskforce to successfully suppress it now that the houthis be threaten seafarer life and international navigation along with the trade and job that depend on it will the prime minister seek the wide possible international taskforce to deal with that will he also support the people of south yemen who want nothing to do with these terrorist 
 the right hon gentleman be right about the necessity of build international coalition and i be pleased to say that that be happen operation prosperity guardian which we be proud to be a partner of be uphold freedom of navigation in the region as have be mention the un security council resolution that be pass on   january   be instructive in this sense it condemn in the strong term the houthi attack demand that they immediately cease all attack and note the right of member state to act in accordance with international law to defend their vessel the right hon gentleman will also have see the statement publish by around a dozen of our ally before and after the strike which i hope will reassure he that there be broad international support for what we be do and for the call on the houthis to desist 
 i represent a constituency with a proud maritime tradition family be anxious about commercial shipping staff whose job take they through the red sea and a scramble towards military action be endanger those uk seafarer maritime union be call not just for more protection but for co ordinated diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis after today ’s attack on a ship can the prime minister explain to seafarer how dropping bomb will lead to a de escalation of a situation that be already endanger their safety 
 that question be quite extraordinary it be houthi rocket that be endanger the life of seafarer in the region we have see shipping company welcome the action we be take because they be keen to see security and stability restore to the region that be what we be aim to do to disrupt destabilise and degrade the houthis ability to carry out these attack and to restore stability to region that be very much the focus of our attention we be act in self defence to protect the life of seafarer not endanger they the right hon lady would do well to call out the houthis to stop what they be do 
 do my right hon friend agree that the international law case for his government ’s action in the red sea be unusually in my experience relatively straightforward do he also agree that the next significant challenge be to maintain and enhance a multinational consensus on deter and combat more of these attack if they occur and that act in compliance with and respect for international law assist we in that task 
 my right hon and learn friend be right i hope he will have see the publish legal summary of our advice on this issue this proportionate and necessary action be take lawfully to respond to attack by the houthis and it be the only feasible mean to do so the uk be as he know permit under international law to use force in such circumstance it be right that we have due regard for the legal advice in such situation and i reassure he that we will continue always to have regard to it while we fight to protect international law it be important that we also follow it ourselves 
 accord to the yougov poll take last month of the british public want a ceasefire in israel gaza yet last week the   government launch airstrike in the red sea in escalation of the situation in the middle east although the government be not under any constitutional obligation to have a parliamentary vote on that military action or to abide by the result of any such vote do the prime minister believe that the government have a duty to the british public and the parliamentary community which represent the british people in build political support for such military action 
 the leader of the opposition rightly say we need to ensure that malign actor do not try to distort what we have do for their own purpose i gently say to the hon lady that to conflate and link our action against the houthis with the situation in israel gaza just give ammunition to our enemy who seek to make thing bad in the region 
 we act in self defence and i have explain the reason the process that we follow and the accountability that i have to parliament which i be now discharge separately we will of course work very hard to bring humanitarian aid into gaza and to try to bring about the sustainable ceasefire that we all want to see 
 i commend my right hon friend for prosecute this military action as a matter of law it be highly necessary and clearly proportionate and his legal position be watertight country around the world depend on that route but as usual it be the british and the americans who do something about protect it however there be report that more houthi attack be take place this afternoon will he take more military action if necessary 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his support of course he will understand that i will not speculate on future action this be intend as a limited single action and we hope the houthis will now step back and end their destabilising attack as i say early we will not hesitate to protect our security our people and our interest where require if we do so we will of course follow the correct procedure and precedent as we do in this case 
 the prime minister be right that ukraine need military support but it also need to be rebuild last year the british government oppose proposal that we should seize $ worth of russian state asset sit in bank around the world include in the uk and use they to rebuild ukraine however i note that the foreign secretary say in the united states of america in december that he be now argue that we should be able to seize those asset should we not legislate to ensure putin pay for the reconstruction of ukraine 
 i be not entirely sure that i agree with the hon gentleman ’s characterisation of the situation i agree that russia must pay for the long term reconstruction of ukraine and i have be clear about that on the g7 leader call at the end of last year i be the who raise this issue and as a result the g7 have collectively task finance ministers with explore all lawful route to ensure that russian asset be make available for that purpose we be work at pace to   identify all option for seize those asset and i reassure he that we be ensure in conjunction with our international ally that the measure will be safe robust and compliant with the international rule of law again it be the uk together with the us that have be lead that conversation in the g7 
 houthi attack on shipping be a global problem and it be right that we act alongside our partner where close ally do not participate in those airstrike we still need they to act and act alongside we will we encourage they to redouble their effort to interdict arm smuggling from iran into yemen and therefore help to degrade far the military capacity of the houthis 
 my right hon friend make an excellent point and we will continue to work with our ally i hope he will have see the statement put out by about a dozen of our ally after the strike reiterate their support for what we have do he will know that there be non operational support from a handful of other country together with the much large coalition of nation that be involve in different way in operation prosperity guardian where other country can play a part in interdict iranian shipment bring stability to the region and protect international shipping we of course want to work with they the defence secretary and the foreign secretary be have those conversation as we speak 
 we live in most challenging time with instability in the middle east europe and africa it be important that we have the right kind of leadership and response we must make sure that our international shipping route remain open what be the prime minister ’s assessment of the degradation of the houthis capability after the action last week on ukraine we must stand united in this house in say that the russians must be defeat for the aggression they have show we should remain together united in say once again slava ukraini lastly the prime minister talk about a sustainable settlement in gaza it be important that we recognise the scale of the humanitarian suffering so may i ask he for an update on what we be do to ensure that in gaza we deliver peace and security with the hope of a well world as we come through 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his support for the action in ukraine let i touch on his last point because i agree with he we be of course concern about the devastating impact of the conflict in gaza on the civilian population too many people have lose their life already and there be a desperate need for increase humanitarian support into gaza i be pleased that the uk be play a lead role we have triple our aid recently the foreign secretary appoint a humanitarian envoy to the region to address some of the blockage and we deliver our maritime shipment of aid into egypt more than tonne of new aid when i speak to prime minister netanyahu i impress upon he the importance of not only increase the flow of truck but crucially if we can open up extra crossing into gaza so that   we can increase the flow of aid we will continue to press on israel to do that so that we can bring more relief to people who be suffer a great deal 
 i thank the prime minister for a clear statement it be report that the drone be use by the houthis be be help by iran the american enterprise institute have report that russia have give $ to iran for drone will the prime minister assure the house that we be do everything we can in this country to make sure that none of that money be go through the uk financial system 
 let i tell my hon friend that she be right and we agree with the us assessment that iran have directly supply and directly support houthi attack in the red sea provide intelligence especially to enable their targeting of vessel and provide they with missile and unmanned aerial vehicle she be right to say that we should do everything we can to prevent that and i reassure she on that she will know about the measure we have take over the past year on financial transparency and beneficial ownership register which allow we to crack down on economic crime and money laundering physically the royal navy be involve in interdict shipment as it have do successfully last year and the year before it will continue to have a presence in the region so that we can disrupt those illegal arm flow 
 it be a critical time internationally but we have a staffing crisis in our navy so can we do more to boost the recruitment of sailor by offer science technology engineering and math qualification when will we see our navy back up to full strength 
 our royal navy be of the top in the world it be capable of operate in all the world ’s ocean simultaneously and we be of only country to operate generation jet from the sea so we should be confident and proud of our royal navy as i have say we be invest in more equipment and capability go into the future the hon gentleman be right to highlight some of the recruitment challenge the defence secretary highlight some of they the other week but we be double down on all our initiative to ensure that our armed force have the staff they need for the future and that those personnel have the equipment and supply they need to do their job effectively 
 i fully support my right hon friend the prime minister i welcome both his statement about the action he take on the houthi and the other part of the statement about ukraine because we must support ukraine and its future 
 on the reality of the houthi we know that iran have support have supply and continue to direct the houthi in their attack it support and direct hamas in their brutal attack in october and it have arm and direct hezbollah on a regular basis and tell they what to do through the islamic revolutionary guard corps we understand all that so why be we still reluctant to proscribe the irgc which be responsible for so much   of the co ordination of that work there be still iranian bank in the city of london feed money to those terrible organisation 
 i thank my right hon friend for the work he personally do in support ukraine i agree with he about the risk that iran pose to the uk and to regional stability we have sanction more than iranian individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety the national security act implement new measure to protect the british public it have be describe by intelligence chief as game changing”—particularly in tackle espionage and foreign interference with tough power to arrest and detain people suspect of involvement in state threat 
 as my right hon friend will know we do not routinely comment on proscription but i hope he will have see the statement today about our proscription of hizb ut tahrir on which i know he and colleague have rightly be focus in previous year 
 some people in the region be live in hunger and food shortage the people of yemen have be bombard by weapon supply by britain from saudi arabia for year and we have a dreadful conflict go on in gaza where there be people dead or missing where be the comprehensive plan by the western nation to try to bring about a comprehensive peace across the whole region rather than pump more and more weapon and money into more and more conflict that will get bad do the prime minister have any hope for the future that there will be a lessening of conflict rather than the present very rapid increase in it 
 i do have hope as we and other take action to degrade and disrupt the capability of those who be malign actor in the region that will give the space for positive voice to build the peace that we all want to see and to allow everyone to live side by side with dignity security and opportunity
