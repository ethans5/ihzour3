the memorandum of understanding as you be aware madam deputy speaker have sign off on it in be an agreement to create a policy framework that promote good environmental social and governance practice in critical mineral mining and processing i be able to visit indonesia in january specifically to raise concern about human right in papua with the senior minister for human right

 the lord chancellor must be live in a parallel universe if she be give herself a pat on the back today the truth be she have completely lose control of the justice system she sit on her hand for week and take day to gather her thought and put her view in write to the sentencing council her incompetence take this down to the wire 
 magistrate and judge be update by the press office of the sentencing council only at midday that the guideline due to come into force have in effect be suspend that raise the very real prospect that magistrate and judge sit from am this morning be unaware of this chaotic last minute change and sentence people under guideline that the justice secretary    herself have concede be tier but it get bad in that very email to thousand of judge and magistrate send just minute ago the sentencing council state 
 we remain of the view that the guideline be necessary and appropriate 
 confusion reign they be be tell thing by the lord chancellor and another by the sentencing council who really be in charge here yet again the justice secretary have be humiliate and undermine by activist judge seek to undermine the will of this place our parliament her authority have be shred she be be treat as a tier tier justice secretary 
 this situation be entirely preventable if the justice secretary have simply put party politic to side and back our bill week ago to restore accountability and empower she to actually control justice policy but the labour party block it if the prime minister have be trick into sit at the front of the dockland light railway think that he be in charge as his chief of staff mock he for the other day the lord chancellor have choose to sit there in the passenger seat allow the judiciary to take charge she decide to be undecided resolve to be irresolute all powerful to be impotent 
 even after this complete shamble the lord chancellor will not even re establish ministerial oversight we be tell via frantic press briefing that her bill which we have not even see yet will surgically remove these tier sentencing guideline that do not tackle the root cause of the problem at all which be an activist legal quango that hold view completely divergent to the public to parliament and now we be tell to the government unless she follow the formula of the bill produce by conservative mp we will be back here time and again to unwind the next piece of madness come out of the council 
 take the sentencing council ’s immigration guideline that water down sentence for immigration offence below the month threshold for automatic deportation if publish it will mean hundred of illegal migrant and foreign national offender will avoid deportation every single year it will blow a hole in border security it even water down the maximum life sentence for people smuggler that be legislate for just under a year ago it completely disregard parliamentary sovereignty 
 at our last exchange the justice secretary say there would be no tier justice on her watch well there it be and it be bad than that on   january her own department not the sentencing council publish guidance order the prioritisation of bail for ethnic minority and transgender people continue a practice introduce under gordon brown contrary to the misinformation peddle by her press office the department produce new guidance on pre sentencing report that have be in force for month which state that probation officer should consider the culture of an offender and whether they have suffer intergenerational trauma from historical event well that be cultural relativism which violate the rule of law and put the british public at risk this time nobody be to blame other than she it be her department it be black and white it be tier justice 
 i have some question will the justice secretary reassure the house that nobody be sentence this morning under guideline that she concede be tier can she honestly say at the dispatch box that she have confidence in the head of the sentencing council lord justice davies give that he have bring it into   total disrepute yes or no if she can be she aware that he take to the airwave yesterday in an astonishing departure from the expect standard of judicial conduct to advocate for abolish short sentence especially for hyper prolific offender effectively instruct low court to follow suit it be time for he to go and if she will not sack he for that what will it take 
 do the justice secretary have confidence in johanna robinson another member of the sentencing council who take a moral objection to border control and describe the illegal migration act as appalling lastly will the justice secretary change the guidance that her own department be produce and which have create a tier probation service or be it once again on her watch tier justice under tier keir 
 the clerk at the table have inform the house of the unavoidable absence of the speaker the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the syrian constitutional declaration sign on march 
 we welcome the provision make in the constitutional declaration on freedom of expression freedom of belief and woman ’s right we also welcome the announcement on the formation of the new syrian government the uk stand ready to support an inclusive stable and prosperous future for the people of syria we will continue to encourage inclusive governance and will work with the syrian government to that end 
 i thank the foreign secretary for that reply the fall of assad be rightly welcome by all member of this house but report of mass killing of christians and alawites which have now result in more than civilian death show that syria be still a very unstable country will the secretary of state therefore outline what support be be give to the new syrian government to prevent further violence and another appalling refugee crisis 
 i can assure my hon friend that we be follow step closely the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer will be meet civil society group today my hon friend   the member for leeds north east fabian hamilton   will know that we have allocate £ to support recovery and stability through lifesaving and other such assistance clearly the recent violence be incredibly horrific and alarming we will continue to work with the new government as good we can to ensure that we get the inclusive political transition that we all want to see 
 the foreign secretary will know that this be a year draft constitution do he share my concern that the legislative executive and judicial separation of power in it need to be beef up the appointment of the new government appear prima facie to be inclusive but do he agree that the people ’s committee also need to be inclusive give that it will be mostly appoint by the president 
 clearly it be welcome that the new government have move in this direction i reassure the right hon gentleman that we recognise our skill in governance and in work with ally and partner and we will use that strength to help to support the new government we be aware of his concern and we will work with the new government to get that well separation that he want 
 whether any cost arise from the propose treaty with mauritius on the sovereignty of the chagos islands will be meet by his department 
 the uk mauritius treaty which enable the continued operation of the base on diego garcia be still subject to finalisation and signature financial obligation arise from the agreement include departmental budgetary responsibility will be manage responsibly within the government ’s fiscal framework include through the upcoming spending review 
 oh dear madam deputy speaker that be not the answer to the question that i ask perhaps the minister have bring the wrong file with he my question be very simple and it be to which the british people deserve an answer the government be plan to give away sovereign british territory along with billion of pound to mauritius the money be not refer to in the spring statement or in the budget where be it come from 
 i have answer question on that matter a number of time in this house this government will not scrimp on security the base on diego garcia will be secure for ourselves and our ally protect the british people and our ally be our no priority and full detail will be provide in due course 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government have finally admit to front loading payment to mauritius for their surrender deal cave in to prime minister ramgoolam ’s demand since he take office in november yet they still refuse to disclose the amount or clarify which budget will cover the lease economic partnership and chagossian trust fund why the secrecy will the minister disclose the detail now will he also confirm whether the statement from the prime minister of mauritius be correct in say that concession have be make include the loss of sovereign right on diego garcia and of unilateral lease renewal provision   when will this horrific deal finally come to parliament and what time will be provide to debate it or well still why do the minister not dump the deal completely and keep chagos british 
 the hon member neglect to remind the house that it be his government who start negotiation on this matter because they recognise that our national security interest and those of our ally be under threat a financial element be crucial to protect the operation of that crucial base once the treaty be sign and after ratification in the usual way it will be put before both houses for scrutiny and it will of course include cost the government will not scrimp on our security protect the british people be our no priority 
 what step he be take with the chancellor of the exchequer to provide funding for urgent repair to his department ’s overseas estate 
 the uk ’s diplomatic estate directly support the delivery of this government ’s mission maintenance of the diplomatic estate with an emphasis on safety and security for staff and visitor have be a core priority for the department during ongoing discussion with the treasury about the spending review 
 the maintenance and upkeep of the property that constitute the foreign commonwealth and development office ’s overseas estate be estimate to cost £ a year in recent year that have be fund through the sale of asset drawdown on the receipt of those sale be due to run out either this year or next and the department have previously make it clear that there be no more family silver to sell my question to the minister be this what conversation have be have with the treasury about a long term sustainable funding model for the estate and if the treasury be not forthcoming with the money what cut do the department intend to make 
 after the fire sale of asset by the former government in the fcdo have be focus on how to make good its estate now that that money be exhaust the fcdo have develop a new estate prioritisation tool to ensure that finite resource be target at place of great need and weight towards mitigate health and safety and security risk 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the uk ’s contribution to the european union force bosnia and herzegovina 
 the european union force in bosnia and herzegovina be key to maintain peace and security there although the uk do not contribute to the mission we be commit to support bosnia and herzegovina through nato and our bilateral defence co operation and we be open   to explore enhanced co operation with the eu include through operation and mission as we strengthen the uk eu security and defence relationship include in the western balkans 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will be aware that the conservative government previously withdraw from the eufor peacekeeping force operation althea in follow their botched brexit deal let our ally down will the minister consider recommit british troop to operation althea as other country have such as turkey to show our european ally that we want to work together and to demonstrate our continue focus on the region 
 i think the hon member hear what i say a moment ago we regularly engage with eufor and the eu delegation in bosnia and herzegovina indeed i co convene a call with quint member and eu institution on friday with my french counterpart and we be work closely on these very serious matter we be also support security in bosnia through our bilateral contribution include our staff officer in the nato hq in sarajevo 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of israeli settlement in the west bank 
 israeli settlement be illegal under international law and harm the prospect of a state solution on   march the un security council make clear that we oppose any attempt to expand settlement in the west bank i have be very clear with israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settler expansion 
 on saturday night the israeli government announce the approval of an expand road network in the e1 corridor of the west bank with the stated aim of support the development of illegal israeli settlement in the area that area be critical to the territorial integrity of a future palestinian state previously unified international pressure have restrain the israeli government so can the foreign secretary say how the government be work with their ally to exert maximum influence on israel in this matter 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question i condemn categorically the development of settlement that be illegal under international law settlement do not offer security to israel or to palestinians i also condemn call to annex the west bank which would lead only to violence and jeopardise prospect for a palestinian state i be clear with israeli counterpart that settlement expansion must stop we will continue to work with our partner to ensure prospect for a palestinian state 
 we have hear secretary of state after secretary of state condemn the increase in settlement and settler violence in the west bank over the last or year and it have make not the slight bit of difference to their expansion when will the foreign secretary accept that the only   thing that the israelis will respond to we should not forget that these settlement be sponsor by the israeli state be action when can we expect more sanction particularly on violent settler and their organisation when can we expect a full trade ban on settlement produce in particular will the secretary of state consider proscribe those settler organisation that be perpetrate terrorism on an innocent palestinian population 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman it be important that there be a cross party position and successive ministers of both political party have condemn expansion and condemn violence we continue to work with partner across europe and beyond on these issue i do not say that it be easy he will know that i announce sanction back in october and we continue to keep these issue under review but the culture of impunity for those engage in violence be intolerable i remember just a few month ago sit with bedouins who have experience that violence and be be subject to that expansion it be horrendous that be why in both the un and our dialogue with the israeli government we be clear that that harm the prospect of peace and security for israel it do not further its ambition 
 the scene come out of palestine recently have be nothing short of shocking hundred have be kill in settler violence in the west bank the brutal torture of palestinians in israeli custody be commonplace and the collapse of the ceasefire mean that the devastation and human suffering in gaza have simply continue will the secretary of state confirm whether his department have receive any evidence show that international law have be violate will he share such evidence and his assessment openly 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue she will know that in a sober and measured way the government have to make our own decision on the export licensing regime which be put in place by the last government and we assess that there be a clear risk of a breach of international humanitarian law therefore we have suspend arm that could be use in gaza that be a decision that minister have make from this dispatch box under different government 
 early this year i visit the west bank with colleague in the chamber as part of a parliamentary delegation where i see the awful israeli illegal violence in hebron and susya we run into israeli settler who clearly want we off the area that they have burn down will the foreign secretary go far than he have in condemn that violence by agree to full sanction and an embargo on all israeli illegal settlement owe to the position of the city of london that could have a profound impact and stop the violence 
 i should make it clear that settlement good do not benefit from any free trade arrangement that we have with israel obviously on   october i announce new sanction target illegal settler outpost and organisation that have support the sponsor violence against community in the west bank 
 what assessment he have make of the value for money of official development assistance spending on in donor refugee cost 
 the government be tackle the asylum backlog at record pace so that we can work towards end the use of hotel and ensure that more of our oda budget be spend on our development priority globally detailed decision on how the oda budget will be allocate be be work through as part of the ongoing spending review 
 the british public increasingly feel that development aid have sadly lose its clarity of purpose while i accept that there be multiple objective behind aid and that of course lift the world ’s poor out of poverty have long be at the heart of the fcdo ’s mission a reset in the social contract around development aid be clearly need what consideration have the minister give to shape development policy that explicitly address the upstream determinant of mass migration 
 i agree with much of what my hon friend have say our development effort as the foreign secretary have say have never just be about the aid budget peace and security effective governance access to private investment remittance flow efficient tax system and access to trade opportunity be all essential foundation for development that require we to mobilise the full force of different resource and expertise across government our business and in university science and beyond 
 do the minister agree that rather than be use to meet in donor refugee cost the official development assistance budget should prioritise tackle extreme poverty it be now a year since the oecd development assistance committee ’s mid term review which show that the uk have only make good progress on of the recommendation since the peer review what progress have the fcdo make over the last month in well meet the committee ’s guidance 
 the hon lady ask about important matter around spend on in donor refugee cost thank to the measure take by the home secretary to reduce the asylum backlog and work towards exit costly asylum hotel we expect overall oda spending on asylum to have be low in than in there will always be some unpredictability but we expect the action to continue reduce in donor refugee cost in this parliament 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of plan reduction to the official development assistance budget on effort to tackle infectious disease 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question decision on how oda will be use will be consider as part of the   ongoing spending review reduce the overall size of the budget will necessarily have an impact on the scale and shape of our work i can say however that our important work and support for gavi be immunise child and save up to life and our £ pledge to the global fund for be support prevention and treatment for hiv tuberculosis and malaria and will help to save over life 
 i agree with the minister on what he just say but gavi say that the change policy will mean that few child will be immunise which mean that over year will die how on earth do he live with himself with that policy 
 with the great of respect the right hon gentleman will know my record on these important issue have advocate for they over many year in this place and outside i do not accept his characterisation decision have not yet be take they be be take as part of the spending review he will know that the uk be of the large donor to gavi we have commit £ in the current strategic period up to and that will make an important impact on child ’s life around the world 
 gavi be create very much with the uk as a drive force it be of the proud achievement of the previous labour government it have immunise almost people in the world and not only be it save life but it be important for job and work here in the uk in our fantastic life science sector will the minister give a commitment that we will continue to be a lead force in gavi at the replenishment in june 
 the foreign secretary have be discuss these important issue with the health and social care secretary my hon friend be right to point out the important role of gavi as well as our role in that the decision will be set out in due course but i hear what she and indeed other hon and right hon member be say on this important issue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be very clear from minister answer that we still have no indication about which programme and where will be affect by the plan reduction to oda and from when exactly the cut will be effective we be tell to wait for the spending review but many organisation include those tackle infectious disease be leave to face uncertainty and to work at risk will the minister tell we what instruction have be issue to his department ’s humanitarian aid programme about what they be expect to do between now and the spending review in june 
 we clearly have difficult decision to make but the fcdo be not pause all oda programming and not create a cliff edge in this year we be focus on ensure that every pound will be spend in the most impactful way in the new context that be a very difficult decision as the prime minister the foreign secretary and i have set out we will set out the detail in due course but we be listen closely to member in this house and indeed to the many partner and stakeholder we work with on these important issue 
 if he will amend the memorandum of understanding between indonesia and the uk on a strategic partnership on critical mineral publish on november to include condition on the protection of human right in west papua 
 the memorandum of understanding as you be aware madam deputy speaker have sign off on it in be an agreement to create a policy framework that promote good environmental social and governance practice in critical mineral mining and processing i be able to visit indonesia in january specifically to raise concern about human right in papua with the senior minister for human rights.[official report   april vol c. 7wc correction 
 in president joko widodo promise the united nations high commissioner for human rights that he would be allow to visit west papua no visit have yet be facilitate by indonesia although high commissioners have be and go without such a visit it be impossible to assess the real human right situation will the minister ensure that the uk do not engage in critical mineral extraction in west papua before such a visit take place 
 the uk continue to support the visit by the un high commissioner for human rights and through initiative such as the voluntary principle on security and human right and the uk indonesia critical mineral mou sign off by you madam deputy speaker the government promote good practice on sustainability and respect for human rights.[official report   april vol c. 7wc correction 
 i be delighted to hear that the minister have be raise human right concern with the government of indonesia about critical mineral would she perhaps have a word with her colleague the secretary of state for energy security and net about the human right concern over other critical mineral conversion in china it be go into a green energy economy that be suppose to have environmental social and governance accord yet somehow or other it fail on all of those it fail because of its coal power production it fail because its product be make by socially undesirable slave labour i hope she agree about that and it fail on governance because there be no oversight will she have those same conversation within her own government 
 the right hon gentleman be quite right to raise those press concern and all will be reveal when the china audit come forward with the specific on his question 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help advance peace in the middle east 
 what step he be take to help restore the ceasefire in gaza 
 i be deeply concerned about the resumption of hostility in gaza the foreign secretary and i be press all party to return urgently to dialogue and to implement the ceasefire agreement in full since the renew outbreak of hostility the foreign secretary have speak to secretary rubio israeli foreign minister gideon sa’ar eu high representative kallas and the un emergency relief co ordinator tom fletcher we have also be work with our french german and italian partner in support of the arab plan for the reconstruction of gaza as part of wide peace building effort 
 it be often say that action speak louder than word the government have repeatedly condemn what be happen in gaza and the west bank yet israeli settler violence israeli settlement expansion the unlawful demolition of palestinian home and violence in gaza be continue give that uk diplomatic effort and condemnation be be so roundly ignore will the uk now take action and ban the importation of product from illegal settlement on illegally occupy land to give the signal that israel can not break international law with complete impunity 
 the hon lady will know the importance that we have place on international law since we come to power in july we have be clear throughout this period that we want to see a ceasefire in gaza we regret that at this point we be still in disagreement with the israeli government and we regret the scene of the last few week in relation to the west bank and to gaza in relation to settlement good as the foreign secretary say early and as i have say before different provision exist for illegal settlement which we consider to be illegal and which do not benefit from any of the provision that would otherwise cover good from israel 
 over the past week i have be in touch with medical colleague on the ground in gaza and also with representative of hostage family in israel in gaza they corroborate the worrying un report of a shallow grave contain the body of paramedic and rescue worker seemingly shoot by by the israeli army some of they still wear the surgical glove that they be use to save the life of other in israel hostage family feel increasingly distant from their own government and abandon by they hamas be a terrorist organisation but israel be an ally as a critical friend and ally what further step can we take to reinforce our message that the israeli government ’s current trajectory be destructive for peace and indeed for their own interest 
 my hon friend be right to ask this question i know that he himself a surgeon have be closely engage with the medical situation in gaza and the incredible bravery of those who provide that assistance as i say in answer to   the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns the scene in gaza in relation to aid worker and of course the gazan civilian themselves be absolutely horrific it be why with france we call a special session of the un security council on friday and we will continue to press with all diplomatic lever to see an improvement 
 what assessment have the government make of report that iran be consider pre emptive strike against american b-2 spirit bomber that have recently be forward locate in diego garcia 
 as the house will understand i will not provide a detailed commentary on that reporting but we remain deeply conscious of the potential threat from iran both in this country and in the region we continue to have dialogue with the iranian government the foreign secretary speak to his equivalent just last week we treat these matter with the utmost seriousness as the right hon member would expect 
 like many i be extremely alarmed to hear the israeli defence minister israel katz threaten the total destruction of gaza the uk and its ally be commit to a state solution but that only work if there be a state leave stand for palestinians will that minister ever be sanction and will our minister set out what role he see the uk play in the long term reconstruction of gaza 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i know how attentive to these issue she have be the foreign secretary have condemn in this chamber the comment of defence minister katz and this government be clear what the path to reconstruction in gaza must be we have engage closely with our partner in the arab world we welcome their plan for reconstruct gaza and we will continue to do all we can to see that as the path to reconstruction with dignity for the palestinian people of gaza 
 today be the anniversary of the killing of the year old ex royal marine james henderson who be kill by the israelis among aid worker with the world central kitchen a year later as   the hon member for glasgow south west dr ahmed   have mention mass graf have be find with body of those who work for the red crescent and the red cross that come week after aid worker from the al khair foundation be kill it be believe that aid worker have be kill do the minister believe that it be illegal under international law to kill aid worker and if so what be he prepare to do about it 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for give i the opportunity to comment today be indeed the year anniversary of the appalling strike on the world central kitchen convoy which kill people include british citizen john chapman james henderson and james kirby i would like to pay tribute to their bravery and remember again the appalling tragedy of that day i alongside the foreign secretary meet their family in november they be determined to see justice for their family member and i know that the whole chamber will be unite in that determination israel ’s military advocate general must quickly and thoroughly conclude their consideration of the strike include determine whether criminal proceeding should be initiate as the hon gentleman have say gaza be now the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker this can not continue 
 as other have say today be the anniversary of the death of james kirby john chapman and james henderson former serviceman we far hear about the aid worker who be kill last week un under secretary general tom fletcher have describe they as have be kill by and bury in shallow graf alongside their clearly mark ambulance fire truck and un vehicle i thank the government for call a un security council meeting on the protection of aid worker will the minister update we on the outcome of that meeting and the further step we will take to protect aid worker in gaza 
 the meeting on friday consider those question there be agreement across the security council on the importance of preserve the space for humanitarian action as i have say this morning we regret deeply that there have not yet be further improvement and we will continue to use all available diplomatic step to ensure that aid get into gaza aid worker be protect and the horrific scene describe by the emergency relief co ordinator be not repeat 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 our thought continue to be with the hostage hold in hamas captivity in gaza and with their family what recent contact have the minister have with counterpart in israel america and our partner in the region to secure their release and broker a way through this impasse what step be be take across government to address the threat to stability pose by iran how do the minister envisage the removal of hamas from the governance of gaza 
 on the shadow foreign secretary ’s important point we be as she would expect in regular contact with all those involve in negotiation the foreign secretary speak to the israeli foreign minister last week i have be in regular contact with the qataris who be do important work in this file as she would expect we continue to be in touch with the hostage family whose concern i know the chamber continue to share 
 on the threat pose by iran we speak to the relevant player in the region and to the e3 as i say in response to an early question the foreign secretary speak to the iranian foreign minister last week and underline that we continue to support a diplomatic resolution to the tension with iran we do not want to see iran secure a nuclear weapon we believe that a diplomatic solution be the good way to achieve that but we will hold the snap back of sanction and indeed many other measure under review until we be satisfied 
 what step he be take to support ukraine 
 what step his department be take to support ukraine 
 the foreign commonwealth and development office be lead international effort to keep up the pressure on russia through more than sanction which have help to reduce russia ’s oil revenue by between january and november compare with year prior we be of course also work hard to co ordinate ally just yesterday i be in madrid discuss these issue with european counterpart and later this week i will be at the nato foreign ministers conference where the ukrainians will be as well 
 i be incredibly proud that since the onset of russia ’s invasion of ukraine wrexham have welcome many ukrainian family among they be yaroslav and oksana who have long dream of open a café in their home town of chortkiv despite the war prevent they from realise that dream at home they now own a thriving business on wrexham high street how be the government continue to support ukrainian family who play a big part in community across britain as well as those who at some point in the future may wish to return to ukraine when the situation allow 
 i be proud that the british people across our country have open their home and their heart to ukrainians flee russia ’s brutal war the homes for ukraine scheme have help more than ukrainians to find refuge here and since   february ukrainian refugee can apply to remain for an additional month while continue to receive vital support 
 as the foreign secretary know we have substantial engagement with and deployment to estonia talk of peace in ukraine be of course welcome and britain should play its role in support that peace but do he accept that any deployment of british troop to ukraine increase the risk to the uk and its force in estonia 
 the hon gentleman should know that the uk ’s commitment to the security of estonia be iron clad and make real by our nato forward land force deployment discussion regard how our military can support ukraine ’s future security arrangement be ongoing include with nato ally and secretary general rutte part of the discussion for country commit to the coalition of the willing be about ensure that those country on the frontline be not leave without adequate support the hon gentleman raise a very important issue 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 the whole house continue to stand united with the people of ukraine in their existential struggle although there have be much coverage of tentative step towards a black sea ceasefire do the foreign secretary agree that with the brutal war rag on land we must continue to constrain putin ’s war machine with every tool at our disposal could he update we on his plan for do so beyond sanction do he agree that the onus remain squarely on putin to prove whether he be in any way serious about the kind of lasting and just peace that president zelensky want to see 
 the right hon lady should know that with eu colleague yesterday at the g7 a few week ago and i be sure with colleague as i head to nato we be discuss an oil cap in particular and how that would limit putin ’s reserve we continue to discuss not just the freezing of asset but the seizing of asset we recognise that some european colleague be more exposed than we in the uk be nevertheless why should we use taxpayer money we should use russian money that have cause so much damage in ukraine of course we continue to look at the arsenal of sanction that we can use and i be sure that i will have more to say on that in the come week 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 of all the horror that vladimir putin have inflict on ukraine the abduction of more than ukrainian child be of the most vile it threaten to rob ukraine of its future which be surely putin ’s ultimate goal the prime minister praise the work of kyiv ’s bring kids back initiative last week will the foreign secretary now commit to the uk fill the funding gap leave by the trump administration ’s withdrawal of funding for yale ’s humanitarian research lab so that it can continue to research russia ’s war crime especially to track the whereabouts of these child so that they can be bring back home 
 it be important for i to meet madam zelensky to discuss this issue when i be last in ukraine the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty also meet the relevant minister in ukraine to discuss this issue just a few day ago i can absolutely give an undertaking to continue to support the group it be not our assessment that we can meet the shortfall leave by the withdrawal of usaid united states agency for international development funding but we will continue to work with partner across europe on this important issue which be very personal to i 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help ensure that israel allow aid into gaza 
 aid should never be use as a political tool as the foreign secretary make clear to the house on   march block humanitarian aid into gaza be appalling and unacceptable israel must allow aid into gaza immediately the foreign secretary make that clear to israeli foreign minister sa’ar on   march   and issue a joint statement with his french and german counterpart on   march gaza be the deadly place in the world to be an aid worker more than aid worker have be kill in the conflict restore the ceasefire remain the good chance to see hostage release allow a surge of humanitarian aid and bring this bloodshed to an end 
 it be clear from the chamber this morning that we all despair at the recent breakdown of the ceasefire agreement the resumption of hostility   and the blockade of aid into gaza we now have warning of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in the gaza strip which be hard to imagine after what we have already see there the minister mention the conversation that have be have with israel can he assure i that we be make it clear that the only way we will achieve a last peace be through a state solution which will not achieve by subject people to such hardship secondly what conversation be ongoing with ally about restore aid drop directly into gaza 
 i can confirm that we say regularly to our israeli counterpart and indeed to all other in the region that the only route out of these horror be a state solution an outcome that provide for the safety security and dignity of both people we be talk with our partner about what might be do to try to ensure aid get into gaza through whatever mean be at our disposal but at the core israel must relax the restriction and allow aid into gaza that be the way to get the scale of aid that be require into the strip during the ceasefire we see a massive increase in aid and that be what we want to do 
 with continued aerial bombardment impact the flow of aid into gaza will the foreign secretary confirm whether uk make f-35 part have be use to enable air strike in gaza since   march 
 to clarify my previous answer the foreign secretary speak to foreign minister sa’ar on   march not   march 
 in response to the question ask by my hon friend   the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman we will continue to press these issue with the israeli government it be clear to the house that we have not succeed over these long month in ensure the level of aid into gaza that we would like to see or have the protection for humanitarian worker that we want to see deconfliction with humanitarian aid worker be a vital part of ensure their security and we be press the israelis to do so 
 what step he be take to increase the understanding of and respect for the right to self determination globally 
 the united kingdom be commit to promote and protect human right and the rule of law and the right to self determination be set out in the international covenant on civil and political right 
 some people in washington dc be currently disenfranchised because their representative in the senate and the house of representatives do not have vote right or full control of local government affair it be the equivalent of everyone in bedfordshire vote for mps who have no chance of go through the voting lobby do the minister agree that that be a particularly strange anomaly 
 this be not a matter for we the united states be a sovereign democratic nation and the issue of voting right in the district of columbia be a matter for the united states

 we be concern at the expansion of the government of israel ’s war aim and operation in the west bank i make clear my serious concern on the continue israeli operation when i speak to the israeli foreign minister gideon sa’ar on   march as the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer say but also on   march we be clear that civilian must be protect and the destruction of civilian infrastructure minimised 
 it emerge today that a year old palestinian boy who have be take from the west bank have die in israeli detention have be hold for month without charge israel have be strike inside the west bank and in do so embolden illegal settler in their own violence give that israel claim that it be target hamas and not the people of palestine itself what specific action be the foreign secretary take to protect palestinians in the west bank from both settler violence and israeli force

 this be clearly a critical time for peace in the region the offensive by azerbaijan in nagorno karabakh result in the forced displacement of up to armenians and the continued detention of official and civilian there be much concern about the conduct of the trial their welfare and their access to legal support so what more can the minister do to put pressure on the government of azerbaijan to look for their release and to get access to the prisoner 
 i thank my hon friend for her important work on these issue the uk have consistently call for the release of all the remain prisoner of war we continue to urge the azerbaijani authority to ensure that those detain during the long stand conflict with armenia be afford a fair trial and provide safe condition i raise that specifically with the azerbaijani president ’s special representative in october and we continue to engage with they on this issue 
 yesterday be the anniversary of the attempt genocide of the azerbaijani people by the armenians and i be sure the whole house will issue its condolence for that purpose in the newly liberate territory of nagorno karabakh hundred of mine be still be clear by hand what action will the government offer to support azerbaijan in remove those mine so that the land can be use for beneficial purpose 
 the hon gentleman rightly raise the issue of mine he will know the important role that this country have play in de mining effort around the world i be very happy to write to he with the detail of where we be on that in relation to azerbaijan and we have discuss that with they on a number of occasion the most important thing be that we continue to work towards the signing of that peace agreement between azerbaijan and armenia so that the people of those country with which we have strong relationship can live in peace and harmony alongside another

 as we and mauritius have repeatedly say include in joint statement on   december   and   january both side remain committed to conclude a deal on the future of the chagos archipelago that protect the long term effective operation of the joint uk us base on diego garcia once the treaty be sign it will be put to parliament for scrutiny before ratification in the usual way 
 give that there be no bind legal basis for the ceding of the chagos island and that the deal will cost the hard press british taxpayer north of £ £ or possibly £ a year will the secretary of state confirm what total financial liability will be bring to the uk and whether they will be fund from the uplift in the defence budget announce in the spring statement

 politic be about choice and the speculation about how much the government want to hand over to mauritius start at £ that money would go a long way as official development assistance so do the minister regret that choice 
 as i have say a financial element let we remember that this be over year be crucial to protect the operation of the base if we do not pay for our security somebody else might attempt to get in there that be crucial reason we have work closely with mauritius the united states and other ally and partner include india to protect our base on diego garcia 
 it be a sell out 
 i can hear the chuntering from the shadow minister but it be simply not correct we be protect diego garcia our interest there and our national security i be afraid that i simply do not accept what he be say and of course if there be not a problem why do his government start the negotiation in the place

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on nhs pension in the light of the statutory deadline for both remediable service statement and remediable pension saving statement be miss 
 i thank   the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans   for ask this question which give i the opportunity to provide further information follow the write parliamentary statement that i issue yesterday to update the house on the delivery of remediable service statement to affected member 
 i have extend the deadline for the nhs business services authority to issue statement to ensure that member have enough time to make informed decision once member have receive statement they will be able to use a tool provide by his majesty ’s revenue and customs to retrospectively adjust their annual allowance between and 
 separately the original deadline to issue the remediable pension saving statement be   october the nhs business services authority issue statement to member by this deadline of which be find to contain incorrect information these have since be recalculate and reissue the nhs business services authority be work to issue outstanding statement as quickly as possible 
 a revise delivery timetable have be develop and share with trade union and employer representative by the end of march statement have be issue statement for member will be produce once further information have be receive from their employer the remain statement require additional manual input from the nhs business services authority before they can be produce and will be issue in july there have be delay on all side which we have be aware of since last july in fact the department have escalate issue of design with the previous government as i be sure the hon gentleman understand 
 we know that this matter be really important and that there be high number of high earner in the nhs which be why we have take the decision to be open and transparent about the timeline that we can now commit to have work tirelessly to reduce the delay although these delay will cause inconvenience to some member i have be crystal clear that no will face any financial detriment as a consequence compensation arrangement be in place for direct financial loss certain hmrc interest charge and the cost of financial and accountancy advice 
 the government do acknowledge the impact of the delay on affected member we be work hard to issue outstanding statement and to protect member from any financial detriment the delay may cause 
 what be go on with nhs pension administration under this government i declare an interest as someone with an nhs pension today the government have miss the statutory deadline for   issue remediable service statement to doctor and they be now push the deadline back to december in mid march the government confirm that just statement have be issue out of as of yesterday ’s write statement there be still more than outstanding this create huge tax liability uncertainty 
 we and the british medical association have be raise concern for month why have it take the government so long to act minister have announce a revise delivery plan but how will it work in practice will there be more staff to help with the backlog what change be be put in place to ensure that the deadline be not miss again 
 what be most concerning however be the complete absence of any mention of the remediable pension saving statement in the write statement this issue really matter as doctor who be take on overtime or who work privately rely on these statement to be able to track their contribution and avoid excessive tax bill accord to dr sharma from the bma 
 there ’ no doubt that without up to date information doctor will be pre emptively reduce or turn down extra work to avoid additional pension bill that they might not even be due 
 the statutory deadline for the statement be as we hear   october in february ministers confirm that be outstanding and that the majority would be issue by the end of february by march however the backlog have actually grow to can the minister explain how legal deadline have be miss will the government be follow up with the regulator to ensure that this do not happen again do the government have confidence in the nhs business services authority with the secretary of state abolish nhs england what do this mean for the future of this vital organisation 
 we all want to see waiting list fall but as newspaper put it today 
 labour ’s pledge to slash nhs waiting list be be sabotage by a litany of administrative error pension delay and punitive tax rule 
 i urge the government to take swift action 
 as i outline in my response and in the write ministerial statement we have take action we be make aware of some of these problem when we come into office in july and we have push the nhs business services authority to move fast than it would have do under the hon gentleman ’s government so that action be happen quick than it would have do before we do have faith in the nhs business services authority to get on with this and ensure that there be no financial detriment in line with the timetable outline yesterday and as i have far make clear today 
 madam deputy speaker the hon gentleman could have ask i more about waiting list which have fall for the last month in a row he could have ask i about the more appointment that have be provide to deliver for patient month early he could have ask i about the hundred more gps who be now work in the health service or the impact of cancel the strike on service for people or the record funding in fact last week in the chamber he speak on behalf of the national pharmacy association this week he could have congratulate the minister for care who be sit next to i on the agreement to produce more pharmacy service 
 we be make improvement to the nhs every day the darzi report report not only the breadth but the depth of the decline that we inherit we be resolve that and fix the fundamental of the nhs 
 i thank the minister for come to the house and give her response we all know the issue she be talk about when she mention the state of the nhs that we inherit and i echo that with the issue i hear about from patient and staff at princess alexandra hospital in harlow on pension can she outline what the government have do to mitigate the delay in the process 
 it be important that people have confidence in the pension system that be why we take action in july on come into office to understand the depth of the problem that occur under the previous government this be a complicated issue which be why we want to be clear with people that there will be no financial detriment to they we will continue to work with employer and trade union to ensure that the issue be resolve as quickly as possible in line with the timeline i have outline 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the delay will be deeply worrying and will make financial planning very difficult for those affect all of whom be people who have dedicate their working life to support the nhs and tirelessly save life nhs worker and their family be be leave in the dark by government delay and may as a result miss out on use their full allowance which be unacceptable they deserve well 
 the revise delivery plan prioritise member base on their likelihood of face financial detriment so clearly some financial detriment be expect for those who be impact can the minister estimate what the likely financial detriment be of miss the statutory deadline or how much compensation as she just mention be likely to be pay can she tell we why the nhs business services authority have fail to meet the deadline in response to a write question from my hon friend   the member for st albans daisy cooper the minister say that there be people work on it will she confirm whether that be likely to be sufficient to ensure that future deadline be meet 
 i thank the hon lady for her question i do not have to hand the exact number of people work on this but i will make sure that i respond to she on that point in writing we be ensure that individual do not face detriment as a result of these delay the nhs cost claim back compensation scheme provide resource for direct financial loss incur by the nhs pension scheme member impact by the mccloud remedy include professional service fee and certain hmrc interest charge that may arise as i outline in my statement hmrc have also confirm that self assessment late filing penalty will be waive on appeal in certain circumstance where a member receive a delay pension saving statement as a consequence of the implementation of the mccloud remedy 
 do the minister agree that it be important that the affected member receive those statement to allow informed decision make the government have work to minimise financial detriment to those affect but this issue be part of the mess we have be clear up we have have record investment into pharmacy and more gps and we have cut waiting list and stop the junior doctor strike we be on the road to recovery 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we be on the road to recovery and that of course be what the opposition can not stand this be a complicated issue as they well know as i say we inherit this complication in july when we be make well aware of it the conservatives could have do more about it while they be in government but it be yet another issue on which they have let people down this time it be staff 
 we will ensure that we remedy that the timeline be available in the write ministerial statement that i issue yesterday we will continue to work with trade union and employer to ensure that people understand as my hon friend say it be important that people do understand their own personal position 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 i have to say that i be none the wiser about what exactly have happen if we be to ensure that this will not happen again that these deadline will be meet we need to know how we get into this position it may well be the fault of the previous government will this government commit to a full review of exactly how we get here so that we can ensure that the publish deadline be meet this time 
 the chair of the health and social care committee make a good point as she so often do about what go on previously this be an issue from the mccloud judgment that run across many department it be a problem under previous government start with the coalition government i know that the public accounts committee on which i serve and the treasury committee have look at the matter over time the department will certainly co operate with any inquiry and investigate what happen across government i be happy to get back to the hon lady on that point 
 this issue appear to be yet another example of the hangover leave by the previous conservative government do the minister agree that part of get the nhs back on its foot include clean up this mess and cut waiting list which have already drop for month in a row 
 my hon friend make absolutely the right point as i have say lord darzi have helpfully outline the breadth of the mess that we inherit back in july and it make for stark reading we have still not have an apology from the conservative party so i be happy to take an intervention now if anybody decide to provide in these issue we be see the depth   of the destruction that the conservatives have cause widely across government we will continue to fix that on behalf of the british people 
 i declare my interest as a practise doctor and a public sector pensioner who have be through the mccloud process do the minister understand that we will not improve productivity in the nhs as far as doctor be concerned if they continue to retire routinely in their mid-50 in their prime they do so because their accountant tell they that they would be foolish not to give the fiscal environment and the structure of the nhs pension scheme 
 i understand that point obviously it be a source of much discussion the change come about during the pandemic to encourage people to return to work and it be a complex issue we want to continue to use the skill of doctor at all stage of their career and we shall continue to work with they the british medical association and other to make sure that there be no detriment to their return to service in the nhs 
 i declare an interest as a member of the nhs pension scheme can the minister confirm that this issue arise only because the previous government carry out their nhs pension reform in a way that be find to be age discriminatory more widely do she agree that give nhs staff the term and condition and the reward and recognition that they deserve also require prompt action each year on agree the nhs pay award which the conservative party routinely fail to do when in government 
 my hon friend make an excellent point on our commitment to staff to be clear on their term and condition and our commitment to honour that reward that be why we act promptly when we come into office we have issue statement and provide answer to parliamentary question to make sure that people be clear about the system and that we be transparent 
 it take rather a long time to train a doctor up to year so it be a good job that the previous government have the opportunity to train more doctor will the minister look at aspect of concern which be that if doctor start reduce their overtime hour because of fiscal aspect it will hamper the opportunity to get more patient treat and to shorten the length of waiting list 
 as i say in response to   the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison we understand that and we will continue to work with all staff in the nhs to make sure that we deliver on our commitment to reduce waiting list which be leave at a shocking level by the previous government 
 i have a constituent who be suffer both financial and emotional distress as a result of these circumstance i write to the nhs business services authority and it take month to get a response in write question to the government i have ask how i might make representation about   my constituent be affect by financial distress the response that i receive from ministers simply say that nhsbsa have all the evidence that it need and there be no need for anyone to provide extra evidence there be a very real risk that some people who be affect by this be suffer financial distress but have not be identify by nhsbsa for those people can the minister please outline what mechanism we as member can use to make those people know to nhsbsa so that they can access their pension choice early 
 i be sorry to hear about the emotional and financial distress of the hon lady ’s constituent if there be a gap i be happy to go back to the nhsbsa on her behalf and make sure that i update the house 
 do the minister have full confidence in the chair of the nhs business services authority 
 as i say in my statement we have confidence in the business authority to undertake the action that i have outline 
 i thank the minister for her answer to the question waiting list be clearly beyond the pale if the government be able to address the remedial pension saving statement we might be in well position to entice our doctor to take on additional hour will the minister confirm that this be a government priority and that there be an understanding that a function nhs require straightforward path to work overtime and payment at every level 
 of our major priority be ensure that the entire nhs workforce be do the work that they be train and commit to do so that they can get down those waiting list and deliver an nhs that be fit for the future the staff as lord darzi have outline have feel very severely the detriment cause by the previous government they be work under really difficult condition and we want to make sure that through the year plan and the nhs long term workforce plan we offer they hope so that they be ready to deliver the service that they have be train to deliver
