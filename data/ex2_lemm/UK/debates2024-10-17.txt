 the prime minister and the chancellor make it clear that the uk have an enormous amount to offer as do all the high profile investor who speak at the summit include esteemed business figure such as larry fink eric swartz ruth porat and more we have make clear our commitment to growth and restore economic stability and we have give business the confidence that they need for the long term business be safe in the knowledge that the uk at last have a government whose central mission be to grow the economy and stimulate private investment thereby end the chaos and churn of the last year 
 as both the prime minister and the chancellor have set out increase investment into the uk be the government ’s no priority to drive growth our mission drive approach allow we to think in term of year not week and to commit to the hard yard require to break down the silos that have too often prevent effective government and get in the way of real growth drive change 
 this be about ambitious policymaking for the long term not stick plaster politic as the chancellor say early this week 
 if the challenge be growth investment be the solution 
 i be delighted to say that as a result of the stability dividend introduce by this government we announce a record break £ of shovel ready investment across the country more than at any previous summit and more than double the total of last year ’s summit from global company such as eli lilly servicenow holtec and many other 
 i thank the shadow minister for his response and welcome he to his place i know that he will want to be a keen champion for the early year sector and i be glad to hear he welcome the update that i have give to the house 
 as i say in my statement labour be committed to the delivery of expand entitlement across government the last government leave significant challenge but we be not shirk that responsibility with labour the early year sector can rest assure that we will be work tirelessly to deliver a wide sea change in early education as well as high and rise standard throughout the education system 
 let i now deal with some of the hon gentleman ’s specific point it be clear to i from my consultation and engagement with parent and provider so far that we have inherit a pledge without a plan and the consequence of that be inherit delivery challenge relate to workforce and place i appreciate the point that the hon gentleman make about the workforce i believe by reset the relationship with the workforce we can have a much more positive relationship with the sector in the future 
 over child have benefit from the entitlement offer since september this year which demonstrate that we be actively engage and work with parent to promote opportunity to take up the offer we will continue to do so 
 on school base nursery the pilot during the testing phase be for place from april our ambition be for place over the course of this parliament i look forward to work with the hon member constructively to bring about the change that early year education so desperately need 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be absolutely delighted to hear of his enthusiasm for the scheme which will make a huge difference to community up and down our country we be start a test and learn phase in april the roll out will be in september we want to learn from that approach and i would be delighted to work with he on this matter 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to deliver my maiden speech in this important debate on international investment the benefit of which will be feel right across all region of our country 
 i want to begin by pay tribute to my predecessor mark eastwood he be a dedicated servant to his previous constituency of dewsbury on behalf of myself and our community i say thank you 
 be the member for the area in which i grow up be truly the honour of my life i will forever be grateful to the people across ossett and denby dale who put their faith in i to represent the area that i proudly call home i pay tribute to the labour member across the constituency especially stalwart member robert gosling without whom i would not be stand here today 
 i would also like to take the opportunity to thank my parent for their support as well as my brother who have always be there for i during some of the most challenging time i be delighted that they have travel from wakefield to be in the public gallery today their own commitment to our community in their long career of public service work hard and talk straight be principle that i hope to emulate here my mum be so committed to the north that this be her ever trip to london proof be it ever need that us northerner only come south if somebody make we 
 i know many member have already speak about the beauty of their patch but with respect i must make the case for ossett and denby dale drive from ossett towards the wakefield rural village and into   denby dale the sky widen and the moor roll out before you on that drive when i see the emley moor mast appear from the horizon build tall than the eiffel tower i know i be home it be beautiful it be yorkshire and it be the place that make i who i be today 
 it be not just those moor and view that move i it be also the people who call they home we be people of talent community and as good yorkshire folk say hard graft in fact that beautiful landscape be the fruit of exactly that graft of that talent you see it in the pit dig across the countryside that serve to fuel and heat our nation you see it in the field plough plant and graze by countless generation to feed not just yorkshire but the rest of the country you see it in the town market which have bustle with small trader craftsman and local farmer for generation that landscape be not just the cradle of talent but a product of it 
 each town each village have its own community its own culture all quietly proudly distinct as well as hard work these town and village be famous for their culture their creativity and their heritage home to brass band morris dancer maypole and even a doctor who but most importantly of all the world ’s great rugby league team wakefield trinity labour may be a party of the union but in west yorkshire when it come to rugby we watch the proper stuff and as you will know madam deputy speaker that be league 
 we be also home to yorkshire sculpture park with its barbara hepworths and henry moores and the national coal mining museum which root we in our proud history i be enthusiastic sometimes maybe a little too enthusiastic that my constituency contain so many wonderful pub and brewer we have the ever expand ossett brewery and our famous yearly festival ossett beercart 
 just as we work hard and play hard we also pie hard indeed for over year the people of denby dale have mark special occasion in the only way i think appropriate by bake enormous pie to feed thousand some even as long as foot with tonne of filling and pint of bitter that history and that culture must be champion it be yorkshire culture it be our culture 
 but i refuse to talk about my community only in the past tense about opportunity we use to have and industry we use to lead indeed i want my successor in this place to be celebrate the creativity and achievement of child be bear in my constituency today sadly however the social mobility commission recently report that many young people in ossett and denby dale and other post industrial community across our nation face an uphill battle grow up in a rural town i know that feel all too well that the place you be from be overlook forget even that opportunity be few and far between and that the only path to success in life be leave your family your friend your home after briefly live in london in my twenty for work i remember feel like the token northerner with the funny accent i find myself have to speak eloquently so folk down here could actually understand i the only problem with that be that when i get back home my friend and family would ask i why i be speak so posh it actually make i feel quite lost 
 young people in ossett and denby dale and in town and village across our country should not feel like they have to get out to get ahead and yet so many of they do to talk solely about what be once possible in our community be to betray those young people instead our politic must be build on their dream and on their potential decent secure job with reliable public transport to get they there good affordable housing where they can build their family and their future high quality education and skill training access to creativity and culture aspiration hope 
 england be a nation of town and village like mine of community of culture of graft for england to succeed town and village must succeed and it will be my mission in this place to see that happen

 thank you madam deputy speaker for allow i to make my maiden speech when i drive around my congleton constituency i thank my lucky star that i have the privilege of both live in and represent somewhere   so very beautiful it be make up of gorgeous rolling countryside farmland hedgerow and oak tree the farmer work all hour to produce the food that we need it have view of the giant radio telescope at jodrell bank and the natural beauty spot bosley cloud it be arcadia within commute distance of manchester crewe and stoke and i can not tell the house how much i truly love it 
 the constituency be a grow place with around extra house in the last few year the population be divide between the cheshire market town of alsager sandbach and congleton alongside the large village of holmes chapel and many beautiful small village such as rode heath church lawton and goostrey there can be few more idyllic spot in the country than sit outside the swettenham arms next to the lovell arboretum overlook st peter ’s the archetypal village church 
 though each town and village have its own unique character and history the joy and challenge experience by the family who live there be often remarkably similar they include family whose child have special educational need and disability who often face extensive challenge get the diagnosis and support that they need those family need our help and i will do everything that i can to assist they i have be pleased to hear the prime minister refer repeatedly in this chamber to those difficulty and i be confident that he will help we too 
 family will also benefit from labour ’s review of share parental leave some woman a year lose their job when they be pregnant or on maternity leave woman actually out earn man in their 20 the gender pay gap be in many respect actually a motherhood penalty man take long period of paternity leave be a way that we could normalise parental leave and potentially reduce those problem i thank the government for start the consultation on this matter imminently i pay tribute to campaign group such as pregnant then screwed rights of women the dad shift parent out loud and the tuc and trade union which be all do incredible thing in this field 
 many homeowner in my constituency have be affect by leasehold and fleecehold problem and will welcome our plan reform on these issue to which i intend to contribute they include old people often the backbone of our community who provide childcare for grandchild and often volunteer as well sometimes however they do so in avoidable pain while on nhs waiting list that be too long those be just a few of the issue that i intend to apply myself to as mp for congleton 
 let i take the house back to congleton ’s history congleton be know as beartown owe to a local story that in the 1600 the town save up to buy a new bible shortly before the summer fête the village bear die so the townsfolk agree that rather than buy their bible they would postpone the purchase and get a new bear with the money instead congleton be very entrepreneurial across the whole constituency and many of our small business feature reference to the bear it be also in our local iconography everywhere we have the beartown tap and beartown beer the bear feature pretty much everywhere as do our fantastic statue of elizabeth wolstenholme elmy which be lobby and fundraise for by local feminist elizabeth who base herself in congleton from until her death in play a    significant role in the woman ’s suffrage movement found the woman ’s social and political union and campaign for woman ’s education and voting right i hope that i shall think of she often in this place 
 another of our most famous local figure although quite different be harry styles whose hometown of holmes chapel be now a point of pilgrimage for his fan i be sure that everyone be sorry to hear today of the death of his former bandmate liam payne we all extend our condolence to his friend and family local people have set up a walk trail associate with harry styles if anyone fancy it i would strongly recommend follow it with a stop in any of our local independent business on holmes chapel high street i would probably include a drink at the george and dragon or the bottle bank or both i know that both publican do a lot of voluntary work within our community 
 people volunteer be common in my constituency as i know it be in the constituency of many other member whether they be coach football at vale juniors or any of the other community sport club there be too many for i to list planting tree and conserve and maintain our woodland and footpath as the sandbach woodland and wildlife group do and as a similar group do in congleton help young people through uniformed group such as scout guide and the various air cadet some of which i have visit run scheme to support man ’s mental health such as the goostrey community shed holmes chapel men in sheds or the new sandbach man walk and talking group or even run a community energy power plant in congleton hydro we have the most amazing set of citizen i be so grateful for the fantastic contribution that they make to help other support those who need it and truly make my constituency the fantastic place that it be 
 on the topic of contribution i pay tribute to my predecessor fiona bruce congleton have have mp in its history all of they woman ann winterton fiona bruce and now i i know that many christians in the constituency and beyond appreciated fiona bruce ’s advocacy on behalf of the religious community both in the uk and internationally in her role as envoy for religious freedom we have many active local church group in our community and they contribute a great deal of very varied support church and secular volunteer and organisation include food bank food pantry and the old saw mill be all quietly provide much need food support within the community they do this for a far large number of adult and child than the apparent affluence of the area would superficially lead to expect 
 as a discrimination lawyer and someone who go into politic because of the value that i place on equality and inclusion i will continue to advocate for the right and freedom of all my constituent and celebrate the diversity within our community i recently attend the world festival in alsager which be establish by margaret keeling year ago it celebrate the diversity of nationality live within the alsager community with food activity and lot of performance from local schoolchildren it really be a delight thank you margaret 
 another of the many achievement of the fantastic volunteer in my constituency be that we have regular pride event congleton hold its pride about year ago i pay tribute to richard walton ronan clayton and all those who be involve in set it up it be now ably chair by malcolm pope who be take it from strength to strength the excellent curator anna maluk put on a pride exhibition in congleton museum host photo from those early event and feature art from the local lgbtqia+ community since then more pride event have grow in sandbach alsager and for the time this summer holmes chapel at of these event it be suggest to i that these be really just a family fun day a village fête if you will it be true that the event be fun fabulous and family friendly but beyond the live music and bright clothing remain a serious message the hard work volunteer who make these pride event happen do so in the face of repeat homophobic hate crime 
 similarly there be still a backdrop of fear attendant in many woman ’s daily life woman in my constituency have write or speak to i about their experience of sexual violence i say to the young woman who have talk to i you know who you be that i will fight for you and all young people in this place every day that will include ensure that when embrace new technology and innovation as we have do this week at the international investment summit we find way of protect people from new threat whether that be people look at tractor on their smartphone in this workplace or artificial intelligence bake in discriminatory decision making unfortunately new technology also bring the potential for harassment discrimination and abuse and we must not be catch off guard we must get on the front foot on that 
 my constituency have a long history of develop new technology the constituency boundary bisect the site of jodrell bank the amazing radio telescope sandbach be the proud home of erf and foden truck the foden traction engine be build in sandbach in and that be follow by the production of heavy good vehicle for year the history and heritage of foden still run through the blood of the town with the annual transport festival and its incredible parade of vintage truck wagon classic car and even the odd plane on the common my constituency be also home to of the world ’s lead brass band foden ’s band which be bear out of the work in and have twice win and twice be runner up in the national brass band championship of great britain i will work across this house to stand up for the incredible entrepreneurial and community minded people and business of the beautiful place that be the congleton constituency 
 lastly i want to say some thank yous i thank the volunteer who help i to get here and continue to support i to whom i be very grateful that include those from the labour party and i make special mention of the fabian women ’s network mentoring scheme i thank my adore family who be in the public gallery today when i be in westminster i miss you so much i hope i do all of you proud 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i start by congratulate my hon friend   the member for buckingham and bletchley callum anderson   on his powerful maiden speech i be not sure that when he and i attend a birmingham university labour students meet back in either of we anticipate that we would be make our maiden speech in the same debate 
 i want to start by say what an honour it be to stand here as the member of parliament for banbury as a banbury lad who have never seek to represent anywhere else i want to repeat what i tell resident on the doorstep during the campaign this be the job i have always want to everyone who help make that happen i can only say thank you i also want those   resident to know that now i have this job i promise that i will work hard every day to deliver for they whether they vote for i or not 
 what make this an even prouder moment for i be that i stand here as the labour member of parliament for the banbury constituency until   july the constituency have remain in the hand of party for year but change be something that banbury the large town in oxfordshire have get use to over recent year for those who do not know the banbury constituency be at the furth point north in the south east region encompass not just the town of banbury but the town of chipping norton and charlbury as well as countless village and roll countryside 
 banbury be a beautiful part of the world to live in and represent it be most famous for our nursery rhyme know across the english speak world 
 ride a cock horse to banbury cross 
 to see a fine lady upon a white horse 
 with ring on her finger and bell on her toe 
 she shall have music wherever she go 
 banbury ’s history be more than that though indeed it be more than just the town itself the constituency reflect our country ’s history include in its foundation and its landscape we have the neolithic and bronze age rollright stone the settlement on the edge of chipping norton leave to we by the romans the norman castle mound at deddington and broughton castle which as well be a stunning late medieval stately home be likely to be recognisable to many member as the setting for tv ’s wolf hall and the film shakespeare in love and men and a little lady i be once tell that of the only request to film there that the owner decline be when the studio want to paint it pink which be probably wise 
 in the village of wroxton where i go to school we have the former home of lord north he be also bury in wroxton give we something that not all constituency have the rest place of a former prime minister bliss mill tooley ’s boatyard and the oxford canal be all remnant of the area ’s growth during the industrial revolution 
 but the most colourful time in our history be undoubtedly the civil war when banbury itself be on the side of the roundhead despite its castle right in the middle of the town be on the side of the cavalier the people of banbury be so unmistakeably puritan that a poem be write about it 
 to banbury come i o profane 
 where i see a puritane 
 hang of his cat on monday 
 for killing of a mouse on sunday 
 more happily the puritans be the nickname for the only supporter own football club in oxfordshire banbury united 
 i mention all this not just because i be really proud of where i call home and its role in our past but because i want the house to understand what the banbury constituency be all about although it do not change hand politically between and change do come to banbury in a big way old industry such as make cloth in chipping norton or aluminium in banbury go while new one such as logistic with company such as dhl and twe haulage food processing with fine lady bakeries and go fresh and   high end mechanical engineering with the haas formula team and prodrive come in instead other industry such as brewing move within the constituency we can no long get a pint in a hunt edmunds pub but hooky beer from hook norton be on sale across the united kingdom 
 the building of the m40 in many way permanently change banbury from a small semi industrial market town into something completely different thousand of new home have go up as our area have become increasingly attractive for commuter to oxford and london but we still have a council waiting list that have quadruple in a decade and a private sector that can not meet the need meanwhile vital infrastructure such as school road and health service have fail to meet demand pose fair question from the community for those like i who support the government ’s ambitious house building agenda 
 while they have change banbury chipping norton charlbury and the village of north and west oxfordshire have not lose their sense of community the community unite across political divide and none in defence of our local horton general hospital when it be face with downgrading successfully fight it off in and less successfully in 
 as the use of food bank grow in the year after people across the area come together to help support those in need for example the chippy larder in chipping norton have become a much love community resource food security in banbury can not be consider without mention our rural farming community and perhaps the most famous farm in the country clarkson ’s farm for all the entertainment that the series have provide for i the most important aspect of it be the light that it shin on the huge challenge face by our farmer and not just in the banbury constituency but throughout the uk i hope that the government ’s programme to support they will relieve many of the burden that have make farming so challenge for so long 
 southill solar farm on the edge of the wychwood forest near charlbury provide community own power to home that be another reason i be so passionate about this government ’s exciting agenda on renewable energy 
 then there be the volunteer driver service in banbury take the elderly or those less able to hospital and gp appointment at nominal rate throughout the pandemic as in other place people across banbury work hard to help those less fortunate during that most testing of time banbury ’s community lead by some of its many thousand of polish citizen get together again to gather supply to support the ukrainian civilian flee that conflict while welcome other into their home and community 
 on that note i pay tribute to my predecessor victoria prentis although there be much in the campaign that we disagree on this side of the house be unite with the conservative party in support for ukraine i pay tribute to victoria ’s decency and her clear compassion for humanity exemplify as much by she take a ukrainian refugee into her home as by her year of service to the community 
 as for myself i stand here in support of this government and their mandate for change something that banbury have a history of embrace before i finish i want to thank my family for their support in particular my wife   who despite have multiple sclerosis remain the strong most steady and most stable woman i have ever meet i stand here as someone banbury bear and breed ready to build a well britain and a well banbury and i be determined to do it 
 i call yuan yang to make her maiden speech 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for bournemouth west jessica toale   on her wonderful maiden speech i know that her international background and deep expertise in international development will add much richness to our new parliamentary labour party and i also believe that an international background be essential to enrich the perspective on our side of the house 
 in my previous life before come into this place i spend year interview the leader of international business many of whom have long stand commitment to investment in the uk but who repeatedly tell i and my former colleague at the financial times that   political instability be put they off make future investment that be why i very much welcome the remark of our minister on the international investment summit and the importance of the private sector ’s partnership with our government 
 the year project that we have for national renewal along with our year industrial strategy show our commitment to long term economic ambition and planning i congratulate the organiser of the summit which bring together more than industry leader and secure more than £ of investment that be more than be raise last year and it will create nearly job of which be bring elton john out of retirement unfortunately private investment in the uk since the global financial crisis have be much less rocket man and more tiny dancer 
 over the last decade and a half britain have experience a much large slowdown in the growth of capital intensity than comparative country such as the us france and germany and it be that alongside our skill growth which account for our productivity puzzle i very much welcome the appointment of john van reenen the wonderful lse economist to our council of economic advisors he have do important work on productivity in the uk and he suggest that our post financial crisis fall in productivity growth be primarily due to a large fall in capital accumulation in other word british worker be be hold back by low level of public and private investment and that be what our government need to unlock to succeed in our growth mission 
 we will provide stability but stability alone be not enough in the century we must do more to provide industry and business leader with the leadership that they require to navigate our increasingly complex geopolitical world in which there be fragmentation of supply chain across the world as well as the green transition that mean an industrial strategy i welcome the publication of our government ’s industrial strategy early this month and particularly the focus on life science as of the key sector for investment 
 my constituency of earley and woodley in the thames valley be a prime location for foreign direct investment particularly in life science and i be proud that the thames valley be the fast grow region in the uk outside london i congratulate the thames valley chamber of commerce with which i have already work in my day on secure over the last decade more than instance of foreign direct investment we can measure the excitement of business and the private sector for our labour government by the amount of engagement i have already have from business in my constituency and through thames valley chamber of commerce 
 the biopharmaceutical group lonza which be swiss in origin receive a grant of £ over the summer to expand and relocate to my constituency in the thames valley park which be of business park in the area alongside thames valley science park and green park i recently meet bayer originally a german company which employ hundred of people at its headquarters in my constituency and contribute to crucial health and life science research in the uk 
 advancement in life science have fundamentally improve not just the economy and innovation of the uk but the length and quality of life here and around the world that be why i welcome the health secretary ’s   mission to ensure that the nhs receive the cut edge treatment be pioneer by company in my constituency and beyond life science investment if do correctly can be a significant driver of growth and productivity our central mission i look forward very much to meet the minster for industry next week to discuss how we can give full range to life science company in our constituency and to the clinical research take place in the royal berkshire hospital which be at the forefront of much research in medical trial that hospital will benefit greatly from private and public investment 
 business do not exist in isolation and what make some country prosper be the strength of their institution responsible and highly productive business wish to retain their skilled workforce who require country with well function public service provision infrastructure and accessible housing those company want political stability and a regulatory framework that work for business worker and the consumer that be why labour ’s pitch to business do not end with the international investment summit but continue with legislation that the government be pass such as the employment rights bill provide the foundation for business to thrive mean fix the foundation of our economy and society and that be what i be proud to say our labour government will do 
 diolch yn fawr iawn i thank you madam deputy speaker for the privilege of make my maiden speech in this house i follow a long list of maiden speech and so i perhaps offer no novelty but i will take the opportunity of offer familiarity 
 i come to this debate on the international investment summit have spend the last decade on the frontline of investment back the inventor of artificial intelligence datum and wide software business across this country and the united states i therefore know the cause with depth and personal experience and in particular i know that no working age person in this country have see a start up go to the ftse top in the united states out of have experience that in the last decade of innovation britons in this country and in the vale of glamorgan have be deny the opportunity of shape their destiny decline no more because i know from speak to investor include those at the summit that they believe what i know with this labour government change be on the way and have begin 
 my role have be to put the vale of glamorgan front and centre in that wave of change but i start by also recognise the dual impact that change in this house always have for every maiden contribution there be a contribution that have be and in my case i wish to recognise that of my predecessor the right hon alun cairns conservative mp for the vale of glamorgan for year in those year alun serve our constituency with sincerity in fact he be so sincere that i remember knock on door in cadoxton in barry with the good constituency labour party in the country only to have my hope dash by a lovely elderly lady who say i be go to be vote for alun the good labour mp   this town have ever have we all carry an inflated sense of our personal vote in this house beyond our political allegiance but in that moment i have to say that i feel and see i congratulate alun on his service and wish he the good with the inevitable duality of change that we share but i also commit to he some continuity in the service that he and his predecessor the labour mp john smith offer the constituent of the vale of glamorgan and continuity also because the cause of barry ’s development which i know alun initiate will echo for year to come as my top priority too 
 i offer continuity because in fact the vale of glamorgan stand out for its continuity there be continuity as the world centre of education it be in llantwit major and st illtud ’s church that the uk ’s college be sit not only home to st illtud but also host to st david in the early century in be in cowbridge in that of the gorsedd of the bards be host by iolo morganwg since then a font of appreciation for the welsh language welsh literature and welsh poetry 
 there be continuity not just in education but in energy with barry be the world ’s powerhouse and the large coal export port in this country and indeed the large in the world in and with aberthaw not just of the most advanced power plant of its time but now the host of my and my constituent future dream of a centre of excellence in green energy 
 alongside energy and education there be continuity in the world ’s pinnacle of natural beauty a title i will only share perhaps with my hon friend   the member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes with our share welsh background my hon friend from dorset and devon might have the jurassic coast but i confess that in the heritage coast of the vale of glamorgan we have every bit of the beauty and the history and perhaps for be a well keep secret a bright future too 
 finally there be continuity not just across education energy and the beauty that we have but in the heart and humour of the people of the vale of glamorgan barry be the town that host gavin and stacey and in particular the heart and humour of uncle bryn my favourite character who when drive down the m4 blast out james blunt song have be a personal inspiration to i each time i leave this esteemed chamber for the even more esteemed comfort of barrybados 
 i have see the heart of the community spirit across the vale of glamorgan in big bocs bwyd which be an initiative across school that start in barry and now go beyond it ensure that no child go hungry when they be learn there be the real struggle and the fight that i see each week in the vale domestic abuse services in my constituency fight the onslaught of violence against woman that we have see not just in the vale but across this country and there be the powerful heart of the voice choir of barry llantwit major and cowbridge which be able to combine the pure heart of calon lân with the deep optimism of the greatest showman in night 
 i come here with news of the heart and humour of the vale of glamorgan but also to report its honest challenge we have the honest challenge of barry where when deliver medicine as a volunteer i learn that the pharmacist be issue multiple of painkiller per patient compare with the same pharmacist in cardiff we have the honest challenge of our beautiful farmland where and fourth- generation farming   family be fight a great but difficult fight against the combine challenge of weather disease and uncertainty we have the honest challenge of the veteran of the vale of glamorgan who be not seek the world but simply seek a bit of public service for the exceptional national service they give we 
 money do not buy most thing in life it do not solve most of our problem but its absence and the deprivation entrench over the last decade be at the root of many of they in particular that have chip away at the dignity of my community that be why i come here with the twin ambition of great prosperity and a deep bond of dignity in the vale of glamorgan and across the uk i do so not as a political slogan or out of political theory but out of a history of personal gratitude because it be year ago that the vale of glamorgan and south wales include cardiff offer a newly arrive set of parent the opportunity of a minimum wage and a night shift to subsidise the sleep of their young boy in the absence of any holiday it be barry island that give those young boy the opportunity of relief and perhaps even some delight over the weekend 
 it be south wales where i grow up with my brother in a situation of particular economic stress where i feel through the deep privilege of education that i could go on to advise the prime minister and the civil service to advise ftse board across the city to invest in tomorrow ’s inventor and ultimately to stand before the house as wales ’s member of parliament from an ethnic minority background when i stand for my twin ambition of prosperity and dignity for the vale i will do so out of that personal history of gratitude for as long as i serve as the vale ’s voice here in westminster i will fight each day for the people in my community 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of visitor levy in scotland and wales on inbound uk tourism 
 responsibility for tourism levy be devolve but we want to watch what happen in scotland and wales with close interest of my main hope be to increase the number of international visitor to the uk and ensure more and more visitor come not only to london and the south east but travel across the whole united kingdom 
 impose taxis on tourist will only discourage people from enjoy the good of what the scottish borders and scotland have to offer many small rural business be struggle to sustain themselves so i fear the extra tax propose by the scottish government will be the last straw do the minister share my concern about the impact that will have on tourism in scotland will the government undertake an impact study on the effect the tax will have on tourism not just in scotland but across the uk 
 despite have be a member of the scottish parliament the hon gentleman do not seem to understand the basis of devolution this be a matter for the scottish government to decide we want to have a very positive relationship with the scottish administration and for that matter the administration in wales of course we will look at this the uk government have no plan to introduce visitor levy at the moment although there be potential benefit that might accrue to local community if they could be get right but the idea of we investigate what the scottish government be do would be completely wrong 
 what step the government be take to promote the scottish highlands as a film location for movie and television

 i wholeheartedly welcome that answer scotland have great potential if i say that the traitors be film at ardross castle in my constituency the secretary of state will know what i be talk about i take the point that these matter be devolve but mr angus robertson seem to flip flop when it come to fund the art so i would be grateful for everything the secretary of state can do to get netflix or whoever to look hard at the highlands 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to draw attention to scotland ’s huge cultural asset i be pleased to meet with my scottish government counterpart when i visit the edinburgh fringe over the summer i know from the international investment summit which the government convene early this week that partner like netflix and many other international investor see the enormous value of scotland and the attraction of invest there this government will do everything we can to support that and we will put rocket booster under the creative industry in scotland

 access to those facility be vital for mental health and community cohesion no more so than in the small town and village that make up my constituency do the minister agree that even in place like that we must have equal access to such facility 
 i completely agree with my hon friend i be pleased to visit her constituency a few month ago i represent a similar area with a collection of town and village wherever community be across the country we want to ensure they have access to local facility it be so important to get people active particularly for mental health and wellbeing

 order that be a very long question

 what recent discussion she have have with representative of the creative industry on ai 
 i have have many meeting with the creative industry which have raise ai at every single i make it absolutely clear that human creativity deserve remuneration wherever we end up the right of artist musician publisher and journalist need to be protect while we garner the significant benefit of artificial intelligence 
 ai generate creation that mimic real people deepfake can lead to financial and reputational damage for musician and other creative however as the domestic violence charity refuge point out last year the most common ai generate deepfake be non consensual sexual depiction of woman how do the government plan to ensure that creative as well as woman and girl be adequately protect from the misappropriation of their voice image name and likeness 
 i be glad that my hon friend have raise this important issue that affect many people in the word of stephen sondheim art be not easy and neither be the legislation in this area but we be determined to look into it it be already a criminal offence to share an intimate image without consent whether real or synthetically generate and we will deliver on our manifesto commitment to ban the creation of sexually explicit deepfake

 it be absolutely essential that we protect intellectual property which be of the key thing this country have to sell we have already have meeting with representative from the creative industry and tech company and we be keen to move forward 
 i welcome the hon gentleman on his décolleté appearance at the dispatch box however i gently push back on his suggestion as i think the previous government have embrace bucks fizz more than anything else

 the previous government do absolutely nothing in this territory we be determined to get to a proper resolution that satisfy the need of both the creative industry and artificial intelligence

 the horseracing industry which be a british success story be dependent on income from responsible gambling i be glad to hear what the secretary of state say about responsibly enjoy a flutter this be nothing like some of the problem gambling that we see online and the proportion of bet on horserace that be deem to be problematic be comparable to the proportion of problematic user of   the national lottery what plan do she have to reform the bet levy and the affordability check that have be in train for some time 
 i should tell the house that the tote be headquarter in my constituency of wigan which give i an insight into the industry which i have have a relationship with for many year there will be a debate on horserace next thursday in westminster hall this industry be worth £ to the uk economy so this government certainly take it incredibly seriously baroness twycross be have discussion with representative from across the industry and i be sure that she would be delighted to discuss this with the hon member as well

 i be grateful to the minister for his answer i understand the need to look at secondary ticketing but dynamic pricing be a contractual bargain between buyer and seller base on supply and demand   it actually give we cheap ticket as well as more expensive one do he really want the government to get involve there i know that the prime minister want everyone to be able to afford concert ticket but what be wrong with the way that he get they 
 the truth be that dynamic pricing have many different form and some of they be good for instance early bird ticket benefit many people as do buy last minute ticket for the theatre we will not interfere with that but we will have a call for evidence about how that work in relation to live event on ticket pricing the real scandal be that for example the face value of stand ticket for coldplay at wembley on   august   be £ but when i check stubhub this morning they cost £ that be the real scandal and that be what we be go to deal with

 the secretary of state believe that it be not good policy that count but good vibe the violent indifference that lead   to a booming creative sector be no long the culture war be over and we the vanquished submit ourselves for re education along with the rest of the public the problem be that every dcms sector tell we that they want more than vibe they need decision and they want a budget that will deliver can she tell we whether she be among the panicked ministers who have write to the chancellor about the budget and their spending ask and which have she list as her priority 
 i be not entirely sure what the vibe issue be but i will say that i do not need to write to the chancellor unlike under the previous government we have a very close relationship and we tend to pick up the phone when discussion need to be have alongside the chancellor the secretary of state for business and trade and the prime minister i be pleased this week to welcome £ of investment into the uk to put creative industry at the heart of our economic strategy 
 i speak to some of the dcms stakeholder who go to the investment summit and they come away worried they see a government who absolutely milk their stardust but all they hear be new taxis new employment regulation other departments rid roughshod over dcms interest and delay to decision can the secretary of state be specific when she say that she be put rocket booster under the creative industry what do that mean in practice 
 as i announce to the house last week it mean introduce an independent film tax credit which the previous government talk about for several month and do absolutely nothing about i have to say to the hon lady that after the legacy that her government leave which have bring our proud country to its knee it take some brass neck to stand at the dispatch box and criticise this government we be fix the problem that her government create and a little bit of humility might go a long way
