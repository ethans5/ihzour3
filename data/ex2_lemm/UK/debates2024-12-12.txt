my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this important matter it be clear that foreign donation to political party in this country be not allow but the government do recognise the risk pose by malign actor who seek to interfere with and undermine our democratic process i be sure that the relevant secretary of state will want to continue to update the house on this important matter 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support the steel industry in south yorkshire 
 the steel industry have be in decline and we intend to turn this around that be why we be develop a steel strategy invest up to £ and work at pace the steel sector in south yorkshire and across the uk have be neglect for too long and we intend to change that 
 stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency be a world lead plant with specialist capability to produce clean and strong high grade steel for our aerospace industry the plant support hundred of job and have an exceptional on site skill training centre with link to local university will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the future strategic significance of stocksbridge speciality steels and its fundamental importance to our national steel industry 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for champion her constituency and its industry she make a very good point and i recently meet she to talk about this this week i meet community trade union representative from the steel sector in her area as well i be always happy to meet again to see what we can do 
 as the minister know it be not just south yorkshire that be face difficult decision about the steel industry i thank she for our recent meeting about the future of scunthorpe be she able to add anything on when we might expect an announcement as she will appreciate particularly at this time of year there be grow anxiety among the workforce 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his interest in his constituent and their job in the steel industry as he say we have meet to talk about this and i have nothing new to add today   other than that we continue with our conversation with british steel we be work as fast as we can obviously it be ultimately up to british steel to decide what it want to do and take forward but we stand ready to support and work with it 
 what step his department be take to help increase the number of business export good and service 
 we recently launch unlock europe a new export programme design to help uk business build strong relationship with european customer last month in manchester my right hon friend the secretary of state launch a new pilot scheme alongside the mayor and his team that offer business in the north west more support in sell their product and service overseas we be determined to do more and will bring forward further plan in due course 
 export from our aerospace defence security and space sector contribute around £ to our economy but without additional support many of the small business i speak to in aldershot and farnborough be limit in their ability to export what can minister do to help they and will the government consider reinstate the trade show access programme close down by the conservatives to help more small and medium sized enterprise trade around the world 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we have to do more to help small business in particular and business in general to export more overseas that be of the key but often understate way in which we can deliver growth for this country as part of our work on a new trade strategy and a small business strategy we be look at further proposal to help our business export more 
 the italian press have be report that the global combat air programme consortium involve the uk italy and japan might be extend to include saudi arabia can the minister confirm this press report how would that affect any future decision to suspend licence to export arm to saudi arabia as the government decide to in 
 we be look at work with other gcap partner i be in italy last month to discuss the further potential of gcap and other work that we can do with the italians in this space but that will not affect the issue about which the hon gentleman be specifically concerned 
 what step he be take to help improve business confidence 
 the government be force to make difficult choice in the budget but the fundamental of do   business in the uk remain strong the government ’s agenda of create an industrial strategy get people back to work reform our planning system rebuild our relationship with the eu pension reform and more be entirely focus on improve the long term business environment across the uk 
 in the aftermath of the budget i speak with many business leader in my constituency of solihull west and shirley invariably they tell i that they be pause recruitment and freeze their growth plan as a direct consequence of the decision make around taxation and the employment rights bill what do the secretary of state say to those business in my constituency that no long have confidence in the government and feel abandon by their policy 
 i say that the budget be week ago so if the conservative party which do not tell we how it would pay for the promise it make when it be in government now have a plan to pay for those promise i would welcome receive it in writing or hear it here at oral question or in a statement the raw reality be that the conservative party make promise that it have no intention of keep we be not go to do that we will fix the foundation and do what we say the reason this government will succeed on growth and business investment in a way that the previous government do not have to do with the fundamental the return to political stability in the uk an openness to the rest of the world include the eu a difficult subject for conservative members i know which be still our major trading partner and the willingness of this government to use their mandate to improve the business and investor environment those fundamental mean that the future of the uk be very promising 
 steel manufacturing be a vital west midland industry but business confidence be be dent by retrospective charging of steel safeguarding duty by his majesty ’s revenue and customs company that be affect in my constituency and elsewhere feel that such duty be unfairly and wrongly impose on they during the chaotic brexit transition period they try to work with the last government but get nowhere give the importance of the steel sector to british industry will the minister work with the treasury to resolve the issue and ensure that these vital business be protect from hefty bill that they should never have be send in the place 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important matter give the sum of money involve i can understand why that be a substantial issue for business in her constituency it relate to the duty that be charge at a time of significant political uncertainty this be a treasury issue relate to taxation but i promise we will get she the meeting she need and work with she to ensure that she get the answer she request for her constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there be no clear pointer on business confidence than the bank of england ’s recent survey on employer response to the budget some expect low profit margin   expect to raise price expect low employment and expect to pay low wage than they otherwise would have now city am report that labour have carelessly lose all its business backer will the secretary of state show any contrition admit that business confidence be through the floor and start stand up for business rather than the treasury 
 well what can i say be it the conservative party that increase corporation tax from to in budget and that crash business investment and confidence because of the way it mishandle brexit fail to prepare for either outcome of a yes no referendum and which opposition front benchers play a role in the mini budget frankly it be all of they with respect to the hon gentleman i will not take advice from he since the budget i have hear repeatedly from conservative colleague that they want to lower taxis and increase spending even though they can not account for the promise that they make when in government that be not credible unless they engage with reality as this government be do whether it be the response to the chancellor ’s speech at mansion house or finally sort out marks spencer this week this government be get on with the job and look to the future 
 sorry seem to be the hard word interruption i be talk about the government ’s budget further proof of how low business confidence be get under this government be give in evidence to the employment rights bill committee jane gratton of the british chamber of commerce predict 
 a reduced hire appetite be this legislation to come in and that 
 their member 
 would be less likely to recruit new employee due to the risk and difficulty particularly under the day rights”.––[official report employment rights public bill committee   november c. q2 
 if business confidence be low employment go down we already know that every labour government leave unemployment high than when they take office but be it not a bit extreme for this labour government to legislate for that outcome 
 if the hon gentleman google that statistic he will find that it be not actually true but i appreciate that it be demand be in opposition and that there may not always be the capacity and resource require as we hear on the excellent reading of that legislation the vast majority of employer in the uk already operate to a high standard than the level to which the floor be be raise in the employment rights bill i do not in any way pull back from say that some of the most vulnerable insecure and low pay member of our society will benefit from the bill that be exactly what it be about those people may have give up on politic or think that the mainstream political system will not deliver for they i reject the claim that certain industry require a supply of labour from job that do not give people the security and dignity that they need this be a set of proportionate reasonable reform that will make a difference 
 order i have a list of speaker here i call munira wilson 
 if he will make an assessment with the secretary of state for education of the potential merit of introduce a right to pay employment leave for kinship carer 
 we recognise the vital role that kinship carer play in care for vulnerable child and the challenge that many face in balance that care with employment we recently announce the large ever investment in support for kinship carer £ to trial a kinship allowance in up to local authority we will also review the parental leave system to ensure that it well support all work family and work be already under way to plan for that delivery 
 i be sure the minister will agree that kinship carer be unsung hero who often step up at a moment ’s notice to look after a child whose parent can not but in be force to give up work to do so which mean they often struggle to pay the bill or put food on the table will the minister look to right that wrong through the employment rights bill and introduce a right to pay employment leave for kinship carer give the saving to the public purse and the well outcome for child that arise from kinship care 
 i meet a kinship carer in my constituency recently who tell i about the challenge the hon lady have articulate the carer say that the most important thing to she be get respite care a point that we can all recognise we be look at how the trial pan out i have speak in detail to my hon friend   the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn   about the proposal come forward but we think it be good to see how the trial work and to look at the wide review of the parental leave system 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality sector 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality sector 
 hospitality business be at the heart of our community and be vital for economic growth the government be create a fairer business rate system reduce alcohol duty on qualify draught product and reform the apprenticeship levy to support business and boost opportunity we be address strategic issue for the hospitality sector relate to high street regeneration skill sustainability and productivity and that work will be support by the publication of the small business strategy command paper next year 
 in reigate redhill banstead and our village we have many amazing pub that contribute hugely to the economy such as the garibaldi community pub in redhill for those business to thrive reform of the unfair business rate system by be critical will the minister commit to the propose 20p reduction to   the small business rate multipli which be the absolute minimum reduction need for the long term sustainability of the pub sector 
 the hon lady will know that the chancellor of the exchequer commit in the recent budget to a series of reform to business rate include permanently low business rate for hospitality business from i welcome the hon lady ’s support for that measure 
 ukhospitality have estimate that the budget measure will increase the cost of employ employee by £ shop pub and restaurant across my constituency have say that that will lead to high price or few job will the minister at least consider delay the implementation of the national insurance contribution increase to when the plan realignment of business rate be due to come in 
 i be sure that the right hon gentleman will have notice that in the budget the chancellor more than double the employment allowance to £ that will mean that more than a small business many of they hospitality business will see no increase in their national insurance liability next year 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of free trade deal on farmer 
 our approach to trade deal consider the impact on and opportunity for the agricultural sector along with other sector of the economy and of course our growth mission the government will publish impact assessment to aid the ratification process for new free trade agreement 
 i work with farmer for many year as a veterinary surgeon and now i meet they regularly as an mp so i be aware that farmer in hampshire and the rest of the country be hugely disappoint when the previous conservative government sign trade deal that undermine our high animal welfare standard what step be the minister take to ensure that after future trade deal british farmer will not have to compete with product produce to low animal welfare standard for example battery hen or product that involve the indiscriminate use of antibiotic which be also a public health issue it be not only vet and farmer who be proud of our high animal welfare standard but the british public so will the minister confirm that he do not want to compromise on those standard 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for bring his considerable expertise in veterinary science to the chamber today we will not compromise on animal welfare standard as we take forward our programme of free trade agreement although we might well have approach the negotiation that the previous government undertake in a different manner reopen they would certainly create uncertainty which we genuinely   believe would hurt uk business we be not see australian or new zealand beef and lamb flood the uk market and we will continue to monitor trade flow under both those free trade agreement he make a very fair and important point about the need to maintain welfare standard 
 what step his department be take to support small and medium sized business 
 what step his department be take to support small business 
 small business be the beat heart of our high street and community and be essential to our economic success that be why on small business saturday i announce the business growth service which will ensure that business across the uk get quick and easy support and advice from government further announcement include the disability finance code for entrepreneurship to improve access to capital and tackle inequality for disabled entrepreneur a new fair payment code be launch by the office of the small business commissioner to help address late payment next year as my hon friend have say the small business strategy will be publish to create thrive high street easy access to finance open overseas and domestic market and enhance business capability 
 small and medium sized business come in many form from microbusinesse to community interest company and co operative often co operative and mutual business model be overlook norwich have a proud history of co operative will the secretary of state reassure i that co operative and mutual business model will be properly include in this government ’s much need push to support small and medium sized business 
 i very much welcome my hon friend ’s question my area on the eastern side of greater manchester have like her a huge history of co operative and mutual the diversity in business model that they bring be a huge strength they bring different thing to the market and different way of do business the resilience in co operative model be particularly attractive i can assure she that they form part of the government ’s wide strategy our ambition be to double mutual size in the economy the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for harrow west gareth thomas the small business minister be lead on that work and i would love my hon friend and business from her area to be involve in it 
 last week i have the pleasure of visit the winner of my small business saturday award in southampton itchen they be riann care the bunker miss ellie ’s café and julie ’s dance studio will the secretary of state join i in congratulate they on their role in ensure a thriving local economy what assurance he can offer they that this government have the back of small business 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his question i certainly join he in congratulate those local business on their work and indeed all member of parliament on the work that they do on their constituency day to champion and support local business the government ’s agenda include long term reform of business rate to create permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure the launch of high street rental auction get rid of derelict property in town centre be also hugely exciting the business growth service be predominantly about recognise that although the government do a lot business can often find it hard to access exactly what they need i have look around the world to the us and its small business administration and to singapore and its enterprise singapore for example to discover the good model that be what we will take forward in and i find it a hugely exciting agenda 
 last saturday be indeed small business saturday it be an opportunity for we to celebrate and support the many small business in our constituency however too many of they be really worried about the increase in national insurance contribution the £ job tax and there be simply no easy answer for they they can not just put up their price so they be look at staffing level why be the government so against aspiration and how do they think they will improve productivity and deliver growth in the economy 
 conservative members know what they leave behind and i have not hear any of they offer an alternative the specific answer to the right hon member ’s question be that employment allowance be double in the budget and the threshold be take off that be why mainly small business be pay less or the same in national insurance contribution as they be before the budget she should tell the house how the conservative party would pay for the infected blood scandal the victim of which we be all commit to compensate post office compensation support for the steel industry and the advanced manufacturing plan that we inherit because none of that be in our departmental budget we be fix the foundation with long term public investment and an agenda base on high business investment and well strong economic growth in every part of the uk 
 the government have raise national insurance charge on employer and introduce a family farm and a family business tax the employment rights bill will raise business cost by £ predominantly for small business as a result of those change do the secretary of state believe that sme will employer more or few people 
 i have absolutely no doubt that the government ’s agenda be for employment business investment and growth some of the thing that this country need the most could only have be deliver by a change of government i simply do not believe that the conservative party be capable of reform the planning system or have a long term industrial strategy fix our relationship with the european union and all the rest of it yes there have be challenge but the conservatives know what they leave behind they know   what they be do there be a reason the conservative party have no spending plan for the next financial year we have have to confront that reality but we can not have the kind of success that this country need unless we be willing to fix the foundation and focus on the long term the chancellor do that in the budget and the agenda of the department for business and trade be extremely attractive for the future 
 i call the shadow minister 
 some of the most successful small and medium sized business which truly think long term be own by family so why do the secretary of state think that it will help his long term growth mission for the government to start tax those business when they get pass on to the next generation 
 with respect i hear a lot of call from the conservatives to cut taxis and increase spending but still no account of how they would do that i appreciate that sometimes the initial transfer into opposition can feel exhilarate but there be a responsibility that come with it i would like to see an account from the conservative of how they would pay for it 
 for all tax change across the board we can still say with real confidence that the uk have a competitive tax system benchmark our corporation tax and the allowance on it our capital gain taxis and in this case our inheritance taxis the mistake that the conservatives make be that they forget that the adjustment to specific relief for business and agricultural property be on top of the exist inheritance tax threshold frankly a little less scaremongere from the opposition and a bit of focus on what be really at stake would be welcome 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 small business be at the heart of our local community firm such as carbon threesixty in my constituency be cut edge manufacturer of carbon fibre product however its growth as a small business be seriously affect by its ability to attract and retain quality staff predominantly because of the poor public transport and completely non existent cycle route these issue cut right across department i would therefore be grateful if the secretary of state could confirm what discussion he have have with ministerial colleague in other departments about how rural transport infrastructure would greatly support small and medium sized business 
 i welcome the hon member ’s question she be right that some of the issue that most affect business in our constituency often sit in other department the role of my department be to focus on and champion those issue across all of government whether they sit neatly in the department or not she correctly highlight the incredible and important role that rural business play and their social as well as economic benefit her point about transport be well make of the big change in the budget be the ability to focus on long term investment which be recognise by the office for budget responsibility in its assessment that the productive potential of the uk will grow significantly over the next decade because of that increase   focus investment investment investment transport be a great element of that whether in my constituency or in her i assure she that the need that she articulate be consider at the high level of government 
 what step his department be take to support the delivery of the funding plan outline in the chancellor of the exchequer ’s mansion house speech 
 what step his department be take to support the delivery of the funding plan outline in the chancellor of the exchequer ’s mansion house speech 
 growth be the government ’s no mission and in her mansion house speech the chancellor announce a package of reform to drive growth and investment across the uk i have lose count of the number of time i have have conversation with business where they talk about how our appetite for risk be not in the right place and we be look to reform that here in dbt we be drive change through our new industrial strategy work across departments which we will publish in the spring

 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the uk ’s world lead financial service sector through the treasury we be develop a year financial service strategy and of course financial service be of the pillar of our industry strategy which we will publish in the spring we can not take the uk ’s status as a global financial centre for grant in a highly competitive world we need to earn that status and work to keep it and that be what we intend to do 
 what step his department be take to help increase the size of the co operative sector 
 the government be commit to double the size of the mutual and co op sector the creation of great british energy will help drive a significant expansion in the number of energy co operative while work to modernise co op credit union and mutual law to drive expansion be recently announce by treasury colleague we will work particularly closely with the recently establish mutual and co operative business council on this agenda we will bring forward further proposal in due course 
 co operative business can be the life- blood of our town and community in my constituency i have be work with stakeholder and interested party to bring about a community co operative bookshop follow the closure of independent bookshop in southport in recent year due to the cost of living may i take this opportunity to encourage new expression of interest in the bookshop and to ask the minister to confirm what more support the government can provide for our co operative sector so that town like mine can see a thriving high street build around our community 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to underline the positive community impact that co operative mutual business and social enterprise can have not only on our high street but in our community more generally we recently announce a significant increase in the capital available to the british business bank and that have enable we to give £ of additional support to community bank or community development finance institution as they be officially know that will help drive more lending to community business potentially include the he set out but if there be anything i can do to support the initiative i would be happy to meet he to discuss it 
 what step he be take to support business in northern ireland 
 business in northern ireland like business across the uk be cry out for stability open trade and an environment in which we can break down barrier to growth and investment and that be what the government be work across the board to deliver my department have a team in belfast to help stay close to business in northern ireland and to understand what they need of course we also work closely with invest northern ireland the department for the economy and other key partner i have speak with northern ireland business during my short time in office and i be encourage by their passion and resilience

 what advice would the minister give struggle business in my constituency who be try to work out how to absorb labour ’s national insurance hike would he advise they to increase their price to squeeze wage or to cut investment and can he explain to those business how that fit with the government ’s promise to increase growth 
 i think the good advice i could give to business in the right hon member ’s constituency be to never vote conservative again his and his party ’s idea of good economic in government seem to be to create a huge fiscal hole and leave it to the next administration to fix it we be work at pace to try to tackle the difficult economic inheritance that he and his colleague in government help to create measure such as the industrial strategy and the decision we have take in the budget albeit some be difficult will help to bring   back economic stability to this country in the long run that will help business in his constituency and indeed in constituency up and down the country 
 on small business saturday recently i have the pleasure of visit derby ’s small business of various type which be the beat heart of our city however as our plan city centre regeneration project recognise empty shop on our high street do not reflect the high perform high technology economy that we be so proud to have in derby build on the new community right to buy what more can the department do to ensure that community group receive the correct business advice and support to use this new right and to breathe new life and vibrancy into our high street 
 i commend my hon friend not only for his work recently on small business saturday but as the leader of derby council in drive the town centre regeneration work that he mention we be determined to establish a small business growth service to provide well support and information to small business so that entrepreneur in this country can take advantage of new power to set up small business on the high street perhaps capitalise on the high tech high growth sector of the economy to which derby have access and in that way make sure that we see benefit from the industrial strategy not just for big business but for small business 
 my hon friend will know from his visit to gateshead this week some of the fantastic small business we have on our high street but also some of the incredible challenge face by so many high street and town centre with that in mind will he tell we what the government be do on access to finance for small business 
 despite the considerable cold i very much enjoy my recent visit to gateshead town centre and i be impress by the dynamism of the business that he and i meet at his instigation in the railway quarter of the thing we be determined to do be to increase access to finance for small business up and down the country that be why we have provide over £ across this year and next year for the british business bank particularly to drive access to finance for small business such as the one to which he introduce i 
 i call the shadow minister 
 of the ingredient for a successful high street be have a post office in the mix the government have inherit a network of post office and that number have be stable since will the minister commit to support high street by maintain the scale of the post office network in this parliament 
 yes we be determined to maintain and indeed strengthen the post office network i suspect that the hon member will recognise that we inherit a post office with huge problem which we be work with the new leadership of the post office to begin to tackle we be look at what new commercial opportunity there may be for the post office and banking appear to be the most significant we be also   work with the post office to identify some of its infrastructure problem not least in develop a replacement for the horizon scheme 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of level of take up of parental leave 
 the parental right survey find that of employee mother take maternity leave and of employee father take paternity leave but take up of share parental leave be much low in fact it be disappointingly low which be why we be committed to a review of the parental leave system work be under way to deliver on that and i will provide an update in due course 
 i agree with the minister it be very disappointing for many parent current maternity pay be too low and the leave system be not flexible enough a recent report by the bbc say that almost half of new father be unaware of what be available to they the system be skew and the take up be low among low earn family that be particularly important this be point out to i by a constituent in edinburgh west for those with multiple birth who need not only more time but more financial support during maternity leave do the minister agree that maternity pay level need to be increase and that the flexibility of the scheme need to be improve as do public awareness 
 the hon member make a number of point which i be sure we will consider as part of the review we be undertake the employment rights bill have a number of important measure to support work family bring parent into scope for parental leave and another into scope for paternity leave we be keen to build on that and we want to support family who be in work 
 what recent estimate he have make of the contribution of creative industry to the economy 
 the creative industry be a huge force for good in our country they be responsible for job last year and more than £ for our gdp in they be of growth sector in our industrial strategy we be work closely with the department for culture media and sport and across government to identify what more we can do to draw out even more of the potential growth that britain ’s creative business can offer 
 as we all settle down for christmas we will be watch mission impossible james bond ironclad and perhaps even call the midwife which be all film in medway—[interruption and also the great escape which be not film in   medway unfortunately how can we make mission impossible possible across our country when it come to new film 
 i can not follow the impressive nature of that question but i can tell my hon friend that in the budget my right hon friend the chancellor confirm a new independent film tax credit which will help to enable the success that he have allude to in his constituency and the surround area to be spread potentially across the country that will allow more business to set up and generate growth and wealth for our country 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of post office closure on high street 
 no decision have be take on the future of any directly manage branch include in chester le street in my hon friend ’s constituency the post office continue to work with local community and other to consider how good to meet the need for post office service in a local area the government set minimum access criterion to ensure that of the uk population live within mile of a post office and those government set access criterion ensure that regardless of change service remain within reach of all citizen 
 the post office in chester le street have be at the heart of the community in north durham since and offer vital service to my constituent do the minister agree that keep those service accessible be vital to keep footfall on our high street and encourage other business to locate themselves there 
 i recognise the significance of the post office in my hon friend ’s constituency as indeed i recognise the significance of post office in my constituency and across the uk it be important to maintain access to post office service as they play a crucial role in the high street that be why we be determined to work with the post office to strengthen the network as i allude to early 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 it have be a hugely significant month for the department for business and trade after our record break international investment summit and our industrial strategy green paper publication my department have be engage with business big and small to drive growth just this week we have help to land a £ train building deal with hitachi secure hundred of job in the north east another promise fulfil from the election campaign for small business we be reform business rate to breathe new life into our high street while launch a new fair payment code tackle late payment to sme and   support new high street rental auction to improve town centre as we have hear our brand new business growth service will streamline sme support on everything from finance to export 
 we be also tackle the challenge that we inherit negotiate a well deal for tata steel employee in port talbot while progress a uk wide steel strategy our horizon conviction redress scheme show that we be right the wrong of the past for victim of the post office scandal i look forward to work with all hon member in the new year deliver on our plan for change go for growth and realise a decade of national renewal in addition mr speaker i would like to wish you all hon member and business across the uk a very merry christmas 
 thank you very kind 
 my constituent still mourn the loss of our m&s outlet in but we be delighted that superbowl uk have just open in aldershot these anchor retail and leisure tenant be so vital for our town centre so what can the government do to assist community such as mine to ensure that we can encourage business to be the cornerstone and footfall driver of our town centre 
 i very much agree and welcome the question from my hon friend i certainly recognise that high street be go through a transition from be primarily retail centre to now have much more of a mix of retail hospitality and leisure and i be delighted to hear about superbowl ’s investment in aldershot i be not nostalgic for a town centre or a high street that have pass it be about how we do that transition into the future there be great practice around the country whether in aldershot or in walthamstow where i be recently and the government ’s agenda be commit to deliver that 
 i remind the secretary of state that these be topical question and contribution should be short i come to the shadow secretary of state for a good example 
 of the great british innovation be the gift of free trade lift billion out of poverty abroad and increase prosperity at home thank to the conservatives this week the uk proudly join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership a bloc that include some of the world ’s fast grow economy as well as major trading partner and investor such as japan and canada with the government have precious little else to show on growth so far will the secretary of state update the house on when he expect to conclude free trade deal with the gulf with india and with the us 
 at least we have some thing we can agree on there which be a nice start to the christmas period i agree that the uk have always be and must be a champion of free trade in a world where trade issue will be politically significant in we can work together on that future we believe that we have progress the gulf co operation council trade deal significantly the shadow secretary of state will know that there be some problem between the previous   government and some country in the gcc particularly the uae where the relationship have unfortunately get into a difficult place we have repair that and the talk be go well it be always a mistake to put a deadline on those because it can limit our negotiate potential when it come to the us we will see what happen with the president elect but i be look forward to negotiation and discussion about that 
 come on secretary of state 
 the secretary of state can count on our support to bring those deal forward it pain i to say it but as we have hear today business confidence be at an all time low bar the pandemic hire be collapse and company be flee labour have talk growth but it have deliver decline the game changer now would be a us trade deal will the secretary of state urge the prime minister to stop obsess about go backwards into the eu and agree with i at this christmas time that the good gift for british business would be for the prime minister to get on a plane to washington and talk trade with president trump 
 i be afraid that the shadow secretary of state ’s analysis be too simplistic the us be a major trade partner and always will be but he will know that so be the european union and another area be our trade with china the future for the uk be be position to get the maximum benefit from all those key market the kind of agreement that he put forward would have major ramification for british agriculture in particular and he know the issue associate with that we can not consider of those trade negotiation without consider the impact on all those key trading relationship i ask he to consider the issue in a more holistic and complete way 
 far to the successful international investment summit that my right hon friend mention early which secure £ worth of investment for the uk the minister of wales eluned morgan have recently announce that wales will hold its own major investment summit next year do my right hon friend agree that this demonstrate the power of labour governments work together in partnership to deliver economic growth for the community we represent 
 i might be bias but i think that the international investment summit that we hold be the good day of this year that be not just because of the investment and the real tangible job that come from it but because of the clear simple message that we could put out there stability openness and improve the investment environment i be delighted to hear the news from wales not only will we support that but i appreciate the strong working relationship we have on such issue as port talbot and get a well deal for that community and the workforce we have work hand in glove with the welsh labour government and it strengthen the thing we be able to do together 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 tomorrow on friday the the eu ’s general product safety regulation come into effect business be tell i that the   additional cost will mean that they can no long sell to the eu and to northern ireland what step be the department take to ensure that small business be support as the regulation come into effect 
 as the hon lady rightly point out the regulation come into force tomorrow actually it cover thing that most business be do already but we have provide guidance for business include online marketplace on how the regulation will apply in northern ireland we will continue to engage with business and online marketplace to ensure that we be support they in deal with this new regulation 
 i declare an interest as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on critical mineral although cornwall sit on some of the rich deposit of critical mineral in the world include tin and lithium in my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle there be significant geological reserve right across the united kingdom include in the north of england northern ireland and the land of our celtic cousin in wales and scotland will the minister confirm that domestic critical mineral production and processing will form a key part of the government ’s industrial strategy 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s question and i welcome the time we spend together at south crofty tin mine which be also of my favourite visit of the year this be a hugely exciting area and the opportunity for his area be particularly exciting what we need be an open transparent trading system where these product will have the certainty of access to market which will unlock the ability to use those deposit to our and our ally mutual interest 
 farmer in my constituency maintain the high animal welfare standard they want reassurance that those will not be undercut by any future uk us trade deal as they be by some of the deal do by the previous government will the minister assure i that the mandate and the detail of a trade deal will come to the house before the government sign it as many member on the government front bench agree when they be in opposition if not why not 
 there be an establish process in take forward the government ’s discussion in relation to the mandate on animal welfare standard the secretary of state have already allude to how there be clearly considerable divergence during the previous attempt to conclude a free trade agreement with the united states i assure the house that we as a new government continue to take issue of animal welfare extremely seriously 
 in norwich we have many amazing business such as the norwich glass company café and great eastern model railways that i visit recently of the challenge that they the norfolk chamber of commerce and the federation of small businesses have raise be attract skilled staff will the secretary of state set out how the government ’s skill plan will support such business to attract the staff they need 
 i recognise what my hon friend be say in her question which be that skill will be of the big if not the big issue for business go forward of course that sit in the department for education and we work closely with colleague on that we have the creation of skills england and the reform to the apprenticeship levy to create the growth and skill levy indeed i think that my ceo call next week i do those regularly will be with the secretary of state for education where we will discuss this problem business from her constituency would be welcome to join that 
 i be sure that the secretary of state agree that create high value job in science and technology be important in local business our local plan give we the opportunity to build a science and technology park deliver over high value job but we can not proceed until the department for transport release fund for local highway improvement will the secretary of state press the secretary of state for transport to take action so that work can progress and we can deliver job and growth in mid sussex 
 the hon member ’s question be perhaps more for the secretary of state for transport but she skilfully put that to i i assure she that i will work with the secretary of state for transport to do that how we assemble investment site be a huge issue and how we can work well across government with local partner be also a key issue for we 
 last week research publish by sage show that of small business in the north east plan to increase their investment in technology next year as the science innovation and technology committee launch its inquiry into innovation growth and the region how will the business secretary ensure that the industrial strategy boost adoption of technology particularly british develop technology to boost growth across all our region 
 my hon friend will be aware that the chancellor of the exchequer recently announce £ in investment for research and development for the next year which will help to drive even more of the type of technological investment that she rightly champion we be also work with small business to encourage they to adopt more digital technology through the digital adoption taskforce 
 business in bognor regis and littlehampton be at the sharp end of the bank of england ’s business confidence survey unlike the chancellor and the secretary of state they know that her budget and the employment rights bill be a recipe for high price high inflation high interest rate and high unemployment be that the growth that the secretary of state have in mind 
 we have have or of the same question from the opposition benches and not a single answer to how they would pay for the promise that they make we be get on with fix the   foundation look to the future and improve the business environment across the board that be why business in the hon lady ’s area and mine should look to with real confidence 
 i declare an interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on british bus the secretary of state will be aware of the consultation on job at alexander dennis in my constituency in september it cite an increasingly unlevel play field over a number of year for domestic bus manufacturer that show the requirement for a clear industrial strategy what assurance can the minister give i as part of implement the industrial strategy that the labour government be work to level the play field for domestic manufacturer 
 i recognise the issue and i welcome my hon friend ’s raise it at the annual dinner of the society for motor manufacturers and traders it matter to this government that we make these product in the uk there have be specific procurement issue mainly with local area i promise he the meeting that he need to take that forward but i assure he that the industrial strategy will cover this issue 
 my constituent kirsty be self employ and be look to adopt a child but she do not qualify for adoption leave or adoption pay and because she be not have her child biologically she do not qualify for maternity allowance would the government support change that whether through the employment rights bill or otherwise so that brilliant future parent be not put off from adopt because they can not afford it 
 that be an interesting question there be a great interplay with right for self employ people we be commit to a review on that in due course together with a wide look at the parental leave system we will get back to the hon lady on that 
 i welcome this government ’s commitment to get more disposable income in the pocket of work people at christmas time a lot of people will want to buy concert ticket what conversation be the minister have with cabinet colleague on reform the secondary ticketing market 
 hopefully we will make an announcement very shortly about plan in that area

 the house will rise for the christmas recess at the conclusion of business on   thursday december   and return on   monday january 
 the provisional business for the week commence   january   will include 
 monday january business to be determine by the backbench business committee 
 further business will be announce in the usual way 
 what a marvellous time of year it be when i see the christmas tree in new palace yard and the trilling sound of the parliamentary and salvation army choir to boot on a slightly more sober note you will recall mr speaker that the story of this government so far have be of early scandal a reset and a delayed budget and now what we can expect to be a delay spending review we must hope that at some point the government will get round to actually make policy 
 i be afraid that this week have bring further confirmation of the disastrous effect of the november budget as members will recall the institute for fiscal studies predict at the time that the rise in national insurance would hit low wage and more labour intensive part of the economy hard and predict that the chancellor may need to raise taxis again soon the chancellor ’s reaction as she tell the cbi be 
 i ’m really clear i ’m not come back with more borrowing or more taxis 
 we will see how long that promise last only this week the financial times report that hiring have fall more sharply in the uk than in other major economy over the past year include the us france germany canada and australia 
 luckily however we now have the government ’s new plan for change i think the whole house should welcome the fact that the government now have a plan only   year and month after they start in opposition and that their plan be to change direction i would describe the plan for change as a fine fat herefordshire beef cow that have be inadequately feed with the reform party ’s favourite anti methane feed supplement bovaer it be a beast full of nutrition but with a certain amount of unnecessary flatulence a lot of medium commentator have have fun with the government ’s blizzard of to do list include their step milestone national mission and foundation but i be afraid that they have miss the christmas spirit of the thing all we need now be policy announcement on turtle dove and partridge in pear tree to complete their new initiative advent calendar 
 i jest mr speaker i come not to bury caesar but to praise he i be not go to indulge in the easy mockery of the commentariat on the contrary i can report genuine sign of reality break through in the plan for change something rarely see in a document from this government the prime minister say 
 in the incoming government inherit public finance in desperate need of repair 
 he be absolutely right public finance in be in desperate need of repair he also say that we need 
 a profound cultural shift away from a declinist mentality which have become comfortable with failure 
 and again i think he be absolutely right finally and most notably he say that 
 we can not tax our way to prosperity or spend our way to well public service 
 not only that but the government have sensibly drop their commitment to clean energy by as conservative members have call for and as i specifically highlight only a couple of week ago 
 the plan for change be a revolutionary gospel indeed honest about the poor performance of the previous labour government realistic in not seek to blame government for wide global event seek to adopt a long term approach and recognise the need to limit tax and spending all we can hope now be that someone spread this revolutionary gospel in the christmas spirit to the rest of the government 
 but i also have various concern about the plan for change that i would like to put to the house it barely mention the crucial short term issue and long term issue of defence highlight once again this week by event in syria or the vital long term issue of social care which all party concede have be inadequately handle over the past year these be extraordinary omission in what purport to be an inclusive long term reset for the government 
 there be more fundamental question to be address too the idea of a mission be a fashionable in policy circle but it imply a total commitment to the goal how will that be reconcile with the obligation of the civil service and the prime minister ’s new efficiency tsar to demonstrate short term value for money how will all this be reconcile with the government ’s intense desire to campaign aggressively against those they see as their political enemy rather than recruit they soberly to a political consensus that could provide a sustainable basis for these mission i would be very interested to know what the leader of the house think on these issue and how they will shape her approach to the conduct of future business in this house 
 may i start by say how appalled i be i be sure the whole house be about the detail that have emerge on the murder of sara sharif may i say on behalf of the government that nothing be more important than keep child safe we be committed to further reform of child ’s social care and much strong safeguard for child be take into home education that be long overdue and further detail will be announce imminently 
 i take this opportunity to congratulate the new chair of the liaison committee my hon friend   the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier i know the prime minister be very much look forward to his regular appearance before it i also congratulate my hon friend   the member for north northumberland david smith   on his appointment as the uk special envoy for freedom of religion or belief i be sure he be look forward to his very frequent and very regular meeting with   the hon member for strangford jim shannon i also remind the house that the modernisation committee ’s call for view end next monday we have have huge interest in this agenda from members old and new i encourage everyone to submit their idea 
 i think we might have have a little bit more christmas cheer from   the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman but it be another rather strange and confused contribution perhaps he can work on his christmas joke a bit more ahead of next week ’s business question 
 let i share some merry news instead mr speaker we be make the big change that people vote for rebuild britain and fix the mess that the conservatives leave we reshape the state and society to put ordinary people at the front of the queue over half our king ’s speech programme be progress through parliament the big change for worker in a generation give security and dignity at work put power back in the hand of renter so that they can get the secure quality tenancy they deserve switch on great british energy for low bill and energy security bring rail service back into public ownership already deliver well reliability take on water boss to clean up our waterway and reform our planning law to build more affordable home the right hon gentleman do not like it but nobody can deny that these be the big necessary change in the service of ordinary people root in our value 
 and yes we have a plan for change the right hon gentleman ask about it and we be deliver it the country vote for change they vote to change from the conservatives government and record they vote to improve their living standard they vote to change the nhs and they vote because they want this country to be fix he raise defence and social care spending perhaps that be his good christmas joke so far because the conservatives record on that be woeful we will not take any lecture from they on that i be afraid 
 the truth be that we be week into the new leader of the opposition ’s tenure and the conservatives strategy for opposition be as clear as mud they seem to have learn nothing they have no new idea they disown their record day and defend it the next perhaps instead of the right hon gentleman ’s ridiculous tired commentary they could reflect and apologise for the mess they leave and ensure that the country get the change it deserve 
 rise 
 the leader of the house rightly mention a live case i hope nobody will add to that because it be in the court at the moment 
 next year bradford district will take on the honour of city of culture my constituency will be host event celebrate local artist and our industrial heritage will my right hon friend join i in wish bradford well and will she consider grant time for a debate on the contribution of northern city to our british culture

 i thank the hon lady for raise the issue of special educational need she be entirely right the crisis that be leave in send support in our school be appalling it be of the terrible legacy of the conservative government and demand be high than ever this be of the big issue face the education sector which be why in the budget as the hon lady rightly point out we announce an extra £ for send the big uplift that it have receive for many year of course that will not solve all the problem overnight it be a down payment on the work that we will do and be already do to reform send and get the resource in which be vital to our education sector
