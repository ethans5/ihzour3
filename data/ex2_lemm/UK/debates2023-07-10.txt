the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of level of antisemitism in the last month 
 we have pay close attention to the concern figure produce by the home office and the community security trust which have show the continued prevalence of antisemitism in our society we be consider lord mann ’s recent report on the subject which we will respond to in due course and we have increase the annual jewish community protective security grant to £ in 
 do the secretary of state see the research from king ’s college london show that those who believe in conspiracy be most likely to be antisemitic much of that antisemitism take place online and be legal but harmful what be he do to tackle conspiracism misinformation and fake news why be the measure to tackle they in the online safety bill so weak and why have the government remove the legal but harmful provision which would protect so much of the jewish community 
 the hon gentleman be right that there be a significant overlap between antisemitism and conspiracy theory and many of the trope that conspiracist use be draw from the antisemitic library however with the online safety bill it be important to balance the right to free speech with vigilance in deal with hate and this government be absolutely committed to combat antisemitism wherever it rear its head 
 what step he be take to level up all part of the uk 
 what assessment he have make of the potential effect of increase in the cost of live on his department ’s levelling up agenda 
 levelling up be not just a slogan it be an imperative and that be why it be a drive mission of this government i fear that if i outline every step we be take to level up my extensive answer would take we beyond time mr speaker but to name a few highlight we be establish investment zone and freeport to create high quality local job deliver billion of pound of investment into vital local project and empower local leader through devolution deal put power and funding back into local hand that be level up in action and there be more to come 
 all those word be just empty rhetoric it be a con trick the truth be that in a single decade the government cut £ from public service and by march they will only have put about £ of that back in through level up be it not   clear that to level up properly we need an end both to this government and to the economic system they have establish 
 absolutely not this be a government that have put level up at the core of every single thing we do that be not go to change the only way to ensure level up remain at the heart of government be by vote conservative at the next election 
 datum from the times health commission report that nearly people in england last year be hospitalise with malnutrition malnutrition itself have quadruple since with a shocking rise in victorian illness such as scurvy and ricket can the minister explain how such shocking figure fit within her government ’s levelling up agenda 
 i thank the hon lady for highlight that she will know that the wide levelling up mission cover a range of area include health and healthy life outcome it be important that we all work together across party and across government to try to tackle this issue 
 the minister understand that regeneration of our high street be key to the levelling up of our community yet she be aware that in gosport that be be paralyse by unfair council tax being slap on house in multiple occupancy very high quality one that be key to the future regeneration of our high street as part of the levelling up and regeneration bill the secretary of state launch a consultation to address that question but it conclude week ago and we still have not have the result when will it be publish 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her engagement with i and the secretary of state on that vital issue unfortunately i can not give she a specific date right now but i will meet she as soon as we have the result in place because i realise it be a vital issue that we need to address 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and to my right hon friend the secretary of state for recent visit to mansfield and the east midland to support the many levelling up project we have go on in our region from freeport to development company integrate rail plan investment zone and levelling up and town fund project include in mansfield all that amount to billion of pound what impact do my hon friend think that will have on my constituency 
 my hon friend have do a great job of highlight the incredible level of support go to mansfield and the wide east midland a lot of that be down to great local leadership from he and his colleague that will have an enormous impact on the people live in the east midland and on their opportunity to get on in life which ultimately be what level up be all about 
 i call the shadow minister 
 up and down the country community be struggle with the tories mortgage crisis and the cost of living crisis those hit hard often live in community that be promise levelling up funding yet the government sit on £ of promise levelling up fund money money that could make a difference to those who need it most where on earth be it will the government commit today to start a process for the allocation of it 
 i find myself a little confused because we get a lot of criticism from the opposition about round of the levelling up fund they want we to get round right and we be take the time to ensure that we get round allocation right we will in due course announce detail on how we will allocate that money which will change people ’s life 
 if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the capacity of local authority to respond to unexpected cost arise from business enter liquidation 
 the local government finance settlement of up to £ for increase core spending power by most of that funding be unringfence as local authority be well place to understand their local priority the government also spend approximately £ through target long term investment in high street and small business 
 resident in the marsh area of lancaster lancaster city council and i be concerned about the future of a skip site on the lune industrial estate that have go into liquidation the cost of clean up be high than the value of the land will the minister make time to meet i and lancaster city council to discuss what step the council can take to ensure that resident know that the environment they be live in be healthy and safe 
 i understand that the hon lady be in touch with the environment agency about that and that there be an ongoing investigation although she will appreciate that i can not comment on any specific of the case i would of course be happy to meet she to discuss the wide issue of waste remediation our government be commit to tackle waste crime we have increase the environment agency ’s budget by £ per year and tighten the law to make it hard for rogue operator to find work in the sector and easy for regulator to take action against criminal 
 what progress he have make on allocate fund through the community ownership fund 
 the community ownership fund have be a significant success and have so far award £ to project   across the uk a total of £ have be allocate in england £ in scotland £ in wales and £ in northern ireland 
 do the minister agree that the community ownership fund provide tremendous potential for community organisation in clwyd south and elsewhere to take ownership of asset and amenity that risk be lose and that the current bidding round be benefit from the positive change to the fund that be announce on   may 
 i agree that the community ownership fund have huge potential in clwyd south and indeed across the uk the change that my hon friend allude to extend the maximum funding available from £ to £ reduce the match funding require and allow application from parish town and community council will mean that even more cherished asset and amenity can be save for local community i remind the house that window of round will close on july 
 the community ownership fund be an ideal fund to support udney park community fields foundation which have be work tirelessly with the community in teddington and twickenham to bring udney park playing field and the war memorial pavilion back into community use for the benefit of local grassroots sport organisation the site have go to rack and ruin since successive and badly advise developer buy the site year ago from imperial college london as the site go back on the market will the minister agree to look favourably on any application from the foundation for that asset of community value 
 as the house will understand i can not comment on individual bid but the hon lady make a compelling case the relevant minister be happy to meet she 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the impact of increase in inflation on local authority budget 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of local authority funding 
 we recognise that council have face challenge since covid which be of the reason why we allocate billion more in subsidy to local authority in the financial year discussion on public spending often require hard choice and trade off on many worthy intention but we hope that the additional billion allocate demonstrate the government ’s commitment to local authority 
 council budget have be impact by huge cost due to covid and the triple whammy of increase in demand for service fuel price and inflation the minister will know that people be scared and   run out of hope so will he outline what support be available now to ensure that council can still provide the vital service that people need 
 as i outline we have allocate additional fund to local authority in this financial year it be also a statement of fact that a number of local authority in england have increase reserve as a result of covid in the last financial year additional grant funding of nearly £ have go to the hon gentleman ’s local council bury council for adult social care 
 do my hon friend share my view that way to support local government finance and to reward well perform local authority such as bromley council would be to introduce multi year funding settlement will he commission a review into the merit of this so that local authority can well plan for the future 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be a testament to the good work of bromley council that he can demonstrate this and talk about it with knowledge and experience multi year financial settlement be something that we all aspire to of the reason we bring forward the policy statement for financial year be to ensure great clarity for council at the end of this spending review and we hope to be able to return to multi year settlement in future parliaments 
 discretionary housing payment administer by council be a vital resource in stave off homelessness the figures—£140 in £ in and remain flat for the next year show a £ cut and further cut owe to increase demand and inflationary pressure section eviction be not slow down the number of household face rent arrear be soar and the number be force into temporary accommodation be skyrocket the department for levelling up housing and communities have ultimate responsibility for homelessness so when will ministers at the department tell their colleague in the treasury and the department for work and pensions to wake up and smell the coffee 
 of the reason why we have give local government additional fund in this financial year as i just tell   the hon member for bury south christian wakeford be precisely that we recognise that there be challenge the government have also allocate an additional £ for the most vulnerable household to be administer through local authority which demonstrate the commitment to both local authority and the most vulnerable in our society 
 what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on long term funding for local authority 
 the chancellor his ministers and his official be in regular contact with the secretary of state i and departmental   official on matter pertain to local government finance the final local government finance settlement for this financial year make available up to £ for local government in england 
 local authority have lose £ of funding since as the government have seek to outsource both the pain and the blame for their punishing approach to the public finance with only a fraction allocate back on a piecemeal time limit and ad hoc basis the reality for local authority up and down the country be that it be increasingly become far too difficult to deliver all the service that local resident rely on when will the secretary of state stop treat local government like a pawn in his political game and start treat local government finance with the seriousness that both resident and hard work local government official need 
 difficult decision be take in the year after precisely because labour fail to make those decision in the year before of the reason why we have make available additional funding for local government in this financial year be to demonstrate that we understand the challenge local authority face ultimately however as i say to   the hon member for bury south christian wakeford this sort of issue require hard choice and trade off something the labour party continue to fail to demonstrate it understand 
 as inflation impact on local authority budget planning department be become especially squeeze council be mean to approve big planning application within week but over the last year only have be approve in that timeframe down from year ago what can the minister do to improve funding for local council planning department 
 my hon friend highlight an important place where further progress be need we recognise that there be challenge in this area and i know that the minister of state department for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend   the member for redditch rachel maclean who be the housing minister and the secretary of state be well aware of these challenge and seek to address they my portfolio include nationally significant infrastructure programme and we have bring forward the nsip action plan demonstrate our commitment to speed up project and decision within they as much as we can 
 shropshire ’s conservative run council be try to save £ a week just to balance its budget this year and restore its reserve to a safe level part of its problem be that the funding allocate to rural council do not reflect the additional cost of deliver service in rural place will the minister consider reassess that allocation so that rural council can get the revenue they need to support the cost of the service they need to provide 
 we be absolutely aware of the challenge that rural council face that be of the reason why we increase the rural grant within the most recent financial settlement by £ where there be   pressure in local government finance in the come year we will continue to work with colleague across the house to address they 
 stoke on trent city council be face unprecedented pressure particularly because there be now over child in the care of the city council as well as multiple education health and care plan that require child to be take out of the city to find the provision that they deserve will my hon friend meet urgently with the leader of stoke on trent city council councillor jane ashworth its chief executive officer jon rouse and member of parliament for stoke on trent to quickly find a way forward and ensure that our finance be in the good possible position go forward 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who speak with knowledge and experience on these issue i would be happy to meet member of parliament from stoke on trent to talk about this matter in further detail 
 what step his department be take to increase devolution in england 
 we have make significant progress in our mission to extend english devolution in the past year we have announce mayoral devolution deal which will bring devolution to over half of the english population most recently i be delighted when the wonderful new leader of east riding council anne handley signal her ambition for great devolution 
 last week i attend an evidence session for the all party parliamentary group on the east midland inquiry into investment in the region which have be historically underfunded business leader tell i that the east midland combine authority need to be head by someone with sharp elbow to get thing do in the region i know there be a man in mansfield who meet that description but can my right hon friend commit to give that combine authority the power to effect meaningful change include consider west midland style power 
 my hon friend make a very good point there be a man from mansfield who would be an absolutely outstanding metro mayor for the east midland and we need to give he all the power he need he have not only sharp elbow but a keen intellect and he have the interest of the east midland at heart what andy street have do for the west midland mr ben bradley can do for the east midland 
 you get there 
 accord to pricewaterhousecoopers the west midlands combined authority that the selfsame andy street preside over be the bad perform ca in the uk judge by its growth figure in that circumstance should the public of warwickshire not have a say in any   potential merger with that combine authority as be propose in the secretary of state ’s levelling up bill that be go through the house of lords 
 i have great respect for the hon gentleman but why do he think that warwickshire can not compete on the world stage as part of the west midlands combined authority why do he have such little confidence in the people of warwickshire he have refer to the mayor of the combine authority andy street be the mayor who have do most to deliver and indeed exceed housing target as mayor of the west midland who have do the bad labour ’s sadiq khan 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his police of the regulatory policy committee statement on the renters reform bill impact assessment publish on july 
 i have read it and it seem fantastic 
 what a facile answer do my right hon friend not accept the criticism of the rpc that the impact assessment be very weak in that it fail to address the impact of the bill on competition innovation and investment and on landlord who run small business and microbusinesse 
 i be very pleased that the impact assessment give the bill a green rating i be particularly pleased that it indicate that the likely additional cost would be £ a year and that the benefit both monetised and non monetised would be significantly great than that it be a progressive measure which i hope my hon friend will be able to join i in support 
 renter reform be important as be safe housing resident of norfolk house a block of flat in my constituency have suffer burst pipe dangerous cladding and sewage and hot water leak that have ruin multiple flat resident have call it a tick time bomb to see whose ceiling will collapse next both galliard the property developer and southern housing the housing association be refuse to address those issue will the minister commit to look into that case which have blight the life of resident for year 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise that and of course we will both the housing association she mention and the developer she mention have come to the attention of our department before so i be not surprised but i be disappointed and we will take action 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the provision of affordable housing in a chesterfield and b england 
 the government be commit to increase the supply of affordable housing which be why through our £ affordable home programme we will deliver ten of thousand of affordable home for both sale and rent in community up and down the country when it come to chesterfield i be aware that the local plan be adopt in july but ultimately local authority be responsible for plan preparation and decision making and they interpret national policy and guidance accord to local circumstance 
 i be grateful but that be not really an answer to my question of whether the minister consider that the amount of affordable housing be adequate under the conservatives the number of new social rent home have fall by over and there be now few socially rent home build each year than there be under a labour government meanwhile hard press mortgage holder be face the high interest rate in a generation be it not clear that neither renter nor buyer can afford another year of this tory government 
 i do not know whether the hon gentleman be aware that chesterfield borough council be under the control of the labour party which with the assistance of significant government grant funding be responsible for deliver affordable housing in the area it be up to chesterfield labour party in control of that council to work with developer to make sure that planning obligation deliver the house that local people need 
 we know that a lack of affordable housing can contribute towards an increase in homelessness of course it be a big responsibility for different area to tackle homelessness and i be proud of what ipswich do particularly through organisation such as the ipswich housing action group i be concerned to hear though that neighbouring authority in the eastern region be send their homeless people to ipswich do the minister agree that those authority should shoulder the responsibility to tackle homelessness in their own area and not send those homeless people to ipswich will the minister confirm that the labour lead council can stop that happen if it want to do so 
 i thank my hon friend for bring this vital issue to our attention on the floor of the house of course we expect local authority to work together to tackle homelessness and to alleviate those pressure on the most vulnerable people it be right for his labour council to work with any other council that have responsibility for that 
 what assessment he have make of the strength of the union 
 the union and support for the union be strong and i be delighted to note that in the most recent opinion poll support for independence in scotland be plummet 
 that be a very interesting definition of plummet when that support consistently remain high than it be in the independence referendum of we be tell during that campaign and afterwards that scotland would have of the most powerful wee devolve sub state legislature in the entire world if not the universe so what be the government ’s baseline for that can the secretary of state give we some example of parliaments that be more or less powerful than the scottish parliament 
 i would just note that at the referendum to which the hon member refer support for independence be at but it be currently at in the poll and be less than more broadly the scottish parliament have significant power it be a pity that the scottish government do not use they and unfortunately as a result scotland ’s people be let down when it come to education where scotland be tumble down scotland sadly do not have the reform that we have have in england which have see we rise up international league table it use to be the case that scotland ’s education system be the pride of the globe but it be now england that have the good reader of the western world 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i want to ask the secretary of state some question on his role as the minister for intergovernmental relations and drug policy of which he have say a number of interesting thing he be on record say this 
 public health measure which be back by strong scientific evidence which follow the lead of the doctor the clinician we should look seriously at they 
 drug consumption room and the decriminalisation of possession of small quantity of drug have be prove to work throughout the world and they have now be propose by the scottish government do the secretary of state accept that the outright rejection of that by the uk government at the weekend out of hand undermine the scottish government undermine those campaigner and those who help drug user and undermine the union 
 no i do not accept that but the hon gentleman raise a very serious question i have have the opportunity to discuss with   the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss   some of the challenge that she face in her constituency the hon gentleman and i both know that drug death in scotland be unacceptably high and there be no single answer to that problem but i believe as be outline clearly by politician from both the government and the principal opposition party that the scottish government ’s proposal be the wrong proposal at the wrong time 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer but the head of all un agency have call for possession decriminalisation and more than country have make change that have cut death and incarceration there be no reasonable rational and evidence cause for the uk government or the labour party to reject the proposal out of hand may i ask he seriously in his role as minister for intergovernmental relations to be   the grown up on his side of the chamber and work and engage with the scottish government and drug campaigner on the issue 
 as the hon gentleman point out this be a complex challenging and heartbreaking issue it be right that the government should work together and with the nhs law enforcement and other to deal with this challenge but i believe that the specific proposal for decriminalisation of possession propose be not the good way forward 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 what step his department be take to support house building 
 house building be a priority for this government we have announce £ worth of investment in the housing supply since the start of this parliament and ultimately our intervention be due to unlock over new home we be also invest £ in the late affordable home programme to provide ten of thousand of new home across the country 
 as my question concern wolverhampton with your permission mr speaker i would like to pay tribute to councillor ian brookfield the leader of city of wolverhampton council who sadly pass away last week age only ian work with many ministers and the secretary of state when the ministry ’s headquarters move to the city of wolverhampton he will be greatly miss by many people 
 the government have make a series of big investment in wolverhampton and that have position it as the centre of the home building industry that include million of pound for the national brownfield institute the city learn quarter and the modern methods of construction taskforce will my hon friend the minister support my campaign for an investment zone in wolverhampton north east stretch from springfield brewery to the science park that would help attract business to wolverhampton where they could capitalise on the expertise that our city now have in home building technology and attract high quality job to my constituency 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute on my behalf and on behalf of all ministers in the department to councillor ian brookfield 
 i thank my hon friend very much for her question she be an absolutely superb advocate for her constituent and the city of wolverhampton i be pleased to tell she that the investment zone programme be under way a shortlist of place in england select for inclusion in the programme be announce in the spring budget and the west midland be of they we be co developing proposal and we will look very carefully at her proposal for the reason that she set out 
 i draw my hon friend the minister ’s attention to the uncertain future of the housing development in long eaton in my constituency it have be at a standstill since the termination of the house builder ’s contract month ago what further support be available to encourage the site owner to complete the more than home plan for the site so that the development be not leave to deteriorate beyond repair 
 i be of course concerned to hear about the situation that my hon friend highlight and i would be pleased to discuss it with she in more detail if that would be helpful more generally we be introduce a range of measure to increase transparency about build out to ensure that when development proposal be bring forward the development actually get build 
 labour run kirklees council be take in million of pound from housing developer through the section levy but local people be lose confidence in the system as they just do not see the money be spend on local school local road or local health service do the minister agree that developer contribution which be give to improve local infrastructure that be affect by major housing development should be spend on just that 
 my hon friend highlight a most unsatisfactory state of affair from labour run kirklees council we be introduce a new infrastructure levy that will bring much need transparency local authority include kirklee should be spend that precious money on the infrastructure need for local people 
 with the growth in development of new housing across my constituency we must ensure that adequate provision be in place to meet the essential need of resident such as at the bramshall meadows development where resident be wait for the play space they be promise and at branston locks where new healthcare service be need to support that development can the minister provide an update on what be be do to guarantee the successful and timely integration of these vital facility in new housing development 
 my hon friend highlight well on behalf of her constituent the vital and press need for the levelling up and regeneration bill which include measure to tackle exactly the issue she have highlight it will introduce a new infrastructure levy which will reform the system of developer contribution bring certainty and transparency over the infrastructure need to be deliver alongside development 
 to address the housing crisis we need to be build more home for social rent and planning department must be properly resource in personnel and funding will my hon friend set out the step she be take to address those specific issue 
 my hon friend speak with considerable expertise on these matter we know that many local planning authority be face capacity and capability challenge which be why we have develop a programme of support work with partner across the planning sector to put more skill and capacity into planning authority our levelling up white paper be commit to increase the supply of social rent home across the country 
 lib dem run eastleigh borough council which be develop home on horton heath last week pass a planning amendment to recklessly remove all affordable housing obligation despite its be the developer of the site will my hon friend condemn that cynical move and assure i that no homes england money will be use to backfill the gap 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the reckless behaviour of his liberal democrat run council i completely agree that it be a disgraceful state of affair the council should be use that funding secure to deliver the affordable housing that his resident rightly need and deserve as he suggest homes england will definitely not be contribute to backfille that need 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i do not doubt the minister ’s good intention on house building but do she accept that accord to her own department ’s figure housing start fall by year on year in the month of this year that be down to a figure of just more than start which be half the figure need to hit home a year on that basis do she conclude like i that not merely be her policy not succeed in hit the housing target but it be considerably contribute to their failure 
 the hon gentleman bring his considerable knowledge to this matter but i will take no lecture from he and the labour party on house building this government deliver house in that be the high level for more than year include the entire time that the labour party be in government 
 we do not just need to build affordable home we also need to build high quality home that be fit for the future and climate resilient in the past year the average cost of repair a home from flood damage have be £ a property and aviva calculate that in home be now at risk of flooding will the government ensure that their propose national planning policy framework will finally prevent unprotected home from be build in flood risk area 
 the hon lady raise an important issue the consultation on the nppf have be well subscribe we be analyse the response now but i be sure we will be able to say more in due course 
 in westmorland and lonsdale average house price be time average household income the danger we have be that when we see house develop we be meet demand but not need should the government not give we far great planning control so that we can ensure that we do not see home build that be a waste of brick go into the home market instead we should ensure that they be affordable home socially rent for local family 
 local authority have a huge amount of freedom they have be give the tool by the government through legislation through developer contribution power and through homes england grant to deliver affordable home the hon member will also know about the wide work we be do on home to enable local authority to raise council tax i hope he can see that the direction of travel will help alleviate some of the pressure he have highlight 
 the government be notoriously bad at dispose of public land i need only look at nhs property services and the year wait on the bootham park hospital site and at ministry of defence land so will the minister look at how that can be co ordinated and hand over to homes england so that we can get build the housing that be desperately need in place such as york 
 the hon lady will be pleased to hear that this be a priority for we i take issue slightly with her comment that we have a poor record of dispose of public land often that public land be need by hospital and the mod so we be work closely and look at where such land can be bring forward for housing if it can we absolutely will be do that 
 among the snp failure that the secretary of state choose not to mention be the fact that since the snp come to government in we have be build new council and social rent house at time the rate of any government cover england do the minister accept that if successive labour and tory governments have follow the snp ’s example in scotland the housing crisis in england would be far less than it currently be 
 no 
 i thank the minister very much for her response of the key issue be for urgent planning decision to be make the minister have a keen interest in northern ireland where the population have rise by about up to thing that need to be do be on infrastructure decision which need to be make here nationally not regionally what discussion have she have with the northern ireland assembly to ensure that those decision can be make to the benefit of all of we in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 only if the assembly sit 
 i thank the hon gentleman so much he be an active participant in all the debate we have on these issue i continue to work closely with he and his colleague in northern ireland because we can work together and learn lesson from each other 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 do the government realise how absurd all of this sound their own flagship levelling up and regeneration bill which be currently make its way through the house of lords have measure in it to block new home from be build and yet the minister stand here berate council for get in the way all of this be happen because conservative back benchers have more control of housing policy than their government so when the local conservative mp in cambridge say that his late scheme will not happen he be probably right be he not 
 i do not quite know how to give that a serious response i have just set out in huge detail all the work back by public funding taxpayer money go into deliver the house that people need up and down the country as far as i can see the only people block housing development be those such as the hon lady who be object to development in her own constituency 
 it be literally in the government ’s own bill they be try to block new house from be build they have have housing ministers and planning overhaul and house building be at its low level for a generation 
 which clause 
 the secretary of state want to talk now why do he not take the question i suspect it be because he have again run into so much opposition from his back benchers about a story brief only yesterday that he have have to abandon it small and medium sized house builder have be protest to downing street and mortgage have go through the roof it really do take some brass neck to present that as anything other than an appalling record 
 i have in my hand an analysis that show that all this chaos will cost the economy £ be the government the only people leave in britain who can not admit that the housing crisis the mortgage crisis the cost of live crisis and the economic crisis have cause tory government 
 that be a flight of fantasy with several question i be happy to engage with the hon lady on the detail of the clause in the levelling up and regeneration bill but i be proud of the government ’s record in bring forward levelling up across the whole country with house building back by billion of pound of public funding and taxpayer money as i say in answer to   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts our house building record be great than that of her party for the entire time they be in government 
 what step his department be take to end rough sleeping 
 the government be commit to end rough sleeping last year we publish our cross government strategy ending rough sleeping for good which set out how we be invest a huge £ over year to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in there be less rough sleeping than the peak and less than in before the pandemic 
 the good way to tackle rough sleeping and homelessness be to increase the supply of house for people to live in a joint report have be release today by the all party parliamentary group for housing market and housing delivery which i chair and the all party parliamentary group for end homelessness which be chair by my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman   and   the hon member for vauxhall florence eshalomi the report find that we could bring house on to the market through conversion will the minister meet i and a local charity that be very keen to do that to discuss how we can take that forward 
 i would be delighted to come to milton keynes to meet my hon friend and his local charity i want to reassure he that this government be commit to increase the supply of affordable housing and to ensure that all house be safe and of a decent standard i look forward to read in detail the appg recommendation 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i have be delighted to confirm that lord morse will be the new chair of the office for local government we be advertise the post of chief executive which would suit someone with experience of local government who be look for a new role so i will pass on detail to the shadow secretary of state 
 follow the wonderful news that the leslie sports foundation base at shelley community football club have be award £ from the community ownership fund will minister visit the foundation to view its exist facility and discuss its exciting plan for the newly fund 
 i congratulate my hon friend on be a brilliant advocate for that project i have no doubt that the work of the leslie sports foundation will make a huge difference to the life of people in his constituency the minister for levelling up my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison would be delighted to visit 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be now over year since the conservatives promise to ban section no fault eviction it need strengthen but the government finally publish a renters reform   bill in may this year give the desperate situation that many renter be currently face and the urgent need to provide they with great security and well right why have the government not lift a finger to progress that legislation in the week since it be publish 
 i share the hon gentleman ’s desire to do more to help people in the private rent sector but as he will have hear we want to make sure that we have a fit for purpose impact assessment so that the house could reflect on the change that we be make and the benefit they will bring 
 what assessment have the department make of the use of cash retention in the construction industry and of possible measure that could prevent the practice which cause cash flow issue and costly administrative burden for subcontractor include those involve in house building

 it have be more than day since the renters reform bill be introduce to parliament despite ample parliamentary time the government have fail to set a date for reading in the last few week alone the house have finish at pm and pm due to the government bring forward no business why do the government not care about renter 
 the bill as you know mr speaker be beautifully form but the impact assessment that go with it as i point out early to my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope need to be read in the round to see what a great piece of legislation it be thing that would enable we to bring forward legislation be if the labour party be to end its pointless opposition to our illegal migration bill it be curious that the labour party seem keener on be on the side of people smuggler than it be on the side of the private rented sector 
 the recent transfer of the administration of home equity loan from target to lenvi have go appallingly badly with my constituent report unanswered email and phone that ring out with no reply when they be look to transfer their home in a time critical phase will my right hon friend update i on what be go on with the administration

 my right hon friend will know from my constant lobbying of he that it be my belief that the revenue support grant mechanism be inherently unfair and mean that rural authority such as dorset and particularly in west dorset receive little if any revenue support grant compare to the ten of million that many urban area such as wandsworth receive will my right hon friend kindly tell i what he be do to restore that balance and fairness for rural area 
 my hon friend have absolutely make this case on multiple occasion both to my right hon friend the secretary of state and to myself he be a champion for west dorset and for rural community in general we will continue to work with local mp who be concerned about this but i would just gently point out that the primacy and the desire of the local government sector in this financial year have be for clarity and consistency which be what we have provide to they through the local government financial settlement this year

 it do indeed sound a concern case and we will follow up 
 property management company be undoubtedly hold back home ownership new homeowner be often oblige to sign up to contract that they can not leave that leave they stick with inflated fee and very often with poor service i be sure the minister agree that management company need their activity curb they need legislation impose on they so that we can get back to a fair system of housing

 no it be the scottish national party that do not want devolution it want independence it be in the name be n’t it they be nationalists and they want to break up the united kingdom we extend devolution within england and we support it in scotland 
 thank to the government ’s brownfield land release fund solihull council be get on with the job of regenerate kingshurst village centre include by build new environmentally friendly house with that in mind will the secretary of state accept my invitation to see at hand the progress of the regeneration of kingshurst village centre and see how it can be support far by a successful levelling up fund round application

 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that it be the clearly express will of northern ireland ’s people to be embed in the united kingdom and we need to make sure that the eu take a constructive approach follow on from the publication of the windsor framework my right hon friend the foreign secretary and the northern ireland secretary be take that forward

 my hon friend be a brilliant champion for well provision of playground and strong support for family and young people the community ownership fund be available for some of the purpose she mention but i look forward to work with she to do more in this area 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on measure to improve the criminal justice response to rape and sexual violence 
 this government be unswervingly commit to protect the public and fight crime as i be sure member across the house will agree few part of that mission be as important as the ongoing effort to tackle rape and sexual violence as i hear on my recent visit to greater manchester police these be sicken destructive crime that can only have a significant impact on human dignity they be a betrayal of everything we stand for as a law abide society and they can have profound and lifelong consequence my thought and prayer be with every single victim 
 although we be unite in our outrage at these horrific act sadly we can not turn back the clock what we can do and what this government be determined to do be ensure that the criminal justice system do not add to the suffering and trauma experience by victim and survivor on that note i will update the house on the work be do to drive improvement in the criminal justice response to rape and sexual violence 
 year ago in the rape review the government set out step to transform support for victim and to ensure case be fully investigate and rigorously pursue through the court crucially we hear that many victim who have report to the police feel that they be the one under investigation and do not feel believe for example we know that victim have face digital strip search with intrusive request for access to their mobile phone last year we change the law to end such distressing and intrusive practice and to protect victim right to privacy where it be necessary we be introduce new legislation through the victims and prisoners bill so that therapy note and other personal record be access only when necessary and proportionate to an investigation but we must go far the investigation of rape must be no different from the investigation of any other crime with the focus firmly on the suspect 
 to support police to transform its response to rape the home office have already provide over £ to operation soteria bring together more than world lead academic from across the country lead by professor betsy stanko and professor katrin hol and frontline officer from police force to develop the new national operating model for rape and serious sexual offence investigation this model launch today mean that all police force in england and wales will now have the tool they can apply to conduct suspect focus investigation which ensure victim need and right be central through the college of policing they can access learning to develop their skill and build a comprehensive understanding of the psychology of sexual offending 
 police force have participate in the programme and we have already see sign of change all pathfinder force have see an increase in the number of case be refer to the crown prosecution service and a reduction in the average number of day take for   a charge outcome to be assign charge volume in avon and somerset have more than triple rise from charge to charge in october to december the met have see an reduction in victim withdraw with this fall from case before soteria to case in october to december the charge rate in durham have increase rise from to since that force ’s involvement in operation soteria the number of case be refer to the cps by west midlands police have double with it rise from to case and charge volume in south wales have increase by rise from case before operation soteria to case in october to december 
 my right hon and learn friend the home secretary and i be encourage that all police force in england and wales have commit to implement this new approach we have already meet or be on track to meet the ambitious target set out in the review ahead of schedule to more than double the number of adult rape case reach court by the end of this parliament and to return the volume of case be refer to the police charge by the cps and go to court to at least level 
 we want to go far and fast and we be do exactly that by provide a furth £ to continue to support the police to improve their response to rape that will be use to establish a new joint unit with the national police chiefs council and the college of policing to oversee and support force as they implement the model continue to draw on academic expertise and oversight we will continue to roll out a government fund uplift in technical capacity and capability to ensure that no adult victim of rape be without a phone for more than hour 
 the npcc and college of policing have also make significant commitment police investigator will complete specialist training on the investigation of rape and sexual offence by april next year a new responder course will be compulsory for all new police recruit from april next year to ensure that victim of rape get the right support and treatment they need at the time of reporting we will also consult police partner on the most effective way those officer can be use include the effectiveness of dedicated rape and sexual assault investigatory unit 
 operation soteria have show the importance of scrutiny to drive progress which be why the home secretary have also commission his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service to carry out a thematic inspection on force implementation of the soteria model i want to be clear there be furth to go and there be no room for complacency we want victim to have the confidence to report these crime know they will get the support they need and that everything possible can and will be do to bring offender to justice this government will work with police to do everything in our power to ensure that happen and i commend this statement to the house 
 i of course welcome today ’s statement any progress on this issue be to be welcome but i would outline that the rape review be commission in it then take year to publish and we rightly get an apology from the   government for the catastrophic decline in prosecution however the report contain only piecemeal change which be why another year on we be here today discuss progress yes but marginal progress 
 in the datum outline by the minister on the number of case now be charge she do not make it clear that hundred of case be still not charge in each police force area she speak of the government seek to get back to standard without recognise that it be on their watch that the system crash charge and prosecution drop to their low level on record just at the time when rape offence record by the police skyrocket to record level what the government be celebrate today be simply the beginning of a reversal of their failure of survivor like smash a vase and celebrate when it be half stick back together with sellotape in this time countless rape victim have be leave unsupported or have drop their case or never even come forward this morning i receive a text message from a rape victim i have be support who wait over year for her case to be hear she say 
 be there anyway i can see you this week i really need to speak to someone before all this get any bad i just can not deal with my own head right now 
 she like thousand of other have be let down by the system and the public have be leave at risk with attacker still walk free 
 the number that the government have not mention today be those for outstanding rape case which show a record high of up from a year previously more rape victim be wait long than ever before the government ’s own scorecard for have the attrition figure at a staggering survivor be still be leave unsupported and be drop their case will the minister say whether the government will back labour ’s proposal for all rape victim to have legal advocate when my hon friend   the member for lewisham west and penge ellie reeves   push that amendment tomorrow in the victims and prisoners public bill committee rape crisis have call for it the labour party would do it and the victim need it will the government vote against support for rape victim tomorrow 
 the green shoot of police improvement from operation soteria be welcome as be its roll out as a national operating standard however to be successful it must maintain that academic rigour and independent input throughout the national implementation it can not just be a good pilot that be spread out to police force as a checkbox will the minister confirm that the academic rigour that the scheme start with will continue in every of the force as it be roll out the total number of charge for adult rape in quarter of be in quarter of it be a drop 
 labour announce over year ago that we would implement specialist rape court list rape case as a priority and fast track they the labour party have call again and again for specialist rape and sexual offence unit in every police force something that still do not exist the government say today that they be have a think about they i ask that they think a little fast if they have listen they could have all be roll out and could be support survivor now labour would also increase the number of prosecutor to put rapist behind bar and reduce the record backlog across the court we welcome progress but the government could and should be do much more 
 i thank the hon lady for those comment i be afraid that i do not accept that the work have be piecemeal this be a sea change in how the model be be operate i have do some research my civil servant have do some research and i have speak to the academic and the people who meet victim all the time there be no other country in the world that i can find that have a similar operating model over academic have work tirelessly with some excellent officer this be not piecemeal this be a sea change but there be a lot more to do 
 i do not accept that the change be marginal it be fundamental this be a different way of look at victim and the suspect it must not be forget that all crime not just particular different sort of crime need to be hammer down and stop by the government that be what we expect from the judiciary the police and the crown prosecution service 
 yes rape case be of course far too high they be come down and more must be do i too be concerned about attrition we must change that so that we can support our woman and boy and man at time who have be rap there be academic rigour and it will be roll out there will be proper monitoring and there be a proper unit to make sure that the operating model be roll out properly 
 the question of specialist rape court be bring up often by the hon lady of course it be a very complex matter with respect all victim of crime deserve decent proper court we should not be single out offence over another because all these crime be heinous and they all deserve a resolution to the complex situation 
 we have already complete a national roll out of pre recorded evidence which be of the main thing victim ask about when they want special rape trial through that roll out of pre recorded evidence we be spar victim the ordeal of appear before a live courtroom which help they to give their good evidence we be talk today about evidence 
 to ease the court process far we be update the victim code so that member of the crown prosecution service team must meet rape victim ahead of their court case to answer their question and allay any fear they have in the next phase of our specialist sexual violence support project we will ensure that at participate crown court include snaresbrook where i commonly work leeds and newcastle the option to remotely observe a sentencing hearing by video link be available to any adult rape victim who need it subject to the judge ’s agreement 
 these be complex issue the work be on evidence not rhetoric we be get there but there be a lot more to do 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 i gently say to my hon friend the minister that some kind of offence can and should be single out actually that be exactly what we have do with the strategy on violence against woman and girl with the landmark domestic abuse act because we have to recognise that sexual offence against woman have a particular personal traumatic impact and we need to do more 
 however i be pleased to hear her single out avon and somerset police and i pay tribute to chief constable sarah crew who be the most amazing woman and have spearhead effort in that police force to ensure victim be treat sensitively appropriately and swiftly the same can not be say about every police force 
 we be now some month or so on from the casey review into the metropolitan police and too many woman still say to i that they do not want to report a crime against they to the met because they have no confidence that it will be treat fairly and properly and that they will not end up be the one on trial what more can my hon friend the minister do to instil as she put it confidence to report crime when it come to our capital ’s police force 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend i know she do great work in this area i too have be thoroughly impressed at my many meeting with sarah crew she really be a breath of fresh air and i put a lot of hope in the way that she have manage to roll out new idea about how to police this area of course these be heinous crime and very special offence 
 in relation to the metropolitan police i have meet the commissioner and the deputy commissioner and i sense there be a change the oil tanker be move at the moment it be move too slowly it need to move fast i be optimistic about the new training that new officer be receive the emphasis on specialist train officer be encouraging and i be sure we will see progress 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 i associate myself with the word of the chair of the women and equalities committee   the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes i agree with everything that she just say more than a year ago the home affairs committee recommend that all police force should establish specialist rape investigation team we know that they produce well decision making can address delay and improve communication with victim and the cps 
 we also urge the government to collect and publish datum on the number of police officer in each force with specialist rape and serious sexual offence training can the minister explain why specialist rape investigation team be still not in place in every police force and what she will do about that can she confirm how many serve police officer as of today have receive specialist training on rape and serious sexual assault what proportion of the new recruit will also receive that specialist training 
 i thank the right hon lady for her incisive question i suggest that the issue be about specialism rather than specialist unit all police force have different operational way of work she will recall the evidence of sarah crew who say that there be no quick fix for each particular force she say that every force must look closely at the way they be operate however specialism of training be key the national police chiefs council be very firmly look at what will   be roll out the module in relation to domestic abuse and to rape and serious sexual offence be be update the right hon lady be quite right to point to training as that be important she mention datum which be also very important we be improve and collect more datum far more than have be collect previously as far as i be advise i be optimistic that we be work together her committee play a vital role in assist the expert and inform the way that they work 
 i welcome the government ’s measure on rape and sexual violence but i invite the minister to consider this colin pitchfork who brutally rap and horrifically murder teenage woman in my constituency be be provisionally release by the independent parole board i know that she do not have responsibility for the parole board but what my constituent and i think the wide british public do not understand be how somebody who have commit appal sexual violence against young woman can possibly be release do she agree that that position can only be regard as irrational 
 i agree with my hon friend the case of colin pitchfork be dreadful and i be very aware that the ministry of justice be work hard on that recently my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor say that he expect more work to be do in this space i commend my hon friend for the hard work that he do in his constituency and nationally in this area 
 it be clear that operation soteria be see improvement but frankly the bar be very low i associate myself with the comment of the chair of the women and equalities committee that the crime that we be discuss be different faith in police and the justice sector more generally be impact when a force that be use soteria the met be find in the casey report to have 
 a strategic and operational failure to tackle rape and sexual offence which compound the harm of the victim 
 i note in the minister ’s statement comment in relation to the thematic inspection it be not just about training but about ensure that those resource have the time and capability to be able to investigate those crime will the thematic inspection be look at that 
 as far as i have be instruct the inspector will be look at that the casey review make for very sobering reading it be paramount that public trust in the met be restore and we have to work hard on that the home secretary have make it very clear that standard must and will improve in the met as a matter of urgency she like i will continue to hold the commissioner and the mayor of london to account for deliver that change i thank the hon lady for her continue interest in this important area of work 
 do my hon friend agree that in order to rid victim of the feeling of shame associate with rape and to encourage more victim to speak out the investigation of rape must focus on the suspect rather than the undermining and digital strip searching of the victim 
 my hon friend make of the most important point so far this afternoon the shame and blaming must change we need to treat rape sensitively and focus a little more on the aggressor the alleged rapist to ensure that there be more fairness and justice in investigation that have be lack the government be clear about that when they apologise recently for the way that this issue have not be look into sufficiently we need to believe the victim and make sure that there be fairness in the way that the evidence be obtain 
 we all welcome progress however small that may be the minister have say that the tanker be slowly turn and there be a lot more to do do she not agree that major issue be around people have the confidence to engage with the system which would be well serve by its embrace the principle of the independent legal advocate scheme 
 the government do not agree at this stage that that be the right way forward the crux of the matter lie with specialism of the investigation with sensitive policing listen to victim and let they know for example that they can have their digital equipment and their telephone back in hour rather than have they take by the police and on some occasion leave for week or month without be return it be all about confidence but it be also about specialism of the investigate officer and of the prosecutor 
 i have a constituent who be brutally rap in the 80 despite present the evidence then and again more recently she never get the support or the justice she deserve due to failing within the met can the minister spell out what precise support historical victim of rape will receive follow the review will it mean that for my constituent and other victim of rape justice will finally be secure 
 as far as i be aware through the ministry of justice ’s new victims and prisoners bill all victim will receive further assistance these be heinous crime and whether the crime happen a day a year a decade or year ago all victim deserve support i congratulate my hon friend on the amount of work that she do in this area and i will be happy to write to she or to get the relevant minister in the ministry of justice to write to she with more particular 
 in the police crime sentencing and courts act the government introduce pre recorded cross examination to allow victim to pre record their evidence and spare they the trauma of attend court in person what progress have be make across the court system with those new procedure also can the minister reassure i and my constituent that when sentence rapist be now serve long in prison than they be before 
 give confidence to anybody who appear in court be important particularly with this sort of heinous crime as i mention early we have complete a national roll out of that pre recorded evidence which spar the victim of those ordeal and really make a massive difference it be of the thing that be bring up time and again when i speak to victim they want to give their evidence in a fair way and not to feel that they be on trial that be exactly why the government be roll out pre recorded evidence the victim code will go even far in allow and in fact mandate prosecutor to meet people who be about to give evidence and who have be the victim of an allege rape it be a really good step forward and i commend the victim code to the house 
 i thank the minister very much for respond to question and for her statement while i welcome the fact that the police force in england and wales be to implement a new approach to investigate rape can i ask the minister what information share there be with the regional administrations about these protocol and what additional funding be available to help the police service of northern ireland and the northern ireland justice system to see this apparently attainable improvement replicate in northern ireland 
 this holistic new approach be suppose to affect and influence the whole way we deal with fighting rape investigate gather evidence and get case before the court i want to see that specialism and those measure roll out everywhere i would be very happy to get the relevant minister to write to the hon gentleman to explain what more we can do to assist the special situation and what we have in northern ireland it do not matter where someone live if a woman or a man have be rap they deserve to have that support i be grateful for the question 
 rise 
 let we take point of order at a time we will start with andy mcdonald and then go across to the government side 
 on a point of order mr speaker last friday the northern echo ’s front page and editorial lament the apparent decision of advanced cables to build its new facility on the tyne rather than the tees quote tees valley mayor ben houchen and   the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke who both blame i for the company so decide without a single shred of evidence for such a ridiculous notion 
 company of course make their decision on the basis of their own assessment and due diligence process however such personal and unfounded attack be not without consequence last week a senior corporate lawyer andrew lindsay post on his linkedin account 
 if it turn out the enquiry conclude that there be nothing to be see here and in the meantime some investment and job be lose local labour mp andy mcdonald should be drag through the street of teesside and lynch 
 that have deeply upset and alarm my family and i 
 i have report the matter appropriately but give the murder in recent year of jo cox of sir david amess and of andrew pennington nigel jones ’s personal aide and not forget the stabbing of our right hon friend   the member for east ham sir stephen timms i seek your guidance on what can be do to ensure that legitimate debate on matter of such significance to our constituent do not spill over in a manner such that the appal comment of the like of mr lindsay be increasingly likely what more can this house do to protect and support member who be on the receive end of such abuse and to reduce the likelihood of such dreadful outburst be they on social medium or elsewhere 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order as he say people be entitle to make their view know inside and outside this house but threat to member be very real and those who comment should consider the potential effect of their word before post injudiciously rather than afterwards i take this very seriously when he texte i on friday i also speak to people about security issue i will not go into that part of it but he can rest assure that we will defend member on both side of the house nobody should be threaten as they carry out their duty we will certainly not forget those who be murder carry out their duty 
 on a point of order mr speaker after a westminster hall debate on   july in which the house reassert its commitment to never forget the genocide of srebrenica and the need to   safeguard the dayton agreement i be deeply alarmed to see that my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns the chair of the foreign affairs committee be threaten by the president of serbia who say in response to her speech 
 we be already conduct an investigation against you to see what you be do to see who be pay you and to see why you be put the republic of serbia in such a position if the government of great britain be not willing to react it be not a problem we will be force to react 
 that be an unacceptable statement from a head of state it be not just a threat to my hon friend the member for rutland and melton but an intimidation tactic against all mp can you reassure i mr speaker that no pressure bring to bear outside this place especially by foreign government will ever endanger the security or privacy of mps and that the full weight of parliament will be use to prevent and dissuade bully tactic and ensure that mps can speak the truth do you believe mr speaker that this be a moment at which the serbian ambassador should be call to explain that position and that statement 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order it be fundamentally a constitutional principle that mps should be able to speak freely in proceeding of this house threat to member do their job be totally unacceptable whoever make they beyond that i remind he that we do not discuss operational security matter in public and he would not expect i to go far than that but i will say that of course we take this seriously and member should no matter their position be they a back bencher or a chair of a select committee be able to speak out openly and freely without intimidation 
 as a reminder to foreign state they have no right to threaten anyone in this house to go a stage far i be sure that the treasury bench will have hear the hon gentleman ’s request to summon the ambassador as he know that decision be not a matter for i but i have certainly echo his request for that to take place 
 on a point of order mr speaker for the past year i have have the privilege of be the patron of stockton rugby club a tremendous community organisation that work with more than boy and girl who play the game and run several youth and adult team today i be proud to wear the junior academy tie would it be in order for i to invite you mr speaker and colleague across the house to join i in congratulate the club on its anniversary and wish it well for the next year 
 of course even if it be rugby union i be happy to recognise those year of play rugby it be just a tragedy that the club do not take up rugby league when the northern union be form but despite that disappointment of course i congratulate those at the club—150 year be a significant milestone in any sport 
 we now come to the privilege motion no amendment have be select 
 i beg to move 
 that this house 
 a note with approval the special report from the committee of privileges 
 b consider that where the house have agree to refer a matter relate to individual conduct to the committee of privileges members of this house should not impugn the integrity of that committee or its member or attempt to lobby or intimidate those member or to encourage other to do so since such behaviour undermine the proceeding of the house and be itself capable of be a contempt and

 in accordance with the convention on matter of privilege as leader of the house i have bring forward this motion to facilitate the house ’s consideration of the special report of the privileges committee publish on   june the motion note with approval the committee ’s special report and seek to reaffirm essential principle underpin the protection of parliamentary privilege and the functioning of this house and its committees make it explicit that the house consider that those protection be fundamental to investigation of the privileges committee 
 paragraph c draw to the attention of the house of lords the issue raise in the report through a formal message the house may wish to know that the leader of the house of lords have write to i to emphasise that these be serious and important matter while recognise that each house be responsible for the organisation of its own affair the report have be place in the lords library and i know that my noble friend lord true be continue conversation with other in that house on this important matter 
 in my speech on   june i take some time to explain the role of the privileges committee and why it matter to all of we here and to our constituent that it exist and that it have people who be prepared to serve on it in that debate we also hear some of the thing that member of the committee have to endure while they carry out the duty this house have require of they i shall not repeat those point but i wish to make further point a pre emptive strike on an issue that may arise during today ’s debate and secondly a personal reflection 
 undermine a committee should not be confuse with the expression of legitimate concern about the work or its process member must be free to raise such concern and there be appropriate way of do so indeed the committee ’s report highlight the various way this can be do in particular cite the approach of my hon friend   the member for stone sir william cash who raise matter before during and after the committee ’s original inquiry in a perfectly proper way if an hon member have concern about any matter of privilege and the internal affair of this house and its committees they may write to the speaker who may afford the issue precedence for consideration those be the appropriate channel for raise such issue and it be every member ’s right to do so 
 i would like to highlight that this an exceptional situation it be not the usual cut and thrust of politic a special report of the privileges committee regard interference in its work be entirely unprecedented and that have lead i to consider the reason why be it perhaps because the nature of politic have change so much or because the obligation we have towards another and to this place and the esteem in which we hope it be hold be less clear perhaps it be because we feel little responsibility towards other right hon and hon member even those in our own party and still less for what our word and deed may encourage other to do outside this place be it that personal honour matter less or good manner i hope not 
 i hope that the colleague name will reflect on their action of the most painful aspect of this whole affair be that it have involve animosity between colleague of the same political view but i know of at least member name in the report who have take the time to speak with regret to some other member of the committee and i applaud they for do so i hope that some speaker today will acknowledge that obligation we have to another as colleague if castlereagh and canning could adopt polite civility after fight a duel i live in hope that today will be the end of this sorry affair 
 it be a pleasure to follow the right hon lady 
 over the past few year the conservative party have drag the reputation of this house through the mud and leave it fester in the gutter when the privileges committee publish its report week ago which find that mr johnson lie to this house and the people of this country many people must have think that standard in public life have hit rock bottom that they could not get any low however the shameful action of senior tory mps spell out in the report we be debate today have damage the public ’s trust in parliament far still 
 some mp i be afraid to say attack the personal character and integrity of individual member of the committee from the comfort of their own bully pulpit tv show some accuse the committee of not follow due process and do everything they could to whip up an atmosphere of distrust throw their toy out of the pram as if it be rule for they and their friend and another for everyone else they be quite wrong while their attempt to undermine and attack britain ’s democratic institution be shocking it be important that we remember that they be not successful this house do vote to approve the committee ’s report into mr johnson in full and sanction he appropriately just like their friend who they be try to get off the hook unfortunately the name mps be have to be hold accountable today for their action 
 i share the desire of the leader of the house for those member to use today ’s debate to set a line and show that they have recognise what they have do so that we can move on that matter because we have to approve the report in full as it say 
 our democracy depend on mps be able to trust that what minister say in the house of commons be the truth if ministers can not be trust to tell the truth the house can not do its job and the confidence of the public in our whole political system be undermine 
 in other word tell the truth be the foundation of a function parliament and when there be allegation that a minister have not tell the truth we simply must have a mechanism for investigate they if we do not there would be no way to hold they to account that be the role of the privileges committee the motion we be debate today protect the committee and allow its member to continue to do their job on our behalf when we instruct they to do so it ensure that they can carry out their work so that we and the people of this country can trust what minister say this be about protect democracy 
 the motion put into effect the report ’s recommendation aim to stop mps put improper pressure on the committee and its member in future because improper pressure be put on the committee during the inquiry into mr johnson that be an exceptionally important piece of work that go right to the heart of the public ’s trust in politician this report now make it clear that to vary degree example be list clearly in the annex to the report the name tory mps attempt to discredit the committee and its conclusion in some case before they have even see they and even push for resignation that ultimately amount to a co ordinated campaign by mr johnson ’s ally to influence the outcome of the inquiry in favour of their friend 
 co ordination of a campaign where be the evidence of that in the report it be just an assertion be it not
