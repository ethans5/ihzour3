 with permission i would like to make a statement about the government ’s support for film making in the uk film be of the great british success story of the last year ever since gordon brown create the film tax credit back in this amazing industry have create job and growth across the uk and fly the flag for british creativity across the world our government have huge ambition for the film sector and today we be introduce secondary legislation that will put rocket booster under this grow industry and unlock the potential of our incredible independent film sector 
 the uk have some special advantage that give we a natural competitive edge thank to the creativity and imagination of our author playwright and publisher we have some of the good story to tell and take to the screen help by some of the good story teller in the world the director scriptwriter and cinematographer and against some of the most incredible backdrop from the welsh valley to the north east coastline as well as act talent that be to none and that breathe life into those story our film industry be of our great economic and cultural success story it be worth £ and employ more than people and it have create true icon such as james bond harry potter and my personal favourite paddington bear 
 our government have aim for our film industry we want to attract the investment for uk film maker to make the good film in the world secondly we want uk audience to see film that reflect their life and their community that mean tell a wide diversity of british story that draw on the rich cultural inheritance in every region and nation thirdly we want the uk to be the good place in the world to make film because we have the right ingredient the investment the talent the technical skill the sound stage the creative imagination and the right fiscal and regulatory environment that be why this government will do everything in our power to ensure that the fiscal and regulatory environment match the ambition of film maker and studio around the world we want they to invest in great british film making 
 however the key to maintain that advantage be an internationally competitive tax regime and i think that be beyond party politic as member will know tax incentive for film be introduce by the last labour government in and the previous conservative government follow suit with the announcement of a plan uk independent film tax credit in the last spring budget we have hear loud and clear the industry ’s concern that any further delay to introduce this secondary legislation even to the end of the month may mean that investment in uk independent film be lose so i be glad to announce that we have today lay the necessary statutory instrument under the negative process for the independent film tax credit to take effect it mean that eligible film with a budget of up to £ can claim enhance audiovisual expenditure credit at a rate of on their qualifying expenditure up to £ that be high than the standard rate   for other film the regulation set out the eligibility criterion for film production company who can apply from   october 
 this government do not underestimate how important this tax credit be big blockbuster movie be an important part of the mix but independent film be every bit as important both for the british talent that they allow to shine and for the untold story that they bring into the spotlight too often people do not see themselves and their community reflect in the story we tell ourselves about ourselves as a nation and this government be determined that will change 
 later today the london film festival will open with the world premiere of blitz write direct and produce by of our most successful british director steve mcqueen set in england during world war it be an example of exactly what film can do it bring together top talent on screen and off and it showcase the nation ’s history through storytelling and highlight on screen our beautiful country from london ’s east end to hull ’s old town our independent sector have produce film such as pride the king ’s speech and bend it like beckham which show our heritage our community and our culture to the world and act as a springboard from the grassroot for world class uk talent on screen and behind the scene 
 while major film production have flourish small budget independent film have not receive sufficient support over the past decade they face multiple challenge include rise production cost crew shortage and decline revenue which have hamper the growth of this vital sector while too much of our creative industry have traditionally be concentrate in just part of our country independent film thrive everywhere give the chance this uplift will not only boost creativity but create job growth and investment in every nation and region through that we will help the independent film sector to reach its full potential 
 while the uplift have be design to support and target british independent film maker i be glad to say that it be also open to qualify official co production because film and television co production be a key way in which the uk increase its cultural tie and collaboration with europe and the rest of the world 
 this government will go far still to support this critical industry the skill shortage that have be ignore for too long act as a break on the ambition of this incredible sector that be why this government launch skills england to bring about the skill we need for a decade of national renewal of our community business and country we will focus apprenticeship once more on young people to set they up to succeed and to help fill the vacancy in the creative sector the secretary of state for education be overhaul the apprenticeship levy to provide well career opportunity for young people build on the success of exist high quality apprenticeship in the creative industry and we be work closely with skills england to ensure that the new flexibility announce by the prime minister last month offer short apprenticeship and an improved offer for a creative skill pathway for young people embark on career in this sector every child should have the chance to live a rich large life and to consider a career in the art 
 in addition the ministry of housing communities and local government be keep the government ’s mission to deliver economic growth at front of mind when make decision about planning application i be pleased to announce to the house that yesterday mhclg recover an application for planning permission for marlow film studio in buckinghamshire the merit of that application will now be review by its ministers in detail before they reach a decision 
 finally next week the government will host the international investment summit where industry leader investor and business from across the world will come together to put the uk back at the global table and to kick start a decade of economic renewal as a critical part of that our creative industry will be at the summit ’s heart this government be commit to ensure that the uk be a choice destination for film production we be back up those word with action today britain be open for business and creativity be back at its heart i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the hon lady for her warm word of welcome at the beginning i think that be perhaps the beginning and end of the consensus that we might be able to reach today 
 if i may i will highlight a few area where we be in agreement i think we be in agreement that today ’s announcement be a thoroughly good thing for the british film industry secondly i think we be in agreement that a number of the initiative that this government be take forward include the football bill that she reference and various other issue relate to the competitiveness of our creative industry on the global stage be welcome and should receive cross party support 
 the hon lady mention the fact that the conservative government bring in this independent film tax credit at the last budget if that be true we would not be need to legislate today the truth be that the conservative government do what the conservative government do for year they talk a good game and then do   absolutely nothing to deliver for the people of this country she say that we vote against film tax credit but the truth as she well know be that we do not vote against they they be our idea and our initiative in in fact it be her party that oppose they in the place if they have have their way in our british film industry would not be where it be today which be rival hollywood as of the good film industry in the world she know full well that we support every of the measure that after year of oppose they they have to be drag kick and scream by the film industry the conservatives belatedly come to support she also know that we vote against successive conservative finance bills because as we be discover now that we have have a chance to open the book there be no money attach to any of the measure it be a hoax and a con trick practise on the british people 
 i have a great deal of respect for the hon lady and i be grateful to she not just for her welcome today and her warm word but for the support that she and other on the opposition benches have give i and the team to take up the mantle but if i have leave a sector with vacancy that it could not fill a legacy of creativity be erase from our community and our classroom and most of all a £ economic black hole that work class people be pay the price for up and down the country all of that and then have such a resounding rejection from the electorate only a few month ago i would be speak with a little bit more humility from the dispatch box

 i strongly agree support woman to return and to progress at work be a crucial part of secure economic growth it be very surprising that that be even in doubt this labour government be on the side of new mother which be why our plan to make work pay commit to strengthen their workplace   protection improve access to flexible working and create the condition for all parent to balance work and care

 the commitment of £ for a new hospital at watford general be of the many brilliant thing that the last conservative government do along with my good friend dean russell the former member of parliament for watford it would have be life change as well as lifesave for so many of my constituent why be the prime minister cancel that funding commitment and spend billion of pound on give pay rise to train driver instead

 when the prime minister talk about security at work once again it be rule for he and another rule for everyone else i know that not everything or everyone have survive his day in government so can he confirm that when he promise not to raise income tax national insurance or vat that commitment apply to both employer and employee national insurance contribution 
 as the right hon gentleman well know i be not go to get draw on decision that will be set out we make an absolute commitment to not raise tax on work people he of course be   the expert ’s expert on raise taxis and what do we get in return for it we get a broken economy break public service and a £ black hole in the economy we be here to stabilise the economy and we will do so 
 i do not think that even lord alli be buy any of that nonsense i be not ask about the budget i be ask specifically about the promise that the prime minister make to the british people so let i ask he again just to clarify his own promise do his commitment not to raise national insurance apply to both employee and employer national insurance contribution 
 we set out our promise in our manifesto we be return with a huge majority to change the country for the well and i stick to my promise in the manifesto but i notice that the right hon gentleman be on question and he have not yet welcome the investment into this country we have have in recent month £ from amazon for job across the country £ from blackstone for job across the north east £ on carbon capture for job in the north east and north west and £ for uk bus in northern ireland while we be invest in our economy what be conservative members do they be argue about whether to scrap maternity pay 
 i be very happy to welcome investment that my government negotiate but when it come to the prime minister ’s answer on tax business across the country would have find his answer just about as reassuring as sue gray find it when he promise to protect her job it be no wonder that confidence be plummet on his watch which he do not mention turn to another commitment before the election his chancellor say that change the debt target in the fiscal rule would be tantamount to fiddle the figure do he still agree with the chancellor 
 the right hon gentleman be literally the man who be in charge of the economy over year the conservatives crash the economy what do they leave a £ black hole in the economy unlike they we will not walk past it we will fix it and it be only because we be stabilise the economy that we be get investment into this country i notice that he have still not really talk about that investment we be power ahead with clean british energy change the rule to build home and return railway to public ownership and the conservatives have nothing to say about any of it 
 on debt we leave the government the low debt in the g7 as the institute for fiscal studies have said—[interruption 
 order i will hear the leader of the opposition 
 as the institute for fiscal studies have say it be 
 hard to escape the suspicion 
 that the government be attract to this change because 
 it would allow for significantly more borrowing 
 the chancellor previously say that this change would be fiddle the figure so i have a simple question do the prime minister still agree with the chancellor 
 i see the right hon gentleman be back to his old script of they ’ve never have it so good it do not work so well at the election so it might be time to change that i be not go to get draw on issue for the budget just as he would not when he stand at this dispatch box meanwhile we be invest and we be build the nhs so that it be fit for the future and back on its foot with well opportunity for young people and protection at work after year of tory failure we be give the country its future back and that be the difference that labour deliver 
 it be clear that the prime minister have open the door to raise employer national insurance contribution include on pension and fiddle the figure so that he can borrow more he talk about what he have achieve but economic confidence be plummet growth be now stall and the uk ’s borrowing cost be rise on his watch 
 can i close on another important topic yesterday ’s intervention from the head of mi5 will have be sober for the whole house not least his warning that britain face the most complex and interconnect threat in our country ’s history i know the prime minister will agree that our security service be owe a debt of gratitude for what they do to keep we safe but can he confirm that the forthcoming terrorism bill will give our security service the power they need to tackle evolving threat i can assure he of our constructive support on these vital question of national security in the same spirit that he provide that support to i 
 i can confirm that we will give the security force and service the power that they need and i hope that that be a share objective across the house they do an incredibly important job for we but the right hon gentleman talk about the economy and it be a real shame that the opposition can not simply interruption well he do at the beginning of his question a moment ago listen on it be a shame the opposition can not celebrate britain ’s success under this government of course we have to take tough decision but when investment be pour in as it have be in recent week when the nhs strike be come to an end when house be get build and when we be deliver the big upgrade of worker right in a generation it be time for they to accept that we be fix the foundation while they fight among themselves in the comfort zone of unfunded promise threaten to scrap the minimum wage we be go to get on with the job of clear up the mess they make and create the well country that people be cry out for 
 cancer be hard on the patient and on their family as my family know all too well this year will the prime minister commit to do all he can to improve research early diagnosis and patient care for those with cancer will he join i in thank the nhs staff who have look after my dad in recent week and the thousand of cancer patient like he in newcastle under lyme and up and down our united kingdom 
 i be sorry to hear about my hon friend ’s father and i think we would all pass he our good wish cancer be another example of the dreadful state the last government leave the nhs in the darzi report publish just a few week ago show that some cancer standard have not be meet since and that no progress be make in diagnose cancer at stage and stage between and i be really pleased that we have just announce a £ research network develop new ai software to identify cancer early we will get the nhs catch cancer on time diagnose it early and treat it fast 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats sir ed davey 
 across this house we all agree that we need to get our economy grow strongly again so that we can improve people ’s life and raise the money for our public service the liberal democrats believe that of the good way of do that be to improve our relationship with our european neighbour on thing like trade and i welcome the fact that the prime minister have make that a priority in his few week but what i just do not understand be that he have rule out negotiate a youth mobility scheme with our european partner this could be so good for young people for business and for re establish that relationship will he reconsider 
 the right hon gentleman be right we do need a well deal with the eu than the bad deal we get under the last government that be why i be pleased to meet the president of the commission last week to talk about how we can improve on the deal in our manifesto we have clear red line about the single market the customs union and freedom of movement and we will negotiate with those red line in place 
 i be disappointed about the youth mobility scheme maybe we can come back to that but the prime minister be right to say that of the many problem for our economy come from the dreadful brexit deal be the red tape that have be put on business there be many example of that but a new example come to i early this week it affect fisherman in the falklands who be have to pay huge amount in tariff to be able to sell their produce into the european market or sail under a spanish flag when the prime minister renegotiate the trade deal can he remember the overseas territory and ensure that british citizen fish off the falklands can sail proudly under the union jack 
 my uncle nearly lose his life when his ship be torpedo defend the falklands they be british and they will remain british the sovereignty of gibraltar be equally not to be negotiate of course we will do everything we can to make it easy for all business to trade more freely so that we can grow our economy but i have be very clear about the falklands it be personal to i 
 conservative lead derbyshire county council be propose to cut adult day centre and care home across derbyshire my constituent pat be diagnose with dementia in   the jubilee centre in new mills be a lifeline for she and her family she always return happy less confused and less anxious for david her partner and main carer it provide vital respite pat and david do not know how they will survive without it will the prime minister join i in ask the conservatives on derbyshire county council to think again and to oppose these devastating cut to old people and their family 
 i be shocked to hear of the impact on derbyshire county council which be propose cutback to adult social care council across the country be on the frontline of the last government ’s ruinous economic failure which have leave people who rely on service count the cost there be no quick fix but we will provide council with more stability and certainty through multi year funding settlement ensure that council can properly plan their finance for the future we will work with local leader to deliver this 
 do the prime minister have any sense of unease that although he be prime minister of great britain and northern ireland there be more than area of law in northern ireland in which legislation be make in a foreign parliament have he any ambition to recover uk sovereignty over those area of law thereby restore the equal citizenship of my constituent and end their disen franchising in respect of make law that govern much of their economy 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that important issue the windsor framework be negotiate by the last government we support it and we continue to support it we will work to make sure it be implement properly and fully 
 in child in my constituency live in poverty after housing cost be take into account so i welcome the government ’s commitment to tackle child poverty but we all know that every year of poverty have a long term impact when do the prime minister expect the welcome child poverty taskforce to report so that we can see action 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question it be appal that child poverty have go up by since after the last labour government do so much to bring it down tackle this be at the heart of our mission to break down the barrier to opportunity the taskforce be develop a strategy to reduce child poverty and it will be publish in the spring of next year 
 the prime minister ’s decision to impose vat on independent school strip hard work family of the ability to choose what be good for their child while risk job loss for teacher increase class size and squeeze state school resource to their absolute limit what action be he take to mitigate these impending threat if he be not undertake an impact assessment to understand they 
 i do understand that many parent across the country save hard to be able to send their child to private school because they have aspiration    for their child but so do every parent who send their child to a state school the problem be that we do not have enough teacher in key subject in our state secondary school the conservative party may be prepared to tolerate that but i be not that be why we have make this change to fund teacher interruption they chunter on but they have to answer the question that none of they be answer if they be not go to make this change be they go to leave our state secondary without the teacher they need or be   they go to cut the education budget by £ which be it 
 gloucester have a proud military history from the battle of the imjin river to raf quedgeley and the glorious glosters in fact almost of gloucester household be home to a veteran so can the prime minister update the house on what this government be do to support veteran in particular how he will meet his promise to ensure every veteran in gloucester have a roof over   their head 
 we owe an enormous debt to all our veteran it be a great honour to announce at our party conference that our plan to build new home across the country will ensure that homeless veteran be at the front of the queue for new social housing recognise their incredible sacrifice and contribution we will repay all those who serve we and house all veteran in housing need ensure home be there for hero we be also ensure veteran have access to support include with mental health and employment 
 special educational need budget in north yorkshire and across the uk be under huge pressure as they prepare for the budget will the prime minister and the chancellor look carefully at how increase funding and change to the funding formula could make a massive difference to the life of thousand of child across the country 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for raise this issue which be of real concern across the country for many parent who be concerned about provision i agree that child with special educational need and disability be be fail with parent struggle to get their child the support they need and deserve we have to change that i be determined to raise standard for every child so they succeed in education we will work with the sector and across the house where we can to deliver on that mission which be very important to many parent who will be watch today

 since the signing of the belfast agreement in more people in northern ireland have now sadly lose their life to suicide than those who be kill during the year of the trouble do the prime minister agree that the challenge with poor mental health in northern ireland some of which be directly relate to the violence    of our past be a unique and press legacy of the trouble will he therefore commit to task his government to work collaboratively with the department of health in northern ireland to explore how these issue can be properly recognise and resolve 
 i thank the hon member for raise that important matter i do know at hand the deep impact that the trouble have have on so many in northern ireland we must ensure that those with mental health issue receive the support and the care that they need public service be obviously devolve in northern ireland but we will work with the executive and leader to support they in deliver well outcome that be why my secretary of state for health and social care speak to the health minister in northern ireland in the week that he be in the department i be sure that he will be prepare to follow up on the matter should the hon member wish he to do so

 i thank my hon friend for his question this reinforce the point that the send provision be a failure of the previous government particularly in rural community the issue be feel by member on both side of the house it be really important and we have a duty now to pick it up and ensure that all child with send receive the right support to succeed in their education and we will continue to do so 
 on the assist die bill which be a private member ’s bill the government be quite rightly stay neutral but the real issue with the bill be that the time constraint of private legislation make it difficult to get it right time if we get this wrong time the consequence be too terrible to contemplate in the government of the day give time to allow david steel ’s abortion bill to go through will the prime minister commit to give extra time government time to the bill to ensure that we get this right time 
 i thank the right hon member for raise this question on a really important issue i do understand that there be strongly hold view across the house on both side and within both side if i can put it in that way i do agree with he that it be important that we ensure that any change to the law if there be to be be effective if this house give the bill a reading it will of course then go to committee as usual which will allow that more detailed scrutiny but we do need the discussion more broadly on this important issue 
 with share prosperity funding draw to a close and cornwall have some of the great potential in europe in critical mineral and renewable energy it be time for   our aspire celtic tiger to identify much more strategic source of investment funding which take we away from the short termist begging bowl politic of the previous decade will the prime minister meet cornish mp to discuss the future of industrial and social funding in cornwall 
 my hon friend be a proud cornish mp he be absolutely right that economic growth must be spread across the country it can not simply be focus in the south east and london he will no doubt have see today the float offshore wind taskforce report which set out that the uk ’s industry can support ten of thousand of job include huge job opportunity in the south west i will ensure that a meeting be arrange for he with the appropriate minister 
 today be pan panda awareness day which be about a paediatric condition affect potentially thousand of child across the uk i raise the condition in the chamber month ago when i hear about its devastating impact from a constituent do the prime minister agree that it should not be for a charity to fund the pathway analysis and research need to ensure that people and child get the support they need will he help facilitate a meeting for i with the charity and the department of health and social care 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this important issue and remind the house of the impact that it have i can certainly arrange that meeting so that we can take it far forward 
 my constituent be anxious about the financial situation at durham county council the tories unfair funding formula have hollow out essential public service such as social care while demand have be increase what assurance can the prime minister give i that essential service will be restore and that a new funding formula will be genuinely fair focus on the need of my constituent especially the most vulnerable 
 my hon friend highlight yet another failing of the last government successive year of underfunding have leave council experience significant budget pressure and that be feel by constituent resident    and individual across the country this government will clear up the mess and get council back on their foot multi year funding settlement will partly help to allow long term work to be do but we recognise the importance of council which know their community well with great stability we can support they in ensure that the service that they provide get to the people who need they

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland if he will make a statement on the northern ireland city deal 
 as the chancellor set out in july the government have inherit a £ black hole in the public finance as a result the treasury be have to consider a range of measure to deal with this significant problem last month the treasury inform the northern ireland department of finance that the uk government ’s contribution to the mid south west deal and the causeway coast and glens deal would now be consider as part of the spending review the belfast regional city deal and the derry londonderry and strabane city deal be unaffected and proceed as plan since the announcement of the pause on those deal i have meet with the minister the deputy minister the chief secretary to the treasury and the northern ireland finance minister i will also be meet the chief executive of those deal shortly 
 everyone in northern ireland understand the importance of the city deal to economic growth and encourage investment and this government be commit to work with the northern ireland executive and business to make the most of the huge economic opportunity that now lie ahead that be show by the progress be make on the belfast region city deal and the derry londonderry and strabane city deal i attend the derry londonderry and strabane city deal signing on   september the uk government ’s £ investment will help to progress transformative innovation digital and health project which will build on the region ’s well establish research excellence the chancellor will set out the result of the phase of the spending review on   october which will include an update on the outstanding city deal 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as the house will know on the evening of   friday september the day after we go into recess the government take it upon themselves to make a number of announcement affect northern ireland the cancellation of the casement park project the decision that sean brown ’s family will not be give a public inquiry into his murder and the subject of this urgent question the pausing of northern ireland city deal it be quite something to instantaneously unite all the political party in northern ireland but that be the feat achieve by the government on the evening of friday the 
 the house will be aware of how crucial the city deal be provide significant investment to boost economic growth create job and enhance infrastructure and bring together westminster belfast local council and private investment we be pleased that the follow day after considerable confusion the government u turn and announce that the belfast region city deal and the derry and strabane city deal would go ahead but the   other regional growth deal the causeway coast and glens deal and the mid south west deal now sit in limbo 
 critically those deal cover area that have not have the same level of investment in recent year as big city need only look at the empty shop in enniskillen and armagh to understand that these deal be badly need can the secretary of state tell the house why be the decision to pause take at such a time and why be it announce in such a way follow that announcement why be there then a u turn on of the deal but not the other what criterion be use to make that decision 
 the secretary of state have refer to money he know that the so call black hole for which the government have provide no breakdown be partially of labour ’s making give the above inflation pay rise that it have choose to award to the union he will know that the money involve be in the world of the exchequer not that significant and crucially will deliver major return to northern ireland and to the uk 
 i ask the secretary of state for thing the be an apology for how the matter be handle i know he would not have want it to happen in the way it do but someone should take responsibility for how the house and the people of northern ireland have be treat the be that in negotiate with the treasury in the run up to the budget he will be the lead advocate for un pause those city deal 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his response on the matter of casement park since he raise it i will say that we take the decision for the reason we set out and i think it be that he support on the question of sean brown i set out in my letter to the family why i have reach the conclusion that i do 
 i would just correct the hon gentleman the belfast city deal be never affect at all it be roar ahead and be a great success in the case of derry i be pleased to attend the signing of the deal which will now progress to its next stage 
 i would also simply say to the hon gentleman that the public finance inheritance the last government leave us—[interruption well the last government make a load of promise but never identify where the money to pay for they would come from and then they be turf out and leave this government to deal with the problem that be the reason for the situation with these city deal he can rest assure that i as secretary of state will continue to make the case for the city deal which be why i say in my opening answer to he that everybody in northern ireland include i understand their importance and i will continue to make that case but in those circumstance the chancellor have find it necessary to look at a whole range of commitment that be make by the last government for which no funding have be identify and the fault for that do not lie with we and if any apology be require a belate apology from the other side for the mess they leave we would be much appreciate 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 city and town in northern ireland have already miss out on levelling up funding under the previous government as i see at   hand as shadow minister so the uncertainty regard the city deal have be quite a hard hit on the people in northern ireland i seek further reassurance from the secretary of state that the people of northern ireland will not be overlook in the budget 
 i absolutely recognise the uncertainty that this have create and as i have indicate i will be meet the chief executive of the deal very shortly give the uncertainty while we await the outcome of the phase of the spending review the particular problem that they face be that a lot of effort go into progress these deal with the private partner because the money come from the government and from the northern ireland executive in the form of match funding and then other partner include the local council and they do find themselves in a difficult position i will not hide from that 
 the only other thing i would say be that those deal be much far back in the process than those for belfast and derry for the causeway coast and glens deal the head of term have be sign in april of this year and for the mid south west deal the term have yet to be sign i think they be due last month then there be a further process under which the programme of the deal itself be develop to then get to the stage that derry reach on   september when the financial agreement be sign and then the business case and the project be unlocked so i recognise that it be difficult and as i have already indicate to the council i will continue to argue for the cause of these deal 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the city and growth deal for northern ireland be critical mechanism in revitalise industry and create new economic opportunity across key region in northern ireland the pause in uk government funding have cause by the secretary of state ’s own admission uncertainty anxiety and lose impetus in key investment project under the city and growth deal framework the mid south west deal represent over £ of investment across the region the decision to allow project in belfast and derry to proceed while pause those in the mid south west and causeway region risk reproduce the very imbalance that these deal be design to tackle widen inequity and inequality across northern ireland i have have the opportunity to speak to   the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood who bring to my attention the risk pose to the agri bio innovation centre in dromore by the government ’s withdrawal of secure funding 
 therefore on behalf of northern irish business council and resident especially those in the poor region i ask the secretary of state the follow question what action be the government take to mitigate those regional economic imbalance and to tackle inequality especially in the mid south west and what assurance can be provide that rural area will not be forget again especially in the mid south west and the causeway coast 
 order you be allow minute and you be now well over that so i be sure you be come to the end this very 
 sorry mr speaker i will end there with thank 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman whom i welcome to his post this be i think the time we have face each other he make a fair point about the area cover by the deal that have be pause and the contrast between they and derry and strabane and belfast it be important that in the end we see economic growth right across northern ireland so i do not dissent from his proposition but the reason we be in this difficulty be the legacy that this government have find any responsible chancellor must in the circumstance find a way of straighten out the public finance which be leave to we in a really bad state 
 my right hon friend be not the sort of person who would make this announcement unless there be huge pressure to do so but i be aware that pause a project especially when people be in post be not completely cost free will he reassure the house and people in northern ireland that there will be some way of maintain a degree of momentum on the project that have be pause if he could give we any costing on that it would be helpful 
 my hon friend make an important point the house may have see that yesterday the northern ireland executive whose funding be secure because of the deal that be offer include the financial deal that be part of the restoration of the institution which the whole house welcome announce that they be proceed with their share of the contribution which i hope will offer some comfort to those in the city deal area who be work out what this mean it be important that clarity on the future be deliver as quickly as possible which be why i set out that we will learn more on   october 
 may i speak up for the city deal which have be subject to a significant amount of work in community across northern ireland the city deal be review early in the year under the previous government at the time of the safeguard the union agreement and the decision make then be part of that deal the secretary of state be make representation on the deal but i urge he to bear in mind that this be discuss early in the year and be part of the overall agreement make to get stormont back up and run 
 i absolutely take the right hon gentleman ’s point give his long experience in these matter and the role that he and other have play in assist with the restoration of the institution but i would very gently observe that if the matter be review then what be decide do not quite make its way into the fiscal inheritance that we have find ourselves leave with that fiscal inheritance rather than a lack of support for the deal i think the whole house support they be the cause of the problem 
 city deal be a serious tool for economic growth that be why the social democratic and labour party initially propose they and why we continue to be their champion   they support skill and employability create decent job and crucially leverage private and foreign direct investment drive much need regeneration in infrastructure in part of northern ireland that have be overlook i be pleased that the government be honour their commitment to belfast and derry but they should know that the decision and its announcement on a friday night cause very serious frustration and a loss of public trust in northern ireland although the tories still have a thing or to teach about unite the party in revulsion at announcement will the secretary of state clarify the reason for the pause in the causeway coast and glens and mid south west region deal and can he assure we that he will be a champion for the deal with the treasury 
 i will indeed be that champion may i take this opportunity to congratulate my hon friend on assume the leadership of her party we all wish she well in that endeavour i also express our appreciation of the former leader of the sdlp my hon friend   the member for foyle colum eastwood who be sit next to she let we be frank the truth be that when bad news be force on the government it be unwelcome whenever it be announce 
 the secretary of state will know that city deal be talk of for a long time but it be in that the democratic unionist party get a commitment from government a commitment that would not just impact we but be of benefit to everyone in northern ireland create opportunity for growth in city and region throughout northern ireland in a phase program sensible and strategic way the decision to pause both the causeway coast and glens and the mid south west region deal be unnecessary and i think the secretary of state accept that give that no arrangement be in place to agree the necessary financial requirement there be no need to pause the deal because of a lack of finance 
 as i think the secretary of state acknowledge this decision place in jeopardy the matched funding from private investor as well as the ability to proceed with the food and drug development centre in coleraine the enniskillen bypass and myriad other important and strategically significant proposal as we wait until   october it would inject confidence if this government be to say that they recognise the importance and value of city deal be determined to deliver on these aspiration which will be key regional economic driver in northern ireland and recognise as i think the secretary of state do that pause these proposal be foolish 
 i do not agree with the right hon gentleman ’s last proposition as i have already indicate to the house give the fiscal inheritance the prudent thing be for the government to say we need to look at a range of thing in the round i entirely recognise that this decision be unwelcome to many people the good thing we can do be give certainty as quickly as possible which would assist but i entirely understand the practical difficulty that this decision create in the meantime i will learn more about that when i meet the chief executive of the deal area 
 the house be united though on our share desire to maximise economic growth in northern ireland this week we have have a really good example of that with the announcement of the very significant order that have go to wrightbus this be a company that nearly go bust then investment come in and it be now help to deliver the bus transportation of the future from a factory that i and many other member have have the chance to visit there be a lot of good thing happen in northern ireland and we need to build on they 
 what representation have the secretary of state make to the treasury about the continuation of these city deal 
 as i be sure my hon friend understand anyone hold my office include i will argue the corner of northern ireland i will continue to do so 
 as the secretary of state who secure funding from the treasury for the deal the belfast city deal and the derry londonderry and strabane deal i be very pleased that they be go ahead but i have concern because i remember the impact that that announcement have on business confidence across northern ireland what discussion have the secretary of state have with business involve in the private sector element of these deal to make sure they know that there be a commitment to they 
 the right hon member be very generous and kind to i but i can not claim credit for the belfast city deal it be unaffected by the announcement that the treasury make and the signing of the full financial deal for the derry and strabane city deal be schedule anyway after clarification that deal be go ahead but when i meet the chief executive shortly i hope to learn more about the point she raise about the practical impact it be important that we understand the impact that will inform the representation that be make 
 it seem to i that these question would be well direct at the treasury because that be where the decision be make i thank the secretary of state for the work he do over the weekend after the to secure the much need derry city deal he have say that there will be an update in the budget about the other deal that have be pause can he confirm whether that will be an update or a decision 
 although my hon friend encourage i to i will not speak for the chancellor she will tell we what be in the budget when she stand up on   october 
 the secretary of state will remember that when he and i be at the signing of the londonderry deal in september i lobby he strongly to get the other deal over the line he have outline the meeting he have hold but give what he have just say about not meet and talk with the chancellor about this will he be meet the prime minister he have meet other people and we need to get these deal up and run over the line to get much need investment into area such as mine and the mid south west 
 i very much enjoy see the hon gentleman at the signing of the derry londonderry and strabane city deal it be a great event it be the    responsibility of all of we in the house who have the interest of these deal at heart to make representation to everyone who can influence the final decision 
 the secretary of state have talk about his engagement local authority have a really important role to play in stimulate and facilitate growth so can he keep local authority in mind as he seek to keep engage and as he ultimately get we the solution that people want 
 i certainly will do that which be precisely why my next meeting on this matter will be with the chief executive of the deal area they will no doubt tell i about the challenge they face at the moment but it be the partnership that make these deal so successful as belfast and derry londonderry and strabane demonstrate by bring together the united kingdom the northern ireland executive the local authority and private investor we get a synergy that result in extraordinary thing 
 i assume that the secretary of state have do an impact assessment on the uncertainty cost of this decision and will know how it will impact growth in northern ireland in particular if so can he publish that impact assessment secondly i assume that the improved future funding in northern ireland be unaffected by this decision can he confirm that please 
 i be not aware of an impact assessment that have be do at the end of july the chancellor announce all the thing that she would have to look at in deal with the very adverse fiscal inheritance from the previous government i apologise to the right hon gentleman but i do not hear what he be refer to in the part of his question 
 the chair of the northern ireland committee   the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi refer to levelling up fund be the secretary of state aware that commitment to business from those fund have also be pause in northern ireland in particular belfast international airport in my constituency be look forward to £ from levelling up fund and be only tell a fortnight ago that the funding be now on hold it be not only the city deal level up fund be affect by this decision 
 the hon gentleman be right a number of thing have be pause i can think of a levelling up project in my constituency that have be pause as a result of our fiscal inheritance that be what the treasury be have to deal with 
 as the secretary of state know of the unsung and often undervalue benefit of city deal be that they underpin the argument for the rebuilding of a new post conflict northern ireland deliver normalcy and forge partnership between sector that be an argument that be often lose on the bean counter in the treasury can he assure the    house that he will be make that key point as we all seek to rebuild northern ireland in the image of what we would all like it to become 
 the hon gentleman make a powerful and important point the progress that northern ireland have make over the past year since the signing of the good friday agreement be what everybody be strive to continue i be confident that the treasury will pay close attention to the exchange on this urgent question and the hon gentleman ’s eloquence speak for itself 
 i have listen to the answer that the secretary of state have give and i can not understand his logic of the reason for not progress with these deal be that they be not far enough advanced do he not recognise the amount of money that have already go into develop they and how this decision put that money at risk who will put further resource into those scheme if there be no certainty at the end 
 the secretary of state have talk about northern ireland be part of economic growth in the causeway coast and glens case much of the investment will be for economic growth whether that be the development of food and drug at the university of ulster the innovation hub at north west regional college or the innovation hub in cushendall by not have those scheme in place the secretary of state be go to affect economic growth so can he explain the logic of the decision he have make 
 in fairness to myself i have point out that these scheme be not as far advanced as the belfast and the derry londonderry and strabane city deal because of they only recently sign its head of term and the other have yet to do so from memory the time it take for the belfast and the derry and strabane deal to get from head of term to full financial deal signing be between and a half and and a half year so there be some way to go base on past experience precisely because a great deal of work have to be do in partnership with the private sector the northern ireland executive local business and the council to put the shape of the deal in place the right hon member make a powerful argument for clarity as quickly as possible 
 could i suggest that the causeway deal be particularly well think out and balance in its proposition it be therefore very disappointing to see it pause particularly for the small but vital village of bushmills which service the vast number of visitor who come to the giant ’s causeway for year there have be a neglect of infrastructure there road have be clog with car because there be not adequate parking in and about bushmills this project be go to address that as well as community rejuvenation   in the village therefore there be an immense sense of disappointment in bushmills in my constituency at the lost opportunity will the secretary of state bear in mind the strategic significance of bushmills to the advancement of the great giant ’s causeway project make a particular case for the reinstatement of the causeway project 
 the hon gentleman speak up very strongly on behalf of bushmills and the giant ’s causeway area i know that all other members represent   constituency affect by the decision the treasury have have to take will be do exactly the same i think all the project be important but he make the case very powerfully 
 i have request of the secretary of state would he put together and compile information on the investment that have be make to date perhaps in conjunction with sue gray in her new role as envoy or otherwise secondly will he ensure that we get clarity on   october way or the other as to whether these deal can go ahead so that we do not have so many local authority private business and other who have invest in these programme leave in continue limbo after that date
