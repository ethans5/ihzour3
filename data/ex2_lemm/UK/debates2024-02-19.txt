 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential merit of participate in further eu permanent structured co operation project 
 the department ’s priority be to finalise entry into the permanent structured co operation military mobility project before consider involvement in other project however we assess that the eu ’s standard country term for pesco project involve procurement or capability development will continue to impose significant constraint on uk involvement 
 i appreciate that the uk government ’s attitude to pesco be to take each project on a case by case basis but may i suggest that publish criterion for that case by case assessment would be useful it be obvious to the dog in the street that pesco will evolve at light speed and the uk risk miss out on a lot of important co operation that could be beneficial will the minister publish that guidance otherwise i will be table parliamentary question to cover each of the pesco mechanism 
 i note the hon gentleman ’s suggestion and i fear that my answer will give he encouragement to table the question because it be right that we consider each opportunity in pesco on its merit pesco be a vehicle for increase military mobility around the continent non eu nato partner support that fully and the uk be among they but industrial or technological co operation will not always be in the uk ’s interest or in the interest of uk industry so it be right that we consider these thing case by case 
 what step he have take to increase military support for ukraine 
 during his visit to ukraine on   january the prime minister sign an historic uk ukraine agreement on security co operation with president zelensky illustrate our long term commitment to support ukraine the prime minister announce that the uk will provide £ in military aid to ukraine in a £ increase on the previous year to cover rapid procurement and gifting of equipment development of international capability coalition and training through operation interflex 
 i thank the minister for that response there be clearly widespread support in this house and the country for help ukraine to resist russian aggression but there be concern give that president zelensky have recently identify a shortage of arm and ammunition particularly in the light of the impasse in the us congress what discussion have the minister have with his counterpart in the eu and other european nation about help to bridge the gap in the short term and on how we will deal with it if in the long term the election of president trump reduce nato spending in general and its spending on ukraine in particular 
 of course we be aware of the scepticism among republican presidential candidate and in the us congress about fund for ukraine that be why uk ministers the foreign secretary the secretary of state for defence the prime minister and i have be in washington to make the case for the us continue to support ukraine no matter the outcome of the election guess the outcome of the us electoral system be probably not sensible but notwithstanding the fantastic effort lead by prime minister kallas of estonia to increase the manufacturing of ammunition in particular it be clear that european manufacturing capacity be not yet at even half the target set that should be cause for all of we to consider how we might urgently ramp up manufacturing if the bad come to the bad 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 ukraine can win the war and must win the war the minister touch on the provision of ammunition and equipment but ukraine also need hundred of thousand of train personnel i very much welcome the extension of operation interflex and the work that we be do but could we not be do far more of that with our ally to assist ukraine 
 my right hon friend be right to point to the importance of the training effort that give i the opportunity to reflect on this week be the year anniversary of the russian invasion of crimea which give rise to operation orbital since then across operation orbital and operation interflex ukrainian troop have be train continue to train they not as individual but increasingly as formation be undoubtedly the key to unlock the real potential of the ukrainian armed force 
 we have all see the event that have take place in the past few day regard the russian offensive in ukraine they must act a wake up call to all of we this be our problem and our fight with the ukrainians to defeat putin we need to make sure that we step up the amount of ammunition and arm that we ship to ukraine we need to do that with our european partner and we need a plan not just for the short term but for the long term so that we defeat putin what talk be the minister and the cabinet secretary have with our european ally to ensure that ukraine win this war 
 such conversation happen all the time only last week the secretary of state be at the late donor conference follow by nato defence ministers i be in norway a week or so early have exactly those conversation with ally as the right hon gentleman suggest while traditional armament such as artillery ammunition be important so too increasingly be the novel precision weapon system that the uk be very much at the forefront of supply to our ukraine friend 
 be it not time that both side of the house come together to agree on a common policy of increase defence expenditure so that by increase our support for ukraine we can set an example to our american ally without whose help there can be no future for peace and security in europe 
 my colleague on the opposition front bench know that i try not to throw gratuitous punch in the house and i know that they be enthusiast for military spending but their colleague the shadow chancellor have thus far decline to say that she would adopt anything other than the target for nato spending which be not the same as what the government be currently spend or what they currently intend to increase spending to so the suggestion make by my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis   be timely it would be fantastic if in the next hour the shadow secretary of state be to make the same commitment as we have 
 let we try now then i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the last year of the last labour government we be spend of gdp on defence a level that have not be match in any of the subsequent tory year 
 like the defence secretary the leader of the opposition and i be in munich at the weekend and the urgency of the need for more help for ukraine run through every discussion everyone be also profoundly move   by the word of yulia navalnaya speak even after the news of her husband ’s death at putin ’s hand this be the brutality that the ukrainians be fight and this be why uk support must not falter we strongly back last month ’s uk ukraine security agreement which the defence secretary have describe as a year alliance will the government take the necessary next step and provide an implementation plan for this year and future year to ensure that ukraine receive the help that it need now and for tomorrow 
 while i be grateful for the history lesson on what be spend under the last labour government the commitment to match our spending in a future government be conspicuously absent from the right hon gentleman ’s question however let i return to the collegiate spirit in which defence question be normally conduct i absolutely agree that what the secretary of state set out in his speech about the partnership with ukraine require a strategic approach with very long horizon set for what our co operation both industrial and military could look like 
 long horizon be fine but ukraine need more help now i be concern about the £ for ukraine that be announce last month and describe by the prime minister as 
 the big single package of defence aid to ukraine since the war began”.—[official report   january vol c. 
 the minister have say much the same today in response to a question from i last week however he would not rule out use that money to cover the uk ’s operational cost at nato basis will he rule that out today will he confirm today that every penny and every pound of the £ for ukraine will go to ukraine 
 i fear that the right hon gentleman have miss something over the last year the £ that the government have provide for operation to support ukraine have always include not just the gifting in kind that take the headline but operation interflex and other avenue through which we support the ukrainians the fact be that next year ’s spending and that of the year after will match exactly what we do in previous year in term of the breadth of that contribution it be also true that the long term strategic alliance that the secretary of state set out and the commitment year on year to spend more than any other european ally be not mutually exclusive we be do both 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 on   february at the munich conference prime minister frederiksen of the kingdom of denmark say 
 if you ask ukrainians they be ask for ammunition now artillery now from the danish side we decide to donate our entire artillery 
 do the minister not agree that ally should be a little more like denmark when it come to recognise the consequence of not meet ukraine ’s need 
 we be full of admiration for our danish colleague but the reality be that the uk have provide almost its entire heavy artillery capability in term of as-90s those that we have hold on to be   those that service the battlegroup in estonia and the very high readiness armoured battlegroup similarly we have be generous with our ammunition stock while retain those that we need for our very high readiness force more than that we have catalyse the production of mm ammunition in the uk and even far we have be buy up as much mm and mm ammunition around the world as we possibly can the uk ’s contribution to the ukrainian artillery fight be not confine to what we have in our own ammunition stockpile it be much much big and amount to hundred of thousand of round 
 to paraphrase a former member the government ’s response have be weigh in the balance and find wanting give the czech republic ’s profound donation of artillery and shell on top of the danish donation as well as a commitment of over shell from the eu i hope the minister can come to the dispatch box and correct the balance can he advise the house on how much of this new investment which be welcome be in tactical armament and artillery 
 the overseas ammunition acquisition plan from previous year remain broadly as it be which amount to about round buy on international market and provide to ukraine the mm manufacture acceleration be subject to a different funding package that the secretary of state and his ukrainian counterpart have be work on it be important to note that the £ additional money from last year to this be focus on the provision of drone and those tactical drone be prove to be most significant in term of their impact in the battle space 
 what step he be take to increase the size of the army 
 the late figure for the full time strength of the army be the army be continue to work towards its future soldier structure of regular and reserve personnel there be no plan to change this the good news be that provisional figure suggest that january have the high number of army application for year 
 medium report have suggest that white man have be actively discriminate against in recruitment and that security check may be relax due to promote ethnic diversity within the army a number of senior military figure have purportedly warn that the pervasiveness of wake ideology be push on to the armed force be a real and present threat to national security and will give aid and comfort to the king ’s enemy will the planned review of diversity policy seek to address those concern 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s remark but i do not recognise the situation that he describe we take security extremely seriously and ensure that all personnel have security clearance appropriate to their job check normally require at least year   uk residency but commonwealth candidate be permit to accrue qualifying residency while serve although they can not take up role and rank that require high level of vetting this policy have be in place for several year and it have not change 
 figure in the times last month show that the british army will shrink to as small as by due to the crisis in recruitment and retention as threat to the uk increase will the minister finally commit to halt the cut that he continue to make to the army 
 the government be stick to regular and reserve personnel as i say early those figure be in future soldier publish in and they remain unchanged 
 what step his department be take to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid to gaza 
 the ministry of defence continue to stand ready to support the effort lead by the foreign commonwealth and development office to pursue land air and maritime route to deliver urgently need humanitarian aid 
 many of my constituent in stoke on trent south be extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in gaza and want to see much more aid get into gaza it be vital for the innocent civilian population there will the secretary of state update we on what more be be do to ensure additional route and particularly a sea route into gaza for humanitarian aid to innocent civilian 
 my hon friend will be pleased to hear that i have be to the region on a number of occasion i have visit israel and cyprus twice as well as visit egypt and saudi arabia with the specific intention of try to resolve the problem that he describe we have already deliver tonne of aid but the problem be get that aid into gaza although we have persuade the israelis to open kerem shalom we desperately need ashdod to be open too as we have discuss with the cypriots we could then create a humanitarian aid route from cyprus direct to ashdod and straight into gaza via kerem shalom 
 if he will continue to issue online update on the implementation of accept recommendation from the live in our shoe report publish on june 
 family be an integral part of the armed force community our commitment to they remain strong and be reinforce by the haythornthwaite review the defence command paper refresh the family strategy which be publish   in january and my hon friend ’s excellent live in our shoe framework for deliver more family sympathetic policy 
 the family of armed force personnel have to put up with more separation relocation and danger to their love one than the family of any other public servant and they often feel slightly disenfranchised they might not know their member of parliament and they might fear to approach they because of the impact it might have on their spouse or partner ’s career do my right hon friend agree it be incredibly important that the public can see the follow through on the recommendation that the ministry of defence accept in full and on the recommendation that it accept in part 
 my hon friend will be interested to hear that i have a slightly different number my number be that of his report ’s recommendation have be accept regardless of the exact figure i entirely agree on the importance of make sure that armed force family live in decent accommodation when we ask armed force personnel to fight abroad they should live in good accommodation when they come home 
 my hon friend be familiar with the steering group which include family federation and the author of his excellent report and he will be pleased to hear that it meet again on   february 
 what step his department be take to tackle recruitment challenge in the armed force 
 what step his department be take to recruit armed force personnel 
 what step his department be take to recruit armed force personnel 
 what step his department be take to recruit armed force personnel 
 in a challenging labour market we continue to apply an array of measure to support recruitment and retention and to refine the armed force offer these include the big pay rise in year flexible service and an improved accommodation offer the haythornthwaite review have a key part to play and team have be stand up across the ministry of defence to implement all recommendation work to establish a reward and incentivisation architecture that will attract and retain the skill we need 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer but the quality of force accommodation be also an important factor in both recruitment and retention will he consider give local commander great agency in get small repair do locally if the national contractor fail to act quickly enough 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend head of establishment can access an approve funding pot to address minor maintenance work up to a maximum value of £ per item which be extremely helpful and get away from some of the bureaucracy involve with the prime contractor 
 experienced personnel be leave for each recruit despite the diversity and inclusion policy some of which be counterproductive in my opinion and in addition to capita ’s initiative last year there be a net loss of servicewoman fall retention rate be overshadow operational effectiveness can the minister outline what he be do on retention 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and ministerial predecessor over the past year the ministry of defence have put servicewoman at the heart of develop and deliver a range of initiative from uniform policy to the provision of accessible sanitary product mentoring the introduction of flexible service wraparound childcare parental leave and tolerance of unacceptable behaviour there will be further measure in response to the wigston review the gray review and my hon friend ’s report i pay tribute to those who have be drive change but it be far from job do 
 the armed force include the signal regiment base in pembrokeshire continue to provide fabulous career opportunity for young people do my right hon friend agree that now more than ever we need to encourage army visit to school and that the long campaign by nationalist in wales to stop those visit damage social mobility and aspiration 
 i share my right hon friend ’s enthusiasm entirely the armed force be a huge engine for social mobility in the last year the army achieve over school engagement visit across the united kingdom each at the school ’s request the british army be the public ’s army it be important it engage with the people it serve despite the good effort of some on the left and the nationalist to whom he refer 
 the london borough of bexley be home to several excellent cadet and reserve unit that teach vital life skill will the minister update the house on progress on the cadet expansion programme and what work be be undertake to strengthen the pathway into his majesty ’s armed force 
 i be grateful for the opportunity to do so the joint ministry of defence and department for education cadet expansion programme be progress extremely well with over cadet in school cadet unit the cadet expansion programme have focus on growth in the state sector since its introduction in the number of cadet unit in state school have grow by over to school some new unit have also open in independent school where there have be a increase i be sure my hon friend will join i in welcome that transformation 
 local service personnel routinely cite issue in service accommodation as a barrier to recruitment and retention so i be disappointed to hear that the government have   no plan to improve the quality of the nearly single live accommodation bed space in my constituency at chicksands that currently fall into the low grade will the minister commit to revisit that decision to ensure we do right by all service personnel serve on the base before it close 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the importance of service accommodation he will be aware of the huge government investment to improve the quality of both service family accommodation and single living accommodation our people deserve the good it be public knowledge that they have not have the good for some considerable time but we be commit to remedy that for his constituent 
 do the minister not wake up in the morning sometimes and want to check in on reality we have have secretary of state for defence since and absolute turmoil in our armed force why would people join the british army when this government have run we down to serve personnel i campaign when the number go below the minister should wake up and invest in the defence of our country in a troubled world 
 those be interesting reflection i suggest the hon gentleman have a word with the shadow ministers on his front bench particularly the shadow chancellor who to date have fail to commit to the level of spending on the defence of this country to which the government be completely committed 
 the rise of so call woke culture have be infect our society for many year and it should be unsurprise that it be now infect our military do the minister think that the rise of woke make it easy or more difficult to recruit the right sort of people into our armed force 
 i completely reject the premise of the hon gentleman ’s question if he be talk about increase the number of woman in our armed force lord etherton ’s review into lgbt personnel in our armed force historically or our ambition to make our armed force more reflective of the society from which they be draw and that they serve then i be guilty as charge 
 the minister and other will be aware that recruitment across northern ireland to the army the royal air force and the royal navy have always be exceptional however the number of personnel in territorial army regiment be set at a figure that those regiment can not go above will the minister look at increase the number of ta soldier to ensure that recruitment in northern ireland can exceed the current number 
 i pay tribute to the people of northern ireland who as the hon gentleman say have disproportionately contribute to the defence of our country he will know that we be committed to grow our reserve force across the united kingdom 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we have few troop few sailor few aircraft and the removal of in ship the conservatives have fail our armed force over the past year miss their recruitment target every year since take power in and hollow out our military do the minister honestly believe that he can look the public in the eye and claim that more year will fix the mess that they have create or be it time for a fresh start 
 oh i think the hon gentleman know what i be go to say in response to his question and that be to invite he to have a conversation with the shadow chancellor to see whether she will commit to the same level of spending on defence that this government be commit to and indeed be spend right now will he make a spending commitment here and now in the house of commons if so i be all ear 
 order may i also suggest that it be not for the government to be ask the question 
 what plan he have for the future of the rotary wing enterprise 
 the rotary wing enterprise programme seek to improve aircraft availability across support solution for apache chinook merlin and wildcat from within exist budget it will do so by drive synergy between platform modernise support solution and pursue delivery focus commercial mechanism 
 mr speaker as you know fleetlands in gosport have be the home of military helicopter maintenance for more than year this highly skilled engineering work be really key to level up the area provide much need job and opportunity do the minister agree that the mod ’s rotary wing enterprise and new medium helicopter programme would benefit greatly from these generation of expertise and skill right there in gosport 
 i know from my recent visit that my right hon friend be a champion not only for defence in her constituency but for defence job in particular she be right about standardaero fleetlands which be a value actor in the maintenance of our rotary wing platform the rotary wing enterprise be due to enter its detailed design this year as part of that it will consider wide social value include the extent to which economic prosperity be support but as this be a specific potential procurement i can not comment any far i also can not comment on the role of particular company in the new medium helicopter programme but we hope to say more on that very soon 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government have delay produce the information require for the invitation to negotiate for the new medium lift helicopter time since september   can the minister explain what have cause this month delay give the report last week about his department freeze capital spending until at least the new financial year when will the government get their act together to get this competition under way can he promise that the delay will not push back the delivery date for this vital capability for our force 
 i be pleased to say thing to the hon lady we will have the announcement on the next stage of the new medium helicopter very soon i be also pleased to confirm that we have be clear on our spending position to echo my right hon friend the minister for defence people and families if the hon lady want to talk about stuff that be rumour in the press we do not have those sort of capital spending control can she confirm whether the shadow chancellor will honour our defence spending commitment 
 what recent progress his department have make on the aukus partnership 
 aukus partner continue to make good progress on the optimal pathway to deliver conventionally arm nuclear power submarine to australia and to develop the advanced capability require 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer aukus be a bold project that rightfully identify the great need for co operation in the pacific between our great nation however i do not think that it should be limit just to defence in my own report for the foreign affair policy committee we find that there be not only a need but an appetite for wide scope the inclusion of canada for example do my right hon friend agree that aukus can not just be about defence policy will we be reap the maximum benefit for britain by consign this to be just a defence procurement exercise where be the foreign commonwealth and development office in all of this 
 my hon friend be right to say that aukus can and should be a programme that extend beyond the core nation the uk the us and australia but that be very much a matter for pillar arrangement rather than pillar which the house will know be about the nuclear power submarine for australia and the joint procurement he will be pleased to hear that in november i be in the us sign up to a programme of pillar work which could ultimately extend to other include canada and new zealand 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the royal navy ’s capability to engage land base target 
 the royal navy have a range of capability to support the engagement of land base target specific threat planning be consider for every deployment or contingency and measure be take to reduce or mitigate those expect threat as dictate by operational priority 
 what urgency be attach to the upgrading of hms diamond ’s defence system 
 my right hon friend ask an excellent question i know that there have be a lot of interest follow the deployment in the red sea in what the lesson be i can confirm that the sea viper capability have be at the forefront of this be the navy ’s weapon of choice in the shooting down of an aerial threat in more than year it be a cutting edge weapon system and i can confirm that sea viper will be upgrade to far enhance this capability against the more complex and evolve threat that we face include the ability to intercept missile in their terminal phase 
 what assessment he have make of trend in level of employment in the defence manufacturing sector in the next month 
 in the ministry of defence spend £ with uk industry the most recent estimate show that that support job across the country of which be in manufacturing 
 my tewkesbury constituency contain a lot of aerospace manufacturing particularly for the defence sector but those company have long complain to i that they can not attract enough young people particularly to take engineering job the all party parliamentary group on aerospace which i co chair have the objective of entice young people to go into engineering or at least consider it as a career will the government do anything more to persuade young people to consider take up the engineering opportunity that be there 
 my hon friend ask an excellent question it help that we have lot of school group and young people in the gallery today it be half term i can confirm that last year ’s defence command paper identify skill as a priority include the shortage of engineering digital cyber stem nuclear and space base skill the defence head of profession for engineering who also support the government science and engineering head of profession have a defence youth engagement strategy that drive stem outreach activity and the encouragement of engineering uptake in individual age to 
 what recent discussion he have have with international partner on future military support for ukraine 
 everything that i have intend to say in response to the hon gentleman be cover in response to the supplementarie to question 
 why be it not group then 
 lord ismay say of nato that it exist among other thing 
 to keep the soviet union out 
 and the americans in the foreign secretary be misunderstood on a recent visit to the united states when he propose that congress should pass a new military aid package for ukraine and he be rebuff by some republicans in the house of representatives what can the defence secretary do to encourage the us to maintain its commitment to ukraine and to nato 
 again we cover this early but it be an important issue the secretary of state and i and other ministers from the mod and across government put our shoulder to the wheel whenever we be in washington to impress on the us not only the importance of its continue commitment to ukrainian security but that euro atlantic security be integral to us security the us can not simply look towards the pacific it need to remain engaged in the euro atlantic in its own interest as well as those of nato ally 
 on my last visit to ukraine a couple of week ago i have several meeting with ukrainian ministers who voice their frustration and concern about the delay in set up joint operation with uk defence manufacturer will my right hon friend assure the house that he be do everything possible to speed the process up to allow the ukrainians to produce their own kit with our help to help win the war 
 the secretary of state and the minister for defence procurement have both be heavily engage in this indeed the minister for defence procurement lead a delegation to kyiv to catalyse exactly the idea that my hon friend mention 
 what step he be take to reduce armed force emission 
 the mod have already start its decarbonisation journey in support of the uk ’s net commitment at the royal international air tattoo last year i be pleased to sign the defence aviation net charter on behalf of the mod work closely with our industrial partner we be move to clean and more efficient technology the army be build solar farm and have invest £ in battlefield electrification the royal navy ’s cut edge catalytic system be reduce emission of greenhouse gas in its patrol vessel by up to finally the raf be pioneer the use of sustainable aviation fuel 
 it be a pleasure to attend the global charge dinner last october and to see so many member of the armed force from all rank commit to tackle the climate crisis however the defence committee have describe the mod ’s current reduction target as insufficiently demand under the green government commitment they be the low across all department will the minister ensure that the next round of cc commitment will contain more demanding   target not least to reflect the real ambition and for member of the armed force on the ground to see the devastation of climate change 
 i know the hon lady be very passionate about this issue i have just list the way in which the individual service be take step to reduce their emission but we always have to balance that against our overwhelming priority as a department which be to support the ability of our armed force to defend these island 
 what step his department be take to support innovative defence technology 
 defence be invest over £ in advanced research and development we be work with uk industry and academia to identify and invest in innovative technology ensure that we have the capability we need to defeat our adversary 
 the raf have traditionally have a very poor record when it close basis in lincolnshire just walk away leave they to go to rack and ruin but at raf scampton we have wonderful scheme for innovative defence technology such as a spaceport will the minister now work with the home office and i to try to release the bulk of that base so that we can get all these exciting technology go the mod can not just wash its hand of the base now that it have be pass to the home office we be suppose to have join up government 
 my right hon friend make an important point as he know raf scampton be no long part of the defence estate which mean we do not have formal responsibility for it what i would stress to he be that we be invest in innovation in lincolnshire include the significant investment into raf waddington associate with our protector capability 
 what recent estimate he have make of the lifetime cost of trident renewal 
 the dreadnought submarine programme remain within overall budget and on track for the of class hms dreadnought to enter service in the early 2030s inflation have remain high than expect for an extended period and have have an adverse impact on the cost forecast for the programme compare with the forecast from a year early as the programme be in its preliminary phase it be too early to provide cost estimate for the replacement warhead programme 
 i think that mean the minister do not know what the total lifetime cost of trident replacement be go to be budget in government departments and household alike be under immense pressure because   of rampant inflation why do everybody else ’s budget have to be under pressure but there seem to be a blank cheque approach to the renewal of trident 
 that be an extraordinary thing for the hon gentleman to say he know that we will shortly be publish before the end of the financial year our supplementary estimate for the defence nuclear enterprise for the financial year but as he know there be a cost in not have a deterrent that be his policy to do away with the deterrent on a unilateral basis despite all the terrible threat we can see in the world and the nuclear sabre rattle from russia his policy would be abject folly we will invest in provide that ultimate guarantee to the people of the united kingdom 
 i know that the minister and most of the house leave aside those on the scottish national benches will agree that the continuous at sea deterrent be absolutely central to the defence of the realm there be no question about that at all do he agree that we must find a way of replace trident within budget and that the bad possible thing that could happen to trident would be an snp government in scotland 
 i agree with my hon friend 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this year i visit the united states the white house and capitol hill to lobby on behalf of ukraine as discuss today saudi arabia and egypt give the crisis in the middle east hms diamond to thank the ship ’s crew and our sovereign base at akrotiri to thank the typhoon pilot cyprus itself be also visit last week i be in brussels for the nato meeting and in munich for the security conference the whole house will know that defence never sleep and will wish to join i in thank the brave man and woman who make that possible 
 will my right hon friend update the house on progress make at the nato defence ministers meeting particularly with regard to support for ukraine 
 alongside the nato meeting there be the ukraine defence contact group a group of country all of which support ukraine the big concern of course be ensure that ukraine have the thing that it need now and the planning to ensure that it can sustain the fight and push back against the enemy in that be why i have announce £   for drone and why we have a nation coalition   for mpi the multinational procurement initiative at   my request we have also welcome australia to the international fund for ukraine with its commitment of australian dollar to a fund that be now worth £ 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the agony of the palestinian people be extreme we all want the fighting to stop now for hostage to be return now for aid to be ramp up now and a ceasefire that    last permanently what be the defence secretary do to help his israeli counterpart to accept that their threaten offensive against rafah just can not happen 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman about the seriousness of the situation as he have just hear i visit israel before the new year and have those conversation directly i believe that it be in israel ’s interest obviously in gaza ’s interest and in the world ’s interest to see that immediate cessation follow by a permanent ceasefire we be do everything we can to persuade the israelis of that necessity and to put pressure on hamas who still hold hostage if they be to release they this thing could finish very quickly we be also help by ensure that we work on plan for what happen in the north of the country and in southern lebanon 
 carshalton and wallington be home to more than veteran who have provide and continue to provide amazing service to our great nation what step be we take as a government to provide well support for veteran in our country 
 since the armed force covenant and its consequential have be the absolute lynchpin of public commitment to those who have serve and they have materially improve the live experience of the service community the ministry of defence be responsible for a number of service for veteran the veterans welfare service for example support around veteran every year and the office for veterans affairs co ordinate across government to advance support for veteran and their family 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the number of veteran claim welfare benefit be rise steadily and more than be now in receipt of universal credit do the minister find that a cause for celebration or concern 
 i be a veteran and i talk to veteran all the time as do my right hon friend the minister for veterans affairs i do not recognise the picture that the shadow minister describe since we have materially improve the live experience of our veteran community and their family and we will continue to do so of that he can be absolutely sure 
 when defence contract be award a to weighting be give to social value which be the benefit that the contract would have for the local and wide community do that community benefit apply entirely for the uk or be overseas company and their community consider equally 
 that be a very good question the distinction be between the cabinet office social value rule which be apply across government and be irrespective and the rule that the ministry of defence apply to our procurement there be discussion of the new medium helicopter   early for example when that come out as i hope it will soon we will be clear that we be look to incentivise a strong commitment to the uk industrial base 
 the mod recently publish the finding of the inquiry into the fatal accident involve a scimitar fighting vehicle on salisbury plain in which a young soldier tragically lose his life of my constituent be a witness to the accident which have inevitably have a profound impact on he the government have say that they do not plan to make a formal response to the inquiry report which be a harrowing read but they have accept all recommendation do the minister not think that the report require a full and formal response from the government with a detailed action plan for adopt the recommendation give the seriousness of the incident and the wide implication 
 order please just remember that this be topical question and i have to get other member in 
 very simply i read that report and as the hon lady have rightly point out accept all of its finding we do not usually take it far but i will certainly be happy to take a look at the case she have raise 
 on the subject of recruitment and retention on   november   the chief of the general staff patrick sanders arguably the good general of his generation tell the defence committee 
 we be take soldier out of the field army to put they alongside recruiter because guess what?—it take a soldier to recruit a soldier 
 never be a truer word speak so when be we finally go to sack capita 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question i know he would get capita in there somewhere he will be familiar with the engage to recruit programme which be currently underway and have some success in get soldier to recruit soldier that be probably why as i touch on in my early answer we be now see some extremely promising recruiting figure include in january the good figure for year 
 so far israel have ignore international appeal to not indiscriminately attack civilian and not take step that be basically raze gaza to the ground it now look as though it be go to ignore international opinion about enter rafah so have the time not now come for we to consider not sell to israel arm that can be use in those totally unacceptable way 
 arm deal and export licence be deal with in the normal way but the hon member will be interested to hear that actually not many arm sale take place in the direction of israel at all off the top of my head i think it be just £ last year and that be mostly for protective equipment 
 late last year diesel get into the water supply at the trenchard lines camp near upavon in my constituency i commend the resilience   of the family who live there and also of the mod which act very quickly to ensure that there be a temporary supply of water those family be still live on that temporary supply so can the minister assure i that attention be be give to sort out this problem and ensure a permanent supply of clean water 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for raise this matter he be a champion of the defence community in his constituency and i thank he for his early engagement on it i understand that the local authority regulator follow the completion of rigorous testing have confirm that the water quality at trenchard lines be acceptable and it be now safe for personnel work and live there to use the main supply i will double check that and write to he but i be grateful for his comment on the performance of the defence infrastructure organisation in that regard 
 today we have see news of another serious attack by the houthis on a commercial vessel in the gulf of aden do minister think that more royal navy ship will need to be deploy to the region give the ongoing threat to merchant shipping 
 the hon gentleman will be familiar with answer i give last week or the week before at the dispatch box when i say that we will always look at what be happen in the red sea i have be there to meet the crew myself and will make a judgment base on the reality on the ground there be now also input from a conglomeration of eu country that be come to join prosperity guardian and we welcome that input 
 in the debate on the red sea on   january i ask for confirmation that hms albion and hms bulwark would not only not be scrap but would not be mothball the deputy foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell with the secretary of state for defence alongside he say in response that i be 
 absolutely right to detect the supportive view of the secretary of state for defence ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 however a journalist be subsequently tell by the ministry of defence that nothing have change so be those ship go to be mothball or not 
 my right hon friend can rest easy i have be down to visit hms albion since those question and i can confirm that of those ship will always be be make ready to sail he can therefore be very relieved 
 suicide rate among veteran under the age of be to time high than in the civilian population but figure show that this group be less likely to be in touch with mental health service how will the minister ensure that young veteran can access the support they need 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question she have be consistent in her inquiry into this matter she will be reassure to know that across   the service community the rate of suicide be low than we would expect in the civilian population there be a subset of young man within the serve population for whom there be an excess and we be look very closely at that i very much commend to the hon lady the suicide action plan that we have publish which lay out what defence be do to drive down the suicide rate in our armed force whichever figure it be it be too high 
 the whole house would like to see a large army navy and air force there be unanimity on that point central to that must be not only the armed force recruitment programme but the army centralise training scheme will my right hon friend confirm that the pause in capital spending by the mod which be announce last week in the press will not affect those scheme and that they will continue in as full blooded a way as they be at the moment 
 my hon friend will be pleased to know that there be no pause the approval be flow 
 the royal navy carrier hms queen elizabeth and hms prince of wales enter service and year late respectively with their cost rocket to over £ more than time that of scotland ’s   ferry while be plague with problem and a lack of aircraft what assurance can we have that these hugely expensive carrier will provide the defence capability for which they be design 
 the whole house recognise the irony of an snp member talk about ship be deliver late the whole house will want to welcome the extraordinary work do by those on hms prince of wales who get the ship ready to leave not at day readiness which be what they be rank for but in day i would have think that congratulate the ship ’s company would be the right thing to do 
 do the secretary of state remember that the british army use to be the big trainer of young man and woman in the country and that we produce so many skilled people when can he take we back to those balmy day 
 since we have be train ukrainian troop prove that we know how to get troop train we still train extraordinary number i think i be right that on all form of train more broadly we be break some of those record we will ensure that we have armed force that be fit for the century 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will make a statement on the uk economy enter recession 
 high inflation remain the big barrier to growth which be why halve it be still our top priority thank to decisive action support by the government inflation have fall from over to the bank of england be forecast that it will fall to around by early summer in only a matter of month which be much fast than previously think 
 it be important to put all this in context just over a year ago the bank of england be forecast the long recession in year that have not happen and the british economy have prove resilient in the face of unprecedented shock forecaster include the bank of england and the international monetary fund agree that growth will strengthen over the next few year with the imf forecasting that we will grow fast than japan germany france italy and many other on average over the next year wage have be high than inflation for month in a row unemployment remain very low and we be back british business by deliver the big business tax cut in modern british history and rewarding work by cut taxis for work people 
 these be all reason to be positive about the economy turn a corner if we stick to our plan we can be confident of see pressure reduce for family and of achieve healthy economic growth at the autumn statement we unveil growth measure include unlock £ of business investment this include a substantial labour market package deliver a tax cut to national insurance for people as well as reform pension and extend investment zone the real risk to economic growth and prosperity in this country be the fact that the labour party have no plan for growth no plan at all while they may pretend that they have abandon their £ pledge they be still committed to their damaging energy policy which as the leader of the opposition have say cost £ all of we across this house know what that mean high taxis and low growth with labour 
 the chancellor should be here explain why britain have fall into recession will the minister explain why he have be leave to answer these question and where exactly the chancellor be the chancellor should be accountable to mps and to our constituent and answer for his failure in the house what an insult to all those people who go to work every day and experience the reality of year of conservative economic failure that he have simply fail to turn up 
 do the minister accept that the prime minister ’s promise to grow the economy be now in tatter will the minister explain why the economy be now small than when the current prime minister enter downing street do the minister accept the misery that this government have cause homeowner with their kamikaze budget leave a typical family renew their mortgage pay an additional £ every single month 
 the chief secretary be also notable for her absence today and be last see refuse or simply fail to recognise that their target measure of debt as a share of gdp be rise not fall follow her rebuke this morning from the chair of the uk statistics authority about mislead the public can the minister inform the house whether the chief secretary will again be rely on incompetence as her good defence 
 it be not good enough the whole country know that the economy be not work for work people under the conservatives it be time for change if the government seriously think everything be fine why do they not take their record of failure and let the british people decide 
 i thank the shadow chancellor for her question 
 answer they 
 i be come to that 
 the right hon lady start by talk about the chancellor as economic secretary i be perfectly entitle to answer on behalf of the department and i will do so today the main thrust of her remark be on growth let i deal with that in detail 
 the point to recognise be the international context that we all find ourselves in interruption it happen to be true for example to describe that international context—10 eu country be in recession in in relation to forecast the office for budget responsibility ’s original forecast be that there would be a contraction of in the economy we have significantly outperform that as i have say the bank of england forecast the long recession in year we have significantly outperform that on wage i think this be the month in a row when wage have be high than inflation which as i have say we have more than halve 
 on the chief secretary what she be explain be that we be and be meet our fiscal rule which be that debt will be fall in the year of the forecast exclude the bank of england that be what she explain and that be what i be reiterate for the house interruption 
 labour members do not like hear this but they have absolutely no plan on the economy we have be clear about our plan and it be start to bear fruit with wage with cut taxis for work people start in january with high business investment as a result of our full expensing in the autumn statement the shadow chancellor do not have to take it from i the office for budget responsibility say that the fiscal event in the budget and the autumn statement would represent the large increase to gdp that it have ever score what i say to she and the house be this our plan be work stick with the plan and do not throw it away with the opposition 
 it be good news that unemployment have stay low by european standard and the economy be still generate plenty of job vacancy will the government take more step to help more people into those job so that we can get fast growth bring down the benefit bill and boost their income 
 the whole house know that my right hon friend be somewhat of an expert on matter relate to the economy to answer his point specifically the national   insurance tax cut be score at the last fiscal event the autumn statement as significantly increase the number of people in work although i will not speculate on fiscal event that point have be very much note by i and the whole treasury 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the minister speak about resilience but the quarter contraction in the economy be the big quarterly fall since early at the height of the covid pandemic so i be not sure he be quite right about resilience he also speak about growth but the government tell we in november that growth be not forecast to exceed in any year in the forecast period how modest the minister ’s ambition be 
 national debt be still approach of gdp—£3 the consequence of brexit be suppress growth and that pose a challenge to the uk government ’s fiscal target although it be welcome that inflation have fall price remain high price be not fall they be simply go up slightly less steeply than they be a month or ago it be obvious that what the economy need be growth and the investment to generate that growth but give that business investment accord to the government be forecast down this year by private dwell investment be forecast down this year by and flat at next year and general government investment be forecast down in and where will the investment for growth come from 
 i deeply respect the right hon gentleman and i will take his point by on resilience the way we get resilience for ordinary people and for household be to ensure that real household income increase since they be up we be try to increase business resilience with our full expense regime which be revolutionary in the advanced world full expensing will enable more business to invest and will deal with the chronic weakness of the british economy which be weak investment that be why we be do that 
 the right hon gentleman mention growth growth be not as high as we would like and that be the case across the whole of europe and the whole of the industrialise world that be why the chancellor in the last fiscal event put in place growth measure we have a plan for growth over the long term and we will deliver it the right hon gentleman mention debt to repeat the point i make to the shadow chancellor debt be fall in the year of the forecast accord to our fiscal rule which exclude the bank of england that be not just the fiscal rule now it have always be the fiscal rule 
 the right hon gentleman make the fair point that low inflation do not mean that price be fall indeed low inflation be a low rate of increase we all know that in this house that be why bring down inflation be so important and the opposition with their plan to recklessly jack up borrowing and taxis to the extent of £ will increase inflation 
 i repeat that investment have be a long term weakness of the british economy we be take long term measure to deal with it and i hope that in the next fiscal event the budget we will continue in that vein 
 may i thank my hon friend for his distinguished service as a voice of his majesty ’s government i refer he to what the former chief economist of the bank of england andrew haldane say today refer to a double blow to the credibility of the bank of england which be late to put interest rate up and miss inflation and have be slow to reduce they hammer the economy do my hon friend agree that the bank of england be no long show itself to be competent and that its independence must be question 
 i do not think that i will quite agree with my right hon friend it be very important that we leave the bank of england to do its work and respect its independent mandate but that from the treasury we do what we can to bring inflation down and support it in that mandate as i say the labour party ’s plan whether it claim to have drop they or not will lead to an increase in borrowing or an increase in taxis which will significantly damage that aim 
 i think the minister be fail the audition labour will not take lecture from he about borrowing which be at of gdp when we leave office and be now nearly he be claim that somehow growth be happen but we be actually in a recession which mean that there be no growth in fact there be negative growth gdp per capita fall in every quarter of last year mean that everybody be get bad off under his appalling stewardship of the economy be it not time that the junior minister go back to his boss and tell he it ’ all over time ’ up call the general election 
 it be definitely above my pay grade to call election in relation to gdp per capita statistic which be important the point of they be to try to get a sense of what be happen to individual or to individual household and family i would say—[interruption let me—[interruption i wish the shadow chancellor would allow i to respond real household income which be as good a measure as any to see what be happen to individual and family in our economy be up since if we be look at people at the bottom of the income scale the rise in the national living wage that come in in april will mean a rise since of about in real term for people on full time minimum wage those statistic be example of what have happen to real people on the ground 
 i thank the minister for update the house do he agree that people in redditch and elsewhere be concerned about negative economic news although it almost always turn out to be wrong most of all do he agree that the great risk to my constituent in redditch and those across the country be a labour government labour have say it can somehow magically get £ of green growth benefit without pay for they we all know that my constituent will be pay for that through extra borrowing and high taxis 
 order the minister have no responsibility for the labour party let we move on 
 the minister say the government ’s priority be back british business cut inflation and reduce the pressure on british family when the government admit this measure will increase inflation when british business be tear its hair out at the chaos cause by not know what the charge will be and who will pay it with less than week to go and when british consumer will find that it cause food shortage and an increase in food price why on earth be the government go ahead with the brexit border tax will the minister commit here and now to cancel it so that we can stop this inflationary measure yes or no 
 i thank the hon lady for focus on inflation she be right that it be critical and bring it down be a focus for the government the house have hear her point about the european union but i would add that we have a clear plan for bring down inflation which we will continue to carry out she have to ask those on her front bench why they do not have 
 for too long too many people in the treasury not my hon friend who be an excellent minister have think that the good way to grow the economy be to fill the country with more and more people will the government recommit to insist that anyone who come here to work should earn the average uk earning of around £ a year that mean no shortage scheme and no exemption for care worker or the nhs but that in those sector we pay proper wage we get people off benefit too many people be on they drag down our economy and we seriously cut mass legal migration and by the way if there be a general election let we give our people something to vote for 
 my right hon friend make an important point about migration i completely agree that we need high earning for british people not an economy where we import too many people and keep earning down that be why we have be focus on raise the national living wage and ensure that ordinary household income will go up as a result of this government ’s policy as i have explain it be worth point out that certain thing happen last year such as people flee ukraine and hong kong which mean that the immigration number be particularly high the broad thrust of what my right hon friend say be correct we want a high skill high wage economy 
 i do not know whether the minister realise quite how infuriate people find watch his government tell they everything be fine it be all go really well and there ’ nothing to see here when every day they feel poor and small business be close if the prime minister and the chancellor can not face reality how on earth can anyone trust they to solve the economic crisis that their government create 
 let i be clear with the hon lady whom i have a huge amount of time for as a very good member of parliament it be not our position that everything be okay there have be a challenging international context a once in-100 year pandemic and an energy crisis cause by putin ’s war in ukraine this government have do everything we possibly can to build an economy for growth and i hope we have her support 
 what distinguish this recession be the job that have be create every day since this government come to power in the very antithesis of anything ever achieve by a labour government who have always leave unemployment high than they find it be it not 
 it be and i would add something else the figure for home repossession be much high when there be a recession under the labour government in in comparison with our record now and unemployment now be much low than it be then though we be in challenge time the economy be turn a corner our record compare very favourably labour ’s 
 the chancellor say last may that he be comfortable with the prospect of a recession now that my constituent in selby and ainsty be suffer under that recession ’s effect would the minister chalk it up as a job well do 
 the hon gentleman will do well there be nobody on the government benches who welcome adverse economic situation for anybody that be why we be do everything we can strain every sinew to grow the economy all the measure i have lay out will continue but they would be put at risk by those on his front bench be in office 
 before i come to this house i be a director of quite a large retail group in north norfolk no have make the point that in the last quarter of the year the country see babet ciaran debi elin fergus and gerrit major storm and flood how many be there in the previous year absolutely none at all will the economic secretary tell everybody that of course the economy will not function properly in the grip of storm and flood every fortnight we be not in recession but the more we talk it up the more we will be 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i would say that the loss of large retail group in norfolk be the house ’s gain his point about the international context be serious and important although labour member do not like to hear it face a once in-100 year pandemic and putin ’s illegal war in ukraine which cause energy price to skyrocket will have adverse impact on the economy the country understand that and the house understand that the labour front bench should also understand it 
 this recession be a direct result of the choice that this government have make year of potential growth have be miss and the government have fail particularly to capitalise on the green transition green investment will be worth £ globally by include half a job in this country when will the government bring forward a green investment programme to match the one in the us or in europe 
 our record on decarbonisation beat anywhere else in the g7 so we do not take lesson from the united states or any other country in that regard in relation to the green investment plan by   the hon lady should direct she ire at those on the labour front bench for not be clear as to what their plan be the leader of the opposition says—[interruption well it be important because politic be a contest of idea as indeed it be a contest between party if labour member believe they can spend an extra £ without that have an impact on taxis and borrowing they be try to pull the wool over the eye of the british people 
 the past couple of year have be very difficult economically and i certainly do not treat the state of our economy as the giggle fest that labour members seem to be have today over the past few week i have meet many business in my constituency large and small and a number have tell i that they feel condition be get well demand be grow and order be come back constituent have also tell i that they have notice food price drop in our supermarket do the minister agree that the most damaging thing that could happen to our economy now would be for those on the labour benches to continue to talk our economy down 
 my right hon friend be correct that thing be start to get well for many people across the country include small business we have more than halve inflation which be now down below we think that in the come month it will go to which be the target of course once it hit that target we hope that interest rate will also start come down which will make a big difference to ordinary people up and down the country 
 i applaud the minister ’s willingness to take on this unenviable assignment unlike his right hon friend the international context that he refer to be that japan and the uk be the only g7 country in recession inflation in the uk which he have refer to be the high in the whole g7 why be the uk economy do so much bad than comparable economy elsewhere 
 the right hon gentleman make an interesting point but i would say that our economy enter difficult time at a different point in the cycle from certain other economy to fully assess the performance of all economy we have to wait for the end of this whole period so i would not prejudge exactly at this stage i simply say that the difficulty we be face have affect every single economy although the nature of different economy mean that they be affect at different time we be put in place comprehensive growth measure and comprehensive measure to bring inflation down i also note that uk interest rate be roughly middle of the pack compare with other country of comparable size we will keep all this under review and at the next fiscal event will take further measure to increase our potential growth rate over the long term 
 do the minister welcome the news that the south yorkshire mayor have finally recognise the economic importance of doncaster sheffield airport and be at last start to use the power give to he to begin the process of   get it up and run again do he agree that that have take far too long it be year since the airport close and that the south yorkshire mayor should have use his power year ago rather than wait until week before he be re elect 
 i thank my hon friend for point out once again what a brilliant champion he be for his constituency i be sure his constituent have hear that comment and that he will continue to make that point 
 lordy lordy it be like listen to the red queen in alice through the looking glass who invent impossible thing before breakfast how on earth can we have confidence in what the minister say when the uk statistics authority have to tell off the chief secretary to the treasury   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott for make false claim about tax cut when evan davis have to school she at length and she refuse even to understand how wrong she be about debt fall as a percentage of gdp when it be go up and when the minister himself actually say that the nhs account for to of everything the government spend when it be only can he confirm fact these year will see the big fall in living standard since record begin that be why people be go to vote the government out be n’t it 
 i have already explain the chief secretary ’s comment in relation to my own i be refer to current spending and not overall spending i clarify that as well look there have be difficulty for so many million of people across the country and as the hon gentleman know i have never seek to minimise that from this position or from any other position in the house we have face once in a year challenge the government have face they and take the right action to deal with they the cost of live support package be worth over £ to the tune of more than £ per person we have deal with those challenge and we have a plan now to grow the economy to grow our way out of they i be afraid that labour members and the labour front bench do not have that sort of plan which be why i would not make the assumption that he make about the election 
 the number of those who be on long term sickness benefit in blackpool have increase fourfold over the last few decade that represent an enormous loss of potential and it be also hurt economic growth and productivity the government ’s propose reform in this area be to be welcome but rather than delay they until next year what be prevent the government from bring they in this year 
 i will take that point away i think the hon gentleman be refer to the next financial year at the next fiscal event the budget the chancellor will bear what he have say in mind 
 year of conservative mismanagement of the economy be have disastrous impact on work people for example musician be wait month to be pay because hmrc be fail to process a1 form   on time for musician tour in europe the trade body live live music industry venues and entertainment tell i that in case musician performer and sound engineer be not pay for more than month after their tour to spain due to delay in process a1 form even worse in response to write question i have be tell that service standard for those form will not be meet by hmrc until at least april do the minister agree that those delay be totally unacceptable particularly when our musician be already have to cope with a challenging financial landscape make bad now by the news of a recession 
 i agree that we need to speed up the processing of a1 form as the hon lady describe i be sure the treasury hear that point and i will ensure my ministerial colleague take what she say very seriously indeed 
 whatever spin the government may put on it forecast show that the economy have officially enter a recession however people out there have be suffer grind economic pressure for year average energy bill be high than they be in and more than welsh household be in fuel poverty meanwhile the profit of energy company such as british gas have increase tenfold to £ this be the minister ’s chance to make a difference to every household he have refer to the next fiscal event will he act to extend and backdate the windfall tax on energy company that be currently profiteer from household everywhere 
 the right hon lady be right that many people have have very challenging time over the last couple of year let i correct something that i previously say to the house the increase in real household income since be actually while the increase in gdp per capita be i want to put that on the record as for taxis i can not speculate about what will happen at the next fiscal event 
 accord to the forecast in year time debt will be high than it be now be this a reasonable time to be talk about tax cut and do their do so not suggest that the government have learn nothing from the budget of september 
 i assure the hon gentleman that this chancellor and this government be very different from those in september to which he refer as for debt i repeat that we be keep to our fiscal rule which be and have always be that debt will be fall in the year of the forecast fall once we exclude the bank of england that have always be our position and it will continue to be the case 
 the minister have make no mention of the importance to the uk treasury of north sea oil and indeed the danger to the scottish economy of the closure of grangemouth refinery give that the uk treasury receive £ in revenue from the north sea last year and be expect to receive £ this year can it not find the ten of million not the ten of billion that it will receive in revenue to ensure that the hydrocracker can be restart and the profitability of the refinery increase threefold 
 i will take away the hon gentleman ’s specific point and ensure that the treasury get back to he but his broad point about offshore oil and gas in the north sea be very important it be critical that we support the oil and gas sector not just for the tax revenue but for the livelihood and prosperity of the united kingdom and this government stand square behind it 
 there be overwhelming evidence that the low the economic inequality the high economic growth will be we know from the office for national statistics that between and the disposable income of the poor of household shrink by while those of the rich increase by and that reflect the position in the precede year what assessment have the minister or the chancellor undertake to estimate the impact of these increase inequality on our shrink growth 
 when we be talk about people at the bottom end of the income scale it be important to note that those on the full time national living wage which we will be increase by the large ever amount in april this year will be well off than they be in 
 news that the uk be officially in recession come as no surprise to my constituent who have be batter by this tory cost of living crisis food inflation be still double the headline rate of inflation and that be not only affect the price of the weekly shop but have a hugely negative effect on my local pub and hospitality sector with many business on the brink instead of their fantasyland spinning that everything be go fine what measure will the government introduce to bring food inflation down 
 as i have say many time this afternoon inflation be a target for this government we aim to ensure that we continue to bring it down and indeed we expect it to get to in the come month in relation to food inflation specifically at the last fiscal event we introduce full expensing which will enable food manufacturer supermarket and other to increase their investment hugely because it completely net off against their tax—100 of the cost of their investment be net off the impact will be increase investment that will reduce their cost and reduce the cost of food in our shop that be of many measure that we be introduce to reduce food inflation 
 the prime minister say he be go to grow the economy and he have obviously fail we be now in recession in my constituency family and small business be under severe pressure can the minister possibly explain how he be go to address these very serious problem 
 all i would say to the hon gentleman be that we be in a very challenging international context and we have perform well than the international forecast we have high inflation which really bedevil this economy a couple of year ago but we have more than halve it we have a plan to grow our way out of this as be show by the last fiscal event where we   unveil i think growth measure that be our plan the labour opposition do not have a plan if this country stick with our plan we will grow our economy significantly over the come month and year 
 the minister keep try to hide behind the war in ukraine and the impact of the pandemic but the reality be that those be affect every country in the world would he not admit that the exacerbate factor the thing that have lead most to economic decline to massive labour shortage and to rampant inflation here in the uk be brexit 
 no i would not 
 the economy be in recession and the consequence for the public finance be not the fault of those people infect and affect through the contaminated blood scandal the large treatment disaster in the nhs i be hop to ask the chancellor this question but can the minister confirm whether money have already be ringfence to pay compensation to those people as set out in the final recommendation on compensation by sir brian langstaff in april 
 i believe that the right hon lady ask a similar question of the chancellor at the last treasury question and the chancellor respond by say that he be absolutely clear about the need to compensate people in the way that she have describe he will update the house in due course and indeed update she with further detail in response to her question 
 the prime minister have fail to get growth and industry have completely lose confidence in this government with project cancel hs2 cancel building schools for the future cancel hospital never build and an absolute failure to bring down high energy price it be no wonder that business investment forecast be down with the us and the eu incentivising investment what be the minister now go to do to get the investment we need in the green manufacturing industry of the future 
 to increase investment we bring in full expensing at the last fiscal event which should represent an increase over the forecast period of £ of investment and deal with the chronic weakness of our economy over generation that be what we be do to increase investment in relation to green investment in particular what we be not do be have a huge unfunded £ plan or maybe now it be not labour ’s plan maybe it be a secret plan or maybe the labour front benchers have stop their plan we have a responsible cost plan to increase investment the opposition do not have 
 let ’s try this again public sector net debt be set to rise from of gdp this year to of gdp in accord to the most recent office for budget responsibility forecast in case the minister do not understand that   number be high than today ’s the prime minister promise to reduce debt but it be increase the plan be not work be it 
 the prime minister and the whole government be commit to reduce debt as we get to the end of this economic forecast period which be what we be do 
 the minister ’s rosy picture of the economy show a complete lack of awareness of what be actually go on in this country he claim that the labour party be somehow a risk to growth but it be his party that have take the country into recession that show a complete lack of self awareness too that be the nub of the matter 
 we be in a recession yet the chancellor be nowhere to be see i would have think this be important enough for he to be here to answer question give that grow the economy be yet another of the prime minister ’s pledge that have not be meet who do the minister think should carry the can for this failure the prime minister or the chancellor 
 i will have to take the hon gentleman ’s criticism of my self awareness on the chin but his broad point be serious he be ask whether the government and i be light hearted or think that everything in the economy be absolutely fantastic but it be not that be why we have take the measure that we have it be why we cut tax for work people begin in january it be why we be increase business investment it be why we have a more than £ package of cost of living support because we know how much many ordinary people in this country be suffer and it be why we be try to grow our economy overall because that will result in great prosperity for the country and more money for our public service the labour party put all that at risk 
 the government be fail an year old constituent tell i that he can not remember the economy and living standard ever be this bad can the minister not see that under his government britain be bad off 
 i do not agree with the hon lady i will not repeat everything i just say to   the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders but this government and this treasury be stick to our plan for growth that be all put at risk by the labour party 
 the office for budget responsibility assess boris johnson ’s trade and co operation agreement which set out the trading relationship between the uk and the eu at the beginning of last year and it say that the tca have reduce long run productivity by why do the minister think that be 
 we build on the trade and co operation agreement through the windsor framework and the opposition do not propose to change it indeed the tca be fundamental to the stability of our relationship with the european union and i do not think the country would benefit from unpick it once again 
 i thank the minister for all his answer the question have not be easy the office for national statistics have reveal that there be a decline in gdp between october and december give that the strength of the economy be and still be the subject of of the prime minister ’s pledge what step be the minister take to reverse this decline and to re instil confidence in the government ’s economic plan 
 i have already lay out the step that we be take and there be a critical need to make sure that all the region of our country benefit from those step that be of the reason why we put so much effort and focus into investment zone over the last couple of year we hope that these investment zone will continue to increase growth in the economy not only at a macro level but for people in every region of this country particularly in northern ireland and the other region that perhaps do not benefit from this country ’s previous growth we be committed to strengthen that regionally 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement about post office governance and the horizon compensation scheme 
 over the weekend several serious allegation be make against the government my department and its official by henry staunton the former chair of the post office the allegation be completely false and i would like to make a statement to the house so that hon member and the british public know the truth about exactly what have happen i would like to address specific claim that mr staunton make in his sunday times interview claim that be patently untrue 
 mr staunton allege that i refuse to apologise to he after he learn of his dismissal from sky news that be not the case in the call he reference i make it abundantly clear that i disapprove of the medium break any aspect of the story out of respect for henry staunton ’s reputation i go to great pain to make my concern about his conduct private in fact in my interview with the press i repeatedly say that i refuse to carry out hr in public that be why it be so disappointing that he have choose to spread a series of falsehood provide make up anecdote to journalist and leak discussion hold in confidence all that merely confirm in my mind that i make the correct decision in dismiss he 
 secondly mr staunton claim that i tell he that someone ’ get to take the rap for the horizon scandal and that be the reason for his dismissal that be not the reason at all i dismiss he because there be serious concern about his behaviour as chair include those raise by other director on the board my department find significant governance issue for example a public appointment process be under way for a new senior independent director to the post office board but mr staunton apparently want to bypass it and appoint someone from the board without due process he fail to properly consult the post office board on the proposal he fail to hold the require nomination committee and most importantly he fail to consult the government as a shareholder which the company be require to do i know that hon member will agree with i that such a cavalier approach to governance be the last thing we need in the post office give its historical failing 
 i should also inform the house that while mr staunton be in post a formal investigation be launch into allegation make regard his conduct include serious matter such as bully concern be bring to my department ’s attention about mr staunton ’s willingness to co operate with that investigation 
 it be right that the british public should know the fact behind the case and what be say in the phone call in which i dismiss mr staunton official from my department be on the line the call be minuted and a read out be send after it take place today i be deposit a copy of that read out in both libraries of the house so that hon member and the public can see the truth in those minute personal information relate to other post office employee have be redact for all   those reason an interim chair will be appoint shortly and i will of course update the house when we have further detail 
 finally mr staunton claim that when he be appoint as chair of the post office he be tell by a senior civil servant to stall on pay compensation there be no evidence whatsoever that that be true in fact on become post office chair mr staunton receive a letter from the permanent secretary of the department for business energy and industrial strategy sarah munby on   december welcome he to his role and make it crystal clear that successfully reach settlement with victim of the post office scandal should be of his high priority that letter be in the public domain the word be there in black and white and copy of the correspondence will be place in the libraries of both houses 
 the reality be that my department have do everything it can to speed up compensation payment for victim we have already make payment total £ across all compensation scheme that include our announcement last autumn of the optional £ fix sum award for those who have be wrongfully convict it be the strong refutation of those in this house who would claim that we act only after the itv drama mr bates vs the post office be show british people should know that a dedicated team of ministers and civil servant have be work around the clock for many month to hasten the pursuit of justice and bring swift fair redress to all those affect 
 to that end i be pleased that all postmaster who claim through the original horizon shortfall scheme have now have offer of compensation the post office be deal promptly with late application and case where the initial offer have not be accept my department have also establish the horizon compensation unit to ensure that money get to the right people without a moment ’s delay last autumn we announce an additional £ to the post office specifically to help it meet the cost of participate in the post office horizon inquiry and deliver compensation to postmaster in all we have commit around £ to ensure that wrong postmaster can be fully and fairly compensate and through forthcoming legislation we be take unprecedented step to quash the conviction of postmaster affect by the horizon scandal 
 in short we be put our money where our mouth be and our shoulder to the wheel to ensure that justice be do it be not fair on the victim of this scandal which have already ruin so many life and livelihood to claim as mr staunton have do that thing be be drag out a long than they ought to be for henry staunton to suggest otherwise for whatever personal motif be a disgrace and it risk damage confidence in the compensation scheme that ministers and civil servant be work so hard to deliver i would hope that most people read the interview in yesterday ’s sunday times would see it for what it be a blatant attempt to seek revenge follow dismissal 
 i must say that i regret the way in which these event have unfold we do everything that we could to manage this dismissal in a dignified way for mr staunton and other however i will not hesitate to defend myself and more importantly my official who can not respond   directly to these baseless attack right now the post office ’s no priority must be deliver compensation to postmaster who have not already be compensate there be those who fall victim to a faulty it system that the post office implement and that it turn a blind eye to when brave whistleblower such as alan bates sound the alarm we say that the government would leave no stone unturned in uncover the truth behind the horizon scandal and in pursue justice for the victim and their family we be deliver on that promise while look for any further possible step that we can take to ensure the full and final settlement of claim as quickly as possible
