 it be the honour of my life to represent the community where i grow up and that i call home as the labour mp in hertford and stortford ’s year history our town centre in hertford give i my job our railway carry i to the university education i think i have miss out on and although i be not sure that at age i count as an old boy of the school i be a proud former student of richard hale i be deeply humble by the trust that our resident have place in i and i will work every day to ensure that it be repay 
 hertford and stortford be a historic community when plague overrun london in the 1500 this parliament move to hertford castle where the gatehouse be now home to hertford town council bishop ’s stortford be suspect to be a roman new town and may once have sit at an ancient transport interchange sawbridgeworth boast architecture from the tudor stuart and georgian period and ware be home to a malt make industry that last from the civil war to the century 
 our constituency represent so much of what be great about our country hard work community historic town and hub of innovation creativity and commerce i have the chance to visit such hub of innovation on a recent visit to wickham hall in bishop ’s stortford there i be inspire by david and suzy harvey self style custodian of the countryside whose creativity and passion have transform a year old family farm into a thrive business community make use of the green technology of the future and with a mission to protect our environment 
 our natural environment be as diverse as it be beautiful with some of britain ’s rare chalk stream of which our resident be rightly fiercely protective run right through our constituency i therefore warmly welcome this government ’s commitment to clean up our precious water i will work tirelessly within this house and in my community to ensure that they be protect 
 today many of our hertford and stortford resident will travel to and from work use our local railway whether from town to the next from our constituency into london or even far however when i speak to resident in our community too often i hear story of a broken rail network that be not work for local people indeed just today of my resident contact i to say that yet more service have be cancel to hertford north this evening due to a lack of staff 
 our railway be once the pride of britain connect people and place with new opportunity but the current model of privatisation be fail passenger and staff across the country i be hearten by my right hon friend the secretary of state ’s promise to move fast and fix thing we know that publicly own passenger focus rail can deliver the efficient high quality and reliable service that our hertford and stortford resident need and make our railway something to be proud of once again 
 i have not follow a traditional path through life as my sometimes frustrated parent would agree i leave school at and go straight into work in my town centre then commute into london before work in recruitment in a local business park i return to education during lockdown enrol at the university   of westminster to study perhaps unsurprisingly politic blissfully unaware that in a few year time i would be desperately try to navigate the corridor of this place 
 i would not have find the path that be right for i have it not be for the inspirational work of our youth club in hertford and stortford and it be to they that i wish to pay tribute now i have experience at hand the difference that their work make to the life of our young people and i can say with confidence that have it not be for the support and guidance of a youth worker name russell cairns i would not be in this chamber today i have since have the privilege of visit the thirst youth café in bishop ’s stortford and volunteering at futurehope youth café in the very building where i once seek advice from russell i look forward to work with they and many other as our member of parliament to ensure that every young person in our community be support to find the path that be right for they just as i be support to find mine 
 i hope i can also show our young people that if they wish the path they choose can lead they here during the election i have the chance to visit some of our local school take part in a husting at herts and essex high school in bishop ’s stortford and answer the question of former at leventhorpe school in sawbridgeworth and richard hale school in hertford i be strike by their insightful question and genuine passion for politic 
 we know that young people be at the sharp end of so many of the crisis we face today whether it be the climate crisis or the crisis in housing and mental health but too often they feel powerless to make a difference and that politics be not a place for they i be proud to be a young person represent his community join this place among a cohort of young parliamentarian but it be incumbent on all of we to show our young people that they have a place not only in politic but in this parliament too and i look forward to work with colleague across the house to make that happen 
 finally i would like to reflect on people without whom i would not be here my mum and dad my mum teach in local school before become a special educational need co ordinator i have grow up watch she give so much to her profession in often challenging circumstance hers be the story of teacher and support staff across our school across the country and she continue to be an inspiration to i as be my dad who now live just outside bishop ’s stortford and like so many of our resident commute into london every day

 i give credit to the former conservative member for taunton deane rebecca pow who will i be sure continue her enthusiasm for gardening and wildlife she be of course a minister with responsibility for water and for our river i be partial to a dip in the river from time to time so i be pleased to successfully apply for bathing water status for a stretch of the tone in taunton to get the improvement in water quality that we desperately need in our river down in taunton the river tone be the silver thread that join wellington to taunton to the level close to where the famous cake be burn near the king alfred inn at burrowbridge 
 i also pay tribute to the former liberal democrat mp jeremy browne the member of parliament for taunton deane from to he serve as a home office and a foreign office minister and remain incredibly well like in the constituency he be the member to propose a new railway station for wellington and i be delighted to have have the chancellor ’s assurance in the previous debate that that project will go ahead i be the liberal to represent taunton in parliament since some guy name disraeli be defeat by the in the general election of course nothing far be hear of he at least not in taunton 
 taunton ’s parliamentary tradition be very deep rooted as a county town with a castle which today proudly house the castle hotel and the superb museum of somerset support by our dynamic town council its parliamentarian hold out in siege after siege today the hard work of so many people in taunton at the brewhouse theatre the southern sinfonia the bluebirds theatre company the tacchi morris the willows and wetlands visitor centre the creative innovation centre arts   taunton gocreate taunton group such as amici and voce and the bradford players i have many more the taunton thespians and the @2 k theatre and in wellington at the arts centre the wellesley theatre the operatic society and the gaumont theatre which once play host to the beatles and the rolling stones and be now home to the bingo all come together to mean that not only do we have a mecca but our area be a cultural mecca to which people come from far and wide 
 then of course there be the magnificent somerset county ground grace by the tower of st james and the minster where i marry caroline just short year ago i thank she and our child emily fraser and fenner and felix from the bottom of my heart for their support our school from north town and minerva to bishop fox ’s court fields castle pyrland selworthy and monkton wood feed into our nationally renowned richard huish college bridgwater taunton college and university centre somerset which now offer degree like nursing in support of the superb staff at musgrove park hospital funding be urgently need for the hospital ’s new maternity unit because bucket be currently use to catch the rain in the corridor of a building build for the us army as a temporary building in 
 similarly king ’s and queen ’s taunton and wellington ’s independent school make a massive contribution to our area ’s local economy we also have a successful home education community that inspire an innovative generation of young people to all our area ’s child i say be yourself if your name be gideon for example there ’ no need to change it to get elect to parliament that be something i once try to discuss with the former member for tatton i confess that it have take i a little time to get to this chamber if i have not have to deliver all those bible to hotel i would have get here a lot quick 
 all those institution together with the uk hydrographic office make taunton the ideal location for new research and innovation entrepreneur it be only minute from paddington so they should all come and enjoy the amazing quality of life that we offer when they come to taunton they will find a ticket office at the station that be still work i be amazed to hear   the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton   apparently still advocate the closure of ticket office a policy about which i can say only good luck to encourage people to come to wellington i look forward to work hard on the wellington station project that i mention early 
 i invite the right hon lady the transport secretary and the under secretary of state for transport   the hon member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood to visit the project on their visit i hope that they will enjoy a glass of famous sheppy ’s or taunton cider or to pronounce it correctly for hansard zyder at the ring of bells the green dragon or the pump house in tonedale in a rocket and bird glass with some somerdale cheese and perhaps some bumblee ’s relish follow by a meal at guddi and gikki maliha and taj the little wine shop or augustus they be ideal for planning visit to key organisation in the constituency like wpa pritex or indeed the commando royal marines at norton manor camp 
 i be delighted to support the royal marines with the help of former royal marine paddy ashdown raise an ultimately successful petition to gain a u turn on the previous government ’s shocking proposal to close down the entire facility in his maiden speech the other day my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury cameron thomas draw attention to the huge sacrifice that previous generation make so that we be all free to sit in this chamber today my service in the territorial army be pretty minimal but my father fjc jim amos cbe and my mother geraldine amos mbe both serve in world war follow their father who serve in the trench i remember discuss it with they all 
 when i be grow up hon member will not be surprised to hear that the atmosphere and the memory of war loom large in discussion around meal table be it not that generation ’s courage and bravery not only in rebuild britain but in defeat fascism in the place that demand our respect they demand that we do everything we can to defend the liberal and democratic value that make this country so great their bravery surely also demand that all hon member on both side of the house always say no to those who would stir up division despair and hatred for nothing more than vote because they have nothing positive to offer people 
 it be the great privilege of my life to serve the resident of taunton and wellington from hatch beauchamp helland and north curry in the east to whiteball west buckland and sampfords moor and arundel in the west and from bishopswood churchinford and stoke st mary in the south to pickney west monckton and kingston st mary in the north in this house i be here to do thing work for they and stand up for they to those in power whenever that be the right thing to do i thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to begin that duty today 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for this opportunity to make my maiden speech may i congratulate you on your recent election i also congratulate all those who have make maiden speech today particularly   the hon member for high peak jon pearce who speak so passionately about the beauty of his constituency and the childhood experience that he bring to this house 
 i be honour to have be elect by the people of thornbury and yate to be their voice and champion here in parliament ours be a beautiful and hugely varied rural constituency with the town of thornbury yate and chipping sodbury and many village stretch from hill falfield and charfield in the north to bridge yate   siston and wick in the south to the east be the cotswold escarpment part of a designate national landscape to the west be the severn estuary a ramsar wetland of international importance and formerly home to the aust ferry make famous by bob dylan 
 there be much worth visit locally from historic attraction such as dyrham park and acton court to the more modern bristol zoo project carry out important international conservation work while not far away i hesitate to mention this when my leader my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   might be listen there be an artificial inland surfing lake call the wave 
 there be a real history of innovation locally although sadly my own parish of frampton cotterell ’s claim to the invention of the stetson hat appear to be little more than an urban legend however we can be proud that the pioneer of vaccination edward jenner start his medical training in chipping sodbury nowadays many of my constituent work in cut edge industry in our region such as aerospace with a background in math and software engineering i take a keen interest in see those industry flourish and i want to ensure that our young people can benefit from the opportunity they bring 
 my constituency be of course more than its landscape and history it be the people who live there and their fantastic community spirit i see that in my own village during the pandemic when hundred of volunteer rally to help other whether it be the big lunch in chipping sodbury the yate ageing better festival thornbury carnival or any myriad other event and group they all contribute to make the constituency a wonderful place to live 
 i thank my predecessor luke hall who serve thornbury and yate for year during which time he champion neonatal care leave and hold post in the department for education and the ministry of housing communities and local government i wish he and his family all the good for the future i also thank his predecessor the former pensions minister sir steve webb who have be a great source of wisdom for i and be fondly remember by many constituent he set a very high bar for all his successor and i will do my good to meet it while i be thank people i put on record my gratitude to councillor maggie tyrrell who have recently succeed i as the leader of south gloucestershire council i know that the council be in safe hand as i bring that experience to this place 
 i be grateful for the opportunity to make this speech in this important debate because if we be to tackle the climate crisis and cut congestion on our road we must get rail service back on track to give people genuine alternative to get around effectively there be currently railway station in my constituency yate station be reopen in the 1980s and we desperately need the propose redevelopment i will also be seek to ensure that the funding for half hourly service be extend beyond the current end date of that will benefit not only yate but provide an hourly train for the new station plan at charfield 
 the station at pilning be a parliamentary station with just train run a week to avoid formally close it its location near the grow industrial location of   severnside mean that if properly reopen it be prime place to help the many worker who travel from south wales to make the trip without a car the station be severn beach once a seaside resort the line now serve commuter however commuter can be leave disappoint by flood on the line as well as the fact that the service be not more frequent rail campaigner be also keen to see other station reopen such as coalpit heath and thornbury but for that to be possible we need national investment in westerleigh junction to increase capacity and unlock this potential i hope that the secretary of state will commit to make that part of the integrate infrastructure review that be reference early 
 as my hon friend   the member for bath wera hobhouse   say ultimately passenger be not interested in who run the train they simply want they to run on time and for the ticket to be affordable give the continue squeeze on people ’s finance we need an immediate freeze on rail fare and our fragmented ticketing system need simplify to cut cost for commuter we also need to think about integration with other form of public transport in my constituency we have see serious cut to local bus service with many village leave with no regular bus at all my aim in this place will be to champion the right of people to have affordable and green method of transport whether they live in rural or urban area 
 in conclusion i promise to work tirelessly for my constituent not only on fix our railway but on other issue too such as the fact that our school be among the low fund in the country and that it be almost impossible to register with an nhs dentist locally i look forward to work constructively with right hon and hon member across the house to address these problem and ensure that the people of thornbury and yate get the fair deal they deserve 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to make my maiden speech in this august chamber i join other hon member in welcome you to your place and the ministerial team and the shadow ministerial team to their place as well i congratulate all hon member who have make their maiden speech today we have hear excellent contribution i thank in particular   the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young who describe her constituency so eloquently that it make want to visit but those who know i will know that a visit by i would be accompany with a labour party campaign 
 may i also please take this opportunity to thank all the staff across the parliamentary estate who have work incredibly hard and always courteously to help i and i be sure many other hon member to establish ourselves in this place 
 i also take the opportunity to thank the voter of smethwick who have entrust i with the honour and responsibility of be their elect member of parliament it be indeed a great honour to stand here today and i give the voter my word that i will work to repay their trust to the good of my ability 
 of course i would not be here without the support of my family my grandfather bhan singh and niranjan singh arrive in the uk in and and carry out manual job in foundry and brickwork respectively they come with hope for a well life for they and their family but they also come with a strong belief that with hard work they would be able to forge a well life in great britain 
 my father swaran singh josan be year old when he arrive in smethwick in he have most of his education here and he go on to work as an engineer for the post office which go on to become british telecom alongside that in he my mum and my uncle establish a family business a hardware store and plumber merchant on the high street in smethwick and my brother continue to run the business today my father be also active in his trade union and the labour party he be elect to sandwell council in and subsequently time unfortunately he pass away in when he be the cabinet member for housing in sandwell be in this place be always his dream i believe that he would be proud of this achievement 
 it be a convention of the house to speak in good term about ’s predecessor my predecessor be the right hon john spellar and those who know he will know thing it do not require convention for i to speak well of he secondly bear in mind that his phone ringtone be the theme tune to the godfather it be a convention that i dare not ignore john be elect to the house in a by election in in birmingham northfield he be then elect as member of parliament for warley west in and for warley in in total john give over year of service to the house during which he serve in ministerial and shadow ministerial role in addition he give stalwart service to the people he be elect to represent and be always greet fondly across the whole constituency john also play a considerable role over all those year in work to keep the labour party in the centre ground the ground where election be win and life can be change for the well he leave i with incredibly big shoe to fill i be delighted that he be be elevate to the other place 
 smethwick exist as the name for the constituency between and and have be bring back follow the recent boundary change the constituency consist of the former warley constituency and most of the blackheath ward it include the football ground of west bromwich albion the baggies it be an extremely diverse place with a relatively young demographic and a significant black asian and minority ethnic community particularly from the muslim and sikh background 
 smethwick be mention in the domesday book its people be a proud people who be particularly proud of our industrial heritage as an example smethwick be the location of the soho foundry create by matthew boulton and james watt in where the old work steam engine in the world be build 
 historically in addition to my predecessor smethwick also see christabel pankhurst stand in the general election just after woman be give the vote oswald mosley be the mp between and smethwick also have the short serve mp ever elect alfred dobbs be elect in the general election    however the day after the election he be kill in a car accident on his way to westminster be aware of that record i wait day after the election before drive extra carefully down to parliament 
 perhaps the most infamous previous mp for the seat be peter griffiths the tory party candidate who be elect in after run a disgraceful and nakedly racist campaign with a disgusting slogan which i will not repeat as it use the racist n word the election and racial tension at the time prompt a visit a few month later to the constituency by malcolm x which be just about a week before he be kill thankfully peter griffiths ’s term be bring to an end by andrew fauld who defeat he in the general election smethwick be undergo huge change at the time in it see the appointment of the black headteacher in the uk tony o’connor at bearwood primary school 
 the general election be about change after year the british people have vote for change and give a huge mandate to the prime minister and the labour party the recent king ’s speech contain bills that will bring huge change to the country our public service and the life of the people we represent the prime minister can be sure that his programme have my full support 
 among those bills the passenger railway services public ownership bill will bring much need change on our railway its provision that will bring franchise into public control and along with provision that will set up great british railways be widely discuss and understand by voter during the general election it be clear that voter support the change propose in the bill 
 for i the election be also about change across our community example of that change in smethwick be the fact that year after that disgraceful racist campaign i a child and grandchild of immigrant can be elect to this house that change be the result of many people across smethwick and sandwell work hard to build relationship and understanding across all community and ensure that we deliver on the aspiration of all our people 
 smethwick be an incredibly diverse yet harmonious place it be my community by that i mean it be the street i live on the park opposite the church on church hill street the jamia mosque on oldbury road the bangladeshi mosque in north smethwick the somali community centre the smethwick asian sheltered and residential association safs care family support st albans community centre better understanding of dementia for sandwell the royal british legion branch and club brushstroke brandhall labour club the school where i be a governor the gurdwara where i pray the high street where i work and so much more that be my community 
 yet in smethwick we also have our challenge some of those spill out during the election as they do in other place the election see the rise of small party and independent include those drive by foreign policy issue and other such as the reform party i be chair of trustee at hope not hate charitable trust and i see how hate and aggression increasingly define our public discourse particularly on online platform but also more and more in person it be a responsibility of all of we to challenge and address that and to ensure that kindness be the basis of all that we do to those who   do not vote for i in smethwick i say i be still your member of parliament and i still want to talk to you about the issue that concern you 
 many members have say that be in this place be the honour of our life so over the weekend i think about that and question why we say it what come to my mind be that people have vote for we they have go out there put a cross by our name and put their trust in we we be in the mother of all parliaments and we will make decision that will change this country those be all reason why it be a real honour to be here but the big reason why it be an honour to be in this chamber be the people we have hear so many excellent maiden speech over the past couple of week which signify the strength of this chamber the chamber without its people be just benches and benches do not do anything institution without people in they do not do anything it be the people who will bring change the honour be be here alongside so many fantastic people i may disagree with those on other bench fundamentally and robustly but it be an honour to be here alongside every single of they 
 i have always be drive by a strong sense of humanity fairness and justice my upbringing and my sikhi faith be key to my belief i be remind of the line in gurbani write by guru nanak 
 ham nahi changae bura nahi koi 
 i be not good no be bad that draw attention to the equality of all of we regardless of any of our attribute a good friend in interfaith circle describe sikhi in a letter word love we believe that god be omnipresent across and within all of creation so to love god be to love other people for those of no faith it do no harm to love other in any case

 i be grateful for the opportunity to make my speech in support of this bill which will hopefully lay the permanent way to well value for taxpayer and well passenger service transport have sometimes be see in this place as an unfashionable department a stop off point for ambitious politician on the way up and occasionally on the way down but it be clear that this attitude be not hold by this front bench team or this new government there be however some historical basis for that view when barbara castle be appoint transport minister harold wilson tell she 
 your job be to produce the integrated transport policy we promise in our manifesto i could work something out myself give half an hour 
 when nicholas ridley tell margaret thatcher that he want to privatise the railway she respond 
 railway privatisation will be the waterloo of this government never mention the railway to i again 
 down the year hon member on the conservative benches must have privately wish that mrs thatcher ’s view have be take to heart by those who come after in fact give the previous government ’s record of reclassify network rail into the public sector abandon the traditional franchising model and   nationalise a quarter of passenger service i half expect to see conservative members join labour tonight in support of the bill 
 it be a privilege to work as staff in the shadow transport team during some of those long year in opposition may i take this opportunity to say how welcome it be to see the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood   in her place she bring real expertise to the role from her time as chair of the transport committee and in the shadow transport team she will be an outstanding minister and i be grateful for her support and guidance down the year 
 another shadow transport minister in that team be richard burden my labour predecessor for birmingham northfield richard ably represent northfield for year he be well remember in this house for his boundless enthusiasm for the motor industry and for his steadfast commitment to social justice which have continue into what can not be call a retirement through his activism in pursuit of well local health service and support for the humanitarian cause in palestine his support mean a lot to i during the campaign and i be sure his friend on both side of the house extend their good wish to he 
 i also want to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor in the space of just parliament gary sambrook become well know locally and through the committee in the conservative party nationally he and other candidate fight a campaign that be untouched by the disgraceful tactic of intimidation that be witness elsewhere in birmingham and which must have no place in our public life i be certain that this be not the end for gary in birmingham politic and i wish he well 
 to talk about birmingham be to tell a tale of city that be as true of the northfield constituency as it be elsewhere pocket of relative affluence sit cheek by jowl with deprivation the historic village centre of king norton and northfield lie a short distance from the new estate like weoley castle that be build to serve the need of birmingham ’s grow economy the fortune of the constituency rise and fall with birmingham but the seat be also define by its outer estate new frankley rubery and allens cross which be distant and distinct from the city centre all these community face common challenge include crime and antisocial behaviour and the decline of the traditional high street they have be hit hard by cut to neighbourhood policing and by the decision last year to not proceed with the regeneration of northfield ’s high street there be much to do 
 for most of the constituency ’s history it be well know for the longbridge car plant which also draw in worker from the surround area of west heath rednal and beyond for year longbridge pay handsomely into the national purse and it be essential to our defence in time of crisis during the world war longbridge and its shadow factory produce many of the armament and aircraft that keep our nation free if the house will excuse a diversion i be remind at this point of my grandad ’s story often repeat with pride to we as child about his time station at the air defence at billeseley common when he almost fire a rocket at an encroaching german plane 
 the site that begin as the austin work be an important part of our national life at its peak it employ some people model from the austin to the metro become part of our share culture it be hard to believe that next year will mark the anniversary of longbridge ’s closure that occasion must be mark appropriately in birmingham and in parliament the site be now home to an ambitious redevelopment project and importantly some manufacture job be return but travel just a short distance and the scar of that closure be still plain to see the male employment rate remain a staggering point low than in birmingham as a whole shamefully average monthly wage be £ low in the constituency than they be in after inflation the scourge of in work poverty be never far away 
 today my constituent be most likely to be employ in public service i be proud to be the son of teacher even if sadly the headquarters of the nasuwt the teachers union which my parent be member of for many year be just over the border in the neighbouring constituency of bromsgrove there will be more to say much more in this parliament about the funding and delivery of service in birmingham it be enough to say today that after year of severe cut the city be bleed and i welcome the statement that the new government have make about the importance of put local government funding on a sustainable footing 
 the new government ’s plan to establish a fair pay agreement for adult social care and to reinstate the school support staff negotiate body will also make a real material and long overdue difference to thousand of low pay worker in the northfield constituency most of they woman who i be proud to help represent as an officer of the gmb union and whose skill and professionalism have be undervalue for too long 
 if i could achieve thing in the time i have in this place it would be to secure improvement to special educational need and disability provision it be a cause that be close to my heart i be of those child i know what it mean to have to fight to avoid be define by other people ’s low expectation i know the stigma that be the mark of attitude that be still common and from word that i will not repeat in this place i wish that i could say otherwise but it never leave you i know too that a child ’s life can turn on access to an identification or a single decision about adjustment and resource or even for the want of a few encouraging word so if i speak for a moment in anger it be because too many child and family in birmingham and beyond face barrier that be high now than they be year ago in breach of the promise that life for each generation will be well than the last it be not enough to fight for people within a fail system we have to change it that be of the cause i come to parliament to advocate for and i welcome the commitment on send make by the education secretary and the prime minister in the early day of this parliament 
 i would like to end by talk about family before i come generation of factory worker electrician and shopkeeper painter and polisher cleaner and coachbuilder jewellery maker and japanner some escape famine ’s shadow who be bear in birmingham or who come to call the city their home in the last   few week i have think about those i know and those i do not and what they might have say if they could have see this day just as the hard accumulate year of million of work life form the prologue to the new deal for work people and the history that this labour government will make i have think too about public service about the challenge of prove to be equal to the task ahead and to the hope of the people who trust we to represent they in this place madam deputy speaker i hope to be

 while i completely and unequivocally support our government ’s plan to build more home we must at the same time do as much as we can to protect our green space and deliver the infrastructure that go with any new home it must be a case of do thing with not to people

 i be honour to have be elect by the people of thornbury and yate to be their voice and champion here in parliament ours be a beautiful and hugely varied rural constituency with the town of thornbury yate and chipping sodbury and many village stretch from hill falfield and charfield in the north to bridge yate   siston and wick in the south to the east be the cotswold escarpment part of a designate national landscape to the west be the severn estuary a ramsar wetland of international importance and formerly home to the aust ferry make famous by bob dylan

 there be a real history of innovation locally although sadly my own parish of frampton cotterell ’s claim to the invention of the stetson hat appear to be little more than an urban legend however we can be proud that the pioneer of vaccination edward jenner start his medical training in chipping sodbury nowadays many of my constituent work in cut edge industry in our region such as aerospace with a background in math and software engineering i take a keen interest in see those industry flourish and i want to ensure that our young people can benefit from the opportunity they bring 
 my constituency be of course more than its landscape and history it be the people who live there and their fantastic community spirit i see that in my own village during the pandemic when hundred of volunteer rally to help other whether it be the big lunch in chipping sodbury the yate ageing better festival thornbury carnival or any myriad other event and group they all contribute to make the constituency a wonderful place to live

 i be grateful for the opportunity to make this speech in this important debate because if we be to tackle the climate crisis and cut congestion on our road we must get rail service back on track to give people genuine alternative to get around effectively there be currently railway station in my constituency yate station be reopen in the 1980s and we desperately need the propose redevelopment i will also be seek to ensure that the funding for half hourly service be extend beyond the current end date of that will not only benefit yate but provide an hourly train for the new station plan at charfield 
 the station at pilning be a parliamentary station with just train run a week to avoid formally close it its location near the grow industrial location of   severnside mean that if properly reopen it be prime place to help the many worker who travel from south wales to make the trip without a car the station be severn beach once a seaside resort the line now serve commuter however commuter can be leave disappoint by flood on the line as well as the fact that the service be not more frequent rail campaigner be also keen to see other station reopen such as coalpit heath and thornbury but for that to be possible we need national investment in westerleigh junction to increase capacity and unlock this potential i hope that the secretary of state will commit to make that part of the integrate infrastructure review that be reference early 
 as my hon friend   the member for bath wera hobhouse   say ultimately passenger be not interested in who run the train they simply want they to run on time and for the ticket to be affordable give the continue squeeze on people ’s finance we need an immediate freeze on rail fare and our fragmented ticketing system need simplify to cut cost for commuter we also need to think about integration with other form of public transport in my constituency we have see serious cut to local bus service with many village leave with no regular bus at all my aim in this place will be to champion the right of people to have affordable and green method of transport whether they live in rural or urban area 
 in conclusion i promise to work tirelessly for my constituent not only on fix our railway but on other issue too such as the fact that our school be among the low fund in the country and that it be almost impossible to register with an nhs dentist locally i look forward to work constructively with right hon and hon member across the house to address these problem and ensure that the people of thornbury and yate get the fair deal they deserve
