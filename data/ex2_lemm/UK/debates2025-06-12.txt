 the hon lady raise a critical issue the british government have a long stand opposition to the illegal occupation of land in the palestinian territory principally in the west bank we have be clear and consistent that on the ground of international law the responsibility lie with the israelis to resolve these issue on the point she raise it be a significant and contentious enough issue i will be happy to write to she but it have be clear for many year that we oppose the settlement and continue to do so

 i sympathise with a lot of what the hon lady have say she be right to recognise that post brexit we have broadly overperforme in service relative to expectation but significantly underperformed in term of good export that be in no small measure because a number of food and agriculture producer be bury in red tape and new paperwork that be exactly why as she suggest the sps deal be critical again i welcome the fact that for the time today we be be challenge to go far and fast on deal that we have deliver i can assure she that as i have say in relation to the united states we take seriously our responsibility on the implementation of sps but that place responsibility on the british government and in this case on the european commission

 what a privilege it must be for my hon friend to represent a constituency with so many essential business do such brilliant work for this country on advanced manufacturing he be right to say that a set of advantageous position have be agree put this country at a genuine competitive advantage particularly in relation to sector such as automotive and machinery which i would expect his constituency to benefit from india be traditionally a very protectionist economy and it be the world ’s fast grow big economy   whether it be for good or service a&m pure precision or the west midland as a whole there be so much good stuff here to celebrate 
 the minister can expect an autographed copy of the book by   the hon member for central ayrshire alan gemmell   to be spin its way towards his office as we speak 
 i very much welcome the uk india free trade agreement it be good news but northern ireland have a particular protocol issue i know that the minister be keen i know it for a fact because his answer be always good that northern ireland can receive the same benefit as the rest of the united kingdom england scotland and wales can he assure we that we in northern ireland will also be benefactor 
 i appreciate the hon member ’s kind word he will know that ensure that everything my department do work for northern ireland be a personal priority for i and for the ministerial team in relation to export i can assure he that northern ireland will benefit from the advantageous position that the whole united kingdom be in we do have issue in make sure the more complex regulatory position from the protocol in northern ireland be work in the good possible way there be very strong reason for make that work well if we can do so and he have my commitment that we will seek to do that

 the government continue to support entrepreneur through start up loan via the british business bank and through programme such as growth hub in england and help to grow management training across the uk later this year we will publish our small and medium sized enterprise strategy key element of which will be to signal our determination to do even more to champion our entrepreneur include through a new vision for business support build around the come business growth service 
 you will be pleased to know that i do not have a book come out mr speaker i be read the that my hon friend   the member for central ayrshire alan gemmell   have write and it be excellent but i should probably say on his behalf that any likeness to character in this place be entirely coincidental 
 i thank the minister for his response i have see at hand his commitment to support britain ’s entrepreneurial spirit but i worry that on the isle of wight unreliable cross solent transport be hold back entrepreneur local business do not lack ambition they lack a dependable link to their supply chain some be even consider leave the island will the minister meet i to discuss a long term solution to cross solent travel that support rather than punishe island business 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s commitment to championing entrepreneur on the isle of wight we know that there be huge untapped potential in the entrepreneurial talent across the uk and we be determined to do even more to unlock it include on the isle of wight as he will know the department for transport which lead on cross solent travel have be clear that ferry service to and from the isle of wight be vital for islander and for business i know he have already have some contact with ministerial colleague at the department for transport to discuss these issue but if he think i can be helpful i will be happy to meet he 
 town like rugby have a proud industrial heritage and an exciting present and we be build a dynamic and sustainable business and industrial future it be very welcome that the chancellor revise the green book to make sure that investment and economic growth be spread more fairly across the country beyond the major city region can my hon friend set out what support may be available for town like rugby to attract and encourage people to start and grow their own business for example entrepreneurship hub in town rather than city so that they can play a role and target tax relief for firm set up in place like rugby

 i recently meet a load of entrepreneur and small business in mid leicestershire who all have the same concern about the low vat registration threshold of just £ that be stifle their growth because it add a lot of bureaucracy and cost what representation will the minister make to the chancellor to ensure that those small business can flourish 
 the hon gentleman will not be surprised to know that we receive representation on the vat threshold from a number of small business and we ensure that they be hear by treasury colleague he will recognise that vat raise a significant sum of money for the public finance and give the mess that we inherit we have to take some difficult decision about those public finance to protect funding for hospital in his constituency and indeed other public service across the country 
 recently impose general product safety regulation have add yet another layer of cost and complexity to export to the european union that be particularly hit entrepreneur and microbusinesse many of which have have to end export to their eu customer do the department have any discussion with its eu counterpart during recent trade negotiation about exempt small and microbusinesse from those rule if not be it do any work to support small business in particular which have have to end export to eu customer because of the new regulation 
 we have be talk to business about what they can do in the light of the new regulation and we be in the process of improve significantly the range of support available to business online the secretary of state recently set out our plan for a new business growth service which will significantly improve the speed and quality of advice that business can get from the government 
 what step he be take to help reduce employment cost for employer 
 what step he be take to help reduce employment cost for employer 
 the employment rights bill be the next phase of deliver our plan to make work pay the bill be both pro worker and pro business and will see significant benefit for employer for example increase worker wellbee could be worth billion of pound a year the bill will also reduce workplace conflict which accord to a report publish by acas in cost employer around £ a year the bill will level the play field so that those employer who be engage in good business practice be not force into a race to the bottom 
 yesterday scotbeef announce the closure of its abattoir in inverurie in my gordon and buchan constituency with job loss and another blow to agriculture in north east scotland it blame rise cost in april the increase to national insurance contribution come in a huge tax rise on business and the office for budget responsibility have show that job be lose in may which be the high monthly figure in year it can not be a coincidence that that happen the month after the nics increase how be the minister ’s department support business and job in sector such as agriculture which be have to deal with huge cost increase because of his government ’s decision 
 i be very sorry to hear the news from the hon lady ’s constituency it be the case that more people be in work compare with this time last year and few people be economically inactive i be rather surprised that she mention the national insurance hike because the leader of the opposition be on the radio this morning and be repeatedly ask to confirm whether that hike would be reverse she fail to do so and it seem to i that the opposition be in opposition to themselves 
 the minister seem to be in denial as a former entrepreneur i visit lot of business in my constituency and i talk to they about their fear not a single have anything positive to say about the employment rights bill indeed they be concerned that it will reduce employment not increase it and it have be estimate that it will increase cost by more than £ the minister have be ask this before so he have have   a lot of time to think about it can he name a single business that publicly support the employment rights bill 
 i can certainly name a number i also refer the hon member to hansard on   tuesday march column where i name a small business a number of other business have be in support centrica co op richer sounds nationwide adept one+all pedal me inkwell there be many business that we talk to on a regular basis and that understand that treat staff well be a good thing for those business it be a pro growth pro worker measure 
 on   june a conservative minister stand at the government dispatch box and say 
 labour ’s minimum wage would cost hundred of thousand of jobs”.—[official report   june vol c. 
 they be wrong then and they be wrong now with particular focus on the teesside region what step be the government take to bring more well pay job to people to make sure they can spend more in our local economy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there be so many echo of the minimum wage debate it be uncanny as time have show the minimum wage have raise living standard in this country and it be something we be very proud to have implement we be look to bring more investment across the economy recent survey have show that business confidence be increase as a result of decision make by this labour government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my hon friend   the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross   make clear early the ons statistic be very clear few on payroll in may alone and few since the autumn budget as ukhospitality point out the nics change be 
 feel most intensely by foundational sector like hospitality 
 which necessitate an urgent review 
 my question to the minister be simple where will his red line sit how many more job have to come off payroll before the department for business and trade will stand up to the treasury on this another a where be the line 
 again it be interesting that those on the conservative front bench do not seem to be in agreement with their own leader any more about the national insurance hike i will just point out some statistic to the hon member the international monetary fund have predict that growth will increase this year and the lloyds business barometer find that business confidence be up we be put money back into people ’s pocket and invest in this country we be do thing that the conservatives fail to do for year and that be why they be out of power 
 what step his department be take to encourage small business to export 
 just last month we relaunche the board of trade to focus on the target support and help that small business need to take up opportunity from the uk ’s free trade agreement the recent trade deal with india the united states and the european union aim to reduce red tape improve custom process slash tariff and open new market for small exporter up and down the uk 
 small business like rezon in my constituency which make groundbreake brain protection sport headwear be work hard to grow and export but it be often hard to know where to get the right advice what practical support be the government give to small business to help they export and take full advantage of those trade deal 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for the opportunity to attend a wide range roundtable with local business in her constituency at the end of last year our new workshop introduction to export be in collaboration with the north east combine authority and be aim specifically at help local small business that be think about export to new market for the time a range of other support be available on the government website and that will be significantly improve as a result of the come business growth service 
 what step he be take to support high street business 
 we have announce plan to reform business rate launch high street rental auction power for council that will help business to access currently vacant property work with industry to open over banking hub and introduce the crime and policing bill to provide retailer with great protection from assault and shoplifting our forthcoming small and medium sized enterprise strategy will set out our further plan to help business on the high street and beyond 
 chester south and eddisbury be home to some truly special high street line with independent shop and pub that play a vital role in the life of our community i have speak to local business owner especially in hospitality who be already feel the pressure follow the spending review the chief executive of ukhospitality say that 
 the overwhelming challenge hold back hospitality from meet its potential be the current tax burden 
 do the minister accept that unless action be take to ease the burden on high street business especially in hospitality the government risk undermine the very community they claim to support 
 i say gently to the hon lady that when she have the conversation that she say she have with business in her constituency i be sure she point out the huge economic mess that this government inherit and the £ black hole in public finance   that be why the chancellor of the exchequer have to make some very difficult decision in last year ’s budget we have set out a series of plan that will make a genuine difference on our high street include new opportunity to persuade landlord to open up premise for rent we will set out further plan in the come small business strategy and our industrial strategy will also help to generate growth in high street and beyond 
 the town of burntwood in my constituency have a high street that have be struggle after year of neglect by the conservatives of the thing hold burntwood back be the lack of access to high street bank will the minister update we on what the department be do to support access to banking in our high street as a key pillar of drive the regeneration of high street like the in burntwood 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to focus on the need for face to face banking in community and high street up and down the country we be commit to work with the bank to roll out banking hub by the end of this parliament but we also think that the post office can do more to help to improve access to banking service on the particular issue in his constituency if it would be helpful i would be very happy to sit down and talk to he about what else he might be able to do to secure a banking hub for his constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the retail jobs alliance be very clear in its warning that the government ’s change to business rate will 
 accelerate the decline of high street reduce footfall and create a cycle of economic downturn 
 that letter be also sign by the union of shop distributive and allied workers a labour affiliate trade union once again the minister and the department for business and trade have a choice will they stand up for high street retailer actual employer and even their own affiliate trade union or will they just go along with treasury diktat 
 once upon a time the conservatives support business rate reform to help the high street the hon gentleman now seem to be shift his party ’s policy indeed time after time his government promise that they would reform business rate but of the reason they lose the confidence of british business at the last election be because they do not act to reform business rate we have say that we will introduce permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure the chancellor of the exchequer set out our initial thought on that in the budget in october and we will publish an update on where we be on that issue in the come month 
 we support business rate reform but when labour ’s own trade union say that its plan be not go to work ministers should really sit up and listen 
 let i turn to another issue affect our high street shoplifting which continue to devastate many high street retailer i see that in my own constituency in   high street in princes risborough wendover and great missenden how be the minister actively engage with the home office police and crime commissioner and police force to move shoplift up the agenda across the board just as my home force of thames valley have do with its disc scheme before he come back with police number let i tell he that there be more police in thames valley than ever before let alone since just talk the talk on number be not enough what be he go to do proactively to make this issue go up the agenda 
 i think the hon gentleman in his own way be congratulate the government on increase police number in his constituency and he be certainly right to do so we have commit to an extra police officer over the course of this financial year and a total of an extra by the end of this parliament we be also take action to end the immunity that his party introduce for shoplifter and take step to increase the power that the police have to take action when shoplifter and other be violent against retail staff 
 what step he be take to support small business 
 what step he be take to support small business 
 what step he be take to support small business in great grimsby and cleethorpes constituency 
 our small business strategy will be publish later this year and will set out our plan to champion entrepreneur improve access to finance and help small and medium sized enterprise to reach more market and adopt new technology as i allude to early we be develop our plan for our new business growth service simplify access to support and advice for small business we be also tackle the challenge of late payment include the introduction of a new fair payment code and upcoming legislation require large company to report annually on their payment performance 
 in aylesbury town centre we have some fantastic business from darlington ’s to the rockwood pub and nafees bakery they provide an amazing service to the community but with issue such as traffic parking and antisocial behaviour they can struggle to get customer into town and through their door i congratulate the minister on the work he be do but can he tell we more about how his small business strategy will support our high street and town centre like aylesbury to thrive 
 i very much enjoy my visit to my hon friend ’s constituency and the roundtable we have with some of the fantastic business there i very much hope that conservative control buckinghamshire council   will finally get its act together and sort out some of the traffic and parking issue she mention we will set out our plan to do more to help small business across the country include in aylesbury in our sme strategy particular measure that we will be able to take action on be to improve access to finance for small business follow the chancellor of the exchequer ’s significant increase in the capacity of the british business bank yesterday 
 small business on our high street across my constituency from earl ’s court road to queensway notting hill gate and portobello road be feed up of be blight by candy shop low grade souvenir shop harry potter shop and even barbershop with accusation of vat and business rate evasion and even link to money laundering and serious organise crime can the minister outline what step the department be take in conjunction with the minister responsible for high street his majesty ’s revenue and customs and the national crime agency to crack down on these operation and create a legitimate level playing field for our small business 
 i recognise that my hon friend have be very persistent on this issue and he be entirely right to be so we have be work with colleague in the home office and the national crime agency to take action to crack down on illegitimate business that threaten to undermine the legitimate one that exist on all of our high street in march the national economic crime centre co ordinate a week crackdown on barbershop and other cash intensive business where there be concern visit almost premise and secure freeze order over a series of bank account total more than £ 
 i thank the minister for his answer but i really do need to press he because my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes be as feed up as those of my hon friend   the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell   with see high street dominate by dodgy vape shop and unlicensed barber while some of those business be legitimate a recent bbc investigative report show that many be involve in money laundering and organised crime obviously the minister be aware of the situation but be he work closely with the home office to try to tackle this blight we probably need a national strategy not a week operation 
 my hon friend be right to say that this be not just an issue for our high street such as those mention by our hon friend   the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell but a concern up and down the country the national crime agency and home office colleague be seek to take action against illegitimate business and my hon friend will recognise that the announcement in yesterday ’s spending review of additional police officer with more to come over the spending review period will help we with that activity 
 if the book that   the hon member for central ayrshire alan gemmell   have write be a political thriller about fight for small business i be sure it feature hero on the government front bench do everything   they can to promote small business but reader will ask who be the villain of the piece be it not obvious that it be the chancellor of the exchequer who be do everything possible to undermine business with people have lose work since the autumn statement and in the month of may alone when will the ministers the hero of this story fight against the chancellor who be get so much so wrong 
 it be a little while since i have be call a hero by the right hon gentleman but i be glad that i have finally have some recognition from he i do not think that the chancellor of the exchequer be a villain at all indeed i think the spending review she announce yesterday will help to unlock investment in our high street and our small business up and down the country the record investment in research and development and in infrastructure and the additional capacity for the british business bank will help to unlock billion of pound of new investment and many more job opportunity across the country 
 charlotte from harpenden and her family run gatwards of the old family run jeweller in the uk it be a small business that have be there for so many year but it have be hit by the rise in national insurance contribution and change to business property relief and inheritance tax mean that it will shelve plan to hire staff and the premise be in peril will the minister work with the treasury to review the impact of these policy on small business and our high street 
 we will always work across government with the treasury to look at issue that affect business whether on the high street or beyond in the discussion the hon member have have with the particular business in her constituency i be sure she will have note our plan to reform business rate which will help many business in the retail hospitality and leisure sector she will also have note that more than of business will pay no business rate in the come year 
 lky7 sports be a small cycle and nutrition business in ashford in my constituency it have be hammer by the loss of small business rate relief and write to i yesterday say 
 the government say that they be help small business but this be a joke when our business rate have go from nothing to £ we be seriously consider close the shop down 
 what advice do the minister have for that boss 
 i be sure that the hon gentleman i say this gently to he will have explain to that particular business that we inherit a very difficult economic situation because of the decision that his party take include on tax but our small business strategy will set out more plan to help small business such as the in his constituency our business rate relief package will make a significant difference for retail hospitality and leisure interruption he ask when we will publish the small business strategy it will be shortly

 british bus manufacturer alexander dennis announce yesterday that it be consolidate its operation in the uk to its scarborough facility place job in falkirk at risk the company be warn about competitive imbalance the increase market share of chinese bus manufacturer and an absence of incentive for british build vehicle how be the government plan to support british bus manufacturer as part of our industrial strategy 
 this be a challenging and difficult time for the worker and their family at alexander dennis as well as for the local area as member would expect i have engage extensively with adl ’s senior executive alongside the secretary of state for scotland the department for transport and the minister of scotland to discuss what we can do to support we write jointly to the company offer to support it in any way we can there be many issue that we try to talk through with its representative bus manufacturing sit with the department for transport so it be take the lead but we be work together to do what we can 
 do the secretary of state and the minister agree that the industrial town and village that make up lanarkshire must be central to any modern industrial strategy will they meet i potentially in airdrie and shotts to hear more about the excellent skill and potential that exist throughout the constituency that could undoubtedly contribute to their and this government ’s ambitious work 
 of course our industrial strategy will speak to the whole country about the way that we be support business to grow and thrive we have identify growth drive sector as the arrowhead of growth but there be also policy that we believe will lift the whole country i would be delighted to meet my hon friend i congratulate he on the support that the local community show in the recent hamilton by election and look forward to talk to he far 
 as part of the government ’s industrial strategy will the minister and her colleague in the department for science innovation and technology carefully consider somerset ’s bid for an artificial intelligence growth zone its unique advantage the gravity local development order and its exist connection to the grid make it an ideal location to boost job and growth 
 we have very big ambition for ai and growth across the country and i be very happy to talk to the hon gentleman about his proposal i be sure that he have already talk to colleague in dsit but i be very happy to take this matter far 
 cyber security will be a key pillar in the industrial strategy that be welcome news in my constituency of cheltenham which be already a centre of excellence in the sector we be on the cusp of unlock £ worth of investment at the golden valley development in west cheltenham i know ministers be aware of that as be their colleague in many other department a planning application be expect very soon will ministers join i in urge the council the borough council and the county council to get on with it and unlock that investment which will bring growth to cheltenham and the nation and crucially support defence as well 
 as the hon gentleman will know we be do what we can to unlock the planning challenge that people have face for many year in a whole range of area we be introduce legislation to do that and make several change i obviously can not comment on specific planning proposal in his area but he should be reassure that we be do what we can to encourage growth 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we have be promise a modern industrial strategy for nearly a year it be go to be with we in the spring then it be go to be publish at the spending review and now it will be here shortly the industrial strategy seem to be a strategy to clobber industry with high taxis and high business rate will the modern industrial strategy have great longevity than the office for investment it be announce in october and we be not give an update until last thursday when it launch yesterday we be tell in the spending review that it be now be restructure what be the future for the office for investment 
 i can guarantee the hon lady that our industrial strategy will have a long shelf life than hers do i think it last month i be not entirely sure we forget because it do not have much of an impact we have work with all industry across the country to put together a comprehensive package that will make it easy to do business in the uk and support our city region and cluster across the country where we have excellent industry it will turbocharge the growth sector and it will make the government more agile in interact with business that be why we be reform the office for investment as we have always say we will it be now a significantly more substantial organisation and will give significantly more support the hon lady should look at 
 order i be really bother because we have only get to question and i still need to call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats welcome yesterday ’s announcement from the chancellor on investment in public infrastructure   project however the general secretary of the prospect trade union have warn that the uk lack the skilled worker require for the new defence and nuclear project outline by the chancellor similarly make uk and the federation of small businesses have highlight that a shortage of skilled worker would be a critical stumbling block for growth as we continue to await the much anticipate industrial strategy why be the government move funding away from level apprenticeship when we know that they support social mobility more broadly why do they not seize the opportunity in yesterday ’s statement to commit to fix the apprenticeship levy to ensure that money be invest in skill and training 
 forgive i for my long answer mr speaker but there be a lot to talk about in the industrial strategy and i like to talk about it the hon lady raise an important point there be a significant skill challenge and we will not shy away from it yesterday £ for skill be announce in the spending review we have announce £ for construction skill because that be a big issue for build the infrastructure that we need we know we need to go far and we be work closely with industry on how we can use the resource we have to recruit the welder engineer

 i congratulate the secretary of state on his excellent work the government ’s decision to suspend their trade negotiation with the israeli government last month be absolutely the right but some constituent have be in touch in confusion after trade envoy ian austin ’s visit still go ahead can the secretary of state affirm that this government ’s   position be that we will not be deepen our trade tie with the israeli government while the situation in gaza and the west bank remain so appalling 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question yes i can reaffirm that position as she say the foreign secretary announce on   may   that we have suspend negotiation on an upgrade free trade agreement with israel in response to the egregious action of the netanyahu government in gaza and the west bank of course the uk have exist business relationship with israel that be not affect by that decision and we maintain trade envoy with both israel and the palestinian territory what we all want be peace a state solution and a strong uk relationship with both state

 i understand the prominence of the issue in the right hon member ’s constituency we already import a significant amount of ethanol from the us tonne of bioethanol we recognise the competitive pressure that the us trade deal will bring it be obviously not yet in operation and have meet the company affect and continue to negotiate with they they be already very distressed and lose significant amount of money so what they really need be regulatory change from the department for transport for the market as a whole i can assure he that we be work on that 
 rusty ’s   collectables be a great new addition to redditch high street offer unique item such as pokémon and marvel collectable owners russell and amee have successfully move from online to the high street can the minister explain how the government will help more entrepreneur like they to turn great idea into high street business

 i thank my hon friend for her question she be absolutely right to raise it uk product safety law be clear all product must be safe before they be place on the market as she set out good sell via online marketplace be become a significant problem that be why we introduce the product regulation and metrology bill which will allow the introduction of clear obligation for e commerce business in order to ensure consumer safety and a level playing field we intend to consult on product safety requirement for online marketplace very shortly after royal assent 
 will the secretary of state accept an invitation to engage with the minister the deputy minister and trade union on the spirit negotiation a joint venture to safeguard northern ireland job at short brothers which will impact my constituent in strangford 
 i absolutely accept that invitation and i can tell the hon gentleman that we be already extremely involved as be the minister for industry we welcome what have happen with airbus but we be focus a great deal on the remainco and the issue there

 we have a wonderful visit about a year ago and i hope the pangbourne cheese shop be still go strong yes the regulatory burden on small business be a huge area of attention for this department there be the business growth service our action on late payment and our incentivising of digitisation and e invoicing 
 our farmer and grower can survive only if there be a function supply chain but since the creation of the groceries code adjudicator they complain bitterly about continue poor practice and the risk of de listing do the minister not agree that it be time to beef up this organisation and to amalgamate it with the agricultural supply chain adjudicator

 i thank my right hon friend and the select committee for all their work in this area he know my view from the evidence that i have give the significant increase in industrial energy price under the previous government be a significant issue for our competitiveness and yes that be something that we seek to address 
 when it come to bus manufacturer alexander dennis and the job at risk there there be not an elephant in the room there be a chinese dragon the company be in competition not with commercial organisation from china but with entity of the chinese state what representation will   the secretary of state make to the prime minister in an attempt to level a playing field that be currently about as flat as the galloway hill 
 i firmly agree with the hon gentleman that a level playing field be not just an economic necessity but a matter of economic security and production in western economy like our own of course if a company have a specific case to make it should make the representation to the trade remedies authority directly i have that power but it would usually come from industry if the company have a specific case to make the hon gentleman should encourage it to make that representation 
 it be fantastic to hear the government ’s commitment yesterday to make the uk a defence industrial superpower at its peak stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency produce of global defence and aerospace steel which be essential to our national security what work be the secretary of state do to secure stocksbridge speciality steels so that this valuable steel asset can be use to maintain our national security

 i be concern by the figure the hon gentleman raise if he write to i i will look into that immediately we have take extensive action to sanction not just individual but the shadow fleet as it be describe transport russian fossil fuel and be willing to take any action necessary 
 yesterday the dad shift campaign organise hundred of dad to come to parliament to campaign for well paternity leave do the secretary of state agree that well paternity leave can give dad more security to spend more time with their baby support the development of child and help gender balance in the workplace will he tell the house whether the issue will be cover in the upcoming parental leave review 
 i be sorry that i be not able to meet the dad shift campaigner yesterday although i have meet they previously i can assure they and the   house that the government be commit to ensure that parent receive the good possible support to balance their work and home life and we recognise that parental leave and pay entitlement play a key role in that we know that the leave system need improve which be why we be commit to conduct a review which will look at paternity leave and pay and the length of leave available to father and partner more detail on the review will be set out before the summer recess 
 the chief executive of ukhospitality estimate that there will be an extra £ of cost on employer for new workers—774,000 of they come in to the national insurance contribution regime on top of £ in other cost if by the next budget it turn out that the previous budget be crush the hospitality sector will the government consider tax relief in order to power our hospitality industry 
 the hon gentleman know the government and the treasury in particular monitor the impact of all taxation i have to be frank with colleague i have no idea what the conservatives be try to tell we today they seem to want more spending and low taxis it seem like liz truss be still hang around the party to be honest i have to ask member on the opposition benches what be your policy towards national insurance 
 i welcome the uk india trade deal which be good for salmon and good for whisky will the secretary of state use his muscle to ensure that a chain of small distillery in my constituency and across scotland can sell a wee dram to india as well as the big brand 
 mr speaker i would like to draw the house ’s attention to report of a crash on take off of a london bind air india flight from india today and allow the secretary of state to express our concern 
 it be very important and i think the leader of the house will make reference to it when we get to business question if we get there 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for update the house on that matter he will know that of the brilliant thing about the uk india deal be that it be not just for the high value iconic product we be all familiar with for bulk there be no minimum price in the deal the deal be incredibly strong for every bit of the whisky and gin industry in the united kingdom 
 i be alert to the news my hon friend have just share and colleague will update the house 
 greenergy a company base in immingham have be force to shut down and review some of its operation in the uk in part that be due to an influx of heavily subsidise hydro treat vegetable oil from the us will the secretary of state bear this in mind when he have trade negotiation with the us with a view to ease the situation 
 i shall of course take that up with the hon member i have spend a fair bit of time in his constituency as he know on matter or another on fair trade and level playing field colleague can direct their industry to the trade remedies authority if they have specific concern but of course we monitor those matter at a departmental level as well 
 since the global financial crisis list on the london stock exchange have fall by pose a significant barrier to growth as liquidity and investor activity decline what step be my right hon friend take to ensure that more british business be list on the london stock exchange and that the uk remain a lead global financial sector 
 that be an area of concern to we all we support and continue to implement some of the listing rule and prospective change of the previous government but the big change from this government be to liquidity particularly around pension reform none the less this remain an issue of key competitiveness for the united kingdom

 friday june the house will not be sit 
 as the house will know we have incoming news of a terrible disaster involve a flight out of ahmedabad in india i know that the leader of the house will want to say a few word but from the conservative benches i be sure that i speak for the whole house let i wish everyone involve and their family the very well 
 it would be a bad day this week if i do not mention the fantastic news of the knighthood of sir billy boston it be nice to be able to do that i hope you will admire my restraint mr speaker in not mention your birthday and therefore not give any incentive to any other member of the house to mention it in their remark either 
 i have the dubious pleasure as you do mr speaker of listen to yesterday ’s spending review in this chamber it bring to mind president abraham lincoln ’s immortal line about manage to compress the great number of word into the small amount of content i be afraid that the statement be somewhat bad than that it be in both its design and delivery an exercise in distraction and sleight of hand a document not of economic strategy but of political evasion 
 we should be clear from the outset that this be a spending review not a budget unlike a budget it be not subject to scrutiny by the office for budget   responsibility the chancellor ’s figure have therefore not be externally verify her assumption have not be stress test and her projection have not be independently review she be not require to publish the full fiscal implication or to give the embarrassing number in her own remark and of course she do not 
 even within the confine of departmental budget the presentation be i be afraid somewhat disingenuous a final year outside the actual spending review period be include fill with speculative figure design to suggest rigour and restraint in budgetary control this be the illusion of discipline without the reality of delivery in case any member be interested this be on page of the document elsewhere baseline figure be conveniently shift most comparison begin from the year not the current year which have the effect of inflate the apparent scale of any increase 
 sizewell c be a classic example the document trumpet a near increase in investment in truth spend over the period be fall by that be on page similarly on police funding the chancellor be very careful in her language to say that there would be an increase in police spending power but what she mean be that there would be an increase in the local authority precept in plain english a tax rise 
 the same obfuscation be at work with overseas development aid the chancellor have always say that oda cut be need to fund defence but the reality be that defence increase be almost entirely in capital spending while oda be a cash line far from fund our national defence what have actually happen be that overseas development aid have be cut to prop up other departments day to day budget 
 the most obvious case be defence spending we be tell in grand rhetoric that it would rise to and later of gdp at some undefined moment when fiscal circumstance allow in fact it be unlikely that even will be reach this parliament the quote include the single intelligence account which suggest that the number be below the defence investment plan the plan that will release the money be unlikely to appear until the end of the year that be nearly month after the general election this at a time of war in ukraine and with china potentially position itself for conflict over taiwan by 
 on monday nato secretary general mark rutte echo yesterday by no less than lord robertson say that unless nato member raise defence spending to with an additional in wide support we may as well start learn russian that be the strategic context the government ’s response have be to dither and delay 
 the chancellor ’s u turn over the winter fuel payment badly damage whatever credibility she ever have yesterday ’s statement have compound the problem for she and the government no mention be make of the estimate annual council tax increase now expect as flag by paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies no admission be make that the review will add £ in new borrowing that be an extra £ a year in interest payment at current rate by the end of the period meanwhile the suppose efficiency saving of nearly £ be widely regard as illusory 
 as the chancellor herself say about the spending review these be her choice but the truth be plain there will be a tax cut for the people of mauritius for the rest   of we the spending review be a gigantic speculative splurge of spending present via smoke and mirror which will end up as it always do with labour with high taxis and british taxpayer will have to bear the impact 
 i start by say that the thought of the whole house and the government will be with the family of those travel on flight ai171 from ahmedabad in india to london gatwick which have reportedly crash this be an unfold story and it will undoubtedly be cause a huge amount of worry and concern to the many family and community here and those wait for the arrival of their love one we send our deep sympathy and thought to all those family and the government will provide all the support that they can to those affect in india and in this country 
 i congratulate billy boston on receive a knighthood for his service to rugby league during your birthday week mr speaker i know that as a former patron of rugby league you feel very strongly indeed that it be about time rugby league be recognise in this way and you might want to mention that later 
 give that i know it be of great interest to the house i be pleased to update colleague on the ratification of the bbnj biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction oceans treaty our ocean be die and without urgent action they will be irreversibly destroy i be proud to confirm to the house today that this labour government will introduce legislation before the end of the year to ratify the high seas treaty and protect marine life around the world we be all shock by sir david attenborough ’s   film about the destruction cause by bottom trawling which this government will ban in protect british water 
 i be really happy as ever to debate   the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman   on the economy he use to be a treasury minister and he be well read he know i be sure what every economist in this country know which be that for many many year the uk economy have be define by low growth and stagnant living standard because of our comparatively low productivity that be because we have have year and year of under investment in our infrastructure in our service in our region and in our people this labour government be finally put that right with a year renewal plan to rebuild britain and address the productivity gap i be not sure whether the conservatives really understand basic economic because they be show no sign of it 
 in my part of the world and your mr speaker that have be particularly true town and city across the north and the midland have be hold back by woeful transport infrastructure that would be unacceptable to people in the south hold back by the lack of job opportunity near where they live hold back by poor insecure and costly housing hold back because they be not get the training and skill they need and hold back because their life chance be low as a result of deep seat inequality 
 that can not be address overnight and we be not pretend that it will be but we have a long term plan for renewal that include the big investment in affordable and social housing in year nuclear and renewable infrastructure transform community around the country the north finally get the rail connectivity   it deserve and every community get well bus school and hospital be be rebuild for the century base not on fictional budget and economic but on actual plan to deliver they we be address today ’s cost of living crisis too with our warm home plan to bring down bill by extend free school meal and free breakfast club with more free childcare with a cap on bus fare and by increase the wage of the low pay with wage go up more in the month of this labour government than they do in year of the conservative government finally we continue to boost the nhs which have already result in waiting list come down month after month 
 the right hon gentleman want to talk about choice so let we talk about those choice we would not have be able to set those thing out if we have not make the difficult change to taxis that we make in the budget last year he seem to want more spending for the police and defence i think that be what he be say but he do not want to make the hard decision about where the money will come from he mention yet again the of spending on defence which this government be deliver but he might want to remind himself of when defence spending reach in the last year be it in any of the year for which his government be in office no it be not it be only when labour be last in government that we reach the height of 
 in contrast to the conservatives fantasy economic yesterday ’s spending allocation be all within the envelope that we set out in the budget last year so we be really clear where the money be come from as ever their economic argument be utterly incoherent on the hand they say that we be spend too much and on the other that we be not spend even more on police and defence they criticise we on growth yet they do not want the investment to turbocharge our productivity and therefore our growth we be the party with a plan a plan to renew britain a plan to raise living standard in every part of the country a plan to get our public service back on their foot and a plan to give people the security they need in their home 
 to follow on from what the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house have say all our prayer and thought go to the family of the london bind aircraft that have crash let we hope there be well news to come on that 
 i be tempt by the leader of the house when she talk about the knighthood for sir billy boston i just hope that it will be like london bus and we will see further knighthood for rugby league i look forward to none more so than the news of sir kevin sinfield 
 let we try somebody from yorkshire i call jon trickett 
 i very much associate myself with your comment about kevin sinfield mr speaker who be a hero for the whole nation and a great role model 
 on the question of the north the leader of the house be right in the great northern town of featherstone there be increase irritation about the way in which the absentee and irresponsible owner of the former junction pub be allow it to deteriorate it be now in a dangerous condition and i fear that somebody will be badly hurt    the process of deal with dangerous structure be too long too bureaucratic and too cumbersome please may we have a debate in government time i think lot of members will have the same experience so we can share our experience and see whether the government can push thing forward 
 my hon friend be right to raise the difficult issue of the junction pub in his constituency we all hear those story time and again we want to give local community more power to have the right to acquire such facility and for those power to be exercise more quickly than they currently be we be bring forward legislation in that regard but he might want to club together with other to get a debate on the issue 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i echo the thought and sympathy that have be send to all those involve in the air india crash that be be report i know that many british citizen will be affect and our thought be with they 
 i recently join essex police on a ride along in my chelmsford constituency to witness at hand its vital work in our local community to keep we all safe worryingly essex police have regularly raise with i that the national funding formula know as the police allocation formula be outdated and unfair the funding that essex police receive fall far short of the proportion of policing carry out by the force in a national context yesterday ’s spending review do nothing to change that or to remove concern about police funding overall indeed the chairman of the national police chiefs council say that in real term the increase in funding 
 will cover little more than annual inflationary pay increase for officer and staff 
 he add that 
 the amount fall far short of what be require to maintain our exist workforce 
 if we want to keep crime off our street and retain the experienced officer who do such vital work to keep we safe surely we must give they the funding to match yesterday ’s spending review do not do that will the leader of the house therefore raise those issue with both the treasury and the home office 
 i thank the hon lady for express her thought on the india crash as well 
 she raise an important issue about adequate police funding all our constituent want to see more police on the street and crime in their community come down this government be commit to more visible police on the street and to increase neighbourhood police number by yesterday ’s spending review announce an above inflation increase in police funding of which we believe be an adequate settlement for the police the hon lady be right however that we need to bring forward reform to make sure that we have well distribution of funding and that we can have efficiency saving on police procurement and other issue we will as be our commitment bring forward legislation in that regard in due course 
 i welcome the new banking hub in penistone which i visit this week however other part of my constituency remain a banking desert the stocksbridge and deepcar townswomen ’s guild raise the urgent need for a hub in stocksbridge and we desperately need in chapeltown too otherwise my constituent have to trek all the way to the centre of sheffield to have cash access and to receive in person advice from their bank will the leader of the house advise i on how i can secure those essential grassroot financial service for those area in my constituency

 may i send my thought to the hon gentleman ’s constituent when i hear of the crash i think of he know the demographic of his constituency if any of his constituent need help and support the foreign office the authority and the government here stand ready to support they i thank he for announce future back bench business particularly the estimate day which be important debate in the calendar year 
 i be sorry to hear about the attack on young boy innocently play cricket in the hon gentleman ’s constituency he raise these issue time and again in the house i be sure the whole house will join i in send the clear and strong message that we absolutely stand against any kind of sectarian religious hate or violence like that and that we will take whatever step necessary to eradicate it 
 we have day of debate on the crime and policing bill next week there be further measure in that bill in relation to attack on place of worship and on memorial which would include religious memorial i recognise that the hon gentleman want further action on these issue so if he do not get a chance to raise they with the home secretary next week i will raise they for he

 the government have pledge to enhance the record of the previous conservative government and uphold animal   welfare retained european regulation currently prohibit the handling of chicken by their leg but in their act of animal welfare the government be propose to pass regulation to permit that harmful practice will the leader of the house ask the agriculture minister to write to i and place a copy of the letter in the library to explain why the government be choose to lower the legal standard rather than to uphold the law and protect animal welfare 
 that be a bad example 
 the government be commit to introduce the most ambitious programme of animal welfare in a generation i be not aware of the particular regulation that the right hon gentleman mention but i will ensure that he get a full response from the minister and that it be make available for everybody else 
 government datum release last year show that homeschooling figure have double since although i wholeheartedly welcome the measure in the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill to ensure that all child be safe many parent in my constituency actively and positively choose to home educate their child and it be safe and reasonable for they to do so on behalf of her cabinet colleague will the leader of the house reassure home educate parent in my constituency and across the uk who be do a fantastic job of educate their child that the bill will safeguard educational freedom and honour the incredibly positive impact that parent can have on their child ’s development will she consider a debate on the merit of alternative form of education 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the issue of homeschooling she be right to say that many family provide high quality and important education for their child where it be not available to they in the mainstream i be sure that she will agree that we must tackle absenteeism in school which be particularly rife since covid and that we need to get more child back into mainstream education although child be home- school for good reason some be not safe at home and we must take step to deal with that 
 this weekend with the team from my parliamentary office i will be take part in the knaresborough bed race a fantastic local community event to raise money for knaresborough town afc will the leader of the house congratulate in advance all those who take part and hopefully finish as well as the organiser of the event and will she consider a debate in government time on unique and culturally important sporting event 
 i be not quite sure that i understand what that race be but it sound very unique to knaresborough and i will take an interest now that the hon gentleman have raise it with i that would make a good topic for a debate 
 yesterday ’s spending review see this government invest in national renewal to truly deliver on that it be vital that small town such as those in my constituency fully feel the benefit we need local investment strategy to   address the thing that hold our area back such as a lack of a commuter rail link in rossendale or overreliance on a single road in darwen these solution be inevitably unique to an area require investment plan that be locally lead but nationally back small town like mine need to be at the heart of our national renewal so will the leader of the house agree to a debate in government time on that vital subject 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as i say early the lack of investment in many of our northern town and city have really hold those community back i be well aware of the challenge in rossendale and darwen and how much his constituency could flourish if it have well rail and road connectivity and i look forward to work with he on that 
 may i remind the leader of the house that when i refer to the prayer table by my right hon friend the leader of the opposition against the mauritius treaty in early day motion she be unable to give an undertaking that this will be debate within the day period lay down by the constitutional reform and governance act

 every single year the horse fair come to mountsorrel and my constituency i have no doubt that the vast majority come to enjoy it but there be always report of antisocial behaviour harassment and business and home be damage it be unacceptable and that antisocial behaviour be incredibly damaging i call on everyone who come this year to do so in a way that be enjoyable but peaceful will the leader of the house set out what this government be do to address crime and antisocial behaviour in my community 
 i join my hon friend in hop that everybody who go to the horse fair in his constituency do so for the right reason and because they want to celebrate that event rather than to cause criminality or antisocial behaviour i be sure we all recognise that we want to take step to clamp down on antisocial behaviour and give the police more power to do that and that be what our crime and policing bill will do i hope that everything pass off well for his constituent 
 the leader of the house will be aware that queen ’s hospital in romford which serve the borough of havering barking and   dagenham and of redbridge be in urgent need of an a&e upgrade indeed i meet the minister for secondary care only this week to discuss it may we have an urgent statement from the government on this issue the situation have lead to many patient be leave on trolley for more than hour the hospital serve people in that radius and that be simply not acceptable please can some of the money from the statement yesterday be spend in romford on a hospital that serve local people
