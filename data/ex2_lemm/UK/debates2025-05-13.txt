the minister raise the important issue of the cost of living give the dire economic impact of brexit include food inflation be time high than it would otherwise have be and the cost of leave the european union amount to £ an hour in accord to datum from the office for national statistics do he agree with i that it make total economic sense for the uk and the people in it to use next week ’s summit to start discussion with the eu on what the process of rejoin might be and the timing for that 
 many people may still be find thing a little bit gloomy and challenging as a result of the mess leave by the previous government as i be after month of be a member of parliament but today i be incredibly heartened it be probably the happy day i have spend in the house yet because we have a real opportunity to be hopeful and positive about the future of this country the ideology and chaos that have cause so much damage with the conservative government run frit from the reform party have now give way to a party that be pragmatic and have prove itself to be competent 
 i would love at this stage to congratulate the government on their tremendous securing of trade deal with india and the usa i be look forward to the hat trick where we secure a trade deal with the european union that be even big and well than either of those and all in the british interest 
 what be absolutely clear to i everybody know this in the labour party and it run through everything the prime minister have say be that this country need growth over the last year service have be decimate every time the new government open a cupboard we find it bare we have to rebuild our public service and the swift way to get growth in the economy be by have a good trade deal with the european union nothing will guarantee swifter growth for the economy 
 i find it very hard to take anything that the conservatives say with any degree of seriousness what be their explanation for why after year public service be on their knee and we have see a collapse in the economy we even hear a conservative front bencher   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say that there have be growth since leave the european union despite brexit even the conservatives admit that it be a disaster 
 nothing will deliver the growth that this country need fast than sign a good deal with the european union slash red tape and reduce regulation with the big market on our doorstep open up market kick start growth boost export and investment and reduce price at home this prize would be welcome by anyone who be not a crazy ideologue we on the   government side be not crazy ideologue or prisoner of our past or of a television programme from the past the action that the conservatives take while in government have damage the british people 
 business across the country and in chelsea and fulham want we to get a good deal from the european union people in my constituency do not want we to rejoin the eu and i be not talk about rejoin they would like we still to be in it and they think it have do they damage the importer of wine in my constituency who have to pay £ for every consignment he now bring in would like we still to be in the eu and to not have to face that but they do not want we to spend the next year renegotiate the deal 
 oh it be sarcasm 
 as i be say i be very pleased as many be with the government for be cool headed and have a common sense approach we be go to reset our relationship with the european union and put britain put britain have to also mean put our young people so i be excite by the opportunity for young people in my constituency and every constituency to take advantage of a time limit control visa base youth system which we already have with a dozen country 
 i can tell the right hon gentleman what people in chelsea and fulham really want they do not want a prime minister like the last a business prime minister who say that we would level up to help people across the country but then do nothing about it what they want be a prime minister who will    invest in increase skill and apprenticeship right across the country as ours say yesterday that he will that be what we need and that be what we be get now 
 iran be now produce roughly significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every week that be time above the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action the deal that we strike with iran which i have in front of i i be really crystal clear about this iran must never develop a nuclear weapon it must reverse its escalation we have see that in its enrichment programme it must not carry out any critical weaponisation work and these term have to be fully verifiable unless we get that we will see a snapback of the sanction regime that we strike with it year ago 
 the right hon lady be right on   may counter terrorism police arrest individual include iranian national as part of separate police investigation of course the minister responsible for the middle east my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer have speak to the israeli ambassador as i say on   march   we put iran on the foreign influence registration   scheme we keep proscription under review we be fully engage with our e3 partner and we be very pleased that germany now have a government so that we can work with they together on the jcpoa and snapback and of course we be speak to steve witkoff 
 reading oppose and defer until   tuesday may   standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what discussion he have have with his israeli counterpart on the entry of aid and food supply into gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to support people impact by the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 aid must be restore to gaza it should never be use as a political tool and israel be bind under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid the uk have jointly call an urgent session of the un security council this afternoon to address the dire situation in gaza 
 the current intentional blockade of food water and medicine by the israeli government be prevent life sustain supply from reach thousand of child who the minister know be most vulnerable to malnutrition and premature death save the children estimate that over child be suffer what decisive action be the government take beyond the e3 statement to make it clear to the government of israel that their siege in gaza must end immediately   and that a humanitarian aid system can not be replace with a military control will he consider sanction and the cessation of arm and rule out any trade deal as child should not pay the price for the inaction of the international community 
 my hon friend be right to raise the plight of child in gaza and indeed all those suffer from the lack of aid and the continued conflict this government have be clear that the ceasefire must be restore since the e3 statement which she mention we have take the decision jointly with our partner to call an urgent session of the un security council give the gravity of the situation 
 the loom famine in gaza be not a natural disaster it be a direct result of the deterioration of the ceasefire agreement it be deeply concern that this be put the entire population of gaza at critical risk of food insecurity and potential famine can the minister assure i that this government be support every possible opportunity to get vital resource and humanitarian aid into the region 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance we be do everything we can to ensure that aid get in that hostage be release that hamas be no long in charge of gaza and that we get the ceasefire and path to a state solution that we so desperately need 
 the un ’s philippe lazzarini be right be n’t he to say today that israel be commit a massive atrocity by block aid to the child of gaza as well as the urgent need for aid the palestinian people need more trade with country like the uk will the minister explain how my constituent in rochdale   can buy more palestinian good such as olive oil herb and date and support tech company and the many co operative that operate in the west bank and in gaza 
 i know that rochdale be the home of the co operative movement in this country and that there be many co operative in the occupied palestinian territories as well on   april we sign a memorandum of understanding with the palestinian authority that include pursue further co operation in exactly the area he describe include economic development and trade 
 gaza face imminent famine due to the israeli government ’s blockade and over people face catastrophic hunger level what action be the uk government take to lift the blockade and secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to gaza 
 this government have a clear position on the vital importance of aid return to gaza that be why we be call an urgent session of the un security council this afternoon it be why the foreign secretary have make these point repeatedly and clearly to his israeli counterpart as indeed have i. 
 how long will the uk walk by on the other side as palestinian child bleed and starve to death be it not time that this government and indeed his majesty ’s loyal opposition show that they be supportive of israel but that that   support do not necessarily mean they be supportive of a particular government in this case the racist brutal regime of netanyahu 
 let we not forget what this government have do we restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency after the conservatives freeze it we suspend arm export licence whereas the conservatives do not take action we have provide £ in humanitarian assistance to the occupied palestinian territories we be not on the other side of the road i welcome the right hon member ’s strong view on this i find his intervention last week very powerful indeed there be no on the labour benches who do not understand the gravity of the situation that be why we invite the palestinian prime minister why we sign the memorandum of understanding and why we be call an urgent session of the security council this government will not be on the other side of the road from palestinian suffering 
 last week the united nations issue a report describe the situation in gaza as 
 of the most ostentatious and merciless manifestation of the desecration of human life and dignity 
 the government have always insist that it be not for they but for the court to determine what be and what be not a genocide but the minister will know that the genocide convention also put a legal obligation on state to act to prevent a genocide do he believe that the uk have fulfil its legal obligation under that convention to prevent a genocide in gaza 
 as i say to   the right hon member for the wrekin mark pritchard we be take action not just rhetoric but action to try to address the situation in gaza that include call the security council to an urgent session this afternoon alongside our partner we will continue to take the action that we think be need to ensure that the people of gaza get what   they need 
 we hear about the action that the government be take but unfortunately none of they be lead to the prevention of the starvation and killing of innocent civilian the late number which be only an estimate show that over child have die of starvation accord to official record we do not know how many have die but have not yet be record there be step that the government have not take i welcome the aid but when it stand on the other side of a crossing and can not get to the people who need it it be useless some or month ago aid be airdrop into gaza why be the government not airdrop aid or provide it by sea and will they condemn the bombing on   may   of the freedom flotilla which go to provide aid 
 as i think the house know i be familiar with the impediment to get aid into gaza i go to the gaza egypt border to see the restriction for myself we have make these point in public and in private and we will continue to do so we be talk to our jordanian partner and other many in the region understandably have real concern about the lack of aid   get in although we be consider with jordan and other what the alternative may be i must be plain with the house there be no alternative to a land route if aid be to get in at the scale that be require so we must be clear with the israeli government and all partner in the region that open those crossing be critical 
 mr lazzarini have say that child in gaza be more likely to die of starvation than of an act of violence what do my hon friend expect from this afternoon ’s session at the un what specifically will be ask for that would move the situation on israel can not be allow to continue use food as a weapon of war 
 i think i be clear about the government ’s expectation in my previous answer those expectation be ground in israel ’s international legal obligation ultimately this be a week of diplomacy the president of the united states will be in the region and we will raise these issue in the security council i hope that diplomacy will be able to make progress towards a ceasefire and the restoration of aid 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 gaza have be starve of humanitarian aid for over day now minister have repeatedly express their disappointment but there be no evidence that the israeli government be listen or have any intention of reopen the supply route in march the foreign secretary withdraw his assessment that the blockade be a breach of international law will the minister state how many day the blockade must continue before the government recognise it as a breach of international law to make clear the uk ’s support for palestine ’s right to self determination and opposition to the extremist policy of annexation by force will the government commit to work with france towards the joint recognition of the state of palestine at the conference next month 
 the foreign secretary have be clear repeatedly as have all ministers from the dispatch box that it be the long stand policy of british government that we do not make legal determination we make an assessment when we arrive that there be a real risk of serious breach of international humanitarian law and that continue to be our finding give the event that many in this house have rightly raise we continue to make those assessment and include all those event in they 
 on the french saudi conference in june we continue to talk with all our partner as i say in my previous answer this be a period for diplomacy a ceasefire be desperately need and it be diplomacy that will get we through to the next stage 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the situation in kashmir 
 the uk welcome the commitment make by india and pakistan   to pause any further military action give our strong and close relationship with both country the uk stand ready to work with both side to make a lasting ceasefire a reality 
 on saturday i meet constituent in bury north with deep family root in pakistan and azad kashmir include relative in mirpur kotli bhimber lahore and gujrat there be grow anxiety within this community in bury about the potential for the conflict to escalate once again while i praise the effort of the british government in secure a ceasefire give the uk ’s historic tie to the region will the foreign secretary assure the house that the government will continue their diplomatic effort and dialogue to ensure last peace include the vital protection of water access under the indus water treaty which must not be weaponise in any escalation 
 we do recognise and understand that the situation in india and pakistan be deeply unsettling for over british national who stem from those country with which we have deep relationship i have speak to my indian and pakistani counterpart time since this crisis begin and i stay in close touch with secretary of state rubio and my counterpart in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in particular nation that have relationship with both country we will do all we can and we encourage both india and pakistan to maintain their commitment to hard win area of diplomatic co operation such as the indus water treaty 
 follow the terrorist attack on   april india and pakistan engage in military activity and india hit terrorist basis now that there be a fragile peace which be still be negotiate today what effort be the foreign secretary make to ensure that the terrorist basis be remove from pakistan occupy kashmir 
 let i be clear that the horrendous terrorism we saw—26 national strip and shoot be horrific and we condemn it we will continue to work with close partner to deal with this terrorist threat the hon gentleman be right all of we have to lean in and ensure that we be support effort on both side to deal with horrendous terrorism that be what in the end will maintain an endure peace 
 the reality remain that the international community have fail   to act on the plight of the kashmiris for over decade from the revocation of article and 35a strip jammu and kashmir of its special status to the mass arrest and political repression in of the   most militarised zone in the world the attack on kashmiri human right and civil liberty be intolerable if we be serious about human right and long term peace and stability in the region the central issue of kashmir can not be ignore any long and must   now get the attention it deserve will the secretary of state today reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the birthright to self determination of the son and daughter of kashmir 
 let i once again condemn the terrorism we see that begin this crisis and remind the house that since there have be conflict and war between these great country the long stand position of the uk be that it be for india and pakistan to find a last resolution to the situation in kashmir take into account of course as my hon friend suggest the wish of the kashmiri people 
 my constituent in woking particularly those of indian and pakistani descent welcome the ceasefire will the foreign secretary urge both country to accept that the solution to the kashmir question be self determination not further violence 
 as i have say it be absolutely for india and pakistan to find a last resolution to the situation in kashmir and of course it must in the end take into account the wish of the kashmiri people but all of we have a responsibility to condemn terrorism wherever it occur innocent people be strip and shoot be intolerable and of course we condemn it 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 we all welcome the easing of tension between india and pakistan over the weekend and our thought continue to be with those affect by this shocking terrorist atrocity the house will be aware of the ongoing presence of terrorist infrastructure in pakistan and that should be a concern for all of we last week at the dispatch box the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs   the hon member for lincoln mr falconer comment that he have hold discussion with his pakistani counterpart on this very issue what further discussion have take place to secure commitment from the pakistani government that they will dismantle terrorist infrastructure and what role will britain play in support the removal of terrorist threat within pakistan because that be what will improve stability and security in the region 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady and may i share my reflection over the last few day we do need proper communication between india and pakistan and that must happen not just on military channel but on political channel she will recognise that on this occasion those communication be poor we do need confidence building measure and to ensure that we be deal with terrorism where it act and of course the united kingdom will lean in to that above all we need dialogue the international community can play a role particularly where country have relation with both country that be why we have be talk to the united states that be why we have be talk to saudi and that be why we be work with the uae 
 what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on the policy of the us administration on iran 
 what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on the policy of the us administration on iran 
 the uk be supportive of us effort to reach a nuclear deal with iran we have encourage iran to engage with president trump ’s effort in good faith and to find a diplomatic solution since the beginning of may i have raise iran with us secretary of state marco rubio and the special envoy to the middle east steve witkoff we have discuss the range of threat that iran pose to the uk and our partner 
 the islamic revolutionary guards corps be the terrorism export wing of the despotic regime in tehran why be we not join the americans in proscribe this organisation when we do proscribe the wagner organisation in russia be it possibly because the americans be pressure we to continue our tenuous diplomatic link with tehran 
 i remind the hon gentleman that on   march   the uk specify iran under the foreign influence registration scheme which target those who undertake malign activity in the uk of course we keep proscription under review we be look closely at the area of state threat that be traditionally very different from the sort of cell and terrorist community that we do proscribe that be why the government continue to look at this area very carefully 
 our united kingdom and the united states be align in the view that a nuclear armed iran would pose a serious threat to global stability with nuclear negotiation currently under way between the us and iran can the secretary of state inform the house what outcome his department would consider to be a success from a british perspective crucially do he have a contingency plan if those talk fail to produce an acceptable result 
 iran be now produce roughly significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every week that be time above the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action the deal that we strike with iran which i have in front of me.[official report   may vol c. 7wc correction i be really crystal clear about this iran must never develop a nuclear weapon it must reverse its escalation we have see that in its enrichment programme it must not carry out any critical weaponisation work and these term have to be fully verifiable unless we get that we will see a snapback of the sanction regime that we strike with it year ago 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 the regime in tehran be responsible for so much of the appalling bloodshed and conflict in the middle east it pose a direct threat to britain and on british soil as we have see from the recent arrest of iranian national in counter terrorism operation have the foreign secretary summon the iranian ambassador to express concern and to explain what have be go on on british soil what discussion   have take place with our ally in addition to the nuclear talk that he have just refer to what be the position of our partner in the region on the very specific threat that iran be pose and demonstrate with its dissident on uk soil when will the government come forward with a comprehensive and clear strategy on deal with iran 
 the right hon lady be right on   may counter terrorism police arrest individual include iranian national as part of separate police investigation of course the minister responsible for the middle east my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer have speak to the israeli ambassador.[official report   may vol c. 8wc correction as i say on   march   we put iran on the foreign influence registration   scheme we keep proscription under review we be fully engage with our e3 partner and we be very pleased that germany now have a government so that we can work with they together on the jcpoa and snapback and of course we be speak to steve witkoff 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of allocate of humanitarian aid to educational programme 
 the uk be a principled humanitarian donor we prioritise give humanitarian assistance to people in great need which include protect the most vulnerable by support access to education in emergency and crisis decision on future budget be subject to the ongoing spending review and resource allocation process 
 accord to the education and development forum plan cut to the official development assistance budget could slash uk aid for education by more than by compare with level in gaza where of school be damage and child go without formal education uk back programme will be vital in restore hope provide stability and equip child with the skill to rebuild do the minister agree that education aid must be protect particularly in crisis response such as in gaza 
 as the prime minister set out the uk will continue to play a lead humanitarian role include in gaza where child must be allow to return to school in safety through our global funding the uk enable thousand of child to gain access to essential education service support recovery from the trauma of war and building skill and hope for the future 
 in the past the minister have speak very positively about education what assessment have be make of the potential progress that could be make in reduce youth radicalisation by allocate aid to education programme as we have witness over the year a number of young people be brainwash online by extremist group 
 we have an excellent programme call education can not wait which in provide £ in emergency response grant cover not just the educational need but the psychosocial need of those affect by conflict and trauma 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we know that education can make a real difference to a girl ’s life chance which be why the last conservative government commit to ensure that every girl have access to quality education however we will now be spend less on development so can the minister give clarity on the commitment that the government be make to support woman and girl over the next few year which programme will be keep and which will be cut and how much will be invest in those programme 
 the foreign commonwealth and development office ’s humanitarian framework set out our long term approach through policy priority provide humanitarian assistance for those in great need protect people at risk in conflict and crisis and prevent and anticipate future shock and building resilience when it come to build resilience the people most at risk be often woman and young girl who fail to have access to education the index of educational attainment will be the basis on which many of these decision be make 
 whether his department plan to introduce a statutory right to consular assistance 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on introduce a statutory right to consular assistance 
 we be committed to strengthen support for british national abroad include introduce a right to consular assistance in case of human right violation the department be consider a package of measure which we will announce in due course alongside option for stakeholder consultation 
 every year an estimate british citizen be arrest abroad many of they under false pretence many be use as hostage and deny access to legal representation and their family be leave without information not know what have happen to they high profile case at the moment include those of alaa abd el fattah in egypt and of jagtar singh johal in india none of these people have an automatic right to support as be the case with other country such as the united states so can the minister give we more detail about exactly what the consular assistance will be and whether it will be automatic for everyone 
 the safety and security of british national overseas be a top priority for the government this be a complex area of policy the hon lady have describe   the wide range of different consular case that the foreign office respond to from kidnap case to more routine case as i set out to the foreign affairs committee give the complexity of these issue we will come back to parliament in due course with option for consultation 
 i remind the government that their manifesto promise a legal right to consular assistance in case of human right violation the government have now be in power for close on a year this be not something that should take a big shove surely we should do it straight away surely such assistance should be a legal right people include ryan cornelius and jimmy lai be still be hold ryan cornelius have be hold illegally for year which the un have criticise as a human right violation for age we do not send anybody to see he surely now we must act and call out these regime the place to start be by give those people the absolute right to consular assistance 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and his commitment to these issue be it only so that pass a right in this place would secure the release of the people whose case have be raise in every case that have be mention by the right hon gentleman and by   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine the people concern do receive consular assistance i have meet the family of ryan cornelius and alaa abd el fattah they both remain very much in our mind it be important that we get the right correct these be complex case and we be bind not just by what we decide in parliament but by the relevant convention and diplomatic norm we will take action to try to preserve the safety of british national overseas but it be right that we take our time to ensure that we get it correct 
 it be at time of crisis that british national abroad need consular service the most i share many of my constituent concern about the violence in india pakistan and kashmir include those of a year old boy who contact i yesterday about his aunt and uncle who be strand in pakistan as be of my lovely neighbour although airspace have now be open what step be the minister take to ensure that all british resident have access to consular service and be able to return to the uk as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be a doughty champion for her constituent include at all hour throughout the weekend and i recognise her commitment and the commitment of many other in this house the foreign secretary set out in a dear colleague letter the detail for ensure that mp be able to contact the foreign office in a timely way and i encourage all those watch at home to sign up to our travel advice and to keep watch it carefully 
 british citizen deny consular access be jimmy lai who face life in prison for exercise the right guarantee to he under the joint declaration between the united kingdom and china my hon friend will have see report that america intend to raise the case of jimmy lai during    its recent talk with china in geneva what step can the government take to capitalise on america ’s renew interest in his case so that we can secure his freedom 
 we continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivate prosecution and release jimmy lai immediately as my hon friend would expect i will not comment overmuch on the action of other state but i will say that the prime minister have raise this matter directly with the relevant authority as have the foreign secretary the chancellor and many other 
 what diplomatic step his department be take to support ukraine 
 last week i travel with european partner to lviv at the invitation of ukraine ’s foreign minister and yesterday i host for the time in london foreign ministers from the weimar+ group of key european ally to discuss our joint effort to strengthen european security and secure a just and last peace in ukraine 
 last weekend the prime minister say that the uk would do all that it could to support ukraine if that be the case why do the government continue to prevaricate over seize billion of pound in frozen asset hold in uk bank which could be use to build ukraine defence the long we delay the more likely it be that those fund will become wrap up in other negotiation and we will lose the chance altogether 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the issue but it be not an issue on which the government should act unilaterally it be a multilateral issue on which we should act with our g7 partner and our european partner recognise that some partner in europe be hugely expose the good way in which to move forward be to pool those asset and discussion on that be ongoing 
 the yale university humanitarian research lab be do incredible work in track the ukraine child who have be steal by russia but then become a victim of the cut be make by the department of government efficiency follow international outrage its work be preserve and give a reprieve for week a period that end on   may can my right hon friend reassure the house that the datum collect by the university have be secure and transfer to europol or that its funding be secure for the long term 
 i thank my hon friend for continually raise this matter we be an active member of the international coalition for the return of ukrainian children and we fund the bring kids back ua and save ukraine campaign we have raise this issue internationally and i be proud to have work on it with mrs zelensky i will write to the hon lady as soon as i can to update she on the funding 
 the sustainable success of ukraine and its self defence hinge very much on the appetite of the president of the united states of america what step be the foreign secretary his ministers and his official take to ensure that the president remain committed to defend the territorial integrity of not just his own nation but all nation and will the foreign secretary ensure that the white house understand that allow an aggressor to prosper in this case will encourage other aggressor to invade their neighbour in the future 
 i be grateful for the experience and the strength with which the right hon gentleman have speak he will have note that the prime minister be in kyiv recently with president zelensky and other european partner and that they engage with president trump there we welcome the desire to secure an endure peace but it seem to i that engage in those talk will require a ceasefire it be putin who be prevaricate it be putin who be obfuscate and we must call that out with our long experience of scrutinise that particular individual 
 we all hope the moot peace talk between russia and ukraine on end russia ’s illegal invasion take place as quickly as possible to stop the killing and save life accountability be important so will the foreign secretary outline his position on russian war crime and on how justice can be do 
 i be very pleased to be with other european foreign ministers in lviv to support the special tribunal and be crystal clear that those who have prosecute this war must attest and be accountable for their action 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 ukrainians continue bravely to resist russia ’s war machine yet president trump continue to indulge in the fantasy that putin be serious about peace the uk need to maintain clear leadership in the face of trump ’s unreliability in the foreign secretary ’s response to i in march he say that the uk want to pursue the seizure of frozen russian asset but that belgium and germany be blocker i listen carefully to the answer he give to my hon friend   the member for horsham john milne and he speak about multilateralism what conversation on this issue have he have with his counterpart in belgium and germany since march and when will the point come when the uk show leadership call time and lead from the front by seize russian asset 
 i have have detailed talk with my belgian counterpart not just at foreign minister level but technical talk that have involve our official i know that the hon gentleman understand multilateralism he will recognise that the new german government have only be in power for a matter of day i be able to discuss this issue yesterday with my german counterpart but with all grace i be allow he to spend some time get into the detail of the issue 
 what progress he have make on ratify the agreement under the united nations convention on the law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of area beyond national jurisdiction 
 as the foreign secretary say in his kew lecture we be completely committed to ratify the marine biological diversity of area beyond national jurisdiction agreement primary legislation be require to give effect to our obligation under the agreement and legislation to implement the agreement will be introduce as soon as the legislative timetable allow 
 the uk have lead world class conservation effort and this government have rightly commit to the landmark high seas treaty but we must act now as without ratification the uk risk lose its place in shape this vital treaty ’s implementation and future direction can the minister confirm when legislation to ratify the agreement will be introduce or provide a clear timetable if we want to stay at the table we must claim our seat 
 my hon friend be quite right to push the government on this issue and the fcdo will redouble our effort in this place to make sure that we do the necessary work to conclude the legal process 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the uk be a world leader in protect marine environment particularly around the british overseas territories but tragically that reputation will be trash when labour surrender to mauritius of the most important marine protect area around the british indian ocean territory while mauritian fishery ministers have be pledge to issue fishing and trawl licence for those water labour ministers have give no assurance about future protection and have just make vague comment on work with mauritius on a new mpa can the minister state if the propose treaty will have any guarantee protection in place will she confirm what be say in a legal letter to british chagossians that their right of return be not guarantee surely that would be a total betrayal 
 i thank the shadow minister for his question follow the trip that he and i do together when we be both on the foreign affairs committee i be sure he be aware that the marine protect area will continue and that the environment have be at the heart of the negotiation indeed he must remember that because when he be the chair of the chagos islands all party parliamentary group he begin the debate with the mauritians so i be sure he be in a very good position to ask any further question that he may like to ask of the mauritians 
 which development programme he plan to maintain funding for after the plan reduction of the official development assistance budget in 
 this government be resolutely commit to development but we recognise that we must do it differently we will ensure that the aid budget deliver value for money and have impact globally support and grow economy will be at the heart of how we spend oda go forward and further decision on the oda budget include specific programme be subject to the spending review and resource allocation process 
 these severely constrain budget call for thinking smarter not simply small so what work be the government do with the world bank and other international institution to make sure that uk development spend be fully leveraged so that every penny be as effective as possible 
 the right hon member raise a very important point and we of course continue to engage closely with our partner at the world bank and other multilateral development institution multilateral co operation allow a global scale of investment and delivery that outstrip what country can achieve alone we be also look at other way include through the important work of british international investment and other body so we be go to look across the board and multilaterally to increase our impact 
 the international development gender equality act say the government must have due regard to spend aid in a way that contribute to gender equality follow on from the early question will the minister confirm that support woman and girl be a ministerial priority and that we will continue fund vital programme that support woman and girl in many area 
 it certainly be and woman and girl will remain at the heart of our programming i can assure my hon friend that equality impact assessment be an essential part of how we make decision on oda allocation indeed minister chapman will be appear before the international development committee later today and i think she will be set out our approach to the equality impact assessment and other process 
 will the minister ensure that britain properly replenish gavi the vaccine alliance a brilliant programme that have benefit so much from british leadership as well as taxpayer money when make his decision on how big that replenishment should be will he remember that the polling show that of our constituent think this be a brilliant use of taxpayer money and that we should support it

 in many way that question be well put to president trump and i do not want to speak for he none the less i be pleased that the united kingdom be the country to strike a trade agreement with the united states many international partner be now ring we up to ask we how we do it 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee

 we will redouble our effort to get into the legislative queue and do all that be necessary to maintain our leadership in this important area 
 today we welcome the release of edan alexander the late hostage free by hamas after over day in captivity the fact that they still have people in captivity be disgraceful and barbaric and put into perspective the fact that the group kneecap be be platforme in croydon after they shout support for hamas from a stage what pressure be the government put on the palestinian authority to ensure that the remain hostage be return to their family as they should be they should never have be take in the place

 it be not often in this house that we recognise a former civil servant but before we proceed to the next business i would like to pay tribute to sir roy stone who die yesterday it feel far too soon give that he only retire from his role as principal private secretary to the government chief whip in a role he hold for more than year serve chief whip and in turn this office with great distinction work in no before he join the whips office roy serve every prime minister from margaret thatcher to boris johnson he be virtually invisible outside this place but those who be involve in this tricky business of keep the parliamentary machinery run smoothly all know he well 
 roy be despite the sometimes fearsome reputation of the whips office a kind and generous man loyal to his principle as well as to his political master he be highly respected and hold in great affection by those in the civil service and with whom he work closely there be many member and staff in all part of both houses who work with he and benefit from his advice and guidance i know that they will be deeply sadden by this news as we know the usual channel be not something we ever discuss that just show the great man we be talk about i be sure the whole house will wish to join i in send our condolence to roy ’s family his wife dawn daughter hannah and son elliott 
 on a point of order mr speaker it be by convention unusual for the government chief whip to address the house it be also by convention forbid to refer by name to those who hold the office of principal private secretary to the government chief whip it be a measure of sir roy ’s service that today we lie those convention aside 
 sir roy be the literal embodiment of the usual channel for more than decade ensure each day that while the government get their business the opposition be able to scrutinise their work as i look back on what be on occasion tumultuous time in this place sir roy be with skill and integrity the constant that hold thing together trust be place in he and his wise counsel be seek over many year 
 i send my deep condolence on behalf of the government to his family friend and the many staff who work with he such be sir roy stone ’s diligence and long service that could be forgive for think that work be his main concern but i know from speak to he that his main priority be always his family of whom he be tremendously proud they should be equally proud of he my thought be with they at this difficult time 
 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 far to that point of order mr speaker you have say much that be true and good and it be hard to improve on what you say as well as the chief whip but may i add a few word roy stone go into the civil   service at the age of and serve his entire life there and in this house chief whips across extraordinary moment be the beneficiary of his sage counsel and advice 
 i think the house will be aware that there be several occasion on which i be able to benefit from his advice in somewhat tumultuous time have offend various senior politician i do not always get a meeting with the chief whip with coffee as hon member know that be the key test but sir roy and his team be the model of professional expertise diligence discretion care and candid advice throughout the fact that he have be take from we so quickly so prematurely and so early into his long deserve retirement be i be sure a source of the utmost sadness for every member of this house i be sure that i speak for all member of his majesty ’s opposition we will remember he with great fondness for a very long time 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i have to admit to shed a tear last night when i hear the news of sir roy ’s pass within month of join the house in i become the chief whip of a small group of and he treat i and my party with the utmost respect he be the person to refer to i as chief”—sadly my family have not pick up that term which show the respect he have for the house mps and the party they represent 
 i value his counsel we sometimes take the daily business for grant but it be testament to the work of the usual channel and the government whips office that we end up with the business and debate we have in this place 
 my right hon friend   the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   be sit with i when sir roy leave his role and the house in we take he for dinner at the liberal club i will just say that the club ’s standard of service be exactly what my right hon friend and i expect they to be i will say no more   on that 
 sir roy be the epitome of the good of the civil service we have good conversation but it be fair to say that no confidence be betray i be very sadden to hear of his loss my thought and my party ’s thought be with his family 
 far to that point of order mr speaker in his role in the usual channel sir roy stone have a unique influence in this place as we have hear work for decade for the government chief whip and the leader of the opposition provide advice to both and protect the confidence of both but answer honestly to each those in the usual channel hold the only role in government that mean work for both the government and the opposition roy manage the whips offices for both the british public see adversarial politic and party in this chamber but for decade roy and his team organise and co ordinated legislation debate recess statement and urgent question and manage the relationship between the party woe betide any chief whip who try to change roy ’s recess schedule which be almost always in tandem with the kent school holiday break 
 every political science course in the country should have dedicate module on the usual channel and sir roy stone roy ’s dominance of this behind the scene role make he of the most impactful and consequential civil servant of his time despite be fair to all side he be political to his core not least during the hung parliament and brexit during that time he be passionate about and focus on support the government to deliver on the referendum and be increasingly frustrated with us politician and in particular i for fail to deliver a meaningful vote 
 roy love his central role in this place and have the respect if not always the agreement of everyone politician and civil servant alike despite all the stress and strain in that most demanding period of parliamentary history which be when i work with he what shine out be the love for and commitment to his family his brother who be ill with cancer during the brexit year and his wife dawn and child hannah and elliott in particular there be pride in elliott ’s commitment to the raf in which he be a cadet and of which he be now a full time member a patriot at work a patriot at home rest in peace sir roy stone 
 far to that point of order mr speaker roy be political to his core he love this place more than anyone could possibly imagine he regularly get quite frustrated with government and prime ministers i will always remember arrive at the office on my day as chief whip and see his look of frustration and irritation which say who on earth have they send i now he ’s never be in the whips office 
 i remember roy sit i down and explain that he work for i of the time and for the opposition the other i want he to shift the dial a little more in my favour but he be never go to do that i ask he rather naively what i should read and whether it be worth pick up erskine may he look at i and say chief only strange people and clerk read erskine may yet there be a not a page in erskine may that he do not know 
 roy start as an apprentice in the ministry of defence work his way through to no downing street and get briefing ready for prime ministers and then go into the whips office all that equip he to understand raw politic as anyone who have be chief whip will know it be deputy not chief whips who whip their party chief whips have to manage the prime minister and the cabinet they be there to save the government from do incredibly stupid thing to themselves every single day or that be the case in my day i have a feeling that might not have change that much 
 i would sometimes come into the office and roy ’s eye would roll he have hear the news about the late decision emanating from no yet he would always sit down talk through the problem and give solution a potential way out of the awful mess that you find yourself in i particularly recall the day after the general election for those who be not here it have not go quite as well as we have hop i arrive at the beautiful chief whips office in downing street and roy who be as good with his anglo saxon word as any man i will not say the word he use but it rhyme with clucking”—said well you cluck screw   that up do n’t you what be you go to do at the time the prime minister be in shock and not really do an awful lot and it fall to the whips office to work out how we take thing forward sit down with roy to work thing out be essential to our put together a deal with the democratic unionist party a deal that make sure that   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   do not have the opportunity to form a government in or since 
 roy live and breathe politic but also care about nothing more than his family i would hear he talk with such pride about his daughter at university and about his son whom he take to countless event relate to swimming and then to the raf altogether roy be a good friend just a few week ago i be sit down with he have a cup of coffee and talk about his family we talk about the difficult time but also the amazing time he will be so miss 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i want to pass on the sincere condolence of the scottish national party to the family and friend of roy stone and i really hope that they take comfort from today ’s proceeding we speak of roy in such term not just because we respect he but because we like he he be a likeable guy who be great company and such fun to be with 
 i will never forget the kindness that roy show i as a new member of this house and as a recently instal chief whip who do not have a clue about house business or procedure he patiently run through how the house work get a lesson from roy stone on parliamentary procedure be something that i will never forget i be represent a group of and roy have time for we all the snp finally get access to the usual channel when we become the party in the house and i be able to observe how effectively he do his work i will never be in government unlike other who be pay tribute today but i see how seamlessly roy be able to serve government of different hue and how the ship of state sail on under his stewardship and command roy be the absolute epitome of public service and commitment to this house which he love and we will all miss he dearly 
 far to that point of order mr speaker thank you for allow this quite exceptional but fitting tribute which i be sure will give some comfort to sir roy ’s wife dawn and his child hannah and elliott it be my privilege to work with sir roy during the and a half year of the coalition government coalition government have never be do in this country in modern peacetime the coalition require service to not party but in government and for sir roy it be a time of change and challenge but they be all challenge that he take impeccably in his stride there be many anecdote that i could tell you mr speaker but unfortunately too many of those who be involve be still alive and there be limit to how far can push parliamentary privilege 
 the genius of sir roy stone be that he never betray any personal political view that be how he be able to serve government of all stripe the dignity of parliament and of the business of government really matter to he there be only occasion when i   see sir roy ’s mask slip it be the early day of the coalition government the liberal democrat whips office be in the business of babysitting and on this occasion it involve an actual baby it be not the normal babysitting that the whips office be call on to do inevitably as happen with baby there be a need for a nappy to be change i take the baby i think it be jenny willott ’s son toby into my office and i have lay he on the sofa and be change his nappy when sir roy stone appear in the doorway glimpse at his face tell i that this scene realise his bad fear about have liberal democrats in government 
 sir roy care about both government and parliament and be able to serve both require very distinctive and particular talent it be a privilege to work with he and to have the benefit of those talent for those who mourn he especially his family the recognition of those talent should be an endure comfort 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i know sir roy stone when i become leader of my group after the general election he do in fact pass view on the chief whips of the time but i think they be probably well keep to myself for now because some of they be in the chamber he be immensely supportive and as the leader of a very small group i learn so much from he it be the time that the group have have meeting with the chief whip i speak on behalf of a small party and sir roy ’s respect for parliament and for the presence of small party in it be evident he feel that we have a role to play and he enable we to play that role very effectively 
 my last memory of sir roy be from just after he leave a member of staff fflur elin could play the harp sir roy find that out and nothing would do but for fflur to bring in say harp to play for he it have be an honour to know he and people ’s recollection of he today tell i that he have immense influence on all of we here 
 far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the democratic unionist party i want to convey to the family of sir roy stone our deep condolence at this time of tragedy and grief to serve under a number of prime ministers and chief whips be no easy task but he be always fair and impartial he contribute loyally and with great wisdom i would not like to say anything against any of the chief whips in my party but i have probably challenge they all and to be perfectly honest i probably still do sir roy ’s advice be much seek after and liberally give he set a standard for other to follow and to admire from a distance it be always good to cite the bible at these time he have run the race he have fight the good fight and there be many crown lay up for he in heaven thank you sir roy and god bless all the family at this time 
 these really have be fitting tribute to sir roy stone he will always be in our thought and memory because of what he do for this house i know that the clerks feel the same way 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if she will make a statement on the mansion house accord 
 mr speaker i would like to associate myself with your tribute and those of other member to sir roy stone who be a true public servant and a servant of this house 
 pension matter they underpin not just the retirement that we all look forward to but the investment on which our future prosperity depend this morning workplace pension scheme provider between they manage about of active saver define contribution pension sign the mansion house accord the accord be propose and develop by the industry specifically by the lord mayor the pensions and lifetime savings association and the association of british insurers and build on the work of the former chancellor   the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt who be in his place 
 signatory to the accord have pledge to invest of their main default fund in private asset by these be productive asset that boost the economy such as infrastructure at least will be for uk asset this investment could support well outcome for saver and deliver growth finance to britain ’s world lead science and technology business it could also support clean energy development across the country deliver great energy security and job 
 the shift towards great investment in private asset be a journey that the sector be already on because everyone recognise that uk define contribution scheme stand out relative to their international peer for how little they invest in those area this be right for saver because it be in their interest for pension fund to hold a diverse range of asset and it be in britain ’s interest this government want to see high investment level in the uk we can not continue with the low business investment in the g7 as we manage under the previous administration supply of capital be part of that and today ’s agreement be expect to release £ of additional investment into the uk economy by but so be the supply of project to invest in the pipeline our job as a government be to support the depth and visibility of that pipeline and that be why we be get this country build once again 
 the accord be an industry lead agreement nevertheless i hugely welcome it the pension industry ’s decision to invest in more productive asset from grow company to infrastructure will support well outcome for saver and fast growth for britain in the come week the government will publish the conclusion of the pension investment review to support the move to big and well pension scheme we will implement the review ’s reform and other to improve return for saver in the forthcoming pension scheme bill which i look forward to present to the house 
 may i start by associate myself with the very fine tribute make to sir roy stone my condolence go to his family 
 no response from the chancellor we see but i thank the minister for his statement the retirement income of million of uk saver rely on the careful management of pension fund those pension provider have a fiduciary duty to act in the good financial interest of their member we on the conservative benches support effort to ensure pension fund be invest in asset that can both increase uk productivity and growth and deliver strong stable return for investor and saver indeed that be the purpose of the mansion house compact which be broker by the last conservative government 
 as we well know labour ministers have a habit of think they know well what to do with other people ’s money but it should ultimately be the responsibility of the provider which have be entrust by saver with their money to make investment decision report that the government intend to take new power to mandate pension fund to allocate minimum amount to specific class of asset should be a matter of great concern to this house can the minister confirm whether the government intend to take such legislative power in the pension bill later this year if he can not rule out make such a move can he explain what it would mean for the exist fiduciary duty set out in legislation 
 major player in the industry include scottish widow have reportedly refuse to take part in the late iteration of the mansion house compact can the hon gentleman explain to the house why that be what discussion he and other ministers have have with scottish widow and other that have choose not to take part and what concern they have raise 
 let i be clear we on the conservative benches want a pension industry that be invest in grow uk business infrastructure housing and all those element that drive a healthy economy but it also have to be for the benefit of saver of course the risk in this case would be bear entirely by private sector worker while public sector worker would be protect finally we be clear that pension saving should never be there to dig a chancellor out of the economic hole that she have make 
 i will directly address question and then come to the overall tone of the shadow chancellor ’s remark there have be a debate across this house and in the wide industry about mandation include on uk equity it have be lead by conservative peer in the house of lords baroness altmann have call for exactly that and by some member in this house include   the right hon member for salisbury john glen   on the conservative benches what we be set out a voluntary agreement lead by the industry on the industry consensus behind the accord of the define contribution industry by active saver have sign up this morning and all provider include those that do not sign up today be commit to the idea of more investment in private asset 
 more generally the shadow chancellor ’s tone be disappointing the truth be that he be a lonely figure there be a wide consensus about the direction of travel to invest more in private asset as canadian and australian pension fund do and today ’s accord be industry lead it set benchmark agree by the industry and in fact many industry player want to go far there should be cross party consensus at the event this morning the chancellor spell out that this work build on the work   of her predecessor in support the mansion house compact the shadow chancellor will remember that compact because it be sign under a conservative government when he be the work and pensions secretary he be in the press release champion it he be right then and he be let himself down now 
 i have some news a response to the accord have just come in from guy opperman hon member will remember he because he be the conservative former member for hexham and the only pensions minister in the last government to last more than minute he be in post for year what do he say about this morning ’s accord he say that it be a good thing and should be welcomed”—he be not wrong 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund the point about fiduciary duty have be make give that fund manager will need time to pool together fund that reflect the government ’s wish and the voluntary accord when do the minister expect it to kick in at that point might he consider mandation 
 the decision by the industry reflect the question that the chair of the select committee raise about pace of change be that the target for asset allocation be for 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 liberal democrats cautiously welcome the response from the minister clearly ensure that people have a good return on their investment be essential but we welcome this step change where we be look at investment within the united kingdom within the appropriate parameter would the minister unpick for we what core lesson he have learn from australia and canada which have already embark on this path also it have long be a long term investment opportunity for many in the pension industry to invest in rental opportunity how can we drive the opportunity in the social rent sector through the accord 
 finally the minister rightly talk about a pipeline of opportunity our fear be that these might only be large opportunity such as the redevelopment of an airport when many of our community be worry by the collapse of our town centre there could be bucket of opportunity highlight there which could be drive by appropriate investment through source like this 
 it be characteristically bold of the liberal democrats to cautiously welcome these measure however the hon member be right to raise the question of australia and canada we look across at place with similar pension scheme to those in the uk and the level of private asset allocation in those scheme be far high than we see here in the uk so he be absolutely right on that front 
 on the specific point the hon member raise i agree on investment in the social rent sector many of our pension fund be already do that and i know   that other major one will be make announcement in that area in the month ahead he also raise the breadth of investment opportunity he be absolutely right that there be large national level project but there be also many more local project where those be finance by the private sector pension scheme may want to look at they as well 
 will the minister spell out how this deal provide real change for constituent across the country and what it mean for infrastructure project especially housing 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there be no way that britain can return to growth unless it start invest in its future again rather than live in its past which be if we be honest what we have be do in recent year this be part of a much wide story i hope that there be cross party consensus there be certainly consensus across the pension industry and among most economist who look at the uk economy that we need to move to a high investment level the finance for that be thing some come from abroad and some come in domestically but it also need to come from our pension scheme 
 obviously it be for the public sector to play its part but we should be careful in distinguish this the government be do our bit on public investment level with £ extra of public investment compare with the plan inherit from the conservative government that be do a lot of the work to move we to the high investment equilibrium but there be lot of project and in the end most investment happen in the private sector that be where i welcome the progress make by the pension industry today 
 i thank the minister for build on the work of the mansion house reform that i introduce year ago westminster work well when government do not automatically tear up the work of their predecessor who know with this constructive attitude we may see some tax cut in the autumn budget 
 do the minister agree that there be a circularity in the argument that the reason pension fund do not invest in the uk be because return be low here in australia and america the stock market can depend on more than of pension fund asset invest domestically to create big return compare with just in the uk do he agree that if we be really to make these reform fly we will need to involve the define benefit scheme as well as the define contribution scheme 
 that be more like it that be what we want to hear from the conservatives the right hon gentleman rightly say that progress be make under the previous administration i have make that clear and the chancellor make that very clear this morning as i say i have discuss with many lead member of the pension industry the fact that we be explicitly build on the progress that the right hon gentleman make rather than throw any baby out with the bathwater even after they have have their nappy change by the previous lib dem chief whip   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael 
 i very grateful to   the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt   for the tone of his question he be also right to highlight the lack of uk bias in some of our pension scheme we see that right across asset class and it be not in the interest of the country in the long term as he know the focus today be on private asset but we do need to think more broadly what be we all after we be after well function capital market both public and private and these reform will make a big difference in that regard i be not say that there be not more to be do i be sure that there be and that he will continue to play an active part in those debate 
 the science innovation and technology committee inquiry into the innovation and growth of the region have repeatedly hear evidence that the lack of access to investment particularly outside london and the south east be a barrier to scale up our fantastic science and tech start up so i welcome the commitment to put more of our pension and saving into the productive economy and i be rather surprised by the response of the shadow chancellor will the minister say a little more about how these commitment will support growth through innovation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right she have long talk about both the issue that she raise the regional balance of investment and the ability of grow firm to get hold of growth finance the latter be a long stand problem in the uk economy and today ’s accord will help to address it although we talk about private asset and investment help with infrastructure it be also about provide growth capital to a wide range of firm obviously the onus be on we and private asset manager to provide way for pension fund to direct capital those be often small ticket item and pension fund will need they to be aggregate up to a high level that be exactly the work of the british business bank which i know she have engage with through the select committee on both point she be right 
 undoubtedly the city of london be not in the good possible place when it come to where it be invest and the amount invest in uk equity when i be a minister we have the hill review the kent review the austin review and the capital market review everything be do to seek to open up the city to more initial public offering and more momentum this systemic undervaluing of uk equity and therefore the lack of investment in they need to be set alongside the fact that billion of pound of taxpayer money be use to enrich the size of pension scheme through tax relief i urge the minister to continue engage with the city i welcome the voluntary commitment give but we must come to the point where the risk aversion of db scheme be call out consider the amount of taxpayer money that be effectively go into they will the minister continue to look carefully at the option available give that the previous government seek and his government will no doubt continue to seek to meet they wherever possible 
 i always enjoy discuss these thing with the right hon member as we have do over recent month he offer a recognition of the challenge   face the country and in focus on what we can do to start change thing he take a much well position than that adopt by his front benchers
