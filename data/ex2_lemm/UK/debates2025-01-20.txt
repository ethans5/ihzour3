 more seriously on the phasing of the programme we have take an approach that ensure that we can stand up and look his constituent and other in the eye and say that we have an affordable programme that can be deliver accord to the timetable that be set out i know people will be disappoint by the length of time it will take and i be genuinely sorry that they be lead up the garden path by our predecessor that be why we have take an approach that say that honesty be the good policy we would rather be up front about the length of time and in the meantime ensure we be deliver the investment and reform need to reduce waiting time and improve primary community and social care service so even as work continue to prepare for the royal berkshire hospital scheme his constituent and other across berkshire will begin to experience an improve nhs under labour as oppose to the broken they experience under the conservatives 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what plan she have to support council with house building target 
 the government be support local planning authority to facilitate the delivery of more high quality well design home but we know that capacity be a problem with council and that be why we have also announce a £ package of investment to support capacity and capability in local planning authority include new planner and support to local authority with deliver their local plan and green belt review we will also make change to planning fee so that council can recover the cost of planning application 
 in waverley and east hampshire housing target from this government be double when my constituent move into those home when they be build the infrastructure and service be simply not there by service i do not mean a phalanx of civil servant to help they move house i mean the school play area supermarket and road network will the secretary of state come to my constituency of farnham and bordon to see where we need that infrastructure so that she can understand the implication that her housing target have for my community 
 we know that we need infrastructure as part of our planning reform and the mandatory housing target that we have put forward and this government will make sure that that infrastructure be there i would say to the hon gentleman that it be his government who allow speculative housing development who fail to meet their housing target and who leave people without the house they desperately need 
 we have a number of scheme for social housing in cornwall that rely on the affordable home programme that end in can the secretary of state confirm that there will not be a gap in the provision of funding so that the provision of those home can continue 
 we have set out another £ for the affordable home programme and we will set out further requirement as we get to the spending review 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the increase in housing delivery that the secretary of state be commit to require a uplift across the board in housing number yet accord to the house of commons library urban and major conurbation have see an increase of while mainly rural area be see an average increase of how be that fair 
 the shadow secretary of state will know that our mandatory housing target be base on affordability and be introduce to ensure that people be able to get the house they desperately need his government remove the mandatory housing target we see speculative development and they fail year on year to deliver the housing that this country desperately need we be go to deliver the house where they fail 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of abolish residential leasehold 
 what step she be take to ensure that not for profit freeholder be accountable for their management practice 
 by the end of this parliament this labour government will have finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end on   november i make a detailed write ministerial statement set out how the government intend to honour that manifesto commitment include the step we will take to implement reform to the system already in statute 
 every week my constituent in poole many of whom be retire contact i with their concern about the leasehold property they live in they be worried about excessive service charge unfair ground rent and exit and event fee can the minister reassure they and i that the government will tackle those problem once and for all and will do so as a matter of priority 
 i sympathise with the plight of my hon friend ’s constituent with regard to service charge in particular we know that opaque and unaffordable charge be put leaseholder and tenant across the country under immense strain the government be   commit to improve service charge transparency and make it easy to challenge unreasonable increase in the come month we intend to consult on how the provision in the leasehold and freehold reform act relate to service charge and legal cost should be enact with a view to bring those measure into force as quickly as possible thereafter 
 many of my constituent can not afford to buy their freehold under the current leasehold legislation when do the minister think the legislation to ensure that leaseholder can enfranchise easy cheap and quick will come into force 
 i fully appreciate the desire of my hon friend ’s constituent to take advantage of the provision in the act that will make it cheap and easy for exist leaseholder in house and flat to buy their freehold unfortunately we discover on assume office that the previous government have pass the act with a number of specific but serious flaw that prevent certain provision include those relate to enfranchisement valuation from operate as intend we need to fix those flaw through primary legislation and we intend to do so at the early possible opportunity 
 early this month together with about labour mp i meet the manage director of firstport i raise the case of year old tom who live in a retirement complex in bingley in my constituency like many of the resident whose story we share he have be hit by extortionate service charge that have rise way above inflation do the minister agree that strong regulation of manage agent be need to protect pensioner like tom and other in leasehold flat from unaffordable housing cost 
 we be very much aware that some manage agent provide a very poor quality of service to people like tom and leaseholder across the country manage agent play a key role in the maintenance of multi occupancy building and freehold estate and their importance will only grow as we transition towards a commonhold future as such we have make it clear that we will strengthen the regulation of manage agent to drive up the standard of their service and we be consider carefully the recommendation make in lord best ’s report on regulate the property agent sector 
 resident of a housing development in maidenhead buy their property year ago on year lease now they be come to sell their flat they be face with a charge of £ to £ each to extend their lease so that the new owner can get a mortgage what will the minister do directly to help those resident 
 in term of lease extension there be provision in the act that will provide some assistance to the hon gentleman ’s constituent as with other part of that act those provision in many case require a detailed programme of secondary legislation in some specific circumstance we can not switch on the provision until we have make the fix through primary legislation that i refer to in answer to a previous question but we be work at pace i be more than happy to have a conversation with he about what we be do in this area 
 resident live in mytchett heath a retirement community in my constituency have report the regular and repeat withholding of invoice excessive insurance charge and £ worth of maintenance without any support rationale all of this add up to a increase in service charge since what be the minister do to ensure that not for profit company such as cognatum estates which be to be very clear not a social landlord be hold to account will he accede to a meeting with i and resident of mytchett heath and other cognatum leaseholder to understand the challenge and anxiety they face 
 in addition to the measure i have set out we intend to proceed with implement the service charge transparency provision of the act so that resident in all tenure can more easily challenge unreasonable increase i think complaint about not for profit freeholder can be make to the housing ombudsman i be more than happy to hear more from the hon gentleman about the particular circumstance of this case and give he further advice 
 i thank the minister for his reassurance to leaseholder but what message do he have for freeholder such as the resident of the wolds view development in driffield who be trap at the mercy of an unaccountable management company will he legislate to protect not just future homeowner but those currently stick in these contract 
 we be determined to end the injustice of fleecehold entirely and we will consult next year on legislative and policy option to reduce the prevalence of such arrangement we remain committed to protect residential freeholder on exist estate from unfair charge similar to my previous answer we need to implement the act ’s new consumer protection provision and bring those measure into force as quickly as possible that be our intention 
 if she will make it her policy to introduce a new planning use class for home 
 the government recognise that excessive concentration of home impact on the availability and affordability of home for local resident to buy and rent as well as on local service from april council will be able to charge a council tax premium of up to on home but as the hon gentleman will know we do not think this be enough we be consider what additional power we might give local authority to enable they to well respond to the pressure they face 
 i be encourage by the minister ’s reply town and community in my constituency such as coniston hawkshead pooley bridge and a whole range of other beautiful place have so many home that up to of property be not live in for most of the year mean that the very survival of those community be under serious threat the government have do a number of thing include talk about   short term let be a separate category of planning use however will the minister agree to look at also make home a separate category of planning use so that we can prevent these beautiful place from become ghost town 
 as the hon gentleman will know the previous government consult on make short term let a different use class but do not consult on home become a use class as part of our wide consideration about the additional power we might give local authority i be more than happy to have a conversation with he i understand that the pressure in his part of the world be particularly acute because of both home and short term let 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the uk share prosperity fund on local community in northern ireland 
 the uk share prosperity fund support people business and community across northern ireland and be an important part of this government ’s local growth funding the department be commit to evaluate the impact of the fund include in northern ireland the ukspf evaluation strategy be a publicly available document set out our approach and the department be commit to publish ongoing evaluation finding as they become available 
 the voluntary and community sector in northern ireland have say that the reduction in share prosperity funding available in the next financial year couple with the increase in employer national insurance contribution present a perfect storm at a time when even more be be ask of it will the minister agree to meet i member of the northern ireland council for voluntary action and representative of the voluntary and community sector to discuss those issue 
 we inherit a situation in which the previous government have not make any money available for that work i have no doubt that the transition year create significant challenge for local organisation i have visit the hon gentleman in south antrim before and meet representative of some organisation and i would be delighted to do so again 
 meur ra mr speaker cornwall ’s allocation from the share prosperity fund be good news and well need the government be rework the outcome for the share prosperity grant and council such as cornwall be await the memorandum of understanding for the grant before they can make agreement with provider ongoing scheme need certainty as employee with month notice period be rely on the contract and the old spf scheme expire on   march will the secretary of state confirm 
 order that must obviously be connect to northern ireland when we look at it 
 i know that local authority from northern ireland to cornwall be interested to know their allocation information about which be make available to they in recent week and that some have concern about make spending commitment the money be there and have be commit but my official be work they have have conversation directly about cornwall to ensure that local authority have the confidence to make those commitment so that we do not see day redundancy notice 
 what step she be take to support local authority on use high street rental auction to help regenerate town centre 
 i be very excited that high street rental auction be capture the imagination of local community and colleague in this place a common view for all of we be that vacant shop be a blight and that high street rental auction be a great tool with which to tackle they we be work with some early adopter but i encourage all local authority to come forward and be active in this space as of   january we have make a £ fund available to support the delivery of those power across the country 
 crewe town centre in my constituency be in desperate need of new year new i for too long we simply have not have the tool at a local level to tackle the irresponsible absent landlord preside over empty shop unit for example the old m&s unit be own by an absent landlord who have leave that crucial anchor unit in our town centre to go to rack and ruin will the minister meet i to discuss how we can remove the obstacle to bring that crucial unit back into use 
 i be sad to hear about crewe ’s experience but i know it be share up and down the country crewe have a proud record in the retail space and i believe it can have that again but as my hon friend say the right tool and power must be assemble to make that happen i would be very happy to meet he he be slightly unkind because he know that crewe town centre be the site of my big personal and professional embarrassment some year ago provide i be still allow back in i will very gladly meet my hon friend 
 rickmansworth high street in my constituency be a thriving hub for the community support by its fantastic local business have speak to many of those dedicated business owner i know the challenge they face what step be the minister take to support local authority in deliver initiative such as high street rental auction to help high street like the in rickmansworth 
 we be aware that with new responsibility for local authority come new cost local authority want to spend their money as effectively as possible so we have make £ available include to the hon gentleman ’s local authority to ensure that they have the capacity to make these power a reality 
 what step her department be take to help improve housing standard in the private rented sector 
 we will deliver on our promise to transform the life of million of renter through our landmark renters rights bill which will make renting fair more secure and more affordable by ban no fault eviction end bidding war and extend awaab ’s law to protect private tenant i be sure my hon friend will agree that it be disgraceful that the tories decide to play politic last week and try to vote down this vital bill which would have deny renter the protection they deserve 
 recent datum show that of private rent sector property in blackpool have damp or mould leave tenant to suffer unacceptable condition i welcome the renters rights bill which will introduce a decent standard for home in the private rented sector what step be the department take to ensure that council have the resource they need to enforce those standard 
 i be sorry to hear of the experience of many of my hon friend ’s constituent most private landlord provide a good service to their tenant but for the few landlord who fail to take reasonably practicable step to keep their property free from serious hazard local council will be able to issue fine of up to £ that will allow local council to target their enforcement effectively on the small minority of irresponsible and criminal landlord 
 late last year bradenham parish council in my constituency contact i concern that the national trust which own a high number of rental property in the village be leave they empty and not put in new tenant to avoid the burden that the government be place on landlord do the secretary state agree that there be a balance to be strike here and what advice can she give area such as bradenham which face be an empty village 
 the government have take action we will ensure that empty home be bring back into use we make no apology for ask that home be of a decent and safe standard people should be able to live in their home without the risk of hazard that be dangerous to their health 
 in my constituency of the big challenge for the private rent sector be the need to house family who be in temporary accommodation it be very often a year tenancy sometimes it be long such family really should not be in these sort of home which be often overcrowded lead to damp and mould whatever the good intention of the local authority that house they in order to improve standard across the board will my right hon friend pledge to ensure that we be push for much need affordable social rent housing so that those tenant can move into it and other private tenant can move into these home which will then be improve 
 my hon friend be right child and family be in temporary accommodation at christmas we need to build the social and council home that we desperately need so that people have a home for life and stop local authority spend huge sum of money on temporary accommodation that do not help the life chance of those young people 
 during the last parliament i visit a family in stanton hill in ashfield who live in a private rent property it be disgraceful the property have damp electrical problem and flooding not only be the property cover by the landlord licensing scheme the landlord be the leader of ashfield district council will the secretary of state please remind council leader that if they or their councillor rent out private property they should be hold to a high standard 
 the hon gentleman highlight an issue across the board we do not have decent home standard we want to introduce they in not just the social rent sector but the private rented sector we have see far too many situation where tenant be too frightened to come forward with mould damp and health issue in their property we have to ensure that those standard be uphold it do not matter who it be or where it be people should have safe secure home 
 what step she have take with cabinet colleague to increase the supply of affordable housing 
 our plan for change set out that the whole of the government be commit to the big increase in social and affordable housing in a generation the previous government fail to take social and in particular council housing seriously i be determined to put right that wrong we have already take decisive step include an injection of £ into the affordable home programme our consultation on the rent settlement and reform to right to buy we will set out more detail in the spending review 
 after year of conservative government ealing council have thousand of family wait for a council home and have an affordable housing programme that it do not have the money to deliver a report from southwark council release on sunday find that of council will have to delay or cancel house building project will the secretary of state look at way to finally make local council housing budget sustainable so that we can build the affordable home that my constituent in ealing southall desperately need 
 my hon friend raise an important point since take office we have set out a series of measure to support council to increase their capacity confidence and motivation to invest in new home we be provide £ to council to house some of the most vulnerable in society through the local authority housing fund as well as inject an additional £ into the affordable home programme to deliver new home we be help council borrow from the public works loan board at a reduce cost until the end of 
 we need a steady supply of affordable home as well as home in the private rented sector far to the question by my hon friend   the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith it be easy to sound morally righteous while demand ever high standard but if the housing market be wreck ultimately it will be the tenant who pay will the secretary of state answer my hon friend ’s question and tell we how she will ensure that the private rented sector remain investable so that tenant have somewhere to live 
 a balance have to be strike people need home that be safe be the right hon gentleman say that they do not want to provide home of a decent standard the majority of landlord provide that decent home standard and it be a few who do not where they do not they need to be hold accountable 
 what discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on use local growth funding to help increase economic growth 
 what discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on use local growth funding to help increase economic growth 
 local growth funding be crucial to our growth mission and to tackle regional inequality the government will set out a refreshed approach to local growth funding at the multiyear spending review in the spring that will end the beauty parade and short term decision making and put local community in charge of their own destiny just as we commit to at the general election 
 ilford be a hub of regeneration offer opportunity to independent business in new space such as mercato metropolitano ilford have thousand of small and medium sized business that make our high street more vibrant and offer choice to local what be the government do to support those business so that they can thrive on our local high street 
 as have be a theme of early question revitalise our high street be a priority for this government we have announce a number of measure include permanently lower business rate multiplier for retail hospitality and leisure property from introduce high street rental auction and provide additional funding to tackle retail crime all of which will support business and our high street 
 the ayrshire growth deal worth over a quarter of a pound have the potential to stimulate growth and create job across the region yet local delivery of the ambition be slow and stagnant what message would the minister send to spark action from the conservative snp run administration in the region so that ayrshire can realise its potential as a world class business region 
 i be sorry to hear that for our part the uk government be work closely with local partner and the scottish government to deliver the ayrshire growth deal which as my hon friend say be worth over a quarter of a pound as part of that we be support a programme review so that if any strategic change be need to ensure that the originally envisage benefit be realise they be make on the message that she ask for we need to move at pace exactly as the government have commit to do so that the people of ayrshire get what be promise 
 the village and town of mid norfolk be reel from the cost of live crisis and the government ’s taxis attack on job and small business rather than tax rural area and spend the money in the city may i suggest that minister allow rural council to keep the proceed of their growth and incentivise they to support business out in our rural community rather than allow the government to milk rural area to spend the money in city 
 i can not accept the hon gentleman ’s characterisation this government ’s decision whether on the support go into rural community and rural policing or the different business rate reduction show that we want to support business in those community to thrive and we will continue to do so 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer he be a regular visitor to northern ireland and that be because he love northern ireland and want to ensure that we play our part in the economic boost since come into government have he have an opportunity to speak to his northern ireland counterpart to ensure that we can go forward together as we should 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind point i have a strong personal enthusiasm for northern ireland its potential be huge i speak frequently to ministers in the northern ireland executive and will continue to do so as part of the prime minister and deputy prime minister ’s reset of our relationship with the devolved administration we meet they regularly and plan together so that our investment and their investment get the good value i will continue to do that and i look forward to work with the hon gentleman as well 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we share the government ’s ambition on local growth but companies house be report the high level of business closure in year will the government commit to publish an assessment of the impact that their national insurance rise business rate rise and change to business property relief be have on local growth plan 
 i have no doubt that the opposition will have all the information they need to scrutinise the government of the day we always provide that with full transparency what i will not accept be that the sand our economy be build on after the past year under the conservative government of the shadow minister and the shadow secretary of state be somehow   this government ’s failure in reality the hon gentleman know exactly as we do that we be fix the mess that they leave of course they will have the chance to oppose we along the way but we will get on with deliver for the british people and they will get on with carping from the sideline i know where i would rather be 
 if she will take step to support social housing provider to fund house make available under section of the town and country planning act 
 i recognise that social housing provider need support to build their capacity and make a great contribution to affordable housing supply include via section to assist in that we have propose a new year social housing rent settlement and permit council to keep all their right to buy receipt 
 i know that my hon friend be commit to increase the provision of social housing in the past few year most social housing have be provide through section agreement accord to the national housing federation thousand of house around the country be available but can not be purchase under section agreement because register social landlord simply do not have the resource i be sure that he be aware of that problem but do he have any plan to deal with it and bring those house which be badly need back into use 
 the government certainly recognise the ongoing challenge pose by the reduce appetite of register provider of social housing to buy affordable home deliver under section agreement as i hope my hon friend be aware the homes england section affordable housing clearing service be launch back in december alongside the revise national planning policy framework with the aim of support buyer and seller of section home to find each other more effectively we be call on all developer with uncontracted section affordable home as well as provider and local planning authority to engage proactively with that new service we will consider what further measure may be necessary to address the problem inform by datum from that service 
 private developer in my constituency have obligation to build social home under section and they be ready to do so the difficulty they face be that there be no social landlord available to take those unit when i raise this issue with the deputy prime minister in october she say that she be aware of the problem and be work to tackle it will the minister update the house on the progress make 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman hear my previous answer but i have just make it clear that we act on   december   to establish a matching service i would advise he to ask the developer whether they have take advantage of that service we want to learn lesson from the datum that come out of it to see whether we need to take further step   we think that the matching service will allow registered provider and developer try to offload section unit to come together to see if agreement can be reach 
 what plan her department have for local government reorganisation in devon 
 on   december i write to all council in tier area and neighbour small unitarie include in devon to set out plan for a joint programme of devolution and local government reorganisation later this month i intend to formally write out to those council on the shortlist to ask for interim proposal by march and full proposal later in the year we will confirm that as soon as possible because we know it be important to have clarity 
 obviously any reorganisation will impact council finance my constituency of north devon have coastal town with real pocket of remote deprivation isolation and poverty now that the minister ’s department have cut the rural service delivery grant what methodology will be use to ensure that local government funding do not overlook those area 
 with respect the hon gentleman be conflate entirely separate issue be reorganisation which will take money away from the back office and put it on the frontline where people can see the benefit of that investment but to be absolutely clear on rural service the provisional settlement that be lay out ensure that primarily rural council get an average increase of and no council see a net reduction in its income level that be our commitment to rural community and it be firm 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a serve councillor on bournemouth christchurch and poole council 
 many council have already undergo significant reorganisation from move to share service right the way through to full unitarisation and the cost of that have always be underestimate although transformation lead to low long term revenue cost we know that council everywhere be teeter on the edge so find fund to pay for reorganisation transformation and redundancy will be problematic the mayoral authority add an extra complication so can the minister confirm that funding from central government will be provide to fully cover both devolution and local government reorganisation so that council do not have to factor extra cost into their and budget or risk reduce local service far 
 the government be not require any area to reorganise what we do be write out and invite proposal to be submit and i pay tribute to councillor across the country for the leadership they have show in put those proposal forward investment to support lgr or devolution will follow a bit later   but to be clear this be a bottom up reorganisation be request by local council and they have our full support in that process 
 what step her department be take to work with the devolved administration to support people sleep rough in winter 
 funding for homelessness service in england be increase next year by £ take the total to a record £ this will help prevent rise in the number of family in temporary accommodation and in rough sleeping today i have announce the tripling of emergency winter pressure fund from £ to £ housing and homelessness be a devolved responsibility but we engage with devolved administration on a regular basis to share good practice and inform our cross government strategy on homelessness which be be chair by the deputy prime minister 
 i thank the minister for her answer and welcome today ’s announcement give that young people ’s experience of homelessness differ considerably from those of other age group across all country in the uk will the minister commit to address their need specifically in the homelessness strategy that be come up 
 my hon friend make a really important point about the impact on child and young people it be an absolute scandal that nearly child be in temporary accommodation and we be determined to ensure that the government ’s long term strategy address the underlie issue affect youth homelessness we be work with mayor council and key stakeholder include in the charitable sector to get we back on track to end homelessness 
 i call the shadow minister 
 st mungo ’s have report a rise in rough sleeping in london under this government compare with the same period under the last government will this government commit to remove the ringfence that they have introduce around the homelessness prevention grant heed council call to give they back the flexibility they need to get rough sleeper and homeless household into accommodation and avoid the cost shunt they impose on council tax payer 
 i thank the shadow minister for his question the fact be that this government be invest record amount of funding to tackle the root cause that require action on prevention and we be work with council to ensure that we address those underlie cause we have inherit a mess record level of homelessness and rough sleeping and we be determined to get a grip on it that mean action on prevention as well as address the impact of homelessness and rough sleeping and that be what we be determined to do 
 strategy that council use to address homelessness be to move homeless household elsewhere in the country that can be an appropriate response but it need to be do in consultation with the receiving authority do the minister share my concern that labour lead rushmoor council be use the standard procedure to attack its own member for bring this legitimate matter of concern to public attention 
 the shadow minister will be aware that the shortage of housing be drive out of area placement i be very happy to come back to he on his specific example but the deputy prime minister have write to council set out their responsibility and that out of area placement should be a last resort we will continue to work with council to support they as they deal with the challenge of the underlie problem which be the housing shortage and the crisis that have be leave behind we be determined to ensure that we get a grip by provide the support they need with funding as well as the home that this government be determined to build 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the english devolution bill on local public service 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the english devolution bill on local public service 
 the english devolution bill will strengthen public service by deliver local government reorganisation and establish more directly elect mayor who will have the new power to convene public service the bill will also deliver a new health improvement duty for strategic authority and enable more mayor to take on responsibility for police and crime commissioner function and health function as well to co ordinate well on local public service beyond mayor the white paper reassert the role of local authority as leader of place and the delivery arm for the government ’s mission 
 the catastrophic impact of the level of debt leave behind by the previous conservative council be be feel all over thurrock our service have be cut to the absolute quick and delivery for resident be at an all time low although i welcome the impact that devolution will have on growth and value for money what reassurance can the minister offer that devolution will finally give we the chance to turn the page and deliver where it matter for my constituent 
 that be a shared ambition the government be determined to take power away from westminster and put it into the hand of local community we know that drive well outcome and well public service rest on fair funding and for too long council have be impoverish while more expectation have be place on they the funding reform we be consult on will be part of rebuild the foundation but this be a very significant project to get power away from this place to local community 
 english devolution provide a generational opportunity to unlock the potential of town such as nuneaton i thank the minister for his time and support in ensure we get these option right will he continue to meet i and council representative to discuss the good option for unlock growth and opportunity in nuneaton 
 i thank my hon friend and the many other mp with whom i have have meeting to talk about devolution at the last tally about to meeting with mp have take place such be the interest be show in devolution for the right reason i be more than happy to continue those conversation and to welcome the local leadership be show 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests several mid leicestershire village such as glenfield birstall and braunstone town be extremely anxious at the prospect of be force into a large city unitary as a result of the english devolution bill will the minister agree to meet i to discuss this matter and will he give my constituent the assurance that they will not be force into a city unitary against their wish 
 it be important to say that any request for local government reorganisation be propose to government by the local area it be for the government to provide the process by which those application be hear over at least the last year local authority election have be postpone countless time to allow reorganisation to take place to be clear there be a bottom up approach for both the postponement of election and the boundary that be draw for the unitarie our job be to ensure that the process support that approach 
 i want to ask about the interaction between the planning reform and devolution which be huge bit of legislation in tunbridge wells we have a local plan but we have be ask when we do our new local plan to have a increase in house except we will not have a new local plan because tunbridge wells borough council will cease to exist it will become part of the west kent unitary authority how will these huge reform interact and what will it mean for housing number in tunbridge wells 
 in a sense a council be only an organisation at a point in time but there will always be a local authority responsible for the area we want to ensure that the authority be strategic but also take that wide view reorganisation be of course part of that but importantly a strategic authority can also take wide responsibility for align public service reform with local growth the hon gentleman talk about housing number and we can sometimes miss how important that be housing target be thing but we must not forget that for every of those number there be people and family who currently do not have a safe and affordable place to live this agenda be about tackle exactly that 
 what recent progress she have make on planning reform 
 in december we publish a revise national planning policy framework follow extensive consultation we be also make progress on develop our planning and infrastructure bill which will be introduce in the come month 
 a constituent of mine be endeavour to prevent her neighbour from build an extension that would affect the right of access set out in her restrictive covenant she be initially quote £ to £ to take the neighbour to court such cost make civil law inaccessible to ordinary people will the minister consider look at way that restrictive covenant can be bring into the planning process as a material consideration 
 i be sorry to learn of the experience of my hon friend ’s constituent legal restriction on property be not usually treat as material planning consideration the planning process only address whether the development be acceptable in planning term material consideration must relate to a planning purpose such as the character or use of the land if my hon friend wish to write to i with further detail on this i will endeavour to explore it far 
 in gosport we be face a massive increase in our housing number and planner be put in application to build across the very last green space in the strategic gap between gosport and fareham which already have air quality issue and overstretch local infrastructure we do have an abundance of disuse military site however so what priority be the minister give to encourage development on brownfield site rather than eat up the last remain green field in area such as gosport which be already overdeveloped 
 the government have a brownfield approach to development we strengthen that approach in the recently revise national planning policy framework we also publish last year a brownfield passport work paper to explore further way in which we might prioritise and accelerate the release of brownfield land on plan make we be ask local authority to take a sequential approach brownfield densify those brownfield site if possible and work cross boundary where possible and only then explore grey belt release and greenfield release in extremis we be in conversation with departments across the board about how we can well optimise the use of public sector land across all departments

 a partnership last year beyond the lifetime of even the young member of this house be unprecedented but it reflect the unique nature of our friendship a friendship that member on all side do so much to strengthen i pay particular tribute to the work of my predecessor   the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly the noble lord cameron of chipping norton and the former member for welwyn hatfield for their work under the previous government in support this partnership

 this government have show strong support for ukraine since our day in office for my part i have call out putin ’s modern day imperialism in the united nations security council i have be use the full force of our sanction against putin ’s war machine with the uk have lead the way in sanction putin ’s shadow fleet and i announce over £ in humanitarian and fiscal support during my own visit to kyiv in september my ministerial colleague have be play their full part as well my right hon friend the secretary of state for defence have accelerate the delivery of military aid extend our training of ukrainian soldier to at least the end of the year and sign a defence industrial treaty with ukraine allow it to draw on £ of uk export finance to acquire military equipment this month legislation introduce by my right hon friend the chancellor come into force enable a loan of over £ more to ukraine all of it repay through the use of profit from frozen russian asset that funding come on top of the government ’s commitment make by the prime minister in our week in office to provide £ a year in military aid in every year that it be need we do not know for how long it will be need it be for ukraine to decide at what point and in what way to have any form of talk with russia and ukraine will continue to need support from its friend even after putin ’s barbaric illegal war come to an end we have always say that we want to see a just and last peace but our priority right now together with our ally be to put ukraine in the strong possible position to achieve that 
 thing be clear ukrainians want to live at peace with their neighbour they do not provoke this war whatever the false claim of the kremlin or its army of bot online but now that putin ’s mafia state be prey on they they be fight back courageously their cause be just quite simply the freedom to choose their own future secondly putin show no sign of want peace he could end this war tomorrow by withdraw from ukraine yet he insist that the war will not end until he have achieve his objective objective that amount to the subjugation of the ukrainian people that be no basis for meaningful dialogue and putin ’s action speak far louder than his twisted word inhuman strike on civilian on christmas day dispatch north korean troop to the frontline and wave after wave of attack on the brave people of ukraine 
 finally putin ’s position be not of strength the invasion have be a monumental strategic failure and pressure be mount russia ’s casualty rate be staggering the high number of military casualty that the country have suffer since the world war and russia be more insecure than it be before the war and for what russia gain some territory last year yes field and small settlement leave barren by relentless bombardment and take at a rate so slow that the russians would need a century to conquer all of ukraine meanwhile their economy struggle increasingly to sustain the war through this year alone spiral inflation be make basic good such as butter unaffordable welfare cut be hit the most vulnerable and interest rate have be hike to a record we be approach the anniversary of this conflict and as the prime minister say in kyiv we must not let up now putin hop that the world lack his resolve and we need to call his bluff to prove he wrong 
 this be not simply a moral necessity although i know that the whole house have moral clarity on the righteousness of support ukraine it be also a strategic necessity for britain and our ally if putin win in ukraine the post war order found in great part by my predecessor ernie bevin which have keep we all safe for more than decade will be seriously undermine foundational principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity will be shake and a more dangerous world will result that be why the government will not falter it be why the prime minister travel to kyiv and it be why we stand firmly with ukraine today tomorrow and for generation to come i commend this statement to the house

 on the right hon lady ’s last point she will understand that today be inauguration day and it would have be a bit pre emptive to have have discussion with the incoming administration on the security guarantee and on ukraine ’s path to nato she know that we set out an irreversible pathway to membership at the nato conference when we come into office and that remain the position she also ask i about the security pillar and that be important help ukraine to reach nato ’s standard particularly across its military structure to support ukraine ’s irreversible path to nato membership be something that we in this country take very seriously 
 ukraine have defend itself resolutely in cyber space in the face of russian aggression and the uk have be proud to support that defence both in ukraine and also in the next door country the right hon lady mention cyber i be in moldova see the work that we fund which begin before we come into power it be good hugely important work and when we see the interference across the region in romania and georgia the importance of this work be underline even far 
 the right hon lady rightly talk about the maritime context and strengthen our maritime capability work with ukraine to protect black sea security be essential to its future security and prosperity some of ukraine ’s pre war trade go through the black sea and i might say that that be why for a substantial period of history russia have want total control of much of the black sea through the agreement we will work together to ensure the safety of trade in the black and azov sea through joint naval tasking and de mining activity which will be hugely important once this war come to an end 
 more broadly it be important for i to be absolutely clear on the issue of party support i raise concern with my chinese counterpart when i be in china on   october   about the supply of equipment to russia and the democratic people ’s republic of korea ’s relationship with russia the right hon lady know that i go on to designate company that we see deal with that dual use technology the direct participation of dprk troop in combat operation be another dangerous expansion of putin ’s illegal war against ukraine and further proof that he have no interest in peace we have also impose sanction on a number of iranian individual on   september   and again on   november include iran air in response to iran ’s transfer of ballistic missile to russia

 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s statement and his announcement that the uk will continue to do all it can to keep ukraine in the fight in the face of putin ’s unlawful war of aggression he mention sanction will he update the house about what discussion he have have with international counterpart on seize and repurpose russian state sanction to the tune of the £ hold in g7 country to finance ukraine to keep it in the fight 
 that be a very good question i reassure my hon friend that the subject remain under active discussion with our colleague particularly in europe we have make progress in relation to interest we recognise that more fund need to be find to keep ukraine in the fight there be difference of opinion about the lawfulness and legality of do this and the implication for the market particularly at this time those discussion be live and active and i be with the weimar group of not just foreign ministers because prime minister meloni and chancellor scholz be there as well discuss these very issue just before the christmas break 
 it be welcome to hear that this partnership agreement be a bind treaty as such it contrast with the budapest memorandum which be non binding and not worth the paper it be write on there be a lot of talk about how ukraine be on an irreversible path to nato membership but it will be difficult to get a consensus for that anytime soon among the nato member in lieu of nato membership what security guarantee might the uk seek to develop for ukraine with european ally 
 this be a very live issue as i say in my statement we do not see putin ready to halt his aggression and come to the table for serious negotiation but just as this country have stand by ukraine throughout and provide very important intelligence in the run up to this war we will recognise our part in work with other on security guarantee 
 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s statement on this year partnership with such an important european ally we absolutely understand how our future be link i want to recognise the ukrainian community in milton keynes which have establish the sunflower school and hold the holodomor memorial event these community be very worried they be come to the renewal of their visa because they never think that they would be here this long they have build new business family connection and friend and community connection can we reassure ukrainians in the uk that they will continue to have our support for the duration of the war and potentially support afterwards for some of they to continue their life here 
 i reassure ukrainians in the strong term i hope that they might see the year partnership as a signal of this that the uk will stand with they long after none of we be in this chamber that be the nature of the partnership they should be reassure and remember that war strike indelible bond just as it do between we and the united states after the world war it will do so between we and ukraine 
 i be sure that the foreign secretary ’s statement will be as welcome in kyiv as it be in this house he refer to the refugee in this country far to the point that   the hon member for milton keynes central emily darlington   make many of those people would like to return home but home be a war zone particularly in the east and they can not do so they therefore have child in school here and have build life here it would reassure they to know that they be safe and secure in the united kingdom for not just the future but the immediate future and will be able to be here for as long as it take 
 none of we know when the war will complete but across our constituency we all recognise community that continue to be here come out of other conflict i be think of kosovan community for example which exist right across the country i can think of a significant community in south london in particular many ukrainians want to return and we should make it possible for they to do so but in some area there will have to be a lot of de mining let we face it in order for they to go back to their home let we see where we get to at the end of the conflict 
 i thank the foreign secretary for the statement exeter ’s large and vibrant ukrainian heritage community will welcome this further strengthening of our cultural security and economic tie go back to sanction will he confirm that the uk will continue to keep up the pace and pressure of sanction on russia and indeed strengthen they where necessary to close the loophole in full partnership with our ally 
 i have be very proud of the work i have lead on sanction since come to office it be now the strong sanction package against russia anywhere in the world with more to come
