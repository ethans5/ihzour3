 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of compliance with the ministerial code 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of compliance with the ministerial code 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of compliance with the ministerial code 
 the prime minister be responsible for the ministerial code and be the ultimate judge of the standard of behaviour expect of ministers which be set out in that code all ministers be expect to uphold the principle of the code as the prime minister have make clear 
 on   april the advisory committee on business appointments write to the deputy prime minister to report a breach of the rule by the former prime minister boris johnson in relation to a visit to venezuela to meet president maduro on behalf of the hedge fund merlyn advisors be the cabinet office aware of the visit in advance and do the deputy prime minister the secretary of state or official have a conversation with the foreign office about any tax fund briefing that he may have receive 
 the government expect all former ministers include prime ministers to abide by their obligation with regard to the business appointment rule set out in the ministerial code the cabinet office be currently consider a letter on this matter from the advisory committee on business appointments and will respond in due course 
 in addition to boris johnson ’s hedge fund lobbying in venezuela there be his daily mail column as well as his lettuce pm successor ’s contravention of the   radcliffe rule in betray royal confidence in her book the minister have say that the prime minister be judge and jury in respect of the code be it not time for a more independent system such as labour ’s propose ethic and integrity commission if the government will not do that can they not just call a general election now 
 the principle on public life be very clear and i have set out the prime minister ’s expectation but let i draw the hon lady ’s attention to what be say by the committee on standards in public life in namely that a single commission would come with considerable disadvantage and that 
 the concentration of such power to a body do not sit well in our democratic system 
 it be fascinating to see time as many ministers as conservative back benchers in the chamber today 
 paragraph 1(3)(d of the ministerial code say 
 minister should be as open as possible with parliament and the public 
 and paragraph 1(3)(f say 
 minister must ensure that no conflict arise or appear to arise 
 why then be the government still refuse to publish the detail of the financial interest that the foreign secretary have before he be appoint to the house of lords why be they still refuse despite numerous request from newspaper and other to publish the fact of whether or not the foreign secretary have have to recuse himself from certain element of his job because of his previous involvement with the chinese state and why be they point blank refusing to say which part of his job he be recuse from 
 accord to the advice of the independent adviser on ministers interest last publish on   december follow a previous publication on   july   which update advice issue on   april the process of ministerial engagement with the register be ongoing and be update on an ongoing basis when minister be appoint they fill in an extensive form which their permanent secretary then review and there be a continuous process of update that as interest evolve 
 i call the shadow secretary of state

 not act on behalf of the government and the trip be not fund by the government 
 in a write parliamentary answer to i we be tell that mr johnson have only make a courtesy call to the british residence last week however the chair of the advisory committee on business appointments make it clear that mr johnson be in breach of the government ’s british appointment rule we also know from mr johnson himself that he have be extensively brief by the embassy when will the government come clean about what have actually go on with boris johnson ’s venezuela visit 
 i explain in an early answer where we be in term of the cabinet office consider the letter from acoba we do expect all ministers civil servant and special adviser to abide by those business appointment rule they be contractual requirement for civil servant and be draw to the attention of ministers by the ministerial code as be announce in the government ’s response last july to the report from the committee on standards on public life mr boardman ’s review and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee we be continue to consider method of strengthen the system and encourage compliance with those rule as for the specific case that the right hon gentleman have raise i have say that the cabinet office be due to respond to that letter 
 what step his department be take to protect public institution and service from cyber threat 
 what step his department be take to protect public institution and service from cyber threat 
 the cyber threat face the united kingdom be intensify state and non state actor have target our critical national infrastructure our business and even our democratic institution the government have introduce a new national cyber strategy which take a whole of society approach we have set out high standard of cyber protection for our critical industry and with the help of our world lead agency we be offer advice to institution business and individual on protect themselves online 
 cyber security be crucial not only to our defence sector but to other include finance energy and retail sector leader have raise fear about the future supply of cyber professional there be some brilliant work take place at ebbw vale college in my constituency pioneer stuff be go on around cyber security but can the deputy prime minister say what be be do to onshore these critical role to protect our economy from attack by hostile actor 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise this issue we have tremendous strength in national cyber security and there be many relevant institution around the country i have visit university in wales that be churn out brilliant graduate we need to do more at secondary school level to encourage more child to get involve in cyber security because the demand be only go to increase in the month and year ahead and i have be engage with the education secretary on precisely this point 
 we have all see in recent week how weak cyber security can compromise elect representative and lead to the extraction of often compromise information could the minister update the house on what he be do to provide support and technology specifically to elect representative to make sure that this do not happen in the future 
 this be an important issue which be why we establish the national cyber security centre it bring together government communications headquarters expertise with that of the cabinet office the foreign office and other through the national cyber security centre we work with the house authority and other to make sure that they have sufficient and appropriate advice but also to advise on equipment and the general security of members of parliament if they have concern about their cyber security i would urge they either to get in contact directly with the national security cyber centre or to do so through the relevant house authority 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state be right to say that the threat be intensify late last year the joint committee on the national security strategy urge the government to offer more active support on cyber security to local authority he may be aware that last month my own local authority leicester city council suffer a hugely sophisticated attack which disrupt many local authority service and have hugely inconvenience many of my constituent who rely on those service give that we be see more of these ransomware group attack on public institution across the world and that he say rightly that the threat be intensify what urgent support and guidance be he offer local council such as mine in leicester 
 specifically in relation to the hon gentleman ’s local authority i have be brief by the national cyber security centre on that incident he be totally right to say it be a significant and serious incident and we be work on remediation through the national cyber security centre to prevent this type of attack from happen in the place we invest £ in the national cyber strategy which be about improve cyber resilience and reduce legacy technology i have be quite open with the house in say that the threat be intensify because we see hostile state create environment in which cyber criminal can flourish both for their own benefit and for the benefit of those hostile state we be work through our intelligence agency and the national cyber security centre to continuously improve our performance 
 what step his department be take to strengthen national security 
 protect national security be the government ’s duty on tuesday the prime minister announce a fully fund plan to increase our defence spending by £ over the next year as part of this uplift we will bring forward a national defence and resilience plan build on the resilience framework and integrated review to respond to the evolve threat we face we be bring our defence and civilian preparation together to reflect the interconnectedness of those threat the cabinet office play a central role in this endeavour co ordinating strategy through cobra resilience directorate and the national security council 
 in the past week people in germany have be arrest on suspicion of spy for china and have be charge in the uk this come on the back of the intelligence and security committee report which conclude that the government have no strategy or whole system whole government approach to deal with this serious threat when be the minister go to get a grip on this serious threat to our democracy from china 
 i totally disagree with the hon gentleman ’s characterisation we deal explicitly with this in both the integrated review and the integrated review refresh which set out a co ordinated approach and be clear about the threat we face from hostile state russia north korea iran and indeed china we be very clear about the threat china pose to our economic security and our democratic institution and that be why we have take a range of action include for the time directly attribute attack to china and impose sanction in respect of they 
 with local and national election on the horizon it be vital that voter can have full confidence in the integrity of our electoral system with that in mind what assessment have the department make of the risk pose by deepfake and misinformation in the upcoming election 
 i have considerable concern about deepfake be use in the upcoming election we have see hack and leak be use as a tactic by hostile state in previous election and we have to take into account deepfake capability particularly enhance by artificial intelligence that be why we be develop our strategy through the defending democracy taskforce and undertake exercise right now to enhance our capability it be however a challenge to all citizen not necessarily to take image to be true on sight because of adversary enhance capability 
 what step he be take to improve support for female veteran 
 the office for veterans affairs have provide £ for research into the live experience of woman veteran and for development of further support with my hon friend make valuable contribution we be develop the government ’s woman ’s strategy which will celebrate the success of woman veteran but also look at the specific challenge they face so as to well address their need 
 i be of the estimate female veteran and i have spend the last year raise awareness of this hidden community i be pleased to have work with the minister on establish the female veteran strategy i have be chair of the advisory board the evidence gathering have end and the recommendation have be make will the minister let i know whether the term female military sexual trauma will be acknowledge and include and the date on which the strategy will be publish 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who have be a passionate advocate of this cause she be the woman from the rank to be elect to this place and she should be incredibly proud of all she have do over her many year of work on this issue as i have say before from this dispatch box i recognise the unique challenge around sexual trauma in the military of course i do the strategy will be publish before the summer recess i know my hon friend be wait for it and i be determined to get it out before the recess i be hopeful that it will meet all the demand and all the hurt in that community that have be unmet for too long 
 i have have the pleasure of meet many female veteran in my constituency and of work with fantastic organisation such as woody ’s lodge the royal british legion and of course welsh veterans partnership what be the minister do to work with the welsh government and local authority across the whole of the uk to ensure that woman veteran get the support that be rightly be ask for 
 we meet the devolved authority regularly to make sure that all our strategy be in sync obviously a lot of these policy area whether health housing or education be devolve but we be clear that both nationally and internationally we want the office for veterans affair to set the standard we have great relationship internationally now in term of set the pace on that and i want to make sure it be concomitant with what we be do with the devolved authority we have regular meeting with the welsh government and the scottish and indeed we be go over to northern ireland again in week 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of his department ’s process for scrutinise nomination for honour 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of his department 's process for scrutinise nomination for honour 
 it look like the member who table no be not out of bed 
 a validation process be carry out to assess the strength and credibility of each nomination we protect the integrity of the honours system by carry out probity check with a number of government departments before the prime minister submit name to his majesty the king for approval 
 the prime minister previously back call for horizon victim and campaigner alan bates to receive an honour yet his name be absent from the prime minister ’s surprise honours list last month however russia link mohamed mansour ’s name be on that list what be it about the multi millionaire generous conservative party donor that attract the prime minister to the idea of give he a knighthood 
 the gentleman whose name have just be mention be a very successful businessman and philanthropist and i be sure those quality be very much in the prime minister ’s mind when he be put forward for an honour extremely distinguished name from the world of artificial intelligence and the creative industry be also recognise for their contribution to our country 
 
 i advise the hon gentleman to go back and check the list because not for the time in this house he be wrong 
 the prime minister recently announce an extraordinary round of honour which many describe as lack integrity and bring the system into disrepute it include a donor who have donate £ to the conservative party and conservative mp loyal to the prime minister in the run up to a general election that he be widely tip to lose what could possibly be the justification for the prime minister announce and recommend a round of honour outside of the traditional king ’s birthday list 
 order it would have be easy if you have be here for the beginning of the question stretch the question be test my patience and the patience of the government front bench 
 i thank the hon member for slough for turn up i refer he to the answer i give a few moment ago 
 what step he be take to support veteran with the cost of living

 here be some fact veteran homelessness have rise by over the last year per cent of veteran and their family be live in food insecure household over veteran be have to claim universal credit just to get by despite the minister ’s claim of make the uk the good place in the world to be a veteran it be n’t be it 
 the hon lady say here be some fact before read out a load of thing that be not correct it do not change the fact of those situation last christmas under a programme design by this government not a single veteran sleep rough because of a lack of provision the shadow veterans minister   the hon member for birmingham selly oak steve   mccabe have not even turn up to ask question this morning so i will take no lesson from labour on veteran 
 go into this election veteran be deeply nervous about what labour ’s offer might be again these banal quote about statistic be not correct this be not a game these be serious people who deserve the nation ’s respect and i encourage the labour party to align with that

 the costing will be a responsibility of the treasury but a joint team between the cabinet office and the treasury be work to give advice to the prime minister so that we can make decision in a timely way as soon as possible from   may i be conscious of the fact that across all the different community of infected and affect as much clarity be need as possible they have have to wait too long so i be make sure that as far as we can when those final decision be make there will be not only a headline decision but clarity on process thereafter it be those detail i be work on now and i hope that a decision can be make as soon as possible from   may 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson

 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of public sector procurement of digital good and service 
 the government recognise how vital digital product and service be for deliver public service the digital datum and technology playbook provide good practice guidance for the procurement of digital product and service the playbook be update annually most recently in june department be responsible for ensure that public service deliver by the private sector represent value for money 
 digital service procurement should be a win win win the british public get well service business get a good and reliable customer and public service be reduce in cost however that be not the case under this government department be lock into single source provider and dependent on legacy system the national audit office itself say that procurement be not competitive enough as an example of that can the minister say how competitive cloud service provision be across his government will he set out how he be use open source to boost competitiveness in digital service procurement 
 we have a highly successful commercial function in government which be drive up value for money across all our commercial arrangement it monitor   contract before during and after they have be in place to ensure that we reduce the chance of issue such as lock in i strongly advise the hon lady to go and read the commercial function documentation 
 i have 
 i be sure she have not she should read the commercial function documentation that come out of the cabinet office because she will see as have be show successively that it save billion of pound for the british taxpayer 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the cabinet office continue to play a central co ordinating role in protect our national and economic security last week we publish the response to the call for evidence on the national security and investment act and i set out the step we will take to fine tune that system include hone our approach to export control outward investment and provide more support to business 
 later i will be convene a round table of university vice chancellor to brief they on the security risk in research and academia and to discuss how we address those all of that complement our plan for a generational £ uplift in defence spending include a new national defence and resilience plan set out a cross government approach to security preparedness and resilience as a nation 
 it be often claim by critic that the continual stream of ineffective and incompetent legislation we see from holyrood be evidence of the need for a democratically elect chamber to scrutinise properly we have such an effective chamber here and this week we have see how important it can be in legislation would that chamber ’s position not have be strengthen by be a democratically elect revise chamber do the secretary of state agree that the time have come when we need to look again at how we reform the house of lords to make it more relevant to the century and more democratic 
 i be afraid that i completely disagree with the hon lady about have an elect chamber this be the democratic chamber for our nation it be the principal voice of the nation we do not need a chamber in conflict with this far burden and complexe legislative process 
 the very welcome windsor framework demonstrate a strong commitment to human and animal health by extend northern ireland ’s access to veterinary medicine until i welcome the establishment of the veterinary medicine working group by the cabinet office and the northern ireland minister of state i be pleased to be part of that group which be work hard to find a permanent solution to this matter can my right hon   friend the secretary of state in the cabinet office reassure the house that the government will continue to strain every sinew in discussion with the eu to protect both animal health and public health in northern ireland and right across the uk with a permanent solution for access to veterinary medicine in northern ireland

 i call the shadow minister 
 may i begin with a moment of unity the deputy prime minister and i be both push for an early general election as soon as possible i very much welcome his recognition that there be absolutely no point in this conservative government carry on in office a moment long 
 far to the question a little early by my hon friend   the member for weaver vale mike amesbury this week people be charge in this country under the official secrets act with spy for china of whom work for politician in this house 
 order i must stop the right hon gentleman it seem to i that he be about to go down a road on a matter that be sub judice which can not be discuss here in this chamber the speaker make a statement at the beginning of business early this week ask member not to refer to this matter because it be sub judice can the right hon gentleman ask his general question in a different way and not refer to that specific issue 
 thank you for your guidance madam deputy speaker i shall ask a policy question 
 the government recently award a contract for a supercomputer to lenovo a china headquarter firm that have be the subject of enforcement action by the united states on security ground this supercomputer will be use by critical government body such as the uk atomic energy authority how will ministers safeguard the public against any possible misuse of sensitive government datum as a result of the awarding of the contract 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i know that he have also write to i regard that topic i can assure he that we will be work with the national cyber security centre and the national security secretariat to ensure that full check and measure be put in place to prevent such abuse from occur 
 the right hon gentleman refer to his role as general election co ordinator for the labour party i understand that he sit on the quad which determine labour policy so perhaps he could clear up for the benefit of we all this question on an issue of national security do the labour party support our £ increase in defence spending if he care about these thing the answer should be plainly yes we do 
 when we announce a policy we ensure that it be properly cost and fund which i recommend to the deputy prime minister other cyber threat that modern state be face be prepositione the planting of destructive software in critical infrastructure that can then be activate at a later date the director of the fbi say that prepositione of the volt typhoon type discover in american infrastructure be 
 the define threat of our generation 
 america ’s cyber defence agency say that eye ally be also likely to have be target have the government look for or find volt typhoon type infiltration of any part of our critical national it infrastructure and if so what action be be take to remove it 
 the right hon gentleman have be around this place long enough to know that he be deliver a non answer on labour ’s support for defence spending the whole house will have note that although he raise an important issue in respect of prepositioning he will appreciate that there be limit to what i can say from the dispatch box give that some of this relate to high side intelligence but i assure he that we be work with our eyes ally in particular the united states since the us and the uk have exceptional capability in these area to ensure that we both have adequate knowledge and understanding of such prepositioning and take effective step in respect of it 
 week ago on   february at order question i ask the minister without portfolio what the government would do to assist people who be adversely affect by the statute of limitation as a result of have be injure by covid-19 vaccine my right hon friend say in response that she have take the issue to the permanent secretary will she update we on what have happen with the permanent secretary over the past week 
 i thank my hon friend for ask that question he be a tireless campaigner on this matter on which he have meet with i and the secretary of state for health and social care as i say to my hon friend i be deal with this matter with the permanent secretary he will know that we have a new permanent secretary in the department and we be work at pace to resolve it 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 last year the uk government promise to relocate hundred of civil service post to the north east of scotland it have now be confirm that the total number will be   give the billion generate in energy revenue and the unparalleled potential of our area in power our green future can the minister please explain to the people of the north east of scotland how hundred and be now the same thing 
 i think the hon lady be refer to the headquarters of the department for energy security and net in aberdeen which i visit just before christmas i think that there be a misunderstanding about the number that be quote in the paper some job have move out of london as a consequence of the place for growth programme i will examine the number that have move to scotland and write to she to clarify the government ’s position 
 i recently meet with emma howard boyd to discuss the interim finding of the mayor of london ’s climate resilience review which she have be lead on it involve the work of many different government departments at a national level will the minister update we on whether we be conduct a similar exercise the review be look at what the impact would be of a similar heat- wave to the we have a couple of year ago flash flooding and all sort of thing it be not just the responsibility of desnz or the department for environment food and rural affairs it cover many department so it be a cabinet office responsibility 
 it be an important question we be do exactly that extreme heat be something that we have to increasingly plan against that be why last year for the time we introduce an alert system for extreme heat that match the alert system for extreme cold i disagree though with the mayor of london that the way to deal with this be to start impose mph speed limit everywhere and an ultra low emission zone i hope that the people of london will take the opportunity to vote against that next week 
 early we hear a number of statement from the opposition question ministerial integrity but perhaps they should look close to home to be precise at the minister of wales and his link with donation to his leadership campaign and the development bank of wales can the minister tell we when the welsh labour party will apply to itself the standard that labour have call for in the chamber this morning—[interruption 
 order if you all shout i can not hear what the hon lady be say but i think there be some doubt the hon lady can not ask the minister a question about what the labour party will do would she like to rephrase what she be say 
 with reference to the link between the minister of wales the donation to his campaign and the development bank of wales would the minister like to describe why this be such an issue for the people of wales while the opposition keep shout that we be do the wrong thing 
 my hon friend make a very strong point if a devolve administration receive a donation as part of a political campaign if the leader of that administration receive a £ donation at the same time that the development bank of wales make a £ loan to a subsidiary of that company that be surely a matter of public interest it will be for the minister of wales to determine what be appropriate but i would have think some explanation would be the very least that the people of wales would expect 
 last year the government pledge to introduce a ministerial deed to legally commit ministers to keep to the after government business appointment rule if i be cynical i could think of a reason why the government have not bring that commitment forward but might the minister give an idea of when he intend to do so 
 the hon lady be right in july in response to those report from the committee on standards in public life the boardman review and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee the government do say they would work up strengthen the rule on business appointment and develop that ministerial deed i can not give an update at this point because it be work the deputy prime minister and his team be lead on but it be important work and we do need to get it right 
 i thank the paymaster general for all his hard work on the contaminated blood scandal however as you would expect madam deputy speaker i still urge he to go far and fast to get this situation resolve if the infected blood compensation authority be to be establish upon royal assent can the minister outline the timescale and process for the appointment of the chair and the other director and how those with live experience will be involve and include among those director 
 i thank the right hon lady for her kind word and her constructive approach it be absolutely right that she continue to press i as she do at every opportunity reflect on our conversation and what she have say to i the key thing be to ensure that we maintain and reclaim the trust of the infected blood community in all its dimension she will know that i be engage with they in depth over several meeting on and   may sir brian langstaff make clear that the infected blood community and all those access the scheme should have a role to play in its delivery so consequential to listen to what they say to i i will be think about how we build that in as she know the government have make provision for committee and sub committee to ensure representation of the community while also maintain an independent arm ’s length body i will need to reconcile those i be sorry that i can not give she a timetable but i be work on it in some detail 
 if i may press the deputy prime minister foreign office official have refuse to say whether lord cameron have recuse himself from part of his role as foreign secretary give his previous well pay work in promote the   china back port city colombo can the minister tell the house whether the foreign secretary have recuse himself from any part of his ministerial duty 
 as the hon gentleman will know shortly before take office the foreign secretary not only have all his interest properly review by the propriety and ethic team in my department but go through they with the independent adviser on minister interest the independent adviser set out all relevant interest and those have be publish so the information be transparently out there for people to be able to judge for themselves 
 ever since the monster cyril smith formally of this house but initially mayor of rochdale the town have be blight by scandal of grooming and cover up we currently have man on bail on groom charge in rochdale the previous labour mayor of rochdale and the next mayor of rochdale the king ’s representative be both investigate on charge of sexual malpractice towards young girl in their employ with all the power imbalance that that imply self regulation with no investigation by any outside party how can this be right what will the minister do to help i to clean up rochdale 
 as the hon gentleman will know any criminal allegation be properly a matter for the court and he would not expect a minister to comment on they from this dispatch box if he wish to write to i in respect of the further allegation he make i will be happy to take they up myself or with ministerial colleague 
 what consideration have be give to the merit of make it illegal for public sector body to pay ransom if they be the victim of a ransomware attack 
 that be a good question it be something the government continue to keep open and under review the argument against do so be that it could discourage company that be subject to ransomware attack from report they for example to the national cyber security centre those report help we to gather intelligence on the nature of those threat and to work with victim to resolve they it be not something i rule out totally but that be the reason that we have not impose it so far 
 the minister for veterans affairs   the right hon member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer will know that many council in northern ireland have appoint veteran champion will he join i in acknowledge the work that many veteran champion do will he also call on the wide range of political party on council in northern ireland to offer their unstinting support to those champion to help to deliver service to veteran 
 yes of course we have make extraordinary progress on veteran affair in northern ireland i recognise and have always recognise the unique difficulty of that veteran service and ensure that these people be look after because of their service should not be at    the whim of different political party i be work at pace to establish an outpost of the office for veterans affairs in northern ireland to create an environment where everyone can work together and pull together all the different service to get veteran care in northern ireland up to the same level as in england i look forward to work with the hon gentleman and other elect representative out there from all party to make sure that we do the right thing 
 with former conservative prime ministers have recently contravene the ministerial code twice in the case of boris johnson and the radcliffe rule in the case of his successor   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be it now tory party policy to routinely ignore the rule if not what sanction will they face 
 the hon lady be correct to say that the book by the former prime minister my right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be review under the radcliffe rule the cabinet office do not clear it the overwhelming majority of book that be submit do comply we will have to keep these matter under review 
 this be a very simple question to the deputy prime minister do the foreign secretary stand recuse in any aspect of his job by virtue of his financial interest either now or before he be appoint to his post yes or no 
 the labour party keep on push on this point but i refer the hon gentleman to the late list of ministerial interest which be publish in december and provide detail of minister ’s interest include those of the foreign secretary that be judge by the independent adviser to be relevant or could be perceive to be relevant to their ministerial role all of it be there in the public domain 
 with reference to the write question that the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet office have answer can he outline what the government consider to be the difference between a foreign court and an international court 
 we have answer this question on a number of occasion 
 the paymaster general tell my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   that he could not give a timeline with regard to the infected blood scandal compensation this subject be raise on an almost daily basis in this house by member on both side because our constituent just can not understand why it be take so long can he at least give an indication of when he think compensation might begin to be pay it be especially important give that as i understand it victim of the scandal die every day 
 the answer to this be to be find when we issue the comprehensive response to the inquiry as soon as possible after   may legislation be go through   the other place to make good on the amendment that be pass in this house by virtue of the advocacy and leadership of   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson we have announce that we will make some interim payment to the estate of those decease infect who have not yet receive any money but the substantive response to translate recommendation into meaningful and actionable response for a wide community over or year obviously demand a lot of work to quantify and get the process right we will update the house as quickly as possible after   may 
 just now the deputy prime minister raise the issue of the £ public spending announcement would he care to tell the house why after year in power it take an upcoming general election for he and his party to make defence spend policy 
 it may have escape the hon gentleman ’s attention but russia have invade ukraine and iran ’s proxy be attack our ally in the middle east that demand a response from the government and it have be provide by the prime minister it be very notable that the labour party be fail to match that commitment 
 paper at an employment tribunal last week report that rowaa ahmar a former civil servant state that 
 the racism within the cabinet office appear to be unrelenting and systemic 
 and that despite have a role as head of policy in the government ’s illegal migration taskforce she be make unwelcome at meeting about the rwanda plan because of her view on the racist ultra hostility of the policy be ms ahmar right that speak up against racism in the cabinet office be a career death sentence 
 i do not accept that at all of course ms ahmar withdraw her allegation completely on the eve of have they scrutinise at the high tribunal so i do not accept that and it be absolutely right that senior civil servant take action when there be performance issue with the staff under they without fear of allegation be make against they 
 far to the question ask by my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   about the infected blood scandal the cumberlege report highlight over year ago the need for redress for victim of the sodium valproate vaginal mesh and primodos scandal what progress have be make on redress for those victim 
 i be sorry i be not able to give an answer on those other scandal there be a backbench business debate on redress scheme last thursday to which the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend   the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart   reply i believe that work be ongoing but i will have to write to the hon gentleman to give he a thorough answer on the matter 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i appreciate that standard may have change since i be last in this place but in answer to the question ask by   the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady the parliamentary secretary cabinet office   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart rise to the dispatch box and say we have answer this question on a number of occasion can that possibly be a legitimate ministerial answer after all that could be the answer to virtually every question that be ever ask in this house 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point of order i can not help agree with his final point have sit in the chair for    thousand of hour and hear the same question answer again and again he make a very good point minister be responsible and have a duty to answer the question again and again however if the minister think today or at any other time that the appropriate answer in the circumstance be the that the hon gentleman just quote that be not something that i can criticise or a matter on which i can take action as mr speaker have say many time and as i be very pleased to repeat what minister say at the dispatch box be not a matter for the chair 
 the hon gentleman ’s point of order have bring we perfectly to just after am we can therefore proceed to the business question 
 i ask the leader of the house for the forthcoming business 
 the business for the week commence   april   will include 
 monday april consideration in committee and remain stage of the post office horizon system offences bill 
 tuesday april consideration of lords amendment to the digital markets competition and consumers bill

 the awful event in wales yesterday will have be traumatic for student staff and parent and our thought be with all those affect i also pay tribute to frank field the word say about frank in recent day really reflect who he be principle determined relentless kind generous and funny his tireless campaign against poverty and for opportunity and education change the life of so many child who will never know it my thought be with his family and friend 
 as someone well experienced in divided weak government do the leader of the house share my concern that the snp have break its power sharing deal which its leader say only last night be in the good interest of scotland leave the people of scotland even bad off under the snp government in scot be on an nhs waiting list and people face high bill and high taxis do she think that be why the scottish greens the snp ’s former partner accuse the snp of sell out future generation 
 this have get nothing to do with the business of the house 
 it absolutely do i be ask the leader of the house for her opinion on these matter 
 another week another litany of problem for the government last week there be more scandal and internal positioning and this week there be a catalogue of failing the government ’s flagship childcare plan be   in tatter they spend month in denial yet this week the department for education finally admit what many parent have be experience that the roll out target be problematic yesterday the spending watchdog warn that the government ’s plan do not 
 achieve its primary aim or demonstrate value for money 
 the report be damn about the dfe ’s oversight and planning for new place can the right hon lady guarantee that full delivery of the plan be on track this be the reverse midas touch government only they could turn what should be a popular policy into such a vote loser 
 another policy that the government have turn to dust be their pledge on renter right ahead of report stage of the bill on that subject yesterday the government table hundred of amendment a poor reflection of the leader of the house ’s oversight of the legislative agenda the amendment water down that weak bill even far and there be no guarantee that ban section eviction will ever happen be it any wonder that the renters reform coalition have pull its support for the bill 
 despite the government finally pass their rwanda legislation it have emerge that around illegal migrant will languish in hotel at the taxpayer expense in perpetuity unable to be remove or even process because of the government ’s last piece of legislation how be stop the small boat go 
 the government promise level up yet the chair of middlesbrough football club a former ben houchen superfan say that the tees valley mayor be 
 give away our child 's future 
 through his management of the south tees development corporation he be right be n’t he 
 in perhaps what will become the conservative most lasting and damage legacy there be more worrying evidence today about generation lockdown among which there be not only massive school drop out and absenteeism rate but more drinking because this government fail to put in place the catch up support need it be no wonder that this country be cry out for change how be the leader of the house feel about her party ’s chance next week we all want to know i see that on the day we return after the local election there be a general debate be that in anticipation of something or to keep government member away from westminster we be still wait on a lot of important legislation 
 order i hesitate to interrupt the hon lady but i will do so now before she come to her peroration early in her questioning she refer to matter in the scottish parliament and ask the leader of the house her opinion on they she have just ask the leader of the house her opinion on a general political matter this be business question and it be about the business of the house i let the hon lady ’s question go very wide they do not have to be exactly about the business of the house for next week but they ought to relate to the business of the house of commons if rather than ask the opinion of the leader of the house she ask a question about the business before we that would be perfectly in order 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i be about to ask why legislation such as the criminal justice bill and the sentencing bill be not come forward   the week after the local election as have be demand by member on both side of the house many other thing could also come before we for debate yet the day we come back after the local election be very light i wonder why that be have the leader of house clear her diary for that day too be that why we have such light business that week no matter how much the government ’s mayors and candidate hide behind their green and purple branding there be no escape the fact that they be stand on the woeful record of this tory government 
 we have a plan they might not like it but we do to bring down waiting list to deliver low energy bill to build more home and as we have set out today to reform our railway in the interest of the travel public it be not more free cash as some have say the truth be that a vote for the conservatives be a vote for this chaotic mess to continue be it not the case that if people want change they have to vote labour next thursday 
 may i send my thought and sentiment to all those affect by the appalling event in wales i hope that the community recover swiftly may i also place on record my sadness at the loss of our former colleague frank field who be mp for birkenhead for more than year when i be go for candidate selection for the conservative party of the question i be ask be who in the labour party i most admire and my answer be frank field many know he for his relentless work combat poverty and its cause but he have many other interest that he pursue with equal vigour i be particularly pleased to work with he on try to secure the building of new ship in the uk and he be also a fellow brexit campaigner the connection he have to the people he serve and the duty that he feel towards they and never waver from be profound and i send my deep sympathy to all who know and love he 
 may i also pay tribute to dame elizabeth gardiner dcb kc for her service as parliamentary counsel she be the woman to hold that role in its year history and she have have a very busy year i place on record my thank to she for her service and wish she well i also congratulate jessica de mounteney who succeed she 
 the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   ask i about the snp i be sure that we will come to that shortly but the greens leave the coalition provide the labour party with an opportunity i think a memo have go out to labour front benchers say that they should go easy on the snp with a view to perhaps form some sort of coalition or alliance with it north of the border 
 the hon lady and her party talk a good talk she just have on childcare ensure that people have a warm and secure home and level up the tees valley but it be the conservatives who be deliver the large expansion of free childcare it be the conservatives who have build new home and be get people on the housing ladder and it be the conservative mayor ben houchen who have deliver regeneration for the tees valley and an employment rate above the   national average 
 in response to the point about the need for more and well competition the conservatives be introduce legislation and scheme to strengthen the arm of the consumer such as fairfueluk ’s pumpwatch labour ’s answer reduce competition far and be a return to the british rail sandwich the hon lady tout the move that be announce today the shadow transport secretary   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh say that the change will be do at cost but we read that it will actually require £ of additional funding and will not deliver any fare decrease or improved service it be socialist ideology over practicality even lew adams aslef ’s former secretary general say 
 in the public sector all we get be cut cut cut and today there be more member in the trade union more train driver and more train run the reality be that it work we ’ve protect job and we get more job 
 the hon member for manchester central raise the issue of rwanda in response to the british government ’s need to control foreign national access to the uk the conservatives have be do the hard yard of institutional and legal reform we have introduce legislation establish the rwanda scheme and the home secretary be work to modernise the international framework that govern it in contrast labour have vote hundred of time against that legislation and say that it will scrap the rwanda scheme even if it be work instead it be pursue a quota scheme that would see immigration rise we will never do that 
 the hon lady talk of change but the labour party have not change at all while labour member have be scoff prawn cocktail they have be devise new business burden that they plan on introduce while pose next to submarine labour member several front bench members vote to scrap our deterrent and be refuse to match our baseline on defence spending while labour member criticise and sneer at those who celebrate the st george ’s flag they be allow some of they to occupy the labour front bench today ’s labour party be pack with the same old socialist and a few new plastic patriot and no amount of window dressing 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker interruption 
 order before the leader of the house finish i can take a point of order if it relate directly to the matter that we be discuss 
 absolutely madam deputy speaker the leader of the house be mislead the house interruption the leader of the house just say 
 order hold on the hon lady can not accuse the leader of the house of mislead the house that would be quite wrong and if the leader of the house have do something along those line i would have stop she immediately if the hon lady mean that she disagree with the leader of the house that be a different matter 
 madam deputy speaker it be a matter of fact that labour members celebrate st george ’s day we all put it on our social medium and the leader of    our party have make a point of wrap himself in the flag the leader of the house be completely incorrect in what she just say to the house 
 i think the hon lady mean that anything that the leader of the house might have say would have be inadvertently misleading 
 i hope that the leader of the house will correct the record right now 
 i want to take that point of order while the leader of the house be still on her foot i be quite sure that the leader of the house do not intend to make any misdirection would she care to take that point 
 i have finish my response to   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell but i be happy to add the truth hurt 
 rise 
 order let we be clear we will be take question that relate to the business of the house i call the vice chairman of the backbench business committee 
 i bring good news from the chairman of the backbench business committee   the hon member for gateshead ian mearns whose daughter in law be recover hon member hear hear that be good news and he hop to be back next week 
 may i add my condolence to those send to the family of lord field i have the opportunity to meet he when i be a student at liverpool university he be a redoubtable campaigner on everything he believe in and of those people i profoundly respect 
 on behalf of the backbench business committee in addition to the business that my right hon friend the leader of the house have announce on   thursday may   there will be a debate on miner and mining community and a debate on the bbc mid term charter review if we be give the time for   thursday may we have offer a debate on the parliamentary and health service ombudsman ’s report on woman ’s state pension age which be extremely well subscribe and if we be give   may there will be a debate on uk arm export to israel and inequality in dementia service 
 in further good news we have fill up the business for westminster hall on tuesdays until the whitsun recess with debate on cost associate with illegal immigration the impact of smartphone on social medium and the introduction of uk make emission bus in the uk on thursday we have debate on global health agency and on global intergenerational week the backbench business committee have be aim to get as many debate on the agenda as possible but as always if member have request they should please submit they by friday lunchtime and we will deal with they as appropriate 
 over the weekend i speak to a number of woman who be frightened of walk home after dark the fact be that the rise in crime in london have be dramatic the rise in knife crime have be dramatic and the   metropolitan police be the only force in the country that have fail to meet its recruitment target could we have a statement next week on action that the government will take to ensure that we have the police that be need in london to make woman and man feel safe when they be travel home 
 i thank my hon friend for step up and make that very helpful announcement on all backbench business in the forthcoming week i be sure the whole house will want to send good wish to   the hon member for gateshead ian mearns   and his family it be very good news that his daughter be make a recovery we send all our love to he and his family 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to point to the failing of the london mayor london have get less safe and crime be on the rise particularly violent crime and it be no surprise to hear that my hon friend ’s constituent be very concerned about that unfortunately many of the area he mention be the responsibility of the mayor of london but there be something that not just government members but the general london public can do in the come day and that be vote in a new mayor of london i think people will agree that you be indeed safer with susan 
 i call scottish national party spokesman 
 i associate myself with the comment about the dreadful news from wales and of course those about frank field 
 i make no apology for start this week where i finish last week the leader of the house may recall that i ask for a debate on the new brexit border control due to come into effect next week answer come there none but thing become clear later on as the financial times report within hour of my question 
 the uk government have tell the country ’s port authority that it will not turn on critical health and safety check for eu import because of the risk of significant disruption the new border system will not be fully ready 
 it be be call a phase implementation approach very yes minister speak from some hapless civil servant try to excuse the such delay more delay more confusion for business but no statement from the minister 
 scotland ’s importer exporter agricultural and hospitality sector and business large and small be all at their wit end because the tories insist on impose their brexit folly on we brexit be estimate to be cost salmon producer the large food exporter in the uk up to £ a year tourism in the highland and island have be devastate with staff shortage affect of business to date brexit be name as the main difficulty for of business in scotland trade overseas 
 before the late delay be announce the chair of the chilled food association which represent trade and professional organisation say that every time there be a proposal from the uk government people invest in paperwork and computer system and then the government change the rule again since £ will have be spend on just export health certificate a recent report find that the uk   economy have shrink by £ with the average citizen around £ bad off thank to good old brexit that scotland do not vote for 
 yet this place shut its eye to the devastating impact that brexit have have on people ’s life and business scot be accustomed to be ignore overrule and treat with disdain by this government but be drag out of the eu against our will have be an economic and social disaster for we no party can claim to be the party of business and back brexit so i urge the leader of the house to overcome the vow of silence an omertà between the tory and labour party and tell we when we can have an urgent debate on the effect of brexit start with this disastrous delay tory trade tax 
 despite what the hon lady say we have now become the large exporter in the world i will not annoy the hon lady by list how well the nation be do on trade fishing and many of the thing that we want to see improve to give people new opportunity because i know it would irritate she it be no surprise to i that snp members do not want to face reality they do not want to engage with the trader support service that be support business very well or with the fact that we be create an interface directly between the it system in business and the legacy government system such as his majesty ’s revenue and customs so that we reduce bureaucracy for those trader and support they in meet their ambition it be no surprise that snp members do not want to deal with the reality of the situation give the reality of the situation now for the snp a minority administration with their failing and some very serious issue that we all know be now subject to prosecution as well as investigation not even the greens want anything to do with they 
 may i pay tribute to lord field he be of my political hero and i meet he when i be a year old student along with my right hon friend   the member for harlow robert halfon as his constituency member of parliament i be delighted to inform the house that he continue to correspond with i on the issue and campaign that he care about until the very end of his life 
 as part of our national health strategy we rightly emphasise the importance of eat healthily and take physical exercise but we do not take sleep into account today the sleep charity publish dream of change a manifesto for sleep which highlight the serious mental and physical health problem that a lack of sleep can cause among both child and adult would my right hon friend consider a debate in government time on the vital public health importance of get more sleep 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that incredibly important issue we could run a positive public health campaign rather than just tell people not to drink or smoke we should also ask they whether they have have enough sleep we should be proud of the research that have be do in the uk professor russell foster at oxford university have do amazing work   which be lead to improvement in the general population but particularly among veteran who have suffer blast injury and lose their sight i would be happy to raise what my hon friend have say with the secretary of state for health and social care because i think that that would be a very good initiative 
 i associate myself with the comment about our old friend frank whom i know for many year 
 it be widely acknowledge in this chamber and elsewhere that iran be run and control by a bunch of clerical fascist and homicidal maniacs who have now take to attack people on british soil which be a bit of a break with what use to happen however there be a difference of opinion over how we should respond especially with regard to the islamic revolutionary guard corps i know that we have have plenty of statement and urgent question about iran but could we have a statement next week 
 the point raise by the hon gentleman be a regular theme at business question and throughout the week these be very serious matter and he be right to point out that this activity be not limit to the strait of hormuz or other part of the world but be take place on british soil our citizen be be threaten and many representative such as councillor and other who hold public office be have to be protect as a result of the appalling campaign against they and the death threat i will ensure that those at the foreign commonwealth and development office have hear what the hon gentleman have say and will encourage they to update the house 
 the united kingdom have a vibrant classic car sector but the driver and vehicle licensing agency seem to have take against it somewhat force car that have be subject to modest repair or even heinous crime such as the fitting of seatbelt to have q plate as i know from attend the heritage matters insight day event hold by the historic classic vehicles alliance during the easter recess and indeed from my own inbox the problem seem to be get bad i have raise it numerous time in the transport committee but it be not go away may we have a debate in government time to iron out these issue and ensure that the department for transport get a grip on the dvla ’s attitude to the classic car sector 
 i would be happy to raise the hon gentleman ’s point with the transport secretary as transport question will not take place again until   may this be not just about people ’s personal vehicle it concern an enormous number of uk business we have a huge export market and britain be of course very well know for its motor sport and motor in general i congratulate my hon friend on his campaign on this important matter and will ensure that all relevant secretaries of state have hear what he have say 
 frank field be a great mate we even forgave he in the end for his daft view on brexit he be a great guy and a great colleague and we miss he dearly 
 i genuinely seek the guidance of the leader of the house this morning i be not try to make a political point we have work very hard to ensure that standard in this house be of the high order and my hon friend   the member for rhondda sir chris bryant   have play a big part in that this parliament ’s reputation be base on standard here and in the upper house be it possible for she to have a conversation with her senior colleague in the house of lords i do not know whether she see a recent article in the sunday times that say the earl of oxford and asquith a former mi6 chief in moscow be a lobbyist for a man in the us who be believe to be involve in russian gang crime everybody know there be a group in the upper house that be very close to russia could we look into this issue it will impinge on parliament if it be not deal with 
 be the hon gentleman relate his question to the business of the house 
 oh and may we have an early debate on it 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman i hope that other will follow his learn example 
 i will answer the hon gentleman with the same good faith with which he ask his question if he have serious concern about anyone on the parliamentary estate he need to raise they formally and in the appropriate way with the house authority that would be the right course of action if he have genuine concern about anyone 
 i do not quite agree with the last answer give by the leader of the house we know who we be talk about and i agree with those on the opposition side of the house 
 may we have a debate in government time on the rivers development in mid devon i have mention this before which be now become a cover up and a financial scandal the chairman of the scrutiny committee have do a runner and slunk off to rent accommodation in bampton which be a disgrace i be afraid this be now become a serious issue for local government mid devon council have no scrutiny no responsibility and absolutely no idea what it be do in government time can we talk about local government that be not take its financial responsibility seriously and be cover up major issue 
 i be sorry to hear about what sound like a very concern issue that be affect my hon friend ’s constituent give that the next question to the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities be not until june i will ensure that he have hear what my hon friend have say today 
 may i add my condolence to the family of lord field he be an exceptional man and an outstanding politician and i have the privilege of know he for year while he be still a member of parliament 
 working or study in other country have wide range benefit for young people perhaps the sad outcome of brexit be that the number of young people from the uk work and study in eu country and the number of young people from the eu work and study here have dramatically reduce in order to reverse this worrying trend last week the eu propose youth mobility visa but the government reject they outright even though they would have bring a wide range and welcome boost to our economy i mean that in good faith can we please have a statement from the government on why that proposal be reject outright and how they propose to boost youth mobility between eu country and the uk 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this issue she will know that our approach have be to widen opportunity for our citizen and give they more choice about where they might want to study abroad i think that the secretary of state do put out a statement explain why the scheme be not deem to be in our interest and it be due to the fact that it be not go to be reciprocal 
 this be the time in my year as a member of parliament that i have raise this sort of frustration and complaint so i hope my right hon friend realise how serious it be 
 over a month ago i write to the foreign secretary about a british citizen whose husband be be hold illegally in a foreign country without trial i have try repeatedly to ask the foreign secretary for a reply and i go to the deputy foreign secretary to chase thing up but still nothing i find it wholly unacceptable that the foreign secretary have not reply to i in over a month of correspondence when i be raise the right of a british citizen whose husband be be keep in appalling circumstance abroad it be his duty and responsibility to respond in writing to member in a timely fashion will my right hon friend the leader of the house please take this issue up for i with the foreign office

 this be not acceptable minister be politically accountable to parliament this be a matter of extreme interest to the house and it be part of minister legal responsibility that they be politically accountable will the right hon lady advise i on what step she can take next week to ensure that a minister answer for the judgment the government have make 
 i know that the right hon gentleman take those new responsibility very seriously as he know both departments have make it clear that they be perfectly happy to attend and be scrutinise in respect of those decision and to answer question on the government ’s position day notice sound like a long time but he will understand that the ministers in question may have travel obligation and might therefore have be unable to make the specific date i know that he know last friday that they would not be able to attend the session that take place yesterday i also know that the deputy foreign secretary speak to he and i hope reassure the right hon gentleman of his intention to field a minister for his committee even though i be not tell the right hon gentleman anything he do not already know i hope that reassure he that minister do intend to attend i be very sure that no stunt such as those that take place yesterday will be require to get they to do so
