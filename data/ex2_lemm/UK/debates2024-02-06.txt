per cent of the fund recover from the loan charge so far about £ in total have come from the employee therefore those who be run those scheme so the hon lady be mischaracterise where we have go so far there have be criminal conviction so far other be in place i repeat what i say to the opposition spokesman   the hon member for ealing north james murray early if they be that concerned about ensure we go after the wrongdoer they would have vote with we last night in the finance bill 
 per cent of the fund recover from the loan charge so far about £ in total have come from the employer therefore those who be run those scheme so the hon lady be mischaracterise where we have go so far there have be criminal conviction so far other be in place i repeat what i say to the opposition spokesman   the hon member for ealing north james murray early if they be that concerned about ensure we go after the wrongdoer they would have vote with we last night in the finance bill 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what recent step he have take to ensure fairness in the application of the tax system 
 regard fairness we have a progressive tax system where the top of income tax payer pay nearly half of all income tax while the top pay more than in addition the national insurance reform announce at the autumn statement cut taxis for people that package also strengthen the fiscal position by help taxpayer to get their taxis right while bear down on the small minority who seek to avoid pay their fair share 
 the minister talk about tax cut but in april most household in this country will receive a increase in their council tax that be not because local council have mismanage their finance but because after year of austerity the local government finance system be essentially break and rely on a regressive and unfair council tax why in the autumn statement do the chancellor freeze the budget of the department for levelling up housing and communities for the whole of the next parliament lead the office for budget responsibility to forecast a furth £ rise in council tax do that not show that the chancellor have no regard at all for council and the service they provide or be he simply defer a problem that his government have create for the next government to sort out 
 i be afraid that be a ridiculous characterisation we on this side of the house care include about our vibrant important local council that be precisely why they just receive an additional £ and future spending will be a matter for future fiscal event 
 i be a strong believer in fairness in taxation would my hon friend care to advise the house about who would bear the heavy burden of taxation should his majesty ’s government choose to adopt the £ spending commitment that the labour party announce on the radio this morning 
 my hon friend make an important point of course we never know from day to day exactly what labour ’s policy be and i understand there be even difference among its front benchers at the moment but we hear a firm commitment without any promise at all about where the money would come from we therefore know where it would come from it would come out of taxpayer pocket or further borrowing which be defer taxation everybody will pay for it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the labour party have set out clear proposal to close tax loophole on non dom private school and private equity to give a much need boost to our public service will the treasury minister confirm whether the government have assess or plan to assess the merit of such a policy 
 i be pleased to hear the hon gentleman ’s enthusiasm for close down tax loophole and go after the abuser it beg the question why labour do not vote in favour of the finance bill last night which include measure along those line 
 that be a short answer but the answer to the wrong question perhaps the minister can have a go while he be think about the answer i point out that the comptroller and auditor general have highlight that the government be waste up to £ a year on mismanage procurement and governance of major project do the minister agree that the conservative chancellor and his predecessor have have to raise taxis so much partly because they be waste so many billion of taxpayer money each and every year 
 the reason we have have to raise taxis be £ of support during the pandemic which i do not hear the opposition oppose and an additional £ to help people during the cost of living crisis which i do not hear the opposition oppose we therefore have to increase taxis out of necessity but we reduce they out of choice which be exactly what we be do labour increase taxis out of necessity and then continue to increase they out of choice 
 if he will make an assessment of the impact of his department ’s tax policy on economic growth in scotland during this parliament 
 the government remain committed to increase economic growth in scotland and right across the uk as part of growth measure in the autumn statement the government introduce tax policy that be project to stimulate economic growth in scotland and across the country that include make full expensing permanent and the large ever cut to employee and self employ national insurance contribution which mean more people work 
 the ey independent treasury economic model club forecast publish yesterday find that the uk ’s growth forecast of this year be only slightly outperform by the even more disappointing growth in scotland give this parliament have hike taxis time and the scottish national party now think that those on modest income in scotland should pay even more tax do the minister agree that the people of scotland be simply pay the price for government with no economic credibility 
 no i do not agree the hon member should be aware that the oecd suggest that in the come year we will be grow fast than france italy and germany of course the government have a strong track record against our oecd friend over the last year and scotland benefit from this economic growth 
 as in scotland business rate be devolve in wales with business rate relief set to fall from to business in wales will pay almost twice as much as in england do my hon friend agree that the welsh labour government should be support local business such as the kinmel arms in moelfre and not increase the number of senedd members by a staggering 
 my hon friend put it well of course we have see the considerable protection and support give in retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief in england that have not be extend to the same extent in wales and scotland fail to extend it as well she make an important point 
 we go back to scotland i call the snp spokesperson 
 contrary to what the minister say oecd forecast show that the uk will have the low growth in the g20 and the high inflation in the g7 minister like to pretend that there be no real cost of living crisis but there be and it be bite hard how long will minister and their labour counterpart continue to peddle the fantasy that brexit be somehow good for the scottish people 
 i be afraid that the thing that would most impoverish the people of scotland be separation from the uk after year of snp rule long than the conservatives in england gdp per head in scotland be low productivity be fall employment be low and inactivity be high that be not exactly a proud record 
 the minister talk about gdp the office for budget responsibility forecast that gdp in the uk will be low in the long term due to brexit meanwhile independent ireland in the eu be boom with a giant fiscal surplus give that the tories labour and the lib dems be all now champion of brexit be it not the case that the only way for scotland to rejoin the eu be through become an independent country 
 the hon gentleman know that the imf have forecast we great growth than france italy and germany over the next few year if he be so enthusiastic about support growth include help   business across the united kingdom perhaps scottish national party member could have join we in the voting lobby last night instead of vote against for example full expensing and investment in research and development they vote against that how on earth be that in the interest of their constituent 
 what fiscal step his department be take to help increase the level of business investment 
 mr speaker may i add my comment to yours yesterday about his majesty the king i wish he and his family well as well as salute his courage in be so open about his condition 
 at the autumn statement last year i announce an ambitious growth package which will boost business investment by about £ a year we be make full expensing permanent which the cbi welcome as a game changer that will fire up the british economy 
 i also welcome those measure business rate be among the big issue for small business in meon valley so i welcome the chancellor ’s £ package of support in the autumn statement however follow covid there be a number of empty office where landlord be still have to pay business rate do the chancellor have any measure to support those who be struggle with a lack of income to pay business rate 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the pressure cause by business rate that be why in the autumn statement we introduce the discount for retail hospitality and leisure all i would say be that the reason we be able to introduce those large cut in business rate be that we do not embark on a spending spree of £ a year which be labour ’s policy on mondays wednesdays and fridays but not apparently on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays 
 i will try to be nice to the chancellor but he seem to be live in a parallel universe if he come to huddersfield and talk to my business and manufacturer he would find they at the low ebb that i can ever remember it be time that the stimulus be there to make people invest and create job get on with it chancellor 
 if that be be nice i be relieved that i have not see the other type of question that the hon member ask i agree that manufacturing be central to our economic fortune which be why it be good news that last year we overtake france to become the large manufacturer in the world but we have go even far in the autumn statement we announce a £ manufacturing strategy to give further support to make our manufacturer the good in the world 
 yesterday we have the pleasure of discuss the very many benefit from the autumn statement include research and development grant and simplification of the tax code however   i wonder whether the chancellor might go a little far and see whether cut vat for the tourism and hospitality sector perhaps by over year would be advisable to help the economy across the united kingdom 
 my hon friend be an assiduous supporter of the many pub restaurant and shop in devon and i commend he for that support we will of course keep all those measure under review ahead of the budget 
 hair salon be a vital mainstay of our high street but many employer be worried about the sustainability of their business a huge issue be their tax bill with vat a significant concern make further business investment very difficult cut vat to would make an important difference to local business high street and apprentice training will the chancellor look at do that to support all our local economy 
 i will always look at anything that help business to grow and expand i set up and run my own business for year can i gently say to the hon lady that it be slightly incongruous to argue for low taxis when the snp have give scotland the high taxis in the united kingdom 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of the loan charge on level of bankruptcy 
 i have hear the concern express by hon member on the impact of the loan charge and i have push his majesty ’s revenue and customs for firm assurance on the safeguard that it have in place no will be force by hmrc to sell their main home or access their pension fund early to pay their loan charge debt nor have hmrc petitioned for bankruptcy which would be only a last resort and be in nobody ’s interest there be substantial support in place to help people in debt include agree time to pay arrangement with they 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that answer and his engagement with the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group include a meeting this evening with its officer in an internal document that surface as part of the morse review hmrc admit to around bankruptcy from the loan charge can the minister tell the house why that figure have never be give publicly by hmrc and what the figure be today 
 again i thank my hon friend for champion this area and his great concern for the human story behind the difficult circumstance result from some of these scheme as i have say i be constantly seek reassurance from hmrc on this matter and my understanding be that where bankruptcy have occur it have often be because of requirement outside of the loan charge not from hmrc indeed some people have declare bankruptcy of their own volition however if my hon friend have evidence to the contrary i would like to know about it 
 the original treasury impact statement for the loan charge state that it would have no material impact on 
 family formation stability or breakdown 
 yet there have be countless divorce family break up mental health breakdown and bankruptcy and at least suicide that impact statement be grossly wrong but also surely negligent we now need a full investigation include how and why parliament be so mislead over the dangerous and unfair loan charge 
 i hear the house ’s concern about this issue on which we have a debate not so long ago of course the suicide the hon gentleman mention concern we and independent review have take place however i want to provide the house and anybody listen with reassurance that the good thing to do if people have concern be to engage with hmrc because very generous and long term plan can be put in place to help people to repay as i say there be fear out there there be a bit of scaremongering that home be be take over or people be have to give up pension that be not the case engagement with hmrc to establish reasonable time to pay would therefore be reassure for many of the people who fear much bad consequence my appeal be to engage with hmrc 
 the government ’s approach to the loan charge have become a nightmare for ordinary people across the country who be the victim of mis selling and face financial ruin the torment and devastating reality be the clear possible proof that the government need to think again those face the loan charge ordeal can not bear to hear yet again that the morse review be the final word on this matter will the minister finally agree today to commission a new truly independent review 
 we have an independent review in under lord morse the government accept of its recommendation the review have take place but as i have say repeatedly i be challenge hmrc and listen to colleague if action need to be take i will take it but i do not believe that there be a case for another review because we have already have and the government have already take action 
 what step he be take to help support homeowner with mortgage 
 as the house know the path to lower interest rate be through low inflation which be why the government be fully commit to support the bank of england to get inflation back down to its target if mortgage borrower fall into financial difficulty our mortgage charter which cover about of the market include new flexibility to help customer manage their repayment on top of the financial conduct authority ’s rule on how lender must treat borrower 
 give that a lot of mortgage payer be suffer because of the rapid hike in interest rate will the government continue to talk to the bank of   england and mortgage lender to see what can be do to bring interest rate down that would help most people 
 i completely agree on the absolute need to drive mortgage rate down which be why we be support the bank of england ’s independent remit to bring interest rate down we be also ensure that we do not do thing to make inflation bad such as add £ to government borrowing which would increase inflation 
 the rate for a year fix mortgage remain more than double the level of december more than borrower be set to see their monthly payment rise by £ or even £ a month government ministers be have to resign because of increase mortgage payment how do the chancellor expect people in scotland to cope with increase mortgage rate if his minister can not 
 i would say thing in response to the hon lady the good thing we can do be to help people with the cost of living not increase their taxis as the snp in scotland propose and to maintain—[interruption i will not get bore of say this secondly we maintain our support for the bank of england drive inflation down we have more than halve it we will continue to do that and interest rate will come right down 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of economic growth forecast for and 
 we announce growth measure in the autumn statement take together with the measure in the spring budget the independent office for budget responsibility say that they will have the big impact on output that it have ever measure in a fiscal event increase gdp by by 
 the uk economy be set for slow growth than previously think the international monetary fund predict that next year we will have the bad growth in the g7 in scotland the snp have increase taxis which we have hear about already and scot now face band stagnation there be even bad and business and household in my constituency need reassurance will the chancellor tell we what he will do to give confidence to people up and down the country that we will soon see economic growth 
 may i gently correct the hon lady on the imf it say that over the next year uk growth will be high than in germany france italy and japan i agree about snp tax rise but i point out that the liberal democrats have some tax rise of their own they want to increase capital gain tax which would be incredibly damaging for scotland ’s financial service industry which employ thousand of people 
 have the chancellor have the opportunity to look at the new conservatives budget proposal a budget for family   it have a point plan with point to help unlock growth particularly for the many small family run business in place such as stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke those plan to increase the vat registration threshold to £ and to abolish the ir35 reform would surely help we unlock the growth of our great nation 
 i have be talk with my hon friend about these issue recently in fact we be discuss increase the vat threshold only last night such be the interesting evening i have in this job we will look seriously and carefully at any measure that help small business they be the lifeblood of the country 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on living standard 
 what step his department be take to support household with the cost of living 
 the government stand by household with of europe ’s large support package worth on average £ per uk household but we all know that the key to reduce cost of living pressure be to bring down inflation which we have more than halve deliver on the prime minister ’s promise 
 family in luton and bedfordshire and indeed the rest of the country be bad off because of year of economic chaos and incompetence under the conservatives do the minister concede that even if the government ’s inflation target be meet family will still be pay £ a month more for their household bill than they be just month ago 
 year of the conservatives have halve unemployment and increase employment by crucially poverty be down we have few people in poverty now than in include child and pensioner that be a legacy to be proud of 
 the joseph rowntree foundation ’s report on poverty in the uk in reiterate that consistently the demographic with the high poverty rate be child although of the child in my constituency live in poverty the scottish government be do what they can with their limited power via the scottish child payment will the chancellor and his team use their power to make a concerted and determined effort to tackle the scourge of poverty which be so damaging to our child 
 i reiterate we have few child in poverty now than in in addition the national insurance contribution cut that we have introduce have be show to cut child poverty dramatically crucially the lead indicator of whether a child be in poverty be whether their parent be in work and that be what we have deliver over this parliament—[interruption yes it be it absolutely be get more people into work will help to solve child poverty 
 the british public be still struggle with the conservative cost of living crisis and the government be now force up council tax last week for the time in my life a conservative mp speak for i when he say 
 there ’ almost no point chop £ off tax bill nationally if you ’re add on to it with council tax 
 labour members agree with   the hon member for mansfield ben bradley do the chief secretary agree with her hon friend and colleague 
 council tax be a matter for council but we put in place a limit which i do not believe exist under the previous labour government more than that the most difficult thing for council and consumer more broadly be the £ worth of tax rise that labour be plan in government 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of remove the cap on banker bonus on the financial sector 
 remove the banker bonus cap be a decision make by the independent prudential regulation authority which have long say that the cap be completely ineffective it do not limit pay or make bank safe 
 the cap on banker bonus might have be a great newspaper headline but it do little to tackle the city ’s excess financial institution quickly change remuneration package and structure so that risk taker still receive substantial pay off sometimes even take they through offshore mechanism do the chancellor agree that what we need be enhance regulation to mitigate excessive risk take in the square mile that could require beyond merely cap bonus a move toward an alignment of interest focus on the form of bonus payment share allocation and deferred amount and robust clawback mechanism for those who have behave maliciously in order to deter misconduct in the square mile more effectively 
 i suspect that when the hon gentleman table his question he be not expect that the big supporter of abolish the banker bonus cap be not the chancellor but the shadow chancellor i hear what he say and indeed those be some of the reason we abolish it because it be not work if labour be go to change its mind on that policy may i ask just to take a totally random example when will it change its mind about the plan £ of additional borrowing 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the potential merit of abolish non domiciled tax status 
 the government want the uk to have a fair but internationally competitive tax system design to bring in talented individual and investment that contribute to the growth of the economy non dom   play an important role in fund our public service through their tax contribution they pay tax on their uk source income and gain in the same way as everyone else 
 the minister talk of fairness but the fact be that during the cost of live crisis nearly a more struggling pensioner will start pay income tax because of the freeze in personal allowance rate while the government protect some of the rich member of society through non domicile status scrap that status could bring the treasury an extra £ a year why do the government not do the right thing and bring in that extra money to protect pensioner and the low pay 
 non dom contribute about £ in taxis in and have contribute to investment to the tune of £ since the hon gentleman will be well aware that scrap their status would not be risk free in a world in which people can be quite mobile and could damage the uk ’s competitiveness as for the need for other support that be exactly why we have be reduce national insurance rate for example 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate during this parliament on household disposable income 
 mortgage interest rate have fall by more than basis point from their peak in the summer none the less the government have prioritise support for household that be vulnerable to cost of living pressure we have introduce of europe ’s large support package and it be partly thank to those measure that real income have prove more resilient than be anticipate in the quarter of real household disposable income per person be just low than in q4 versus the office for budget responsibility ’s autumn statement forecast that it would be almost low 
 i thank the minister for his answer but since his party ’s disastrous mini budget fiasco under the previous prime minister food price have soar extreme damage have be do to the economy and mortgage have skyrocket every month people be have to remortgage the average monthly rate have rise by £ and people will have to remortgage this year overall after year of a conservative government people be more than £ less well off than they be on pre-2010 trend be it not time that the chancellor and his ministerial team look again at the possibility of additional support for those who be face mortgage and other financial distress the chancellor be frown but it be time that he take further action to support people in distress 
 this government have introduce of europe ’s large support package worth more than £ during to that be an average of £ per household the point about mortgage rate be that they go up everywhere across the world to a   high level than our in many jurisdiction such as the united states i have already mention the work that we have do on the mortgage charter help hundred of thousand of people to manage their mortgage but the critical thing that we need to do be bring inflation down she need to talk to her shadow chancellor and the shadow treasury team about their plan which would make inflation high 
 order i be not sure that she be a good word to use to other member 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on funding for a uk wide infected blood compensation scheme 
 whether he have have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential cost to the exchequer of compensation for people infect and affect by contaminate blood and blood product 
 this be an appalling tragedy and my thought remain with all those affect we understand the strength of feeling and the need for action the government have accept the moral case for compensation and have acknowledge that justice need to be deliver for victim as such the government intend to respond in full to sir brian langstaff ’s recommendation for wide compensation follow the publication of the inquiry ’s final report in may this year 
 the minister ’s answer that question have bring forth another question the chancellor be previously secretary of state in the department of health and of his former colleague all give a commitment to address the issue now that the chancellor be in a position to do something about that how long be it go to take as this government ’s day be number the difficulty i have be whether this will be in place before we have an election will they ensure that the commitment be there 
 i know that the hon gentleman have a lifelong friend who have suffer from this terrible tragedy and i can reassure he that we be determined to do right by the victim and those who have tragically lose their love one the victim of the infected blood scandal deserve justice and recognition on his question on timing government of all colour have fail to sort this out but i be pleased that the interim payment at least have be pay as i have say the government be commit to the moral case for compensation and we be expect the final report very soon we will move as quickly as possible afterwards 
 we have have sir brian langstaff ’s recommendation since april mrs dorricott the wife of the chancellor ’s constituent mike tell the inquiry that the chancellor when he be health secretary tell mr dorricott 
 do not worry about this we ’ll sort it 
 he be now the chancellor with his hand on the purse string so will he now through his colleague the chief secretary to the treasury confirm that the government have identify the contingency to pay the compensation to the people hit by the infected blood scandal 
 i can confirm that we be work with the cabinet office and the department of health and social care to ensure that we can respond as quickly as possible once the inquiry report 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 small business be the engine that drive our economy and we support they to thrive use lever right across government our small business rate relief mean that of business property in england already pay no business rate we provide tax relief benefit small and medium sized enterprise such as the annual investment allowance and employment allowance and we support investment in sme through british business bank programme and a variety of other support measure 
 what consideration have be give to reduce employer national insurance contribution to help small business to sustain employment follow the record increase in the national living wage from april particularly in the tourism and hospitality industry 
 my hon friend and i have speak about these policy area on a number of occasion in term of support small business the employment allowance enable business with employer national insurance contribution bill of £ or less to claim up to £ off those bill that be increase in april from £ to £ so the small of business have already be take out of pay employer national insurance contribution and many of those be in the hospitality and leisure sector we always keep policy under review and i know that my hon friend will always be lobby on this issue 
 become an entrepreneur in this country have become increasingly purgatorial over the past year do the minister agree that what small businessman want be not more handout and allowance from the government but low simple and flat taxis and less regulation not more they want the government to get off their back and shove off 
 that be very interestingly put by my right hon friend i completely agree with his instinct though and those instinct be completely share on the conservative benches when we be able to reduce tax and release the entrepreneurial spirit independence and innovation that exist right across the uk the country thrive and all of we thrive 
 in the former chancellor set a public sector net investment target of of gdp but that be abandon after the debacle and today we have the low business investment among advanced economy partly because of that failure on public sector net investment can the minister offer we any reassurance on the future trajectory of public sector net investment 
 of course labour leave we in pretty terrible financial circumstance back in instead its figure be up £ in real term at the start of the next parliament an increase of in real term or annually the big ever publish 
 small business be the backbone of our economy but they have a constant problem with late payment which increase by last year and that be drive many of they into insolvency give that the government be a major contractor what be they do through project bank account to reduce the impact of late payment 
 the hon lady make an important point and i know there be agreement on this issue across the chamber we make statement last year along those line put particular pressure on the public sector i be sure there will be continue pressure on the private sector too 
 what step his department be take to support growth in the financial service sector 
 the government be take ambitious step to grow the uk ’s world lead financial service sector with widespread industry support to take example reform to solvency ii will help to spur a vibrant innovative and internationally competitive insurance sector the reform will unlock £ worth of productive investment to grow the economy in every constituency over the next year 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer but clearly to grow the financial service industry investor must have confidence that their money be safe i have write to he about the woodford equity scandal of which there be many thousand of victim across the country the financial conduct authority refuse to intervene so will he now intervene and take action to ensure that the investor get at least a large part of their money back 
 i thank my hon friend for his question for write to i and for stand up for the right of his constituent it be important the house know that over of investor vote to accept the scheme of arrangement it be now up to the court to decide whether to approve it and i therefore will not comment on it any far i be happy to be in constant dialogue with he on this matter as on many other 
 as the minister know the northern ireland assembly sit for the time today to make a change for northern ireland we    would very much like to be part of the financial service sector so what can he and the government do to support the northern ireland assembly in relation to the financial service sector and to ensure that we in northern ireland can be part of this great country of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland always well together 
 i strongly echo the hon gentleman ’s sentiment i be very happy to engage with he and his colleague from northern ireland to see what more i can do in the treasury to work with he and indeed the northern ireland executive particularly to encourage our financial service institution to invest more in northern ireland i be very happy to discuss way in which we can do that 
 what recent fiscal step he have take to help tackle regional economic inequality 
 this government be commit to support all part of the united kingdom in october we announce the £ long term plan for town which give town up to £ of endowment style funding we be deliver an ambitious programme of investment zone and devolution deal we ae continue to support local growth through the uk share prosperity fund and we be invest billion to improve local transport connection in our region outside london 
 by their own measure the government be fail on almost half of their levelling up mission in the east of england meanwhile the cambridge sub region which be a net contributor to the exchequer have vital transport project on hold or await finance when will the treasury stop stall growth and give power back to the region which know well what need to be do in their area 
 this government be commit to level up by boost growth raise living standard and spread opportunity throughout the country in several different way the hon gentleman talk about give more power to local area and he will know that the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority be get a £ devolution deal he will also know that cambridge receive some £ as part of the share prosperity fund to spend on local project i reject his assertion the people of cambridge be benefit from this government 
 the way to reduce regional inequality be to ensure that growth happen everywhere across the country way to do that be to support small and medium sized enterprise and community enterprise which be particularly locate in under serve region i commend the government for the recovery loan scheme which have be a lifeline to many small business and community enterprise can the minister tell we whether that scheme be likely to be renew hundred of million of pound of private investment be wait on the government to make a decision 
 my hon friend have a long history as a great champion for community organisation i will write to he on his specific question 
 what recent progress he have make on raise the level of the national living wage 
 the government be commit to end low pay from   april the national living wage will increase by to £ that represent an increase of more than £ to the annual earning of a full time national living wage worker and it be expect to benefit about worker 
 i congratulate the government on increase the national living wage because that will make a huge difference however after speak to not only those in the public sector at the like of my local leicestershire county council and hinckley and bosworth borough council but small business in the private sector i know that there be a trade off because they have to foot that wage bill what step can the government take to make sure that those business and the public sector have the money to pass on to those who be earn so well 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i will take the part of it in turn the government continue to support business with the high cost through a generous package of support at the autumn statement we show our commitment to support small business by extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief and by freeze the small business multipli which will protect more than property from the multipli increase yesterday we announce a wide range package of support worth £ for local council include £ of new funding for social care 
 i understand that concern be express some year ago about how a significant increase in the minimum wage may well have a knock on effect particularly on the hospitality sector give that that do not come about with previous living wage increase will the chief secretary commit her government to ensure that future increase will be monitor closely to enable and assist small business to increase wage level systematically and sustainably over the long term 
 i can commit to the hon gentleman that we be absolutely monitor the effect but as i say a good package of support be in place for business 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i would like to update the house on a couple of datum release publish since our last oral question total greenfield foreign direct investment since have not just be high than that of france germany and italy but in   the past year have overtake that of china to be the high in the world yesterday ’s labour force survey say that unemployment fall to a quarterly average of mean that unemployment have halve and conservative government have oversee the creation of more than job every day since 
 can the treasury find fund for an increase pay offer for junior doctor i completely agree that we must safeguard the public finance and have regard to affordability but if ever a group deserve a pay rise it be junior doctor and we need to get the dispute settle 
 as my right hon friend know as health secretary i campaign for extra money for the nhs to make sure that we could pay nhs staff fairly but i do believe that junior doctor have have a very fair offer that be high than be recommend by the independent pay review body and be about double the rate of this year ’s predict inflation i know that the health secretary be willing to talk about anything else that could help make their working condition well 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 last week at prime minister ’s question when ask about the tory mortgage penalty the prime minister boast that someone come off a fix rate mortgage 
 will be able to save hundred of pound ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 but the small print be that they have to add many year to their mortgage people have be come off fix rate mortgage deal this year and last so do the chancellor agree with the prime minister that british homeowner have never have it so good 
 the way we be help family with mortgage be not just through the mortgage charter which be a lifeline to many family but by bring down inflation we have be have a few pop about labour ’s confusion about its £ policy but the real reason we be against it be that go on a borrowing splurge push up inflation push up interest rate and make mortgage more expensive 
 it be under a conservative government that interest rate inflation and mortgage cost have go up the government need to take responsibility because after year this out of touch government be make it hard for ordinary people to get on if the chancellor decide to campaign in next week ’s by election what will he say to the people in wellingborough who be remortgage and pay £ more on their mortgage every month and to the people in kingswood pay £ more a month because of the conservative mortgage penalty 
 what i will say to they be that responsible difficult decision the vast majority of which the shadow chancellor oppose have see the inflation rate more than halve and interest rate likely to have peak last year we build more house in year than in any single year under the previous labour government we be   do everything we can to help bring down mortgage rate but a £ borrowing spree will make they bad not well 
 in the government quite rightly set up the fund to compensate victim of the equitable life scandal notwithstanding the fact that the government do not give they enough money we know that the fund will not be fully spend on the people be compensate will my right hon friend ensure the fund be use for the benefit of the people who suffer in the scandal rather than be return to the treasury 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i will write to he with the specific of the answer 
 many of my constituent whose life have be destroy by the loan charge scandal feel the central injustice be that the government be focus on pursue the victim rather than the company responsible they be dismay to read recent allegation that individual link to such company have donate hundred of thousand of pound to the conservative party will the chancellor confirm why exactly the government be ignore the provider and operator of the scheme how many have be prosecute specifically for their involvement in disguised remuneration and not for other misdemeanour 
 per cent of the fund recover from the loan charge so far about £ in total have come from the employer therefore those who be run those scheme so the hon lady be mischaracterise where we have go so far there have be criminal conviction so far other be in place i repeat what i say to the opposition spokesman   the hon member for ealing north james murray early if they be that concerned about ensure we go after the wrongdoer they would have vote with we last night in the finance bill.[official report   february vol c. 12mc correction 
 at the meeting this evening will the financial secretary review the injustice that prevent loan charge victim who have engage with his majesty ’s revenue and customs but who can not agree with their assessment have any access to a tribunal 
 i know my right hon friend have be campaign on the issue i respect and appreciate the information he have provide and his contribution to the debate i assure he that i be in listen mode and look forward to the meeting this evening because i want to ensure that i hold hmrc to account to make sure everyone involve be treat fairly and respectfully 
 last week the international monetary fund join many other in urge the chancellor to prioritise public spending and investment above tax cut rather than seek to appease his back benchers with tax cut in the next budget will he finally deliver the level of public investment this country be cry out for   include in a nationwide energy efficiency programme that would shield household from volatile gas price get their fuel bill down for the long term and create job or be he yet another who be run scared of green investment 
 i be sure the hon lady understand that i can not talk about what will be in the budget ahead of the budget because no decision have be make i celebrate with she that the uk recently become the major economy in the world to decarbonise by more than ahead of france germany japan and the united states 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 if the chancellor have an ambition to spend an additional £ a year on something will he explain to the house what level of tax that would impose on ordinary household 
 i thank my hon friend for ask that question i be curious to know where that figure of £ have come from but as she have ask the question i will tell she that if we be to stick to the fiscal rule as the labour party claim it will do to increase spending by £ would mean increase income tax by or increase corporation tax which labour say it will cap by 
 with winter still upon we and fuel bill still rise ofgem be advise that the level of domestic energy debt be approach £ when people can not meet their current bill how can they possibly be expect to meet that level of arrear be it not time to fund a debt write off scheme as propose by national energy action and other fuel poverty campaigner before hypothermia and misery worsen 
 the government continue to work with ofgem in fact i meet the chief executive officer very recently ofgem continue to monitor the level of energy debt to ensure that consumer be protect the hon gentleman will know that last year the chancellor announce measure to ensure that household with prepayment meter pay no more than those with standard meter and that be on the back of the energy price guarantee which effectively pay of people ’s household energy bill 
 the chancellor will be aware of a proposal from the world war muslim memorial trust to establish a memorial at the national memorial arboretum honour an estimate muslims who have fight for the british armed force with ten of thousand of they pay the ultimate sacrifice previous budgets have support memorial that honour those who have give we the freedom that we enjoy may i ask the chancellor to personally consider this proposal and help make it a reality 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right we must remember and honour the sacrifice make by those of all nationality and religion who fight for our freedom include i believe nearly   muslims who die in the world war my official would be happy to engage with he to identify how good the government can help make this vision a reality 
 business owner and high street business in oswestry tell i that their big challenge be business rate in his upcoming budget will the chancellor consider a radical reform of business rate that put the high street on an even keel and on a level playing field with the online retailer 
 over the past few year we have help to support our high street by freeze multiplier and importantly target further relief at the retail hospitality and leisure sector frequent revaluation be now par for the course because of the recent change we have make 
 last july follow a debanking scandal i write to the economic secretary to the treasury about the risk of implement so call diversity equity and inclusion policy far from be inclusive their implementation have often be divisive yet labour put such policy at the heart of its financing and growth strategy just last week will my hon friend assure we that he will give clear direction to the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority to avoid all the risk of so call dei policy 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be study those policy carefully i be concerned about certain aspect of what be propose and i will be discuss the matter with the pra and the fca to make sure that we have sensible policy on this matter 
 at the autumn statement the chancellor announce that he would explore sell off the government ’s remain stake in natwest this year as it stand do he anticipate that this will result in a well or bad return for taxpayer compare with the previous sale 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question indeed the chancellor announce at the autumn statement last year that over the next month the government will consider sell share in natwest that be all subject to value for money concern and other matter as he will appreciate and it be market sensitive of course value for money will be at the heart of any consideration of the sale of share and the house will be keep fully inform over the come week and month 
 my right hon friend and his colleague will be aware of the challenge that business and household face in coastal community as the budget approach may i urge he to be ever mindful of how we maintain the vitality of the economy in our coastal area 
 i absolutely will that be a core part of the levelling up agenda and my hon friend will be pleased to know that since we start on that agenda    third of all new job create have be outside london and the south east we will continue to look at any proposal he may have in that respect 
 the government have deliberately create a funding model for university in which they be dependent on income from international student do the chancellor share my concern about ensure that nothing be do to undermine that income 
 the university sector be of the jewel of this country and i be proud that we have of the world ’s top university i be happy to look at any individual proposal from the hon gentleman 
 last june the exchequer secretary announce the energy security investment mechanism and i welcome the announcement in last november ’s autumn statement that the floor price would rise with inflation from april how and when will that be legislate for and will he look at alternative way of set that floor price other than the year reference period that be already use 
 the energy security investment mechanism be design as my hon friend point out to give more certainty not only to the oil and gas sector but to investor ensure that the energy profit levy be disapplied when price return to historically normal level to provide additional certainty on the back of urge from he and the industry we have agree to legislate for esim and will be announce that shortly 
 regardless of what the chancellor tell we the reality remain that people in bradford be bad off after year of this government healthcare gps and dentist be less accessible home be more expensive cold and riddle with mould job be less secure and badly pay with stagnate wage and household saving have be wipe out by rise food water energy and fuel bill ahead of the last budget he will deliver before the general election will the chancellor apologise for year of disaster that have devastate our community 
 let i tell the hon gentleman some positive message he can take home to his constituent in bradford violent crime and burglary have be halve school standard be up the nhs have more doctor and nurse than ever in history and real after tax income for people on the minimum wage or national living wage be up by if they be work full time 
 can my hon friend tell i how many staff be now employ across the departments base at the darlington economic campus what progress be be make on name the new building william mcmullen house 
 i can tell my hon friend that staff be employ across all departments at the darlington economic campus the treasury ’s aim be to reach full time staff by march and we be on track to meet that target the official name of the campus will be decide close to the delivery date and   will be consult on by the government property agency but we have hear very clearly his suggestion of william mcmullen house and we will consider that in due course 
 the chancellor know jolly well that in april sir brian langstaff make his final recommendation on compensation for those infected and affect by the contaminated blood scandal the chancellor also give evidence in july to sir brian and say that work be under way in december this house vote for a compensation body to be set up i would like the chancellor to answer my question please not a junior minister   and explain exactly what be go on in the treasury what work be be undertake and whether there will be an announcement in the budget 
 with great respect to the right hon lady who have campaign formidably on this issue i do not think she be give a fair representation of what the government have do i stand by every word i say as a back bencher and as chancellor i have try to do everything i can to speed the process up she have not mention that the government have already give £ to the family affect we have accept the moral importance of the duty to give compensation and we will now work with colleague in the other place to make her amendment workable 
 on a point of order mr speaker last week we see the lid lift off the secret empire of tory tees valley mayor lord houchen and the recommendation for improvement in the way he do business cover everything from poor decision making and a failure to provide his board with proper information to a lack of transparency and value for taxpayer money yesterday we learn that he have squander several pound of that money in lose a needless legal action against pd ports about access right 
 in the past the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have refuse to call in the national audit office to examine how the mayor do business opt instead for his own independent inquiry give this late revelation can you advise i mr speaker on how we can get the levelling up secretary to make a statement from the dispatch box about the late scandal so that we can persuade he of the need to get the nao in there to look at that colossal waste of public money and report his finding to parliament 
 i be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order i can assure he that i have have no indication that ministers intend to come to the house to make a statement on that matter but i be sure that the table office will be able to help and advise he on how to pursue it so i know that he will not give up yet

 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to publish proposal for a social tariff for energy 
 during the autumn statement of the government commit to develop a new approach to consumer protection in energy market in order to consider the good option include social tariff that commitment have be repeat multiple time since include by the prime minister in april the department for energy security and net reiterate that pledge by promise to consult on a social energy tariff in the summer of however despite multiple commitment and to the frustration of many a consultation never materialise and as we be now in february there be a significant risk that no new protection will be in place this year all the while low income and disabled household have struggle to heat their home over the festive period and the cold snap in january and winter be not over yet 
 i be introduce this bill in an attempt to fight for protection for the most vulnerable in society by their continue inaction on this matter the government continue to disregard the real and immediate concern of many people the great need for a social energy tariff be well demonstrate by the wide and varied support for its implementation disability group debt advice group politician from across the political spectrum consumer group local authority housing provider ofgem and even energy company be in favour of 
 such be the united front on this vital issue that it be even more surprising that the uk government have fail even to hold the consultation that they promise they have continue to bury their head in the sand despite the fact that national energy action energy action scotland age uk scope citizens advice moneysavingexpert and other organisation as well as mps write to the prime minister in september call for the promise consultation on a social energy tariff now we be into and the situation be catastrophic for low income household i thank the many organisation that have provide briefing on this topic both for my debate in november last and once again today 
 you may ask what a social energy tariff be mr speaker admittedly many different organisation and group have slight variation in their approach to such a tariff but in its most basic form which be universally agree upon it be a system of target support through a reduction in energy bill for vulnerable low income and disabled household in response to incredibly high energy bill as in household will spend more on energy bill this winter than they do last winter a figure that be close to half for the poor household the need for a social energy tariff can not be stress enough citizens advice research show that energy bill be high than in while other research suggest that high energy bill will become the new normal for the rest of the decade that highlight the desperate need for more meaningful long term support 
 when i hold a debate on this topic in november i be hearten by the cross party support and atmosphere in westminster hall as member from across the political spectrum present a united front on this matter each raise the need for long term target support for the most vulnerable household i be then immediately dishearten by the lack of a meaningful response from the under secretary of state for energy security and net   the hon member for derby north amanda solloway and now over month on from that debate and month on from the government ’s initial call for a consultation we be no far along 
 government members highlight that energy bill have fall from last year but that do not paint a picture of the reality for many even though we be tell that the energy market have stabilise bill remain sky high and winter be project to be much bad due to the huge level of energy debt accrue last year ofgem and citizens advice research show that energy debt be at the high level ever and ofgem ’s chief executive officer jonathan brearley have say that 
 we think there be a case for examine with urgency the feasibility of a social tariff 
 in the absence of an energy bill support scheme this winter many people have have to once again choose between heating and eating some condition require the constant charging of essential lifesaving equipment such as oxygen concentrator or feed pump it be dreadful that in the uk in some household have be force to self disconnect but that be simply not possible for many disabled household as they would not survive 
 a coalition of charity age uk scope fair by design mencap the motor neurone disease association and sense warn that the cost of living crisis be still add huge pressure to household finance with million face the dilemma of how they be go to pay their energy bill around in household in the uk that be of household or be experience fuel poverty this winter marie curie share with i the thought of rhian who be terminally ill 
 people with terminal illness feel the cold so much more than the healthy and need to heat their home people with terminal illness still have mortgage or rent and bill to pay there be no specific benefit offer to help terminally ill people so they have to carry on work with debilitate symptom i live with incurable terminal cancer my monthly heating bill be currently more expensive than my mortgage 
 a social energy tariff be the good way forward that tariff must be in addition to the warm home discount and the default tariff price cap it must be target at    the neediest and go beyond the benefit system as national energy action have estimate that approximately third of fuel poor household do not receive any social security payment all eligible consumer should be auto enrol use supplier exist datum and/or datum share by the department for work and pensions and the tariff must reduce cost for consumer to pre crisis level 
 we all know that a social tariff will cost money so it be essential that those cost be meet in a progressive manner if not the tariff risk create a significant cliff edge with those who narrowly miss out be much bad off national energy action citizens advice and centrica all say that an energy social tariff should be fund by general taxation to ensure the great level of fairness if that can not be do low income household on the fringe of support must be exempt from pay towards the social tariff the government have say that the new round of oil and gas licensing would raise money to reduce bill a social tariff would have numerous economic benefit it would also offset cost as illness bring on by have a cold and damp home cost the nhs between £ and £ a year far increase spending power could boost local economy with more money spend on our high street 
 million of the most vulnerable household and organisation span all of civil society be shout from the rafter for the implementation of a social energy tariff and the government can not and must not continue to bury their head in the sand a society should be measure by how it treat its most vulnerable and this government through inaction be continue to fail the most vulnerable household right across the country there be excess winter death last year in the uk that be down to people live in cold and damp house and that be why we need this bill million of people can not wait any long and that be why i be ask for support for this motion 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that marion fellows peter aldous john mcdonnell cat smith owen thompson kirsten oswald alison thewliss patricia gibson dave doogan david linden alyn smith and drew hendry present the bill 
 marion fellows accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday march and to be print bill 
 before we begin the debate on ban knife and sword from uk street i remind hon member that under the term of the house resolution on sub judice matter they should not refer to any individual case that be currently before the court 
 i call the shadow minister 
 pm 
 i beg to move 
 that this house condemn the government for oversee a per cent increase in knife crime since recognise the devastating impact that knife crime have on victim their family and the wide community acknowledge that the government recently announce measure to ban zombie knife and machete believe nonetheless that this legislation do not go nearly far enough mean that a number of dangerous type of knife and sword will remain legal and available on uk street therefore call on the government to address the shortcoming of the ban by extend it to cover ninja sword and consult on a further extension and far call for the government to establish an end to end review of online knife sale and introduce criminal liability for senior management of website which indirectly sell illegal knife online 
 ronan kanda be he go to get a playstation controller from his friend and be yard away from home when he be murder he be murder by teenager who use a ninja sword they have obtain that sword by buy it online use someone else ’s id to collect it they stab he in a case of mistaken identity this be a heartbreaking tragic story of a young life lose with a family trap in the most extraordinary grief and we be here today because it be time that parliament act to tackle knife crime head on 
 per cent that be how much knife crime have rise since accord to the late figure release by the office for national statistics and the home office in recent week that equate to a staggering violent and sexual offence commit involve a knife or sharp instrument in the past year there be a huge human cost to this with life lose in the year up to march the last complete datum available to we and roughly in murder involve a knife or sharp instrument for those carry a knife almost half of case lead to no further action with current rule allow those carry knife to escape further sanction by write an apology letter 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way because he be describe a situation that be virtually identical to the we face in scotland plus year ago the initiative take by the then strathclyde police force and the scottish government since have be a very different approach to tackle it that of treat it as a public health and social problem with a violence reduction unit there be nothing in the hon gentleman ’s motion that i would disagree with but it be like play whack a mole with the different sort of knife available do not he agree that this issue require a much more fundamental and radical approach 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his intervention and that will be part of my case so i be sure i will be able to meet that test 
 it feel like most day we wake up to another tragic story of death and family tear apart the most basic search online tell we it be all over the country bristol feltham warrington haverhill my own community of nottingham be rock last summer when my constituent ian coates and university of nottingham student barnaby webber and grace o’malley kumar be kill with a knife and i stand with their family in their attempt establish the fact and failing in this dreadful case 
 thing be get bad not well and that mean more young life lose more child draw into crime and more exploit by criminal we know this have a huge impact on our society hundred of family cripple by grief for murder love one life chance of young people squander potential leave unfulfilled and the criminal get away with it and go on to cause further misery knife crime destroy life devastate family and create fear in our community that be why this debate matter we must invest in our young people so that they be support to make the right decision in life and we must come down hard on those involve in knife crime real support real consequence 
 under the conservative government and a conservative police and crime commissioner cleveland have the high crime rate in the uk and only this weekend we see another serious stab a mile down the road from i in norton village we hear the government try to talk the talk but the bottom line have to be that they be not take the necessary action i be sure my hon friend will agree 
 i share my hon friend ’s view he talk of a case in his community and we be wake up seemingly so many day in every week with another case in another area in village town and city the public be rightly look for action from we and that be what i will be set out in my explanation of this motion 
 i be glad the shadow minister talk about we i understand that this be an opposition day debate and the government will be criticise but be it not the case that what the public on the left and the right and the apolitical be look for be cross party consensus where it can be find in this place to deal with what be a very important issue and that party politic should be set aside for great cross party working do he also agree that stop and search have a part to play on machete and zombie knife ban they be not the only solution although it be a good place to start but the most radical step be to work together 
 we have be clear throughout that when the government bring forward proposal design to take this issue on we will give they our support that be true of the forthcoming legislation on zombie knife although we have concern about the scope but there have to be action and where there be not action it be our role to point that out i think the right hon gentleman will find that in the tone and spirit of my contribution    we serve no if we do not do that but of course we will build consensus wherever we can and i hope the whole house can get behind our motion today 
 it would be a key mission of a future labour government to make the street safe and halve knife crime within year recently my right hon friend   the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper   and the leader of the opposition unveil our plan to deliver this with a crackdown on knife crime today and a radical youth prevention programme and this motion start to build that out we be clear no more loophole no more caveat no more false promise we need a total crackdown on the availability of serious weapon on britain ’s street 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment on this often heartbreake topic my constituent julie ’s daughter poppy devey waterhouse be kill in her home with a knife already in her kitchen currently offender convict of murder who use a weapon already available at the crime scene have a start sentence year low than those who bring a weapon with they domestic violence murderer can bank on leniency do the hon member agree that woman kill by knife already in the home need to see equal justice 
 the hon member raise an important point that need parliamentary scrutiny we have an anxiety as hon friend have mention many time that crime happen in domestic space be in some way deem less significant and that can be reflect in sentencing this bear our parliamentary scrutiny 
 to turn to the motion we want to see restriction on the sale of the most serious weapon those with no functional purpose since the government have release different press release about zombie knife but action have be slow to follow we be pleased that week ago we see the statutory instrument aim at take some of the knife and machete off the street and as i have say we will support the government in that venture but i hope to hear from the minister an explanation of why that be a ban not for now or a few week time but for september month away this be an immediate problem that need more urgency where be that urgency and leadership he can be assure of our support so let ’s get on with it 
 we also believe as set out in the motion that we should go far we would broaden the ban to include a wide range of weapon and to toughen exist rule on serration and length that would mean finally ban blade such as ninja sword the weapon that kill ronan kanda his incredible family be campaign for this ably support by their member for parliament my right hon friend   the member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden and they be right any ban on offensive weapon that would not have take off the street the blade that kill their son be insufficient 
 there be also an unintended consequence of leave out ninja sword those who sell these weapon be indifferent to their customer and their customer intention if colleague think i be overstate my case they should just put into a search engine zombie knife or ninja sword and look at how they be market if knife and machete be prohibit these firm will   just move on to push ninja sword at customer this be a hole in the government ’s plan and it must be plug 
 we can go far still here many ban knife continue to be sell where young people can buy they and have they deliver to their home within a few day we would introduce and believe the government should introduce criminal sanction on the tech executive who allow knife sale on their online marketplace not just ofcom sanction as the government have opt for but proper criminal sanction to send a very serious message to these leader that if their platform be be use and they be not actively make sure they be not be use for the sale of dangerous weapon there be go to be very serious consequence not one that can be price in as the cost of do business to add to that we must ensure we have the right tool in law to deal with the digital age 
 to drive this work forward our motion call for a rapid review of online knife sale from the point of purchase through to delivery in particular look at strengthen id and age check conduct by royal mail and border force for uk bind parcel currently all too often serious weapon can be purchase online with loose id and age check with little oversight and with no background check every time oversight be loosen and check be not carry out properly these weapon potentially fall into the wrong hand and be use to kill we must ensure we have the most robust system possible to prevent this to those who carry these weapon we need to send the unmistakable message that the law will come down hard on they not apology letter not weak warning but proper and serious intervention 
 my hon friend be make a great speech will he support parent in my constituency leanne and mandy whose child be kill by knife crime they be call for much strong sentence and great deterrence for knife crime do he agree with i and their family 
 i be go to set out a few of they shortly but i would be very interested in meet leanne and mandy if my hon friend could help facilitate that to hear what more they might want to see 
 our commitment be for every offender to be refer to a youth offend team and have a mandatory bespoke action plan to prevent reoffende as part of that we need tough new guidance so that serious penalty be always consider where appropriate such as curfew tagging and behavioural contract too many of these be be overlook and insufficient sanction such as a letter of apology be use in their stead that be wrong we need strong guidance from the centre on this but speak to the point make by   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael all of this on its own will not resolve and remove the issue of knife crime in our community 
 we must invest in young people because prevention be well than cure we need a total approach not an either or but both that be particularly germane to this debate because we know that those who seek to profit from the sale of dangerous weapon shapeshift and adapt around legislation that be of the challenge   so we must tackle demand and tackle issue that mean that young people think they need to carry harmful weapon 
 build on the success of sure start the last truly transformative prevention programme for young child we would create the young futures programme to help prevent violent crime it would be a target programme in every area to identify the young people most at risk of be draw into violent crime and of buy these product that we be seek to restrict we would build around they a package of support that respond to the challenge they face 
 as well as provide support to young people i welcome the £ of exist funding to divert and support young people through preventive work do my hon friend agree that it be crucial to provide positive role model through mentor to every young person in the country i have work on that with the charity uprising which i have chair for many year do he also agree that we should look at institution such as the royal london hospital and its trauma unit which have work on the frontline deal with the result of knife crime whether in hospital or out with paramedic we can draw on a great deal of knowledge to tackle this epidemic 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention because she have do incredible work that be admire by i and the shadow home secretary a lot of what i be about to talk about be base on that experience because that work have be very good 
 the young futures programme will bring together service locally to well co ordinate the delivery of preventive evidence base intervention around a young person that help to tackle mental health issue substance abuse issue and issue that people might get into with their friend and family we will then bring that together in a national network that share evidence deliver support for teenager at risk of be draw into crime across boundary and where appropriate could deliver universal youth provision then crucially this speak to the point just make by my hon friend   the member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali we would build out from that with youth worker in accident and emergency unit and in custody centre and with mentor in pupil referral unit to target young people who be start to be draw to violence 
 those be change moment particularly in healthcare and custody setting we know it might be the moment when an individual who be slide into serious violence whether as a perpetrator or a victim may need that intervention it might be the moment where we can get that change in behaviour that will in many case save their life that be why it be so crucial that we have this degree of investment into young people because otherwise such measure will not work 
 the hon member make good point as   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   point out a lot of this work have be go on in scotland have the hon member meet medics against violence whose navigator project do exactly what he be talk   about within a hospital setting it intervene through people with live experience to try to get young people into that frame of mind where they might want to exit that lifestyle and that violence they have get themselves into 
 there be clearly much that we can learn from the scottish approach i have not have the opportunity to meet medics against violence but on the hon member ’s recommendation i will seek to do that we strongly support the idea of support and mentor in a&e and custody setting the evidence show that would be highly effective 
 we need to end the exploitation of child and young people by criminal gang and that include county line we need a new criminal offence of child exploitation and a new serious organise crime strategy to go after those coward who make million off the back of exploit young people to bring the change to deliver that we need a new proper cross government coalition to end knife crime bring together those who have key role in tackle it and in keep young people safe whether they be ministers community leader faith leader the family of victim sporting body tech company or young people themselves everybody should be bring into this fight that be the sort of government that we would seek to lead if give the opportunity 
 the hon member be make a passionate speech about bring various people from across government and community together to tackle knife crime when the shadow home secretary and the leader of the opposition hold a summit in east london last year on knife crime the mayor of london who be the police and crime commissioner be nowhere to be see can the hon member ask the shadow home secretary why 
 i have to say i be a little sadden by that intervention this be a deeply serious issue about which the public expect to hear answer i do not think the public would consider the policing of the diary of the mayor the hon gentleman or anybody else to be part of a substantive solution i write my note for his intervention ahead of time because i know that day before a mayoral election the tories be much more interested in try to fight that election than tackle the problem if he really believe that be the approach i do not but it be for he to use his time as he choose let we put that to the people of london 
 on the point about work together perhaps outside this house rather than inside it may i say i completely agree with the hon gentleman yes i agree with his majesty ’s opposition on work together more cohesively with local authority public body health service and in particular around pupil referral unit and exclusion there be so many disparity throughout the country and it make sense to bring everybody together to look at good practice 
 that be a hugely important intervention from the right hon gentleman i have real anxiety about pupil referral unit exclusion and internal exclusion it be a problem prior to the pandemic but what we be see with school absence only compound that there be a risk of there be a generation of young people   who be vulnerable to these type of behaviour unless we take the field and fight for their heart and mind the right hon gentleman and i be in the same position on that 
 i will draw my remark to a close because lot of colleague have lot to say the motion before we in the name of the leader of the opposition be tightly draft and call for of the most pressing change that we believe be need to kick start this process the ban on ninja sword with a consultation on further extension to the propose ban on zombie knife an end to end review of online knife sale and criminal liability for senior executive of those website who do not adequately prevent they from sell knife we believe those be reasonable change that the whole house can get behind and i hope the government will take they seriously they should support this motion today the minister for crime policing and fire and i have be work on the criminal justice bill committee for many week and we will be table change to enact those measure and the government should accept they if they take up our idea before the bill ’s next stage we will support they but we will not ignore the large scale damage that knife crime be do across the country the public be rightly look to we for leadership and action and we stand ready to give they that 
 i be grateful to the opposition for give i the opportunity to respond on behalf of the government and to speak about our record on fight crime include our work to get weapon off the street and stop they fall into the wrong hand which be have a real impact 
 as my right hon friend   the member for the wrekin mark pritchard   say we should remember what this debate be all about he be absolutely right that it be not about party politic point scoring cheap jibe or sound bite because the truth be that serious violence and knife crime leave the same trail of misery and devastation in their wake regardless of the constituency we represent the tragic reality be that many of we in fact far too many on both side of this house will have have the humbling experience of sit with the love one of victim of crime whose life have be cut short in the most tragic way there be little can say in those circumstance that will ease the pain of lose a son daughter brother or sister it be incumbent upon we all by us i mean the government and the police but also each and every of we here who contribute to public life to strain every sinew to stop other suffer as they have 
 i have also be in the situation in the past month of have to write to the mother of a year old young man who be stab to death at strawberry hill station in my constituency last month understandably parent teenager and other young people be raise concern with i about how we can tackle this huge increase in london alone as the minister for crime policing and fire will know we have see an increase of almost a in knife crime since if we be to ban all these weapon we need good intelligence lead community policing but in london since we have see our police community support   officer cut by a what assurance can the minister give my constituent that we will see an uplift in police officer include in place such as richmond upon thames which be often deprioritise because they be see as safe area no area be immune from knife crime 
 i agree with the hon lady ’s last point give the representative in the chamber i think a lot will be say in the debate and rightly so in relation to crime and knife crime in london include by she it be right to say that every time somebody pick up a knife or another dangerous weapon there be the potential for bloodshed and every time somebody arm themselves whether for protection or with violent intent they risk ruin not only other life but their own life that have be bring home time and again in the most devastating fashion in recent day week and month my thought and prayer be with the family and friend mourn such devastating loss it be any parent ’s bad nightmare 
 that the victim be so often young people with their whole life ahead of they make it all the more unbearable in our shock and our grief we must remain steadfast in our conviction that we can get knife and other dangerous weapon off our street and that we can prevent young people from get draw into violent crime in the place 
 in the spirit of the intervention that my right hon friend   the member for the wrekin mark pritchard   make on the shadow minister i would like to reflect on a debate before the recess lead by my right hon friend   the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton during that debate in which there be cross party support my right hon friend mention the knife angel in aldridge brownhills in the borough of walsall she also mention a campaign by the brindley family and the brindley foundation that be set up to bring about positive social action as a result of a tragedy my hon friend   the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french   make powerful intervention during that debate 
 it be right to look at the number and the late datum the late datum on hospital admission of under-25s follow an assault with a sharp object show a reduction since december that be a good indicator the most reliable indicator for serious youth violence my right hon friend the policing minister will in due course mention the crime survey which show that violent crime have reduce by since it be also right to say that nationally homicide have fall but it be obvious that datum on a chart provide no comfort for victim family and that any incident of serious violence or knife crime be too many that be why the government be continually look at what more we can do to protect our citizen especially child and young people and drive those number down far 
 the police be on the frontline in this effort force up and down the country be aware that this be an issue of significant public concern and they be firmly committed to tackle it it be right that i as a dorset member of parliament mention our police and crime commissioner david sidwick and i pay tribute to he the work he be do and the crime plan that he have put together for dorset 
 thank to our recruitment drive which have deliver the promise extra officer we have significantly bolster the police across england and wales with   every additional officer the ability of force to crack down on weapon carrying and violence be strengthen that include through the natural deterrence that flow from an increase police presence there be the add benefit of reassurance to all our community who be clear that they want to see more officer on the beat 
 of course it be about not just how many police officer there be but what force do with the resource and power give to they the government have consistently and publicly back the police to take the tough possible stance when it come to address serious violence knife crime and weapon carry that include support the use of stop and search which be a crucial tool since the police have remove knife and dangerous weapon through stop and search surrender programme and other targeted action 
 on that specific subject every knife seize through stop and search be a potential life save in the year stop and search result in about arrest and remove over weapon and firearm from our street the significance of stop and search should not be downplay because every knife or weapon seize be a potential life save 
 on criminal sanction the motion table by the opposition they will have to forgive i be too generic too sweeping and perhaps too adversarial on criminal liability for the senior management of website that indirectly sell illegal knife online however what be the government ’s current thinking unless perhaps the minister do not want to tell i vis à vis the criminal justice bill on which i know he be work closely with the shadow minister 
 the criminal justice bill be pass through parliament have have its committee stage i do not want to steal the thunder of the policing minister who will wind up the debate on behalf of the government but i encourage my right hon friend to be here for that 
 in the round we have some of the tough knife crime law in the world for example it be illegal to carry any fix bladed knife in public without a good reason with such an offence carry a maximum sentence of year in prison the offensive weapons act strengthen the law on the sale and delivery of knife to under-18s
