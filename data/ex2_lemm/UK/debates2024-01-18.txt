southport pier be a significant feature of our town ’s life for over year until it be close by sefton council in december give the significance of pier to many town around the country particularly because of the economic impact that they can have will my right hon friend agree to have a debate on how can they be restore and maintain for future generation 
 i believe my hon friend be refer to veterans uk which be be retire because i be well aware of the plethora of issue we have staff there who work incredibly hard but with very poor resource and consequently the experience of veteran have not be what i want it to be we be retire that brand and completely revamp those service i take on board the point about an mps hotline which exist in other department and i can confirm that we be look to establish the same thing in the new organisation to meet these claim 
 as i have say if the house of commons have indicate its will by the amendment that piece of legislation move to the house of lords and the government will respond at that point that be the week after next that be the process of the house i have recognise the need to ensure that we get the clinical legal and care expert in place they be in place and they be work on some of the complex issue the hon lady allude to the psychological support be now in place but i be do everything i can in every dimension of this complicated problem to deliver as quickly as i can 
 as i tell the house yesterday i have to report the death of sir tony lloyd the member for rochdale i know that hon member from across the house will join i in mourn the loss of our colleague and i invite all member to join i in a minute ’s silence in memory of tony 
 the house observe a minute silence 
 i would like to assure the house that there will be an opportunity for all of we to pay tribute to tony at a later date our sympathy be with his family and friend he will be sadly miss across the house 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with the chair of the grenfell tower inquiry on the timetable for publication of the phase report 
 what recent discussion he have have with the chair of the grenfell tower inquiry on the timetable for publication of the phase report 
 the grenfell tower inquiry be a statutory inquiry establish under the inquiries act under the act the drafting of an inquiry ’s final report and the timing of that process be rightly matter for the independent inquiry chair in its november newsletter publish on its website the inquiry confirm that 
 the report will not be publish before april next year but the panel hop to be able to send it to the prime minister before the next anniversary of the fire with publication soon thereafter 
 i thank the minister for his response it be now nearly year since the grenfell tragedy in which people lose their life what assurance have he have from the inquiry chair that there will be no   further delay in the publication of the report it be essential that justice be do and i know that view be echo across the house 
 the hon gentleman will have see far to what i have just read out the report that be publish in november in which the chair explain that rule of the inquiry rule require the inquiry 
 to write to those who might be subject to criticism 
 and give they fair time to respond the newsletter state 
 the rule process be prove time consume 
 however i hope that the hon gentleman will be reassure by the date that i have read out 
 the prime minister assure the public that the grenfell tragedy would not be forget yet across many different area of concern the lack of resolution on the future of the grenfell tower site the many building that have be evacuate because of structural concern and the lack of justice for survivor we see a lack of urgency in address the concern raise by the inquiry when will the government act to rebuild public confidence and ensure that the necessary measure be take to prevent a similar tragedy happen in future 
 i thank the hon lady for her question but i think it be deeply unfair to suggest that there have be a lack of urgency from the government the then prime minister announce the inquiry the day after that terrible event and we have take huge action to provide compensation for people and to ensure that no qualifying leaseholder live in a building above metre will face the cost of remediation for unsafe cladding of course we be eager to get the response from the official inquiry and we will take action thereafter 
 whether he have make an assessment of the adequacy of public procurement process under covid-19 emergency regulation 
 whether he have make an assessment of the adequacy of public procurement process under covid-19 emergency regulation 
 there be well establish procedure in the public contracts regulations for handle emergency procurement which enable the government to procure lifesave good and expertise we follow those procedure in order to save life as fast as we could during the bad pandemic in live memory the procurement act which have just pass both houses of parliament will introduce fast competition process for emergency buying reduce the reliance on direct award while retain and improve transparency and the ability to act at pace in situation similar to the covid pandemic 
 i be deeply sadden by the death of our dear friend sir tony lloyd 
 i fear that the procurement act will allow for the same horrific waste of taxpayer money and the approach to public procurement that we experience during the pandemic with friend and donor to the tory party be give the bite of the cherry while decent local skilled business be increasingly sideline by the government ’s approach we see that in recent analysis from the british chambers of commerce can the minister explain why small and medium sized enterprise be increasingly be sideline from access to public procurement 
 i have to take issue with a number of the hon gentleman ’s point and foremost the idea constantly repeat by opposition members that there be special consideration for individual companies—[interruption it be very important that we go through this yet again the hon gentleman have have answer on this twice in the past year but i be go to tell he a time the simple fact of the matter be that everyone who apply for a contract go through the same process very hardworking and professional civil servant make those judgment in uniquely difficult circumstance frankly i be sick of hear slur against their good name interruption 
 if the minister have to say it for a time i hope that we will not get the attention we be receive today 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend   the member for slough mr dhesi in spite of the minister ’s protestation the evidence be to the contrary interruption 
 order we do not need the parliamentary private secretary chip in be that understand 
 i be sorry mr speaker 
 thank you 
 the fact that minister mate can get these lucrative contract as last month ’s evidence show while ten of thousand of our constituent struggle to put food on the table be an absolute disgrace of the £ worth of personal protective equipment contract let in will the minister confirm i have evidence on this so i advise he to choose his language carefully that up to a be fraudulent or the result of profiteer or conflict of interest 
 i would be very interested to see the hon lady ’s evidence where there be evidence of fraud we will of course go after that as we have do so in a number of high profile case where investigation be ongoing we will recoup as much money as we can for the british taxpayer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i too wish to put on the record my condolence to tony lloyd ’s family he will be miss across the house and across the labour movement as a whole 
 the government lose £ through duff unusable ppe the prime minister when chancellor sign off £ worth of dodgy covid loan even today the government be lose £ to tax fraud £ to universal credit fraud and billion more across the public sector as a whole be the truth not that family be pay £ more on average in tax because the government simply can not be trust with taxpayer money 
 i really struggle with that line of questioning opposition members have very short memory this be the bad pandemic that we have have in over a century the pressure on government be immense the accusation that we buy too much ppe be akin to people stand up in and say that the government buy too many spitfires 
 what step his department be take to strengthen cyber security 
 i know that my right hon friend be particularly interested in this issue follow cyber attack in her constituency in i can assure she that we be improve cyber security defence across critical national infrastructure and government organisation initiative such as govassure which i launch last year be set high standard for resilience and the government ’s cyber co ordination centre be enable collaboration and information sharing on cyber security good practice 
 i add my condolence to those express to tony ’s family 
 cyber security be the big risk that many company face but many small and medium sized business be not insure buy good quality cyber security insurance can involve a health check to ensure that system be protect the uk be the world leader in insurance and chelmsford have the large cluster of insurance company outside london so will the minister meet i and representative of the london insurance market to discuss how an improved quality mark for cyber security could increase the availability of cover ensure that business and public sector body be well protect 
 i would be very happy to do so as my right hon friend point out cyber insurance play a vital role in help to build resilience and we have a share interest in develop it the national cyber security centre have stand up the cyber insurance industry working group which be work through all these issue i have meet with lloyd ’s of london and both i and treasury ministers will be happy to have further such meeting 
 have the secretary of state read the speech make by the auditor general this week about cyber security which say that lack of investment in upgrade our infrastructure make the government vulnerable to cyber attack be he comfortable that we be safe from such attack do that not show that the tories be penny wise but pound stupid 
 i be aware of the speech and i have speak in the house on many occasion about the challenge we face on cyber security it be an increase threat landscape but the government be take a range of action to improve our cyber security not least govassure which i announce last year that be about go through the cyber security of all departments to bring it up to scratch we publish the cyber policy handbook and we have introduce secure by design principle so that all new government it procurement project be secure from the outset 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the recent british library incident be a stark reminder of the terrifying security risk and enormous cost of cyber attack and recent ministerial answer have reveal a shockingly high number of red rat it system across government departments i hear the secretary of state ’s word but give that the government ’s cyber security strategy tell we that 
 transparent central governance structure will maintain oversight and responsibility for cross government cyber security risk 
 will he now set out the government ’s timetable for remedy this shocking situation and explain how he will keep the house update on progress 
 we know about this in the place because of the work undertake by the government to fully understand the cyber security risk face this country we be well prepared than most country around the world none the less in respect of the red- rat system we be develop remediation plan all of which will be in place by next year we be track progress and be confident that we will achieve over £ in efficiency saving in addition to achieve great resilience by next year 
 what step his department be take to improve access to public sector procurement process for small and medium sized business 
 what step his department be take to improve access to public sector procurement process for small and medium sized business 
 the procurement act will deliver simple and more effective public sector procurement and it will help sme secure a great share of approximately £ of expenditure every year the act include a new duty on contracting authority to have regard to the particular barrier face sme and to consider how they can be overcome 
 to some extent sme have historically be block out by large company this week it be report that the government try to block fujitsu from bid for future contract on the basis of woeful performance in previous contract government lawyer have advise that this can not be do but they be wrong will the government give far serious thought   to block large company with terrible track record such as fujitsu from bid for future contract and if necessary legislate accordingly 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question as he will know there be clearly define circumstance in which the government can exclude company from bid for contract with regard to fujitsu he may be interested to hear that this morning the cabinet office receive a letter from fujitsu voluntarily undertake not to bid for government contract while the inquiry be ongoing unless of course the government ask it to do so 
 when it come to small and medium sized enterprise get government contract sometimes the devil be in the detail and the unintended consequence business have tell i that the prior year turnover to contract ratio restriction in public procurement be hinder the growth of business such as kromek in netpark sedgefield force they to surrender margin to prime contractor and meet the contracting eligibility requirement cost the uk government the good innovation and cost sme growth will the minister please commit to explore alternative measure for assess contract eligibility include look at the model of the us government and their associated agency 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i know that he will have follow the passage of the procurement act through parliament closely as will business in his constituency particularly sme i hope he will have see that the act remove unnecessary obstacle relate to audit account and insurance for the condition of participation mean that small business will no long be shut out of the procurement process or incur unnecessary cost that duty that i refer to early for those procure government contract to consider how to remove barrier to sme will really change the landscape for our small and medium sized enterprise 
 in his reply to   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis the minister totally miss the point because he refer to define reason why company could be exclude the government and parliament make the rule they have be drag their foot month after month year after year on change that in this regard but also in term of support domestic industry as every other major economy do when will they sort this out and get it down to the house and into the rule over civil service intransigence and delay tactic 
 the right hon gentleman will have hear what i just say to my right hon friend   the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis i know that as a lover of due process he will believe that the statutory inquiry should appropriately have the final word on this and when it do we will have absolutely no compunction in act 
 may i too convey my sympathy to the family of tony lloyd i thank you mr speaker for allow we the opportunity to come together more fully as a house to pay tribute 
 i thank the minister for his answer my constituent in strangford and indeed people across northern ireland include a large number of small and medium sized enterprise and business they create many job wage packet and opportunity very much want to be part of this process and i know the minister be keen to support we what can be do for defence procurement for example and also for the food and agriculture sector because we have great company that have the potential to do well can the minister add his support 
 i certainly can as my hon friend will know northern ireland agree to be part of the new procurement regime when we pass the procurement act which be fantastic sadly that be unlike our friend in scotland who will miss out on all the benefit of the good modern procurement framework in the world that mean that small and medium sized enterprise in his constituency will now have a well opportunity to bid for government contract i very much enjoy be in northern ireland at the end of last year i be go again in the next few month and would be happy to meet any business that he would like to put i in touch with 
 what step he be take to improve support for female veteran 
 the government will publish our woman veteran strategy in the spring focus on the specific need of woman veteran the office for veterans affairs have provide £ to well understand the experience of woman veteran and to increase support for those who have experience military sexual trauma 
 i thank the right hon member for his answer will he join i in recognise female veteran who not only serve themselves as i know he do but support veteran in their local community such as my constituent morag lightning she be an raf veteran who volunteer as a raf association welfare officer and who do too many thing to mention in our community for which she be award a british empire medal in the king ’s new year ’s honours list would he join i in congratulate she on that 
 i pay huge tribute to morag and the many other who i have meet over the past few year who work night and day at the coalface of veteran care and policy they be the true hero in look after our veteran it be the nation ’s responsibility and those who have leave the military often set the example for how we look after our veteran i pay tribute to she and the hundred and thousand of other across the country who spend night and day help veteran 
 i welcome the woman veteran strategy and the update that the minister have give on it will the strategy take into account the finding of the review of veteran welfare service which i be pleased the government carry out 
 yes of course the review of welfare service for veteran be the most significant review that have happen ever on the statutory service of veteran affair across the ministry of defence and across government it have of course be a concern of mine for some time that female veteran have not feel as include and as part of the veteran community as i would want they to feel i be absolutely determined to over correct that and ensure that woman veteran be look after and be as proud as i be of their service and of be in the veteran community 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the centre for military women ’s research have identify numerous gap in our understanding of woman ’s experience in the military the consequent problem they face and the reluctance to pursue research on those matter be it right to presume that the woman veteran strategy i hear what the minister say about his genuine concern on these matter will be his main vehicle for ensure that we tackle those issue 
 absolutely the point of the strategy essentially be to ensure that the voice that have be unheard for too long be hear i know that there be unmet need and pain in the female veteran community there be also huge pride and there be extraordinary example of those who have serve and have go on to achieve extraordinary thing in their life we will of course look to achieve balance i want to ensure that female veteran be correctly cater for and look after in this country i want it to be the good country in the world to be a veteran and that be for all veteran female or male across the piece irrespective of cap badge i be determined to keep go until we get there 
 what step his department be take to protect public service and institution from cyber threat 
 we be protect our public service from cyber threat through our world lead government cyber security strategy we be also tackle the threat at source last year alone we sanction criminal responsible for spread a prolific ransomware strain and we expose the russian intelligence service for their attempt to target high profile individual and entity through cyber operation 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response in the wake of the recent attack on the british library will he tell we what assessment the government have make of potential cyber attack on other non departmental public body how will he ensure that they be not vulnerable to similar attack and that the country be not bring to a standstill 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to highlight that attack it demonstrate that such attack can affect not just central government any agency of government can be subject to they indeed we discuss it at cabinet just this week i continue to co ordinate   activity through the ministerial cyber board and the national cyber security centre work closely with government agency include the british library to ensure that they be as robustly prepare as they can be 
 what recent discussion he have have with the independent adviser on minister interest on ensure transparency of declaration 
 there be an establish process in place for the declaration and management of interest hold by ministers as set out in the ministerial code the independent adviser on minister interest publish a twice yearly list of ministers interest since interim update to the list be also issue as need the late list be publish in december 
 public appointment declaration be important as the public face of scandal ride greensill capital it have be say of lord cameron that he earn $ be pay via an offshore trust and enjoy many personal flight on greensill ’s plane yet when challenge on his remuneration lord cameron refuse to answer say that he have be a private citizen and have declare all the information for the register of members financial interests the reply that i receive from the independent adviser about all that say that on appointment ministers must declare their private interest i ask the minister how a member can get answer to question about lord cameron ’s employment before his appointment surely if someone get a new public job answer to fair question should be lay out for we all to see 
 as the hon member say integrity be vital in this place and we all adhere to high standard he will also know that there be an establish regime in place for those declaration the foreign secretary have adhere to those and as he have say he have just job now foreign secretary of the united kingdom he be very proud to have that job and to work with the prime minister to try to make sure our country be as safe and prosperous as possible 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 thank you mr speaker please accept my apology if my voice give out part way through my question i will do my good our thought in the snp be with tony lloyd ’s family his constituent and all those feel the pain of his loss today 
 the prime minister and ministers include the foreign secretary hold their wealth in blind trust or management the ministerial code say 
 minister must ensure that no conflict arise or appear to arise between their public duty and their private interest 
 how can the public trust their politician when that money be hide from public scrutiny 
 i repeat that there be establish regime in place for the declaration and management of interest and they be oversee by an independent adviser who publish report twice a year 
 i read the report that be publish in december lord cameron lobby on behalf of the chinese state ’s belt and road initiative aid the geopolitical and economic interest of the chinese government the day prime minister also seek to export defence equipment to china if there be nothing to fear there be nothing to hide will any new requirement be place on uk politician to disclose in full interest from foreign state even when those be in blind trust or management 
 i refer the hon lady to the late list of ministers interest which be publish on   december   and include the relevant interest of all ministers form the government as of   december include the foreign secretary our clear eyed position on china remain unchanged and our approach of engage directly and robustly with china in the uk national interest be the right and be firmly in line with that of our g7 and eyes partner 
 whether he have have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the use of ai on the delivery of public service 
 i discuss this area regularly with cabinet colleague the incubator for artificial intelligence which i announce last year will recruit expert from the private sector academia and beyond who will work with departments to rapidly and responsibly develop new application for artificial intelligence across government as part of radical plan to harness the potential of ai to improve life and public service 
 i join other in pay tribute to the great sir tony lloyd our thought and prayer be with his family today 
 i thank the minister for his answer as the government have start work on an artificial intelligence hit squad to eliminate civil service job and replace human labour it be of urgent importance that they lie out the safeguard they will enact the childcare benefit scandal in the netherlands in where artificial intelligence bake in racial profiling that discriminate against minority highlight the necessity of strict control and protection so will the minister reveal what step they be take to prevent the harmful use of artificial intelligence 
 it be not the case that this be about take job off civil servant it be to enable they to do their job well and more efficiently for the benefit of the public we serve in this place in respect of the measure that we be take to ensure that we follow good practice the government ’s central digital and data office be ensure a high delivery of quality and regular testing of that software throughout all stage of development in addition there be a service assessment model so we be take a number of step to ensure that we guard against the risk that the hon gentleman highlight 
 what progress his department have make on implement the interim recommendation of the infected blood inquiry 
 as i set out on   december i be pleased with the progress that we have make in appoint an expert group to assist on technical detailed consideration of those recommendation it be announce yesterday that the final report will be publish on   may and the government be commit to update parliament on the next step within sit day of publication 
 the publication of the final report into the infected blood scandal have yet again be delay cause dismay for hundred of people include some of my chester constituent who be still wait for justice in this matter time be precious the government commit to introduce primary legislation early in the new year to enable the establishment of the compensation scheme give that the house have show its majority support will the minister confirm that the government will now get on with it 
 i take the will of the house very seriously that vote be on   december   as part of the victims and prisoners bill which will now be work through its next stage in the other place the week after next i have be work with colleague across government to ensure that we be able to respond appropriately at that time 
 i call father of the house 
 the house understand that it be the minister ’s department that have to co ordinate government and that be not an easy thing to do do he understand that sir robert francis and sir brian langstaff have make it absolutely clear that the final report will say nothing more about compensation it be not just the victim of the infected blood scandal who matter so do the family of those who have already die they be die as well may i say on behalf of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood i be sure that   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   would say the same that day after the report be publish in may be too long to wait people want certainty and need support 
 i thank my hon friend for his empathy with the complexity of deliver this i recognise the urgency of course that be why over the recess i have several meeting with official we be move forward with the appointment of the clinical legal and care expert however i recognise that his focus and that of colleague across the house be on the speed of delivery of payment obviously we make those interim payment far to the interim report recommendation in october i will continue to have meeting with colleague to move this forward as quickly as i can 
 what recent assessment he have make of the prevalence of the use of personal smartphone for conduct government business by minister and official 
 the cabinet office do not hold datum centrally regard personal smartphone use we be committed to ensure that government business be conduct securely and to support individual in meet their security responsibility in march last year we publish guidance concern the use of non corporate communication channel for government business which set out consideration around the use of private device 
 i may be part of a very small and shrink group but i think it be sensible that ministers official and adviser should be able to share their thinking and thought in private on occasion however the truth of matter be that the constant drip of story whether about boris johnson nicola sturgeon or anybody else and whatsapp message not be available to hold people accountable be harm public confidence in government and politic will the minister look again at this to see how we can have good accountable and transparent government 
 the right hon gentleman raise important point i draw his attention to the document we publish last year use non corporate communication channel e.g. whatsapp private email sms for government business i think he will be particularly interested in the summary table on page 
 what step his department be take to increase transparency in the honours system 
 we have make a number of important change to increase transparency we have launch a new website and online form to make it easy for anyone to make a nomination we have bring the recruitment of the independent honours committee which make the honours recommendation into line with the governance code for public appointment and we have bolster probity check through new and renewed agreement with vetting body 
 the post office scandal and paula vennells handing back of her cbe have shine a real light on the need for more scrutiny and transparency in the honours system do the minister agree that the vetting process the scrutiny and transparency be need more than ever in our honours system to protect its integrity 
 i do agree give that my hon friend be a former sub postmaster i can fully understand why he feel so strongly about this matter he be absolutely right to do so and i thank he for all the work he have do for his fellow postmaster and sub postmaster it be important that we protect the integrity of the honours system which be something to which this government   be commit we have undertake a range of action to strengthen check include expand criminal record check and work closely with regulator and other body to ensure full due diligence for all nominee 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the right hon lady have just speak about the integrity of the honours system but the government have fail to be transparent around the interest of baroness mone in the ppe medpro contract where over £ be waste we have no answer from the government as to why the link be not make public at the time no answer as to why a government minister do not correct the wrong impression that have be give in public and no answer in response to the allegation that the government indicate a national crime agency investigation would be drop if the civil claim be settle back on   december labour call on the government to order an urgent investigation into this matter to give taxpayer the answer they deserve but the deputy prime minister have not even respond to the letter be the reason the government be so afraid of an investigation that it will just show once again tory sleaze 
 we have respond 
 you have not respond 
 have you not have our letter 
 i have not have it 
 i will say from the dispatch box that the answer have be send and give if it need to be reissue we will do so but it have be send 
 baroness mone have take leave of absence from the lords and there be separate investigation into the allegation against she in my mind if she be find guilty of wrongdoing she need to resign membership of the lords the public would expect no less the house of lords reform act ensure that a member convict of serious offence will cease to be a member of the house of the lords and that be what we want to see we do not want people in parliament who bring either house into disrepute they need to leave 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on help to ensure potential employer recognise veteran skill and prior learning 
 veteran employment be at an all time high with of those leave service find employment within month we have recently launch the employer guide to hire veteran showcase good practice on how employer can benefit from veteran skill and qualification i regularly champion veteran employment to cabinet colleague as employ veteran be of the good decision that business can make 
 be it not the case that after year of conservative government ministers have create a postcode lottery for veteran and halve employment support for they specifically will the minister tell the house how many veteran have be employ as a result of the civil service interview scheme for veteran 
 when it come to veteran care in this country and how it have change in the past year it be hard to take the hon gentleman seriously those service have be transform the number of those employ through the civil service scheme be i believe over but i will write to he with the correct figure have a job be the no factor that improve the life chance of any veteran in this country it be the real focus of what we be do at the office of veterans affairs and i be incredibly proud of those effort again i lament the fact that that be not reflect by labour i want to see that change as we go into the next election so that veteran know that whoever win it their interest will be represent properly 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this week i sign an agreement on biological security between the united kingdom and the united states this strategic dialogue will mean share more datum collaborate on research and co ordinating action prepare for a whole spectrum of biological threat i also sign a memorandum of co operation on cyber partnership with japan help to fulfil a key element of the hiroshima accord 
 this week the government be make available a free portrait of his majesty the king available to all public building this portrait will hang in school police station and local authority serve as a reminder of the country ’s ultimate public service i be sure the whole house will wish to join i in wish his majesty the king and her royal highness the princess of wales very swift recovery 
 it emerge this week that avanti west coast boss be recently catch give powerpoint presentation brag about receive free money from the government be this value for money 
 i be not aware of those allegation but they sound very concern and i be very happy to look into they on behalf of the hon lady 
 last year the government trialle their emergency alert system this summer i have the joy of go to south korea unfortunately i be catch up in the typhoon but there be many such alert tell people where road be close or flood recently in leicestershire the like of shenton and witherley come under the cosh of flooding and my constituent be wonder whether the alert system could be use for something like this as the government website state that it can 
 yes the service be available but it be up to local responder to determine whether to put in a request for it in this case they do not do so i would commend the local responder whether the environment agency the police or the fire service for their response that tool be available to they should they need it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i echo the condolence that have be give to the family of tony lloyd 
 far to the question about flooding yesterday the public accounts committee say that over property in england be vulnerable to flooding and the budget for flood protection be now expect to cover few property than the government originally say it would we have see the devastation that flooding can do in recent week and the terrible consequence for those affect give the cabinet office ’s responsibility for resilience can the secretary of state explain why the plan be so far behind schedule and what the government will do to protect the property that may now be leave without adequate flood protection 
 as the right hon gentleman highlight the cabinet office have responsibility for resilience under a lead government department model but the department for environment food and rural affairs be responsible for individual flood defence we have put record sum into flood defence and we have provide record flood defence building clearly there be more to do to allocate those resource but we have make considerable progress 
 this week gareth davies the head of the national audit office say that ministers could save up to £ a year of taxpayer money by modernise it system tackle fraud and well management of major project such as hs2 he also say that out of date it expose the uk to a great risk of cyber attack and we have hear reference this morning to the cyber attack on the british library why be it that time after time the government reach for tax rise such rise will leave a typical family pay £ a year more in tax instead of save money by get a grip of these it project and major infrastructure project as have be call for by the national audit office 
 that be precisely why we have create i. ai the incubator for artificial intelligence under my leadership to make sure that we apply artificial intelligence to drive down the cost of public service and to improve output i say gently to the right hon gentleman that it be a bit rich to be take lecture from the labour party which waste over £ when it be in government on fail it project fail it project in the nhs the ministry of defence and defra and where be the right hon gentleman he be sit in downing street while that happen 
 may i associate myself with the deputy prime minister ’s word about the royal family 
 on   february this house have the opportunity to correct the constitutional sexism that mean that of the seat in the other place be reserve for   man only will the government support and work with i on my hereditary titles female succession bill to ensure that the succession of peerage move in line with that of the crown 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and the work she have do in this area i know she have think about it a great deal i will be write to she in due course it be a complicated area of constitutional law but we appreciate the position from which she be come 
 in light of the shocking revelation that only of the tip off receive by the government ’s covid fraud hotline be be actively pursue can the secretary of state explain to an increasingly despairing nation what step the government be take to recover every single penny of that fraudulently claim taxpayer money 
 that be precisely why we set up the public sector fraud authority and i can update the house that in its year it meet more than double its target in addition there be both civil and criminal investigation ongoing to bring every person responsible to justice if they have defraud the taxpayer 
 my constituency boast the high number of veteran of any in the uk with about of people have serve but the veteran agency be not assist i and other mp like i in serve my constituent because when i raise issue with it it insist on respond via ministerial correspondence from the ministry of defence there can therefore be no direct interface with it make it very time consume and frustrating for my constituent will the minister get the veteran agency to introduce an mps helpline so that veteran concern can be answer quickly and efficiently 
 i believe my hon friend be refer to veterans uk which be be retire because i be well aware of the plethora of issue we have staff there who work incredibly hard but with very poor resource and consequently the experience of veteran have not be what i want it to be we be retire that brand and completely revamp those service i take on board the point about an mps hotline which exist in other department i can confirm that we be look to establish the same thing in the new organisation to meet these claim

 fast resolution to the infected blood scandal compensation before it be too late for myself and other to see full and final resolution 
 it might be too late for my constituent he can not wait more week but can the minister outline how many people have receive interim payment and how many be still outstanding 
 a large number of payment be make available quickly in the last quarter of i fully recognise the absolute tragedy that this be every death be a tragedy this be the big scandal in the nhs ’s history i recognise and acknowledge that the victim organisation say that there be death last year and i be do everything i can to find solution as quickly as possible

 in the spring statement in march the review of public body be announce as the hon lady know that will give we significant saving there be arm ’s length body review cover of arm ’s length body expenditure honestly i be not familiar with the exact protocol around publication but i be happy to look into it and i will come back to she 
 in the cabinet office reject my request that it fund the forensic investigation into the horizon it system by sight indeed the cabinet office insist that the post office pay for its own investigation which ultimately allow the post office to try to control and coerce the lead investigator ron warmington thus delay justice for the sub postmaster will the minister look into the reasoning behind this historic decision and write to i about it please 
 i be happy to do that 
 what discussion have the minister have with the police service of northern ireland ’s cyber protect team in relation to learn the hard lesson that have arise from the numerous datum breach of office information across the psni and throughout the united kingdom 
 this be an appalling incident as the hon gentleman know and it highlight big flaw in how datum be handle in respect of freedom of information request we have issue further guidance on how such request should be handle but i continue to work with official in my department and across government to make sure that that sort of incident never happen again 
 that complete cabinet office question and we will soon be go on to the next set of question as i say next week we will be pay tribute to our friend tony lloyd follow his tragic death but i have    no doubt that the shadow leader of the house who take over his previous seat will have a comment to make i be just watch the clock tick down we be nearly there

 i thank the leader of the house i want to start by pay my own tribute to my dear and hon friend sir tony lloyd the word speak about tony since his passing yesterday which have come from across this house and the political divide really be a reflection of the special person he be he be kind sincere and drive by his deep value and principle he work with everyone necessary to further a cause and always with integrity and humanity 
 tony be also my predecessor as mp for manchester central as i say many year ago in my maiden speech he be a brilliant man elect in serve stretford and then manchester central for year before be elect as police and crime commissioner for greater manchester he then return to parliament to serve the people of rochdale from he be an incredibly hard act to follow i still often find myself in his shadow for the few year i have to accept the frequent complaint that i just be not as good some of my constituent still say you ’re no tony lloyd be you he be a proud mancunian but we do disagree on football as he be a long stand season ticket holder for united 
 we all know what tony stand for and the cause he hold dear and tirelessly campaign for but in all the year i know he i can not remember ever hear he raise his voice he go about his politic differently for he politic be all about relationship and discussion whether in this place internationally on the street or in his beloved pub that be what earn he so much loyalty from everyone who know he because he be such a thoroughly nice bloke my thought be with his family his friend and his staff at this difficult time hon member hear hear 
 tony be not afraid to champion little hear or unpopular cause such as his campaigning on mesothelioma of his last act just this week be to join more than member and peer and my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   in call for urgent action on infected blood compensation we have raise that issue many time in business question but give sir brian langstaff ’s statement which be issue yesterday it need raise again i just hear question on it during cabinet office question 
 sir brian the chair of the inquiry have unfortunately delay publication of the final report until may however he also make it absolutely clear that his final report on the compensation scheme have already be publish in april last year and that that aspect of the inquiry and its finding will not change give that may i ask the leader of the house once again to arrange for a statement from the cabinet office on establish the compensation scheme she and the government can not keep hide behind the final report or complexity when the chair have make it crystal clear that his recommendation on the scheme be now publish i must say that the answer i hear in cabinet office question just be not good enough they feel like dodge unfortunately yet the will of the house be clear on this subject 
 this week i happen upon an article by the leader of the house in the news portsmouth bemoan the fact that nothing seem to work anymore it be remarkably similar to a big speech she make a year ago this week to the institute for government make similar argument that ordinary people feel the system be rig against they i agree with she and after the post office scandal i be sure many other do but it leave i wonder what her government be do about it and who she think be responsible in a week when avanti be brag about free money from the taxpayer while rail passenger suffer poor service whose responsibility do she think that be in a week when the national audit office warn that the government be waste ten of billion of pound on crumble infrastructure and badly run project whose responsibility do she think that be 
 the leader of the house say that she want to focus on improve the quality accountability and accessibility of healthcare so in a week when it have be report that the nhs be spend a staggering £ a year on agency staff whose responsibility do she think that be whose responsibility be it that million of people be wait long for treatment and can not access a gp before she embarrassingly blame doctor or welsh labour for the problem of the english nhs will she be honest about her government ’s terrible record and tell we what she be do to fix it 
 the whole house will soon have an opportunity to pay tribute to our late colleague tony lloyd people may not know and the hon lady may not have have an opportunity to do that so i thank she for her tribute today let i place on record my deep sympathy for all who love he the tribute pay to he already illustrate his gentle and kind nature and the breadth and depth of his public service as the hon lady testify he be still do that right up until the end 
 i also thank the family of those hold hostage by hamas for again come to parliament this week to talk about their love one we will all keep they at the   forefront of our mind and do all we can to bring they home i remind the house that kfir bibas turn today in captivity i also wish both his majesty the king and her royal highness the princess of wales a speedy recovery 
 i thank the hon lady for again raise the important issue of infected blood this session follow cabinet office question in which a number of thing be place on record both by the paymaster general and by member i again remind the house that the compensation study be establish acknowledge the moral case for compensation that the study should be concurrent to the inquiry and that the inquiry and the study could make reference to each other the reason for that be to ensure that we could arrive as swiftly as possible at a compensation package for all those affect by this appalling scandal i do not disagree with any hon member who believe that we should not have to wait 
 as the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood my hon friend   the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley say in the cabinet office question the government now have all the information to arrive at a compensation scheme in those inquiry which be why the paymaster general be make progress on exactly that we be acutely aware of that moral imperative and what both the study and the inquiry have say on this matter so far this house have also be clear in its desire to see that appalling scandal resolve quickly i refer the hon lady to what the paymaster general just say at the dispatch box with regard to legislation but i be keep regularly inform of progress that he the treasury and other departments be make on this matter i expect more news on that important point in the come week 
 the hon lady refer to my article and i thank she for the publicity i argue that we should ensure that the consumer be king again we have some challenging new monopoly the natural monopoly of water company and the online giant and we need to ensure that the customer be king that be what the government have be do through our legislation to improve competition and the work we be take forward with regulator on a whole raft of thing from energy bill to other consumer issue we can do because we have a plan we have a plan on all the issue face the public 
 i expect praise from those on my own bench but i be much encouraged at the praise we hear yesterday from the opposition benches labour member   the hon member for putney fleur anderson be urge a focus on reduce the backlog and end hotel use she say 
 the conservatives start this work by employ some temporary new officer and it start to work 
 she go on 
 the tories have also start smash the gang through the work they be do in france ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 she be right on that priority she could have add that crossing be down by this year the albanian return scheme have see a fall in arrival and we have dismantle alongside the french organise criminal gang we be make progress on that and other area the health statistic announce show that the waiting list figure   the hon member for manchester   central lucy powell   mention be come down these be not easy problem particularly because of the recovery from the pandemic and the global situation on price and supply chain but we have a plan and we be methodically work through it with assistance from the labour party 
 on any issue and priority we be stick to that plan the reason we can do that and be not be blow off course be that we have some principle back it up unlike the labour party we understand our duty to the people of this country whether that be set up inquiry into infected blood and the horizon scandal or on the people ’s priority which be also the prime minister ’s top priority we have never waver in our duty to the people of this country we have never waver in our support to protect our country ’s border and protect the defence of the realm unlike the hon lady ’s party which have current shadow cabinet member who vote against our continuous at sea deterrent we be work to strengthen our border and stop the boat the labour party have vote consistently against that legislation we believe in support minimum service standard on vital public health service include health and transport labour have oppose that and we have take tough decision on help the economy include control borrowing which be why inflation be down by since october and the office for budget responsibility forecast inflation fall to this year labour ’s state policy on fiscal rule and spending mean that it will have to raise taxis if it want to stick to those fiscal rule but it have not say what and when 
 on all those thing we have a plan and it be work we be go to stick to it despite what the labour party be do labour have no plan just a big fat bill for taxpayer 
 i call the father of the house 
 i agree with a great deal of what the shadow leader of the house   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   say about tony lloyd and i agree with much if not all that my right hon friend the leader of the house say on party politic have a plan and deliver for the british people 
 next week the select committee on the holocaust memorial bill continue its hearing it have session this week and transcript can be make available in the vote office issue that come up be the government ’s continue failure to publish the minute of the uk holocaust memorial foundation from to there be a consultation on a site for the propose memorial and learning centre the consultant analyse the response and shortlist day later the government produce an alternative option which be victoria tower gardens 
 no outside the department have see the comparison between the merit of victoria tower gardens and other possible site no have see the minute of discussion change the specification behind the back of the public will my right hon friend look to see the redaction make by the department for environment food and rural affairs and why it be continue to instruct lawyer to oppose the freedom of information request which be vital to the work of the select committee through she may i recommend to the select committee ask for that information and make it public 
 i presume that the father of the house be ask for a debate on the matter as well 
 i know that this issue which my hon friend raise almost weekly be of great concern to he and that he want to ensure that the final outcome of the process be as good as it can be i will again make sure that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have hear what he have say the next session of question to the secretary of state will be on   january and my hon friend may wish to raise the matter with he directly this be the kind of information that should be in the public domain so that people can make good decision although on some matter relate to security concern for example it may be sensible to redact 
 let i start by associate myself with all the remark about tony lloyd whom i always find to be a very good and decent man 
 once again i be indebted to the leader of the house her eccentric video last week in which she joke about tupperware and the stone of destiny excite quite a response in scotland why be she always on about scotland people ask the tories have give we a joke minister for common sense and now it look as if we have a minister for clickbait 
 scotland do seem to be just a big joke for the leader of the house the brief seem clear to rubbish and insult scot every week during business question of course she be not alone this seem to be tory policy nowadays but she be add value now by produce full page article in the paper about how awful scotland be along with a new clickbait video every week all that effort mr speaker although give the very bad news for her party in this week 's yougov poll perhaps these joke video be in fact audition perhaps it be not so much stand up and fight as stand up comedian 
 meanwhile the record of the right hon lady ’s own government be absolutely nothing to joke about with destitution rise doctor on strike cripple the english nhs sea coast foul with pollution inhumane treatment of asylum seeker and the breaching of international law unresolved scandal pile up and the crush impact of of the bad tory joke of all brexit but before we be treat to oh i do not know perhaps an attack on the scottish government and praise for the bullish action of the zombie scotland office let i say this surely scotland can find a well use for what be it now over quid?—than funding that ever expand propaganda unit beaver away behind the scene undermine the work of the scottish parliament and of course assist the leader of the house with her script each week 
 close to this place however we have the westminster joke of the other place with its or so ermine clothe peer but notable absentee the right hon lady ’s scottish tory friend and colleague baroness mone be currently not a sit member because she have take leave of absence by her own choice it be be report in the daily record that baroness mone claim she be still a conservative as far as she be concern because she never have the whip remove can the leader of the house confirm that if baroness mone resume her position in the other place tomorrow as i believe she be entitle to do she can sit as a conservative if not   exactly when be the whip remove can the leader of the house make time to answer that question before read out this week 's hilarious clickbait script 
 the hon lady should thank i i have be give her publicity that money can not buy and i think it be encouraging that we have generate such a following and such an interest in what go on in the chamber during business question let i make it clear to the hon lady that i be not talk scotland down i be talk the scottish national party down because it have be an unmitigated disaster for scotland the stoicism of the scottish people in deal with their inept government deserve great credit 
 each week the hon lady talk about our record on delivery and invite i to make the comparison with the scottish government i shall try to do so this week without mention the appalling record of the snp government and just invite people to contrast our record with theirs 
 in the uk we have the large rail infrastructure investment since victorian time we have massive regeneration project across the uk more than mile of major road have be refurbish compare that with the a9 please we have time as much offshore wind capacity as we have when we enter office household have full fibre broadband how be the scottish government ’s broadband rollout go then there be our hospital mental health facility new surgical hub new nuclear power station and record investment in home and flood defence and in the come financial year our research and development spend will be about £ 
 in the strategic defence and security review greenlit a couple of aircraft carrier and year later be commission that complex tonne warship be build through the carrier alliance a wonderful example of the uk supply chain work together after the same year timeframe the snp be still build a couple of ferry which be £ over budget for context the overspend be time the original budget and i now understand that these pioneer green vessel will run on diesel 
 the snp government have be an unmitigated disaster for scotland they have be find out they be incapable and incorrigible and now they be in trouble 
 the hon lady ’s final question be a matter for the house of lords not the house of commons 
 the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe will be meet in strasbourg next week which mean that member on the uk delegation will not be here for the tribute to tony lloyd he be latterly an effective and diligent member of that assembly and i hope we will be able to pay our tribute in strasbourg we miss his charm and humanity as a fellow member who enter this house in i have the privilege of know he for a very long time 
 will the leader of the house initiate a debate on the effectiveness or otherwise of integrate care board the rationale for the board be to deal with the interaction between health and social care and to reduce the incidence of bed blocking last week we hear that no few than hospital bed in dorset be occupy   by people who do not need they at a cost of over £ a day let alone the opportunity cost of miss operation and so on this be intolerable and show that the system of integrate care be not work can we have a debate 
 i thank my hon friend for put on record his beautiful tribute to tony lloyd it would be wonderful if such tribute could also be hear in strasbourg 
 my hon friend be right that it be vital that commissioner be hold to account our nhs will not function properly without accountability and choice the former secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend   the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay undertake work on patient outcome datum and the quality of commission in each board and across the uk which will help to drive accountability now that we have that datum i be sure it will make for a very interesting debate my hon friend know how to apply for a debate and he may also wish to raise this matter with the secretary of state on   january 
 i call the chair of the backbench business committee

 i apologise to the leader of the house because last week i raise the subject of the tyne bridge which i raise again at prime minister ’s question yesterday but it be a matter of urgency and i will quickly explain why the tyne bridge and its surround building be the furth inland nesting place for kittiwake if we do not get the work start before the kittiwake return from their wintering it will become increasingly difficult because it will mean disturb kittiwake nest we do not want to do that so we want to get on with the work there be urgency from an environmental perspective but also from a financial perspective the work really need to be start as soon as possible i thank the leader of the house for write to the department for transport on my behalf last week but i would like she to understand the urgency of why we need to do that 
 i apologise mr speaker that i miss next week ’s business question as i will be on select committee business 
 priority of course 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his very helpful advert to all member for forthcoming debate i will ensure that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have also hear the hon gentleman ’s concern about the bridge and again i will ask the department for transport to lean in 
 may i add my tribute to tony lloyd he be a good man who never underestimate or undervalue the extreme power of kindness 
 the leader of the house will have see last month ’s judgment in the case of the duke of sussex v. mirror group newspapers ltd which record that witness for mgn accept that in the culture media and sport committee be mislead by the then executive at the mirror try to conceal the illegal and unlawful activity that be go on the individual accuse of mislead the committee die in do the leader of the house agree that any attempt to mislead committee be unacceptable but especially those by medium organisation from which the public and parliament expect honesty and integrity will she commit to keep the important issue of select committee power under review so that committee such as mine can continue to operate without obstruction 
 i thank my hon friend for her question the power and privilege of this house be necessary to enable parliament to function freely and fully and it be vital that select committees be able to obtain full and accurate evidence from witness as part of their inquiry that be critical the power available to this house and select committees have be under continual review and they have be investigate numerous time in the past decade it be of course very frustrating when witness do not co operate with select committees and the government support this house in assert its power to ensure that it can scrutinise effectively 
 may i say how sad we on the liberal democrat benches be that tony lloyd have pass away i be a councillor in rochdale when tony become the police and crime commissioner in greater manchester he be such a decent man and a sincere politician and public servant 
 warm and comfortable home be crucial to reach net and reduce energy bill people should be encourage to invest in energy save measure but a complicated certification landscape mean that it be difficult to find qualified and reliable installer a review of this issue have be recommend by the competition and markets authority and support by which can we please have a debate in government time on consumer protection in the green heating and insulation sector 
 i thank the hon lady for her very important question the competition and markets authority be do important work in a number of area and that be of they we have have announcement   on petrol retail for example in the last week i shall certainly make sure that the secretary of state have hear her concern about that particular area 
 southport pier be a significant feature of our town ’s life for over year until it be close by sefton council in december give the significance of pier to many town around the country particularly because of the economic impact that they can have will my right hon friend agree to have a debate on how can they be restore and maintain for future generation 
 the government recognise the importance of these often much love heritage asset that be why part of the coastal community fund be there to renovate heritage building particularly pier and lido and we have do that we have renovate an enormous number of those type of structure across the uk 
 even sad than the pier closing be the fact that it receive £ through the coastal community fund and only a few year ago undergo a £ enhancement there be question about the use of that public money and what my hon friend ’s local authority be do 
 i want to alert the leader of the house to action by a private security firm on the wynyard estate in my constituency to stop legitimate political campaigning there be thousand of home on the estate but chris mcdonald who i hope will succeed i as the labour mp for stockton north be order to leave the area by guard he be tell that they do not allow cold caller and that be how they categorise labour activist the leader of the house will recognise that as anti democratic deny thousand of people the right to hear from those who seek to represent they i would be oblige if she could use her office to investigate the silencing of politician and make it clear that people of whatever political colour should not be stop carry out perfectly legal activity 
 i will certainly ensure that the cabinet office have hear about that case i think there be sometimes a misunderstanding about the function of local councillor and member of parliament when they go door to door try to identify issue there be certain area in local authority particularly those with a high volume of quite vulnerable people where cold calling zone be in place that be perfectly proper i will certainly raise the matter with minister but i also encourage member to address such issue directly and locally often these thing be misunderstanding if people say what their business be in a particular area hopefully such incident will not arise but i will ensure that minister have hear the hon gentleman 
 may i add my word of condolence to the family of tony lloyd i serve with he on the international trade committee he always make a valuable contribution and will be sadly miss

 i will be here to pay tribute to my friend tony lloyd at the appropriate time 
 the hillsborough inquiry the post office horizon scandal windrush contaminate blood and lgbtq veteran have all be the subject of report and they be all example of how the state treat working class people when it should be there to support they victim of the last of those scandal windrush contaminate blood and veteran be still wait for their compensation to be sort out and for the outcome of the report to be enact can we have some form of cross party arrangement whereby we can all come to an agreement on how we should respond to the report and treat those people with the dignity to which they be entitle the government be just obfuscate and kick the can down the road we know that we be at the fag end of the government but these thing need deal with now why can we not have some co operation to bring matter to a conclusion for those people 
 in last week ’s session i speak about many of the inquiry and issue that the hon gentleman raise i be proud of this government ’s record in bring forward for the time in some instance inquiry into such matter and in make public apology on behalf of the state about some of those issue i will not repeat what i say early about the legislation and progress on infected blood but i will repeat the statement with which i end my evidence to the infected blood inquiry about why the inquiry be so important not just to a comparatively small group who have be affect or infect but to all of we because it could have be any of we anyone in the country could have be affect 
 how the state respond to such matter be incredibly important and we all want to see justice do last week i write to the cabinet office about how we could learn lesson from the series of inquiry we have set up i know that the paymaster general be in regular touch with the all party group that be primarily concerned with the issue the hon gentleman raise and with   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson in addition many people in the house and other stakeholder be engage in consultation and provide their input 
 we be determined to get these long run injustice resolve that have be our visible track record when i be paymaster general i admit that there be a   moral obligation on infected blood and i set up the compensation study we will deliver on it with i hope the support of opposition members 
 i send my condolence to the family and friend of tony lloyd i do not know he well personally but i know he well within this place he be not just well respected but well like which be quite hard for a politician of such tenure he be also know to be very kind and the immeasurable difference he make to this place will last for generation 
 i recently speak to a constituent who be concern about fraudster knock on door dress as if they work for a commercial business with the intention to scam usually vulnerable resident will my right hon friend advise on how that issue can be address to ensure that resident feel safe when open the door to people who be supposedly sell to they 
 may i start by say how good it be to see my hon friend in his place again fit and well early we hear from an opposition member about cold call zone and measure that be put in place to protect area with a high volume of vulnerable people which be way to address the problem that my hon friend raise that be within the gift of local authority and may be something his local resident wish to see i will also ask the relevant department on his behalf whether there be any good practice that can be pass to my hon friend ’s office 
 time and again the government have ignore warning about the crisis brewing in adult social care child ’s service and homelessness that combine with rise cost be push local council finance over the brink the result be that from lunch club to library and from art group to youth centre to support bus service community be lose the thing that bring people together and support their life can we have a debate in government time on the impact that this loss of social infrastructure be have on community and particularly on the old the young the sick the disabled and those who already face extreme poverty 
 the hon lady will know how to apply for a debate in the usual way but i also draw her attention to the local government finance settlement and the offer from the secretary of state and his ministers to discuss that with member i urge she to take he up on that offer if she so desire i also point to the work and focus across many government departments on the issue that she raise i be think in particular of the department of health and social care and the work that the minister for veterans affairs my right hon friend   the member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer have be undertake with regard to homelessness 
 last week i meet my constituent kym ledgar a former sub postmistress and former representative of the national federation of subpostmasters i be already appal but be now incense by the story that the victim of the post office horizon scandal have to tell i welcome   the government ’s commitment to complete the process of exoneration and resolve outstanding compensation claim as soon as possible but those responsible need to be hold accountable do my right hon friend agree that the government should learn from victim of this appalling miscarriage of justice will she find parliamentary time to debate the introduction of a whistleblow bill to protect brave citizen who speak out against corporate wrongdoing in the future 
 i thank my hon friend for her work on that matter her question come in a week when we have also see report about previous whistleblower on other issue such as maggie oliver and her work on groom gang at tremendous personal cost to herself lose her career and livelihood in the process we owe those individual a huge debt of gratitude and i will certainly make sure that the cabinet office have hear what my hon friend have say as i mention i write last week to the cabinet office ask it to reflect on what it could learn from horizon and from other inquiry that we have establish my hon friend may wish to raise the matter directly at the business and trade question on   january
