the minister of state department for transport my right hon friend   the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman who be the minister for the future of transport meet murphy group this week the government remain committed to the low thames crossing as part of the responsible decision take to help meet inflationary pressure and balance the nation ’s book we will be rephase construction on the ltc by year as this will allow more time to take into account stakeholder view and to ensure that there remain an effective and deliverable plan that be in the good interest of taxpayer 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i think he welcome what we have decide to do with the pay increase which leave a typical teacher with £ we be reprioritise within the department for education ’s exist budget to deliver the additional funding to school but we be protect core school funding and frontline service we have put in additional sum of money through the spending review and subsequent fiscal event £ in and £ in the number add up and he will recognise that 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of rail privatisation 
 the private sector have play an integral role in improve our railway over the past quarter of a century deliver a doubling in passenger journey and an expansion of service on offer the current railway industry structure be in clear need of simplification and reform under a revitalise public private partnership we will deliver a join up customer focus railway with an enhanced role for the private sector work in partnership with great british railways to deliver for customer 
 the uk government have now nationalise twice as many rail line as the scottish government but continue to cling to the ideological view that privatisation have not fail rail service why will the uk government not finally admit what everyone else have know for over year which be that the disastrous experiment with privatisation have be a disaster a disaster for passenger taxpayer and the rail network 
 because the fact simply do not support the hon lady ’s contention on the eve of the pandemic passenger number have more than double since privatisation service have increase by a and investment have double include more than £ of private sector investment while the uk have of the good safety record for rail in europe there have clearly be challenge because of the pandemic and that be reason why we need to have reform this government do not have an ideological view we have already say and i have say that we want a public private partnership there be a role for the state work with the private sector to deliver the good service for passenger that be the right approach and it be the we will continue to deliver 
 what plan he have to reform ticketing for railway service 
 what plan he have to reform ticketing for railway service 
 what plan he have to reform ticketing for railway service 
 we be deliver on the plan for rail commitment to improve railway ticketing we recently announce that contactless pay as you go will be extend to another station in the south east and we be work with greater manchester and the west midlands on pay as you go trailblazer devolution deal commitment some of all ticket can be purchase online or through ticket machine 
 may i wish the minister of state a happy big birthday sarah from my office think he look no old than i may not always agree with she on that 
 of my constituent who work at a local station reach out to i last week with concern about the department ’s plan in the email my constituent say 
 by close the ticket office you take away a focal point of contact how be someone in need go to find i on a station that be as big and spread out as ours 
 can the minister reassure we both that those who need assistance will be able to locate staff easily 
 there be no well place to celebrate my half century than this place with friend and even great colleague 
 i thank my hon friend and i thank his constituent for the work he perform at berkhamsted and tre station these station along with another station will be get pay as you go by the end of the year we know that of transaction be complete outside ticket office and this shift tend to increase for station that operate pay as you go he ask about ensure that staff at ticket barrier be easily identifiable i believe that be the case and we will certainly make sure as these reform be roll out by train operator that it continue to be the case the proposal from train operator be aim at redeploy ticket office staff to part of the station where all passenger will access they and see they 
 will my hon friend confirm when my constituent will be able to access the tap in and tap out service from the station in my constituency at laindon basildon east tilbury pitsea and stanford le hope 
 yes i can i thank my hon friend for the work he have do in ensure that part of the roll out of the include of his station i can confirm that we be on track to get those deliver by the end of the year across the rail network that will take we to more than station with pay as you go 
 i thank the government for expand the pay as you go scheme to station in the windsor constituency which mean that people can quickly tap in and tap out when they commute it strike i that people be under increase financial pressure during these difficult time so will the minister confirm that it be the government ’s intention to roll the scheme out far afield and that people travel in that way will get the good available fare 
 yes and i thank my hon friend for the work he put into ensure that his constituency station at windsor be part of that i can give he that assurance as well as provide seamless tap in tap out payment fare will be simplify so that most adult passenger can be confident that pay as you go will be the good price for they on the day of travel 
 many of my constituent in battersea be concerned about the government ’s plan to close ticket office at wandsworth town and clapham junction those closure will have a severe negative impact on disabled people include blind and partially sight people and their ability to book assistance buy ticket or use the rail network only of those with sight loss say that they can use a ticket machine and nearly third say that it would be impossible will the minister set out what assessment have be make on the impact of those closure and will he publish it 
 the hon lady be a london mp and she will be aware that when london underground do exactly the same thing for the underground it be deem a success that be why the current labour mayor have no plan to reverse it the group i meet be that represent disability and access issue because i want to ensure that the reform good help those individual the aim be to redeploy staff away from the ticket office where not so many people be see to the front of the station where all passenger can access they that will particularly benefit those who have accessibility and disability challenge 
 i wish the minister a happy birthday but may i respectfully bring to his attention the experience share by stephen anderson who provide evidence to the transport committee recently he highlight this issue and say that if he require assistance he need a designate point to approach rather than have to call out for help on the platform in essence stephen believe that ticket office closure be merely a means to cut staff as a disabled passenger impact by previous government policy stephen express a view echo by other witness include baroness tanni grey thompson do the minister share their concern 
 i thank my hon friend i enjoy all the work that i do with he i take the point that he make with regard to stephen but i passionately believe that the good help that anyone can give in a rail station be through personal interaction that be difficult when somebody be behind a glass screen because they be not able to exit that point and go and help it be strike that the recent report on accessibility by the office of rail and road show that demand for passenger assist   at station have increase by on that basis and because few people be now purchase ticket from the ticket office only in it surely make sense to put the staff out on the platform where they can be access and where they can help and reassure people and give they more assistance 
 halifax ticket office be face closure we know that in journey on northern be purchase at a ticket office which be high than the national average there might be more of a case for close ticket office if there be not near constant chaos on rail network in the north pretty relentless cancel and delay service be not uncommon with the fragmentation of the ticket on offer result in everybody have question about what service they can get on and when why on earth be the government allow the closure of the ticket office 
 this be ultimately a matter for the train operator but they have take the view that their staff can be well redeploy across the station concourse platform and barrier access of passenger rather than the nationally who purchase their ticket from a ticket office effectively this be the railway catch up with the change in passenger behaviour and demand i very much hope that in halifax there will be a well service as a result some train operator be look to turn currently unstaffed station into staff station by redeploying and i again give the commitment from the train operator that no currently staff station will become unstaffed as a result of these change 
 i gently say to the minister that chorley matter to i its ticket office be open all day but the proposal be to have somebody available from to which be half the time please do take this up for people with disability rightly but do not forget that what you be be tell be not the case 
 what recent step he have take with cabinet colleague to reduce disruption cause by roadwork 
 what recent step he have take with cabinet colleague to reduce disruption cause by roadwork 
 roadwork be essential to ensure the safety and integrity of england ’s highway network and it be also essential that utility company can install and repair the equipment on which we all rely some disruption be inevitable but the government have introduce several initiative such as street manager to reduce that another tool lane rental scheme allow local highway authority to charge work promoter for the time that street work and roadwork occupy the highway charge be focus on the very busy street at the busy time with the aim of reduce congestion 
 the west midland have great transport connectivity but we be particularly vulnerable to congestion cause by roadwork the work to replace the central barrier on a mile stretch of the m42 be cause   delay to my constituent and many other across the region that work be clearly important but it be vital that we minimise disruption please can the minister outline what step have be take to ensure that these work be complete as soon as possible 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be in the west midland just a couple of week ago visit the rac just off the m42 the scheme between junction and to replace the barrier will provide increase safety to driver which remain our top priority once complete the new barrier will require significantly less maintenance and repair after incident which will far reduce disruption for her constituent to minimise disruption national highways have endeavour to keep all lane open to traffic and be utilise the long daytime hour and good weather to complete the work as quickly as possible for her constituent 
 i thank the minister for personally endorse my can the cone campaign and my associate roadworks regulation bill which have its reading in november great frustration of modern life be spend age crawl through a set of traffic light at a contraflow to finally drive past a large hole in the road immaculately con off with no do any work on it the bill be design to make it much more difficult for that to happen do the minister have any good news at all that might help all of we in our constituency to can the cone 
 i thank my right hon friend for his excellent and continue work in this area alongside his colleague in chelmsford southend and elsewhere in essex i be particularly pleased to see that he have already manage to persuade essex county council to move ahead with a lane rental scheme and his regulatory reform suggestion be be consider by the department i hope to be able to update the house later in the year because the progress that he have suggest be directly feed into the government ’s general policy 
 what step he have take to improve infrastructure for cycling and walking 
 the government as the house will be aware be invest more than any other in active travel with more than £ in investment over this parliament which enable the delivery of high quality scheme across the country active travel england be help local authority to deliver the great possible value for money in that investment by ensure that relevant scheme comply with the guidance it be also ensure that any active travel scheme fund by the department be of the high quality 
 in the minister ’s department say 
 increase walking and cycling can make life easy and more convenient for people whilst help to tackle some of the most challenging issue we face as a society improve health and wellbeing improve air quality combat climate change and tackle congestion on our road 
 his department ’s data confirm all that include the role that low traffic neighbourhood play in all this now the secretary of state have boast that he have stop fund for future ltns as part of the third cut in active travel which the local authority do not have the money to build back up due to the cut they have have why be the government pander to the twitter warrior and not the datum and those in their own party who support investment in active travel 
 i find that surprising if i may say so because this government be not only invest but seek to reduce any possibility of conflict between driver of car and cyclist i do not think the hon lady should disagree with policy that be design to reduce that conflict what we want to see be more choice for people in how they travel inevitably many and increase number of people want to use active travel because of all its health and environmental advantage 
 while we all want to encourage and give people the freedom to travel how they wish include by walk or cycling will the minister confirm that the government be not anti car that they will allow people the freedom to travel when they want where they want in their own vehicle and indeed that blanket mph zone where congestion build up be not good for anyone in local community 
 we be respectful of decision make locally by local authority but he be absolutely right that as i say we be seek to promote choice that approach do mean that where people want to use car they will be perfectly able to do so and where they want to use active travel with all its personal and environmental benefit they can do that as well 
 i call the shadow minister 
 of the most effective way to increase active travel uptake be to improve road safety but progress in this area have stagnate the last labour government cut road fatality by almost compare with a mere reduction under this conservative government back in ministers promise a new road safety strategic framework but year and secretary of state later all we have be tell be that it will be publish in due course meanwhile countless people remain hesitant to embrace active travel due to safety concern will the minister move beyond the soundbite and provide some much need clarity on when the strategy will finally see the light of day 
 we take safety extremely seriously and have do a lot of work on this issue over the year the whole point of have dedicate active travel infrastructure on the scale that it be be roll out at the moment be to segregate and improve safety for those use active travel i be sure that the hon lady will welcome the excellent work do on connected and autonomous vehicle because they offer a potentially revolutionary improvement in safety over time 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 in answer to my write question it be confirm that active travel be down to just of departmental spending last year but that be positively lavish compare with this year and next year the scottish government will spend £ million—10 of their transport budget which be great than the active travel budget for the whole of england will the minister urgently review active travel spend to ensure that the poor who rely more on walk and wheeling to get around be not disproportionately impact during this tory cost of living crisis 
 the fact of the matter be through both covid and the barnett formula the scottish government have be fund at level that vastly exceed those available in england if be a herefordian as i be look with astonishment at the increase level of spend north of the border and wish that in many way a similar rural landscape such as our own be support as well as that 
 whether he have have recent discussion with relevant stakeholder on proposal for fund the expansion of heathrow airport 
 the answer be no 
 well that answer be succinct if nothing else the minister will know that a new chief executive have be appoint at heathrow airport ltd and he will inevitably meet that chief executive when he do will he take he through the costing of any road and rail infrastructure associate with the propose development of a runway heathrow have offer £ to cover the cost the government ’s airport commission calculate the cost at £ but we now believe that because of the tunnelling under the m25 and the road link and rail link in particular the rail link for western and southern access the cost of the scheme could be between £ and £ will he make it clear to the chief executive of heathrow that not a penny of taxpayer money will go into subsidise the profit of the overseas owner of heathrow 
 it appear that the right hon gentleman know a lot more about this than i do any expansion of heathrow be a matter for it as he will know if that be finance it will be by private finance for what be a private sector project the department have no position on this matter because at some point the secretary of state may need to be invite to decide on any development consent order so we do not take a view 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 while heathrow and gatwick set out plan to expand the government ’s regional airport strategy have be seriously undermine by the hopefully temporary closure of doncaster sheffield airport the secretary of state have the power to protect the air space around the airport while doncaster council undertake negotiation with peel on the lease will the secretary of state do that 
 we recognise this important issue the secretary of state have have the question put to he by local stakeholder he be consider the matter and will respond in due course 
 what step his department be take to support local authority to transition to low emission bus 
 our policy have be to support the introduction of emission bus which will reduce emission support manufacturing and improve the passenger experience the government be commit to support the introduction of emission bus and achieve an all emission bus fleet across the uk i be pleased to inform the house that since february an estimate emission bus have be fund across the uk include scotland of which be on the road 
 lothian buses which cover my constituency have remove tonne of carbon dioxide from its footprint include by introduce several electric bus together with the tram and the low emission zone that be help to reduce pollution particularly in corstorphine which have of the bad air pollution record in the country would the government consider give all local authority great power and resource to franchise bus service and simplify the application system to reverse the ban on local service set up their own company how will the government improve the measure already mention and introduce as we fight to tackle what be still of the pollution that we face every day 
 i thank the hon lady for her multiple question the government have commit to look into municipal bus by the end of the parliament on devolution we be happy to work with local authority right across england and wales on devolution settlement and what more can be do i be delighted to visit lothian buses to see its fantastic red white and gold livery right across the street of edinburgh and the wide region i see the excellent work it be do on the ground not just on local bus service provision but be a responsive service to the local community she represent 
 low emission bus rollout in cambridgeshire be go good gun but sadly all in cambridge at the same time the bus which connect the village of thorney with eye and peterborough will be ax by stagecoach at the end of the month so many people rely on that service in thorney to go to doctor ’s appointment see family and friend and go shop shockingly the combine authority mayor have know about the axing since may and have do nothing squat can the minister think of a well way to spend the million give to the mayor for bus rollout and to save the bus for all those people who rely on it 
 we will all miss the bus at this rate come on 
 my hon friend be a massive champion for his constituent across peterborough the bus be clearly a vital local link i encourage he to have those conversation with the combine authority mayor we have make the bus service improvement plan flexible to protect service i will make representation to that end on his behalf hopefully he and the mayor can come to an arrangement to ensure that all the funding we have put into that combine authority area really benefit the people of peterborough 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s commitment to deliver emission bus by the end of the parliament lie in tatter and be in the realm of fantasy no creative counting can hide the fact that there be still only bus fund through the emission bus regional area scheme on the road will the minister come clean with parliament and passenger and admit that the government will fail in spectacular style in their promise to deliver those emission bus on the road will the minister also take the opportunity to exercise a little humility and tell we how many bus have be order not funding allocate as that do not mean anything to anyone how many will be manufacture in the uk how many will realistically be on the road by the end of the parliament 
 if the hon gentleman have wait for a response to his write parliamentary question which be come late day he would have notice that bus from the zebra emission bus regional area scheme be now on the road he seem to have fail to realise that that be out of a total of that be on the road from out of the that have be fund across the uk he might want to ignore previous scheme but it be very important that we look at scheme right across the country on top of that he ask how many have be order across the country have be order we be make great progress towards the over by the end of the parliament if he would like to provide some extra cash or outline a labour policy that will do anything for bus user in this area i would really love to hear it 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of ticket office closure on rail user 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of ticket office closure on rail user 
 as i set out to the house last week these industry lead reform be about modernise the passenger experience when propose major change to ticket office opening hour include closure operator be require to take into account the adequacy of the propose alternative in relation to the need of all passenger and to include that in the notice of the proposal send to other operator and passenger group 
 mr speaker you yourself say that this news have be most unwelcome for the elderly disabled and blind be an impact equality assessment carry out i be lucky that sadiq khan be keep all my transport for london station open but rail worker risk their life for we all they be not watch box set of bridgerton during covid can the minister commit to say there will be no redundancy 
 mr speaker i will come back to you with regard to chorley station i repeat the aim of the train operator be to redeploy staff to where they can interact with all passenger rather than just the in who purchase ticket from ticket office some of all transaction can now be complete online or at ticket machine i will just repeat the point that the labour mayor of london seem to think that get more staff out and help more passenger be a good way to operate because that be exactly how london underground continue to operate as well as other operator across the country include the tyne and wear metro 
 i have a lot of respect for the minister who i believe want to do the right thing but the rosy picture he portray be not bear out by the reality in my constituency at burnage station the ticket office opening from be to pm be be replace by a person from midday to pm at east didsbury where the ticket office have the same and a half hour opening it be be replace by a person for hour from am and at mauldeth road the ticket office that open from be to pm be replace by a person from be to am all station have massively reduce hour by over third and importantly will no long be cover by a member of staff at rush hour how can the proposal result in anything other than a much bad service for my constituent and other passenger will he ask northern to rethink 
 the train operator proposal as i have state be to ensure that ticket office staff can be with member of the public and passenger where they well need they it be also undoubtedly the case that some ticket office be sell just ticket per hour so it may well be that train operator be look at exactly which hour be well attainable as i mention there be particular train operator that be currently look to staff currently unstaffed station by spread and redeploy staff across its network i will be have conversation with the train operator as the proposal move along i will certainly take forward the hon member ’s point and i thank he for his engagement early this week on high speed 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the minister have manage to unite labour mps his own back benchers you mr speaker disability group trade union and consumer group in their concern about these closure even former pointless presenter richard osman have voice his concern and it be little wonder because this consultation be completely pointless there be just day for people to voice their concern no equality impact assessment and no answer on job security accessibility or digital ticketing will the minister think again acknowledge the consultation be a sham pause it and go back to the drawing board 
 the consultation be under the ticketing and settlement agreement which i believe be put in place under the last labour government so i very much believe it be a good and robust process it allow for a period of time for member of the public and hon member in this place to give their view on individual station there be then a day period for passenger group to take they into account work with the train operator to try to reach an agreement and ensure that all current accessibility and opportunity requirement be take into account and maintain i fundamentally believe that rather than the railway be stick in the past it need to adapt and change in the manner that its passenger be if in passenger be operate the booking office purchase system that mean that of passenger be not see a member of staff that member of staff can look after they give they information make they feel more reassure and assist they on to the train that be a modern railway in action 
 what step he be take to decarbonise transport infrastructure 
 all transport infrastructure project deliver by the department ’s arm ’s length body be require to undertake whole life carbon assessment and set carbon reduction target as part of their business case national highways hs2 ltd and network rail have already set out ambitious plan for achieve net and we be support they in their delivery through the live labs competition we award £ of funding to new regional project to boost innovation in decarbonise highway infrastructure 
 i recently visit polypipe in my constituency which design develop and manufacture thermoplastic piping system from recycled material for civil and infrastructure project i understand that the government and national highways tend to favour the use of concrete to make ducting for cable over plastic for the road network despite it be weak less resilient and bad for the environment could more consideration be give to use recycled material such as the plastic manufacture by polypipe in the construction of road infrastructure project to help to achieve our net goal 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and it be very interesting to hear about the work of polypipe she will be aware that those decision be for national highways as an arm ’s length body but she have put that point on the record in hansard and i would be very happy to put the question to national highways so that it be specifically consider in detail 
 do the minister have an estimate for the cost of decarbonise our transport system especially when we factor in the improvement to the national grid for the extra electricity supply will he also look again at reverse the deeply unpopular policy of ban internal combustion engine vehicle from be sell after 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that a very wide range of information about potential cost and budget be already in the public domain from the department across a very wide range of mode on electric vehicle we have just consult on regulation on the emission vehicle mandate and £ of new private investment be be schedule on the basis of those projection that will transform our charge infrastructure and we should all welcome it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the climate breakdown datum come in from around the planet at the moment be truly terrifying so decarbonise transport be vital if we be to meet our climate change commitment will the minister pledge to continue the work lay out just year ago in the maritime strategy as recommend by the transport committee 
 the hon gentleman may know that we have just have a very interesting and successful potential negotiation at the international maritime organisation we take this issue extremely seriously both as regard the decarbonisation of port and the creation of green route and other form of maritime decarbonisation we absolutely be work on this agenda recognise that it be of the most difficult area of all to decarbonise over time 
 what progress his department have make on deliver improvement to the black cat roundabout on the a1 in bedfordshire 
 follow the dismissal of the recent judicial review the a428 black cat to caxton gibbet scheme be due to begin construction later this year with the open for traffic date plan for 
 i thank the minister for that update as he will know with the closure today of the consultation on suggestion for the next phase of road infrastructure ris3 or the road investment strategy it make a lot of sense for the department to continue the momentum by now look at alternative to the remain roundabout on the a1 in my constituency sandy biggleswade north and biggleswade south 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and it be a delight to visit some of his constituent not that long ago in sandy to discuss this and biggleswade roundabout on a route i use regularly we will continue to keep all these scheme for the long term improvement of our strategic road network under review they be very important particularly when it come to road safety and i look forward to have further discussion with he in future 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change pattern of rail travel on the planning assumption for hs2 
 before i answer the right hon gentleman ’s question i hope you will give i permission mr speaker to inform the house if it have not already notice that hs2 ltd announce yesterday that mark thurston its chief executive officer will stand down in september i want to thank he on the record in the house for his work over the last year on progress britain ’s most transformative rail project he successfully oversee the start of construction and he ensure that hs2 have create ten of thousand of skilled job and apprenticeship across the country the government and i be grateful for his exemplary service 
 to answer the right hon gentleman ’s question hs2 be a railway for the country ’s long term prosperity and it be already bring significant economic benefit to his constituent in the west midland where business have already win £ worth of work deliver hs2 
 i thank the secretary of state for that waffle i actually ask he about the basic planning assumption for this project because the ongoing case for hs2 would have have to be base on estimate of future passenger number particularly for business travel and inter city commuting follow the pandemic we all know there have be a major change because of video conferencing and work from home what be his department ’s late projection of inter city passenger number and how do they affect the viability of the hs2 project quite apart from the escalating construction cost will he publish those figure 
 i think the right hon gentleman fundamentally misunderstand hs2 be a railway for the come decade not for the next few year what happen during the pandemic should not affect the case for hs2 also he assume that business traveller be the only people who will use hs2 it be true that business and commuter traffic be down follow the pandemic but we have see leisure service rebound very strongly with passenger number high than they be pre pandemic 
 when i be in japan recently i see that high speed train be not only use by business user they be use by everyone who use the railway hs2 will free up enormous capacity for the right hon gentleman ’s constituent on the west coast main line and it will get more freight off the road and on to our rail network he should welcome all those thing 
 what step he be take to improve rail service 
 early this year i set out my vision to modernise the railway industry as part of my bradshaw address this include ambition for a customer focus commercially lead rail industry and the creation of great british railways as its new guide mind we continue to invest record sum in improve infrastructure and just last week i be pleased to officially open the late phase of the south west rail resilience programme at dawlish part of a £ investment to date which i know the hon gentleman be about to welcome 
 the secretary of state be right that i welcome the programme 
 this week the charity devon in sight send an email to its supporter include i title propose closure to railway ticket offices the email about the consultation be short 
 please find attach a letter from we detail how you can make an objection 
 why do the secretary of state suppose that a devon charity that look out for blind people should presume that its supporter would want to object 
 i be not entirely certain exactly what the hon gentleman be ask the rail minister my hon friend   the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman set out the purpose of the rail company proposal very well the rail company be consult on the proposal the purpose of which be to recognise the change reality that most passenger purchase their ticket either online or from a ticket machine and most of they do not go near a ticket office it be about get the staff out of office and into the station so they can support all passenger include those who be old or disabled and who need assistance rather than have they stick in a ticket office that be the point of the proposal and there will be a detailed consultation i be sure the hon gentleman will respond to the consultation which the rail company can take into account as they pursue their proposal 
 whether he plan to exempt fisherman on vessel below metre from medical certificate requirement 
 the requirement for people work at sea to have a medical fitness certificate apply to vessel of every size in every other commercial sector however minister be listen carefully to the view of colleague across the house on the good way to progress this issue and i look forward to the hon lady ’s follow up question 
 there be real anxiety up and down the country among fisherman as a result of the government ’s policy which be see to be expensive and onerous my constituent bob be of those fisherman who have work on fishing vessel his whole life i be pleased to hear that the secretary of state be listen carefully i hope he will meet fishing representative to hear their concern 
 either i or the maritime minister will be pleased to do that i hope i can reassure the hon member ’s constituent that of the case that have be through the mca ’s medical assessor no fisherman have be fail except who do not provide the evidence require she will also know that there be grandfather provision for those fisherman already in the industry if they obtain their medical certificate before   november and i urge they to do so if she write to either i or the maritime minister i will make sure that of we meet she and her constituent 
 what step he be take to improve railway infrastructure 
 we continue to invest in upgrade the railway across england and wales with a budget of about £ a year include open new station and new line in the past year in the north east the government be invest in darlington station the northumberland line and the east coast main line upgrade 
 i thank the minister for his answer but the most critical rail infrastructure need in the north east by far be the leamside line project start with ferryhill station its importance can not be overstate it be about resilience capacity and level up can he tell we when we will get spade in the ground to show our commitment to constituent in ferryhill and let they see the economic benefit that these station will bring 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who be a champion of rail in the north east i thank he for his long stand support for this scheme and for sponsor the bid for restore your railway idea fund to reopen a station at ferryhill the update strategic outline business case for the ferryhill middlesbrough proposal be with the department and we will be look at it shortly 
 railway ticket office be essential railway infrastructure the minister have say that his hope be that staff will be redeploy on to the concourse so can he comment on the fact that the planning assumption for great western railway once it close the ticket office in plymouth be that it will cut the number of role at plymouth station by as part of a cut in the workforce across the network in the south west be that his actual plan can he also publish the letter of instruction send by his department to train operating company require they to start the consultation on ticket office closure 
 i certainly intend to be as transparent as you would expect in this regard mr speaker so i will look into the hon member ’s request i re emphasise that this be a consultation by the train operator his own train operator will no doubt take his comment about the station in his constituency on board that will then be assess by the passenger body and if matter need to be work upon i would expect those body to do that if that can not occur it move to an ultimate determination in the department for transport 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 tomorrow mark year since the government publish their decarbonisation plan our road map to clean travel in that time we have come a long way we have agree international target for aviation decarbonisation allow aviation to grow without harm the climate as the minister of state department for transport my right hon friend   the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman say just last week at the international maritime organisation we work   with our partner to secure the agreement of other member state for net shipping by our emission vehicle mandate will see this country continue to lead the world ’s major economy in decarbonise road transport open the door to not only significant reduction in carbon emission but investment and manufacturing opportunity to turbocharge british business on every mode of transport we be work to cut our carbon emission grow the economy and business and give people across the country the freedom to travel when they need to in the way that suit they well without have to worry about the environmental impact of do so

 i call the shadow secretary of state for transport 
 do the secretary of state think it be acceptable that the village of little ouseburn and beal in the selby and ainsty constituency have no bus service either in the evening or on sundays who do he hold responsible for that be it the tory government which completely snub selby and ainsty in their bus strategy the tory council which cut km of subsidised bus route or the previous tory mp who mention bus just time in over year do he not agree that it be time for selby and ainsty to have a fresh start with keir mather 
 it will not surprise you mr speaker that i do not think that at all north yorkshire council the local transport authority for selby be allocate £ as part of the bus service improvement plan plus funding that mean it have the resource to deliver the ambition plan that it need to carry out on her point i think claire holmes who be deeply rooted in yorkshire and have live there for her entire life be the good candidate i be there last week deliver leaflet for she and i will be there later today she will make a fantastic member of parliament and i look forward to welcome she to the house

 mr speaker i have just return from the nato summit in vilnius where we strengthen the nato alliance and confirm britain ’s place at its heart face with a more volatile and dangerous world a mechanised war in europe and increase aggression from authoritarian state we must show those who would challenge our security and prosperity that nato be united that it be ready for this new era and that it will remain the most successful alliance in history 
 together with our ally that be exactly what we do in specific way we act decisively to strengthen the alliance we agree the most fundamental transformation to nato ’s readiness since the cold war that include comprehensive war fight plan to defend the uk and its ally scale up defence production to boost our stockpile which will benefit british industry and job and increase defence spending all ally make 
 an endure commitment to invest at least 
 of gdp 
 the vilnius summit also see nato ’s membership expand we welcome finland to the table as a nato member and ensure that sweden will follow close behind the historic decision of our finnish and swedish friend to join nato would have be almost unthinkable just a year and a half ago but putin ’s aggression make it almost inevitable where he seek to make we weak he have achieve the opposite we be strong than ever with these new ally by our side 
 secondly we act to increase our support for ukraine let we never forget what ukraine be go through over day of war ukrainians have experience untold suffering the like of which no nato country have suffer since its inception i know the whole house will join i in pay tribute to the ukrainian people and to their incredible spirit and fortitude they be still stand strong and defiant and the counter offensive be make progress in the last few week they have take back more ground than russia have take in the last year we be stand with they and ally be double down in their support 
 this be not just about nato at the munich security conference in february i call for long term security arrangement to protect ukraine re establish deterrence in europe and break the cycle of russian violence and now ally have deliver yesterday the g7 leader come together to sign the joint declaration of support for ukraine agree to provide the long term bilateral security commitment that ukraine need and deserve those commitment mark a new high point in international support for ukraine and more ally will be sign up to add their support but let i be clear that be not a substitute for nato membership 
 we take a big step in vilnius towards bring ukraine into the alliance the summit communiqué echo the uk ’s long hold position that 
 ukraine ’s future be in nato 
 of course there be more work to be do but we have shorten ukraine ’s path to membership remove the need for a membership action plan and hold the meeting of the nato ukraine council with president zelensky sit at the table by our side as an equal as president zelensky say the summit be 
 a very much needed and meaningful success for ukraine 
 thirdly we show in vilnius that the uk remain a drive force behind this alliance as i have tell the house before those who run down this country and its place on the world stage could not be more wrong in my bilateral meeting and the wide nato session i be strike again and again by how value our contribution be the british people should know that and they should be proud the united kingdom be and will remain of the world ’s lead defence power we be the lead european contributor to nato we be of the to hit the target for defence spending and we be go far early this year i announce a significant uplift of an extra £ over the next year immediately increase our defence budget to around of gdp on our way to deliver our new ambition of and ensure that our incredible armed force can continue to keep we safe 
 right now raf jet be patrol nato ’s eastern flank our troop be on the ground in estonia and poland as part of nato ’s enhance forward presence and the royal navy be patrol the sea provide a quarter of the alliance ’s maritime capability we be of the only country that contribute to every nato mission and we will keep play our part as a lead nation in the joint expeditionary force we be build deep partnership such as aukus and the global combat air programme we be use our leadership in technology to keep nato at the cutting edge host the european headquarters of the defence innovation accelerator and hold the global summit on artificial intelligence safety in the uk later this year we be also lead the debate on tackle emerge security threat include the migration crisis i have call on nato to play a strong support role here help southern ally to build their capability 
 that leadership in defence and security be match by our diplomacy strengthen our relationship around the world in just the last few month we have conclude negotiation on the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and have sign critical mineral partnership with canada and australia a semiconductor partnership with japan and the atlantic declaration with the united states a new kind of economic partnership in a more contested world 
 there be no well example of our ability to bring all those element together and lead on the world stage than our response to russia ’s invasion of ukraine our diplomat have lead the unprecedented effort to co ordinate sanction against russia ’s economy last month we host the ukraine recovery conference raise over $ to help rebuild ukraine ’s economy and bring in the private sector to help unlock its economic potential 
 as the house know we have back ukraine ’s fight for its freedom and sovereignty since the start we be the country in the world to train ukrainian troop the in europe to provide lethal weapon the to commit tank and the to provide long range missile   now we be at the forefront of the coalition to equip the ukrainian air force with ukrainian pilot start their training here in just a few week time 
 we do all of this because it be right because it protect our value and our interest because it keep our people and our ally safe and because quite simply it be who we be as a country we be there at the start of the nato alliance and this week we have show once again that we remain at its heart lead it into the future i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for an advance copy of his statement 
 it be over day since putin ’s barbaric war in ukraine begin putin believe the west be too divide to act in our common interest and too corrupted to stand up for what be right he be wrong nato nation continue to stand united unite in our collective support for president zelensky and unite in our belief that victory will come to the ukrainian people and so too across this house we remain steadfast and determine to show that whatever our difference we will stand up to putin ’s aggression and we stand ready to pursue he for his crime 
 labour ’s commitment to nato be unshakeable it be an achievement of this party and a cornerstone of british security for year i therefore welcome the progress make in vilnius this week in particular the commitment to strengthen the collective defence of this continent regional plan great intelligence co operation and improved readiness this will put we all on a well footing to react quickly to modern threat the new defence production action plan will help we build a robust and resilient defence sector not only to develop the munition and hardware need to support ukraine ’s war effort but to strengthen our own defence capability 
 i also welcome the announcement that g7 member will provide wide range and long term security commitment with ukraine this be a crucial signal to putin and those who back he that our support for ukraine will not waver we must continue to show that his illegal invasion will end in defeat and that it will only make nato a strong alliance that be why this house should celebrate the historic decision by nato nation to welcome sweden into the alliance sweden will be a strong addition to nato and its membership along with the recent accession of finland show once again that rather than divide and weaken europe putin ’s war have only strengthen our collective resolve nato have never be strong 
 i understand the decision by leader not to set a timetable for ukraine ’s membership of nato but i also support the clear declaration that ukraine ’s future lie within the alliance our military assistance for ukraine have labour ’s total backing but so too do ukraine ’s long term aim to join nato it fight on the frontline of european freedom so it be important that we be clear to the people of ukraine who fight so bravely for their future that the question be not if ukraine join nato but when ukraine join nato 
 finally it be important we be clear that even if there be a change of government in the uk there will never be a change in britain ’s resolve no change in our   support for ukraine and no change in our commitment to the security of britain and our ally at moment like this this house tend to acknowledge this unity and understand that our word carry weight beyond these shore we choose they wisely so i would ask the prime minister when he rise whether he be prepared to correct the record in this house in relation to a social media statement he make last night that labour do not want he to attend the summit this week on the contrary we be delighted that he be there because in an ever more dangerous world we must be unite and nato must be co ordinated ready to adapt and ready to strengthen the decision take this week give we a platform to do that and deliver a plan that can protect our collective security and support our friend in need however difficult that may prove to be we must stay the course and make sure putin ’s brutal ambition end in his total defeat 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman although it be a bit rich to attack i for miss prime minister ’s question time and then say that he want i to attend the nato summit interruption 
 order please i want to hear the prime minister 
 i think the point have be make i also welcome the right hon and learn gentleman ’s new find affection for the nato alliance have sit for long year next to someone who want to interruption 
 order i want to hear the prime minister those who do not can please leave now 
 mr speaker you can tell from the volume of noise that they do not like it but it be the truth interruption 
 order it be the same for those on the government benches i want to hear the prime minister and i do not want those on the government side stop i either 
 the reality be this for long year the right hon and learn gentleman sit there next to someone who do not support nato and want to scrap trident and abolish our armed force that be what the record be but i be pleased that the right hon and learn gentleman join the government in support effort for ukraine it be important that that remain a united position across this house interruption 
 order   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   be step in for the chief whip that do not mean that he can carry on shout like he do when at this end of the chamber 
 briefly with regard to nato membership it be important that president zelensky ’s word be listen to he say that he view the nato summit as provide a meaningful success for ukraine for his country and its people because significant progress be make on the path towards nato membership it be a question of when not if and as the secretary general say what be a step process have now become a   step process with more political support and momentum behind ukraine ’s membership than at any time in nato ’s history that be something that president zelensky understand and appreciate and over the course of the day it be crystal clear that there be an incredibly strong feeling among all alliance member to support ukraine on that journey as quickly as practically possible 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement i return from ukraine in the last few day where i be quite close to the frontline work with a charity the thing that i must tell the prime minister be that the people of ukraine be enormously grateful for the leadership that he and the uk have show within nato they never stop tell we how much they welcome the uk ’s leadership in this matter 
 while i be there the ukrainians be very clear that in their assault their big problem be that they be lose many man try to clear the minefield they do not have the right equipment in fact at night they go forward with bayonet try to get to the mine it be shocking to see i urge the prime minister if at all possible to make it a priority to talk to the us government and try to get they to release the right equipment that would allow the ukrainians to make those assault in the right way not lose so many life 
 i thank my right hon friend for all his commitment and indeed for his personal visit to ukraine to see at hand what be happen and how good we can tailor our support he be right about the mine that have be leave by the russian army it be a considerable effort to have they clear i want to reassure he that we be in close communication with the ukrainian military about exactly what capability and equipment it need to clear minefield and support its armed force as they make progress we will continue to have that conversation and work with ally to get it all the kit it need 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 thank you mr speaker and i associate myself with the prime minister and the leader of the opposition ’s strong support for ukraine slava ukraini 
 this government ’s defence command paper will be publish next week i believe give event in ukraine what lesson have the ministry of defence learn about modern urban warfare and how will that feed into operational strategy i recall the former prime minister say at the liaison committee just before the war 
 we have to recognise that the old concept of fight big tank battle on the european landmass be over 
 he then proceed to cut our tank number how wrong he be be the department consider future opportunity for defence co operation with the eu that be complementary to nato 
 there be less than a week leave until the expiration of the deal allow ukrainian grain export via the black sea this be very important so i hope the prime minister be listen can he speak to the discussion that be have at the summit to ensure the continuation of the   current deal which be vital for ukraine ’s remain economy and for global food security what step have the department take and what step will it take to improve the uk ’s military partnership with finland in the period since it join nato and be there plan to do the same with sweden 
 give recent report of russian spy on and sabotage of energy infrastructure in the north sea and the fact that the uk ’s undersea cable be worth £ a day to the economy what will the uk be contribute to nato ’s establishment of its critical undersea infrastructure co ordination cell and will it be base in scotland my hon friend and leader   the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn   raise with the prime minister previously that some nation be continue to use product from russian oil do he pursue that far be it his impression there be genuine unity on propose reconstruction effort in ukraine 
 finally how do the prime minister hope to contribute to diplomatic effort to bring on board part of the international community increasingly include the republican right in america to support what nato be do to ensure ukraine ’s survival 
 on nato co operation with the eu i agree wholeheartedly with the secretary general who set very clear condition for support eu defence initiative that they be coherent with nato requirement secondly that they develop capability that be available to nato and lastly that they be open to the full participation of non eu nato ally that have be the establish position and it be we fully support 
 the hon member ask about the black sea grain initiative which be due to expire on   july i commend president erdoğan ’s leadership on this issue in particular over the last year i speak to he at the conference last week on this and he be work to engage with the russians on extend the grain deal as be other ally it be important that the grain deal be extend because as we know around third of the grain leave ukraine be destine for low and middle income country and we do not want russia to inflict any more suffering than it already be 
 the hon member also ask about undersea cable and undersea infrastructure i agree with she that that require attention and focus which be why the ministry of defence and the department for science innovation and technology be work collaboratively together with industry to make sure that everyone be do their part to protect what be critical infrastructure the mod be develop particular capability to monitor and protect that infrastructure and it be something that we have put on the agenda through the joint expeditionary force which obviously comprise the northern european nation we be host in fact as i think she allude to a potential headquarters for more focus on that area and i look forward to discuss that with my jef ally towards the end of this year 
 lastly on galvanise international support for ukraine that be something i do when i be at these international summit particularly when i be last in the us of the thing i do be spend half a day in congress talk to congressional leader from both party to illustrate to they the importance of provide support to ukraine not just now but for year into the future i be delighted   that the us have play a lead role in the multilateral security guarantee and it be important that it do so however as we be see we be broaden the coalition of support for ukraine and be at these international summit and talk to world leader show that the uk be lead by example and lead from the front i be very pleased that france have just announce that it will also now be provide long range weapon to ukraine follow the uk ’s lead and make an enormous difference to ukraine ’s counter offensive 
 on britain ’s contribution have our excellent defence secretary not effectively foresee the russian invasion and provide thousand of nlaw next generation light anti tank weapon to the ukrainians with the appropriate training to blunt the assault russian general would be have lunch in kyiv today the british army relative to its size have make a large contribution of critical equipment the key organ as it be than any other army in nato include the united states we can be immensely proud of that but those organ need to be grow back for our own security and to maintain our contribution to nato will the prime minister do everything he can across whitehall to promote the requisite sense of urgency to regrow those organ and critically to provide the resource to do it 
 i agree wholeheartedly with my right hon friend that this house and the entire country can and should be proud of the leadership we have show on ukraine he be right that we need to rebuild the stockpile we have provide that be why in the budget £ extra funding be provide for the armed force with a large chunk of that go particularly to rebuild those organ and those stockpile come on top of the half a that be provide in the autumn statement just this week for example we announce a new contract with bae to provide critical mm round which as he will be familiar with be absolutely mission critical because we now have the funding to provide long term contract we can increase defence production that be good for our security it be good for the security of our ally and crucially it also create job particularly in the north of england 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s update and our support for ukraine and i strongly agree that we need to encourage our nato ally to meet their commitment in full how be he encourage that goal when he be oversee a cut to the british army of troop be not of the key lesson from russia ’s attack on ukraine that a sizeable stand army remain crucial to the defence and security of our country and nato ally and will he listen to voice across this house call for a reversal to cut in army number 
 the right hon gentleman talk about defence spending and it be clear that not only have we meet the target but we be of the to do so and we have do so for over a decade it be good that other be now catch up and our leadership on this issue be unquestionable how that money be spend be ultimately a question for our military chief to ensure that we have the optimal mix of capability to protect ourselves against the threat we face i will not   pre empt the defence command paper other than to say that when it come to our armed force what be important be not just the quantum in term of the army but how lethal they be how deployable and how agile that have be a particular focus of attention from the chief of the general staff and it be a plan that we be put in place i would maybe draw slightly different lesson from the right hon gentleman ’s on the conflict that ukraine be currently experience the capability that we have bring to bear have be in a range of area all of which have receive extra investment again those will be question for the defence command paper which he will not have to wait very long to see 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and congratulate he on contribute to what i think history will prove to have be of the most significant summit in nato ’s history will he clarify what he understand be the intention with regard to ukraine ’s membership of nato what would be the purpose of delay ukraine ’s membership beyond the end of hostility in ukraine and the victory for the ukrainians without the article security guarantee rebuild ukraine will be much more difficult because investor will not have confidence unless we be provide that security guarantee 
 i thank my hon friend for his question in the interest of time i might point he in the direction of the secretary general ’s press conference from the day before yesterday which explain in more detail than i have time for now the process and how this have be do previously as he point out accession to nato have never be a question of timing it have always be a question of condition and circumstance my hon friend will be familiar with the fact that there be an ongoing conflict there be also requirement on all nato member when it come to area such as modernisation governance and interoperability which ukraine be now firmly on the path towards fulfil not least because of the help and support that we have provide over the past year 
 i agree with my hon friend that history will judge this to be of the most significant nato summit there be the significant change in the defence investment pledge so be now firmly establish as a floor not a ceiling there be the most comprehensive update to nato ’s war fight plan in decade if not since the end of the cold war and they be remarkable in their breadth and significance there be the accession of new member finland and sweden to follow lastly there be the move on membership for ukraine take together that represent a significant set of nato achievement sit alongside the multilateral security guarantee as my hon friend say it have be an historic and very important couple of day 
 i hope that in his reply the prime minister will help clarify that it be we who owe gratitude to ukraine not the other way round will he update the house on plan not simply to help ukraine win the war but to win the peace the reconstruction of ukraine will cost at least $ and russia should be help to foot the bill that mean we need new law to seize not simply freeze asset it mean we need action at the united nations to change the norm around immunity of central bank crucially   it mean we need to start prosecute russia for the crime of aggression that will require we to mobilise not simply a military nato but an economic nato will the prime minister update we on the conversation that he have have to make that a reality 
 as the right hon gentleman know we have recently host the ukraine recovery conference for which the ukrainian government and people be extremely grateful it be the most successful conference of its ilk that have happen raise more than $ for ukraine ’s reconstruction and mobilise private sector capital as be necessary it be see as a significant achievement and the uk lead from the front with regard to asset i point he to a good couple of paragraph in the nato communiqué all ally be take step as be we to legally freeze asset until suitable reparation from russia have be put in place for reconstruction he will understand that the international framework for do so be untested and novel it require co operation among ally and that co operation and work be happen 
 far to the question from   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne i welcome the uk ’s strong leadership at the nato summit and thank the prime minister for it the unity the resource and the new member send a powerful message there be no timetable for ukraine join nato but its membership be only a matter of time when that time come the extent of reconstruction and the investment need will be vast a lot of russian asset be hold here and be frozen can the prime minister elaborate even far on the conversation he have at the summit on how the uk will again play a leadership role in unlock resource from those russian asset to help with the reconstruction of ukraine 
 we have recently publish new legislation that will enable sanction on russia to be maintain until moscow pay compensation to ukraine i can assure my hon friend that we will pursue all lawful route to ensure that russian asset be make available in support of ukraine ’s reconstruction in line with international law our international partner be like the uk yet to fully test the lawfulness of a new asset seizure regime but that be exactly the work we be do with ally particularly across the g7 to share expertise and experience 
 in ukraine give up its nuclear weapon in return for guarantee about its security and territorial integrity give what have happen since we all understand why president zelensky be so keen to join the alliance do the prime minister agree that when and however the current war end nato membership at that point will need to form the cornerstone of new security guarantee that the people of ukraine can rely on 
 i think the people of ukraine receive a very strong signal of support from the nato alliance over the past couple of day that be what president zelensky believe and it be what he be take back to his country he call it a significant security   victory the signature of the multilateral agreement on security guarantee by the g7 represent near term immediate support for ukraine ’s security from the g7 ally i be highly confident that other will join that declaration too give the ukrainian people some assurance and security which they rightly deserve 
 i commend the prime minister for his lead role at the nato summit and i very much support his statement in the statement he say 
 all ally make an endure commitment to invest at least of gdp 
 many country have be make that promise for many year and never actually fulfil it they want the protection of nato but be not pay their fair share towards it and be instead rely on the uk taxpayer and more importantly the us taxpayer to foot the bill what more can be do to ensure that every country in nato if they want the protection of nato pay its fair share 
 my hon friend make an excellent point and i agree wholeheartedly it be why we fight hard for the new defence investment pledge to set as an endure commitment and as a floor not a ceiling progress have be make if he look at the statistic over the past couple of year in particular he will see an increase not just in the volume of defence spending across the alliance but in the number of country that be meet that be forecast to be potentially as high as third of all member next year which would represent a landmark achievement he be right that we must keep the pressure on and urge everyone to fulfil their commitment 
 the prime minister know that uk stockpile be be deplete due to the war in ukraine and for we to rightly sustain our support at the right level the government should be fully address our diminished defence industrial base and skill shortage our nato ally be swift to reboot their defence plan yet he have consistently delay the defence command paper why be that 
 the hon member talk about what other ally be do but again that be not the conversation that i have be have for the past couple of day other ally look up to the uk and to the example that we have set we be the one increase defence spending particularly to rebuild stockpile as i mention there be £ of investment at the budget come on top of half a pound at the autumn statement a new contract be announce just this week which be create job across the country but particularly in the north that be the right thing to do and that be what we will continue to deliver 
 what conclusion have the prime minister draw about the increase vulnerability of ukraine since it give up its nuclear weapon and the contribution that our nuclear weapon make to our own security 
 our nuclear deterrent be the ultimate guarantee of our security that be why it be so important for the uk and an important part of the   contribution that we bring to nato we be of the few country that offer nato not just nuclear capability but carrier strike generation combat air and lead maritime across the board as well as cyber offensive that be why we be respect in nato and why we be a valuable member of the alliance 
 this week i be at the forum of the nato summit in vilnius alongside my right hon friend   the member for north durham mr jones who be vice president of the nato parliamentary assembly i hope that the prime minister will join i in pay tribute to lithuania not only for its political leadership but for have be such excellent host and organise such an historic summit but the mood in vilnius be not quite how the prime minister have present it representative of ukraine ’s parliament and civil society have a clear and sobering message that as the war go on for long ukraine be lose brave fighter on the frontline that be why it be so important that we get the weapon that ukraine need to win into the hand of those brave soldier now what be the practical outcome of what be agree that will ensure that those resource be on the frontline so that ukraine can win soon rather   than later 
 i would say to the hon lady that that be exactly what we have be do for the past year and the ukrainian government and people be extremely grateful for our leadership on that issue but i join she in pay tribute to lithuania not just for host the summit excellently but for demonstrate so clearly why our collective security be so important give lithuania ’s geographic position and the threat it face particularly from belarus it be important that the nato summit be hold there it send a strong signal of our unity in support the eastern flank of the nato alliance which i think be incredibly important
