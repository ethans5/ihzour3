 there be certain thing that the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for leicester west liz kendall and i can agree on and smoking be of they i be interested to learn that she be a former smoker they always say that former smoker have a passionate desire to stop other people smoke and she certainly demonstrate that we know that in cancer be cause by smoking as a father of young daughter vaping be of great concern to i personally and i be pleased to see the reference in the king ’s speech to get on top of those kind of product and the way in which they be retail

 the house will be aware that the prime minister have today appoint the right hon david cameron as secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs this be not the time in recent year that a cabinet minister have be appoint in the house of lords but give the gravity of the current international situation it be especially important that this house be able to scrutinise the work of the foreign commonwealth and development office effectively 
 i have therefore commission advice from the clerks about possible option for enhance scrutiny of the work of the foreign secretary when that post be fill by a member of the other house i also look forward to hear the government ’s proposal on how the foreign secretary will be properly accountable to this house i do not propose to respond to point of order on this subject today until the advice i have refer to have be receive and until i have hear the government ’s own proposal but i can assure the house that i be fully aware of the need for hon and right hon member to be able to hold the government to account in this area especially at the current time and i shall do everything i can to ensure that they be able to do so

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to help improve workplace support for woman experience the menopause 
 we take the challenge of the menopause very seriously which be why the government appoint helen tomlinson as the menopause employment champion for england in term of progress i point my hon friend to the report no time to step back 
 i welcome the work by campaigner and devon ’s nhs to improve access to menopause service in devon almost of menopausal woman be in work yet all too often support can be lack what step be my right hon friend take to raise menopause awareness among employer 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his extensive work as my constituency neighbour push for proper support in all gp practice across the county we lead by example of the department ’s staff be female and we have a menopause and workplace policy which see menopause ambassador across our dwp network 
 almost woman in the uk have quit their job due to the menopause the right to flexible work be a key part of tackle economic inactivity and it would particularly benefit people manage menopause symptom what conversation have take place between cabinet colleague on remove the onus on employee to request flexible working and instead ensure that that be provide as a day right by default 
 the hon lady ’s question be well direct to the department for business and trade rather than dwp as it relate to employment legislation and regulation however i be pleased to tell she that we have our 50plus champion work coach in our jobcentre the midlife mot and many other measure that be there to help exactly the people she describe 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of ai on the functioning of the welfare system 
 we have a number of project that use artificial intelligence within the department to drive performance efficiency and the service we provide to our customer important point to bear in mind be that we never replace a human when it come to judgment relate to a claim or an appeal 
 will my right hon friend tell the house what assessment he have make of the potential merit of the use of ai in fraud protection how will his department ensure that appropriate safety measure be in place 
 let i take the of my hon friend ’s point as i have outline there be always human intervention when it be appropriate none the less he be quite right to raise the issue of fraud and error we have see a reduction in the department over the past year of some across the benefit system and much of that have be drive by machine learning and datum analytic 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of child experience destitution 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of child experience destitution 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of child experience destitution 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of child experience destitution 
 what step his department be take to reduce the number of child experience destitution 
 child poverty and its reduction be absolutely core to the mission of my department which be why we have focus on cost of living payment why we have put up benefit across the board by and why the chancellor announce £ in the spring statement to support our back to work programme to raise people out of poverty 
 of the crown achievement of the previous labour government be to lift child out of poverty how do the secretary of state think that that compare with the conservatives record give that new figure show that child be experience destitution and that that have actually triple since 
 i think that our record be extremely clear since we have few people in absolute poverty few child in absolute poverty and few pensioner in absolute poverty under labour ’s watch we have people park on long term sickness benefit for more than year 
 there have be a shameful increase in the level of destitution in the uk with child not have their basic need meet in my constituency of blaydon child in every classroom be live in poverty across the north east there have be a increase in emergency food bank parcel in the past year do the minister agree that his government have completely fail the most vulnerable child in the uk 
 no i be afraid that i can not agree with that at all i have just go through the various figure point to the decline in the level of absolute poverty include few child in absolute poverty since the hon lady ’s party be last in government the cost of living payment the increase in the level of benefit and the £ that the chancellor have make available to help people back into work be help to drive poverty figure in the right direction 
 the minister ’s response be disappointing if the government do not recognise the problem of child poverty in this country how will they fix it child experience destitution in the uk last year organisation such as chantelle ’s community kitchen little village and wandsworth foodbank in my constituency work tirelessly to fill in the gap but they say that there be increase hardship and they be worried about the winter ahead what impact do the minister think that crash the economy and unleash a cost of living crisis have have on child poverty 
 the common theme in all the question that we have have on this substantive question be a lack of memory as to what happen under the previous labour government under that government we have more workless household and more child in those workless household 
 in the past month the trussell trust have issue emergency food parcel for child in my constituency in some school that i visit teacher bring food from their home to feed hungry kid will the minister step up and take responsibility for this or instead move out of the way for a labour government commit to make child poverty a thing of the past 
 heaven forbid that we do have another labour government mr speaker because i have just set out the case against the last and their appalling record on poverty when it come to cost of living payment those go to low income household and to people with disability there will be further payment of £ for pensioner alongside the winter fuel payment in the come month 
 i wish to draw your attention mr speaker to a very distressing case in my slough constituency a single mother a victim of domestic violence be struggle to pay her rent and meet basic need due to cut in her universal credit after be compel to find part time work her live condition include mould in her home be very badly affect the health of her child will the secretary of state explain how current policy be help to support such vulnerable family and what immediate measure will he put in place to ensure that we do not have such dire situation of destitution 
 i can not comment on the specific case that the hon gentleman have put forward other than to say that what he have describe be of concern to i and i will want we to look into that extremely carefully i will be happy to make sure that he have the appropriate time with the appropriate minister i think the minister for employment to look into those matter 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in a christmas carol publish year ago charles dickens write of a world where child lack shelter clothing heating and food they be represent by a boy call ignorance and a girl call want dickens die in and we live in the large economy in the world so why in accord to the joseph rowntree foundation do child experience the type of destitution he chronicle long ago we have hear the minister quote figure and programme and launch attack on previous government but simply as a human would he not agree that just child live in destitution be child too many 
 i completely agree with the hon gentleman that child in destitution be too many person in poverty be too many person who be unemployed and badly want a job to support their family be too many the question we have to ask be how good to go about improve those situation i say it be through encourage people into work and through those cost of live transfer payment for those target through universal credit which his party originally oppose so that we can help those who be most vulnerable and most in need 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the cost of living crisis be plunge many family into destitution we know from the jrf that household and child be plunge into destitution last year will secretary of state use the upcoming autumn statement to bring forward the mortgage interest tax relief and action to tackle soar food price and to reintroduce that £ energy bill rebate otherwise more and more child will fall into destitution he have the power will he respond at the autumn statement 
 the hon gentleman raise mortgage payment in particular we have extend the scope of the support for mortgage interest arrangement particularly for those who have not long be on universal credit i can not comment on what may or may not be in the autumn statement but i can assure he that the kind of issue he have raise be always at the centre of our thinking 
 if he will undertake a review of the personal independence payment assessment process for people with multiple sclerosis 
 the department closely monitor all aspect of the assessment process include how we assess fluctuate health condition such as multiple sclerosis follow the publication of the recent white paper we be look at way to far enhance the delivery of personal independence payment to all disabled people 
 orkney have the high prevalence of multiple sclerosis anywhere in the world so we have see the problem   cause by pip assessment that do not cope properly with fluctuating condition we now have the adult disability payment in scotland but that still use some of the same eligibility criterion as the minister carry out the review will he speak to scottish ministers to make sure that we have a system that work for every ms sufferer wherever they be in the united kingdom 
 it be fair to say that i have a collaborative and strong working relationship with ministers in the scottish government and i would definitely be keen to talk they about the test and trial that we be introduce which i hope will help to well capture fluctuating condition and help people to provide all of the right evidence as early as possible in the claim journey so that we get people ’s award right and make the right decision we should certainly look to work uk wide where we can 
 learn the lesson of our change to special rule for the terminally ill and the principle of the severe condition criterion should allow we to look at those who sadly have degenerative condition such as ms and motor neurone disease will the minister confirm that as part of the testing and piloting the department be look at the potential for automatic entitlement for those with degenerative condition which would lift around a quarter of a people a year out of unnecessary assessment 
 my hon friend have be a strong advocate for the severe disability group work that we have be take forward i be pleased to be able to say that blackpool teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust and the british society of physical and rehabilitation medicine have agree to work in partnership with the dwp to test the sdg reduce the assessment burden where it be inappropriate and ensure that people get the right support and help be the right thing to do 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the hospitality sector base work academy programme in cities of london and westminster constituency 
 we be work with uk hospitality and local provider up and down the country from liverpool to manchester to coventry in london of course and also to come in wales to ensure that we have a hospitality work programme that provide employment training work experience and a guarantee job interview it be free for all dwp jobseeker it be early day but the sign be promise 
 may i thank the minister for employment for join i this morning at ben venuti a brilliant café and deli in pimlico to celebrate hospitality in cities of london and westminster i be delighted that the hospitality swap pilot have be launch in my constituency where we have thousand and thousand of hospitality job of the business involve in the pilot be the raffles london hotel just up the road at the old war office which i visit with uk hospitality   recently what further step be the department take to ensure that the scheme benefit minority and those struggle the most with the cost of living crisis 
 it be a tough ministerial visit to an award win coffee shop this morning somehow i miss the early hotel visit i can assure my hon friend that we be drive forward that hospitality pilot to try to tackle the recruitment issue in that vital sector which permeate all across the united kingdom she will be keen to know that every person who pass get a hospitality skill passport which we believe can genuinely make a difference across all age group and all section of the community 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of work capability assessment for people with neurological condition 
 may i start by welcome the hon gentleman to his place in this house the work capability assessment be a functional assessment base on how a person ’s condition affect they not on the condition itself work capability assessor have train across a range of health condition include neurological condition and can access a range of resource that have be quality assure by relevant external clinician 
 my entry in the register of members financial interests have not be publish yet but i be a trustee of an epilepsy charity i thank the minister for his welcome and for that answer but for people with neurological condition particularly multiple sclerosis and epilepsy the condition be not uniform week they might be affect in way and the next week in a different way so the capability assessment have to match that so that they meet people ’s capability as they be the publish consultation on reform the assessment be still cause a lot of concern for people with those condition so what more can the minister do to make it a holistic process that recognise people ’s need as they be 
 i be not in a position to set out the outcome of recent work capability assessment consultation but a key principle underpin the test and trial that i touch on early be to take well account of fluctuate condition help people to provide high quality evidence as early as possible in the claim journey we be spend a lot of time work with stakeholder to develop that work and i would be very willing to have a conversation with the hon gentleman about that 
 what step his department be take to support people in essex into employment 
 employment in essex be up on figure and well than in full credit go to the essex jobcentre   staff who work across the county with local skill provider be provide real opportunity for local man and woman they hold a plus event in witham recently for example and my right hon friend will be aware that there be a job fair in maldon on wednesday just down the road from her constituency 
 my hon friend be well aware of the fact that essex be a powerhouse when it come to employment job creation and economic growth that say many business be still frustrated because they find recruitment and training difficult we have the autumn statement come up but will he touch on some of the cross departmental discussion he have be have to look at how we can support business by lower taxis get rid of regulation and red tape and help they to employ more people and grow the economy 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for her question and for her robust championing of conservative value and support for business and job in her constituency and across essex we at the dwp be work across government to ensure that we consider different way of support job investment childcare support higher pay skill and pathway into work the view of my right hon friend be strongly put and i be quite sure that treasury ministers and the chancellor will have take due notice 
 what step his department be take to reduce youth unemployment 
 the level of youth unemployment be down by since and this government remain committed to deliver target support to young people through our expand dwp youth offer provide comprehensive employment support for to year old claim universal credit that offer include intensive support through the youth employment programme youth employability coach and youth hub across great britain 
 i visit business on a weekly basis and thing they tell i in ashfield be that they struggle to recruit apprentice of the barrier be the requirement for english and math because a lot of these young people would make great apprentice but they either mess about at school or have not have that support what more can we do to get those young people into apprenticeship and then support they with their math and english at a later stage 
 we fund apprentice to achieve english and math qualification by the end of their apprenticeship we understand how important they be for people ’s long term career prospect and we be boost the rate for those qualification by from january we be also pilot flexible english and math requirement for young people with learn difficulty or disability to ensure that they be not overlook when it come to apprenticeship opportunities.[official report   november vol c. 7mc 
 economic inactivity due to ill health have more than double for to year old over the past decade why do the minister think that be could she also please look again at the closure of the local jobcentre in halton lea in my constituency because of build safety issue 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i will happily take away his point have a look at it and get back to he in writing i want to assure he and the house that have dwp youth hub together in location help those young people who have be go through very difficult time because of covid they help local youth expert and local partnership to come together and overcome those barrier and ensure that young people have the skill and confidence seek by local employer to take up the opportunity that be around they just down the road it be really important that we be there to support they through those mixed youth hub which be a big focus for i and for our department 
 anglo american and its contractor have just announce new job opportunity at its woodsmith mine just outside whitby with workshop both in whitby and on teesside for those interested do the minister agree that these sort of opportunity in the mining industry be just the sort of opportunity that young people need to grasp with both hand 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question which go back to the point about know what job be just down the road for young people so that the labour market come close to home for they that be what our youth employability work coach do and we see that with the kickstart programme job be create by employer who want young people in their business their feedback show that they absolutely get something from have young people in their business and i appeal to employer to keep do what be happen in whitby 
 but the number of young people unemployed in denton and reddish be still far too high the late figure show a youth unemployment claimant count which be not good enough give that the share of young people not in full time employment or education rise last year what more be the minister do to make sure that young people in place such as denton and reddish get the life chance they deserve 
 i absolutely agree that in the hon gentleman ’s constituency and more widely it be absolutely right that young people get the opportunity they deserve in fact since september the dwp ’s youth offer have see over start as i mention early our comprehensive support for young people now encompass those from age 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister begin answer these question by claim credit for have well youth unemployment figure now than in the aftermath of a global financial crisis which seem   to i to be a low ambition as she have hear we have problem with inactivity and we have more young people who be not do anything what account can she give for the fact that even after and a half long year of conservative government we have bad youth unemployment than ireland norway and the czech republic and that here it be double what it be in germany and treble what it be in japan what on earth have go wrong 
 i think that be a reminder to continually speak up for opportunity for our young people the current youth employment rate be up percentage point since it have be my absolute mission in this parliament over the last and a half year to focus on young people with around new youth hub to support the complex need of young people i humbly suggest that the hon member go and look at the change that be happen to see the difference be make in community up and down the land we be not write young people off we be make sure that we support they i go to see a new youth hub only last week and the work be do on housing and with partner be innovative it mean young people with smile on their face and their future in their hand 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of benefit level in the context of rise in the cost of living 
 the government have never spend more on welfare and benefit support than we presently do from april we uprate benefit by and increase the benefit cap level by the same amount that be on top of the cost of live support that have be make to multiple household and individual to address the rise cost of bill 
 i thank the minister for that answer but he will be aware that the trussell trust have warn that food bank be at breaking point as more and more people across the uk be unable to afford the essential with new figure show that emergency food parcel be distribute through the charity ’s network between april and september this year will the minister therefore back its joint campaign with the joseph rowntree foundation call for an essential guarantee within universal credit to ensure that the basic rate at least cover life ’s essential and that support can never fall below that level 
 the hon member will be aware that there have be £ of cost of live support over and above the increase in benefit rate that support be over and for example the winter fuel payment will be pay to the tune of £ or £ over the next few week 
 would the minister agree that the journey we have be on with benefit rate for the last decade and a half have perhaps be a little haphazard and it be pretty unclear to most people   exactly what basket of good and service benefit be actually mean to buy if the minister do not agree with the case for an essential guarantee will the government commission their own study to work out if benefit be at the right level 
 my hon friend make an interesting point which be clearly a matter for the secretary of state and the chancellor when they make their decision on uprating and i be sure they will take that on board there be always ongoing discussion about how assess this process but with respect this be the system we have have for some considerable period of time 
 what recent step his department have take to help disabled people to find and remain in employment 
 there be a range of initiative for support disabled people to start stay in and succeed in work this include disability employment adviser the work and health programme intensive personalise employment support access to work disability confident the information and advice service and support in partnership with the health system 
 research by the charity versus arthritis have find that in people describe as economically inactive have a musculoskeletal msk condition arthritis and msk condition be the cause of over working day lose in alone will the minister ask the chancellor for additional support in the autumn statement to help people with arthritis and msk to find and remain in work and will he meet i and versus arthritis to discuss this serious issue far 
 i be always happy to meet colleague to discuss such issue it be fair to say that the chancellor of the exchequer have put a real emphasis on this policy area in his previous spending announcement no doubt he will have hear the hon lady ’s comment in advance of the upcoming autumn statement when we consider initiative such as work well our work in respect of occupational health and the consultation on that we see that a lot of effort and energy have go into recognise that retention be just as important as job start 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in his conference speech the secretary of state say there would be a revolution in employment support for people with health condition and disability do this revolution include a backlog of people wait for an access to work decision with an average delay of day minister need to get a grip of support for disabled people rather than vilify they the government ’s lack of real action often prevent disabled people from work labour have a plan for delivery so instead of endless reshuffle why do the minister not ask his boss to call a general election now 
 i think i will pass up on the invitation at the end of the hon lady ’s question the fact be that this government be concentrate on work hard to support more disabled people into work we be unlock that potential with all the help and support around it the hon lady specifically mention access to work we now have more than full time staff member work on that compare with in march we be focus on prioritise job start and streamline thing to make it easy for claim to be process and for people to get support quick as well as that staffing increase we have a comprehensive plan the hon lady ’s plan be hide somewhere i be sure we would all love to hear it 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of government support for pensioner in the context of rise in the cost of living 
 the pensions minister be unavoidably detain in no so they have wheel out the old pensions minister to attempt to address the hon gentleman ’s question the reality of the situation be that april see the big ever rise in the state pension by thank to the triple lock every pensioner be entitle to a winter fuel payment and will receive a cost of live payment this winter the poor pensioner will receive a £ further cost of live payment 
 i thank the minister for his answer but many old people in my falkirk constituency be live below or on the poverty line furthermore old people in the uk live below the poverty line with many more hover precariously above it research by independent age have show that old people be significantly struggle and urgently need additional cost of live support to help they through the come winter by expand the eligibility criterion for the exist cost of live payment to people on housing benefit and those who receive a council tax reduction we could help to support this group of old people who desperately need it will the minister commit to that 
 with no disrespect to the hon gentleman we have commit to that which be why there be the £ further cost of live payment a doubling of the winter fuel payment and the high state pension we have ever have this government be passionately support our pensioner and our most vulnerable on an ongoing basis 
 i call the shadow minister 
 new figure on pension credit update have shed light on the catastrophic failure to get money to the people who desperately need it up to pensioner be now miss out thousand of household would be so much well off and able to keep the heating on and food on the table this winter underpin the figure be a huge drop in uptake among the under-75s with a fall of up to with so many new pensioner   seemingly unaware of their entitlement to pension credit will the government stop bury their head in the sand and get a grip now 
 it be good to welcome the hon lady to the dispatch box i have not previously have the chance to answer her question we have undertake tv campaign internet campaign and campaign on the radio in print and on social medium the great len goodman assist we in that regard before his passing so there be fantastic support across all aspect the hon lady should be aware that pension credit application be up in the year to may and we have never have so many people as we be now seek to encourage to apply absolutely the government be fully behind the pension credit campaign 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential impact of propose reform to work capability assessment on the a financial and b mental wellbeing of people with parkinson ’s disease 
 the department have develop estimate of the number of claimant impact by option consider in the work capability assessment consultation estimate be not base on specific condition because the work capability assessment be base on how a person ’s condition affect they not the condition itself 
 the propose change to the work capability assessment could actually see half a people force to look for work they be not cut out for and then at risk of sanction the propose change on continence mobility and social engagement be put thousand of parkinson ’s sufferer at risk of be deny the benefit they need cause needless stress and financial pressure will the secretary of state meet i and parkinson ’s uk to discuss the impact on those suffering from parkinson ’s hopefully the government will then change their mind on these cruel proposal 
 what i can say to the hon gentleman be that no decision have be make it be right and proper that the consultation response be properly consider in the normal way i would be happy to meet with parkinson ’s uk again i meet it previously and it be an important stakeholder for the department we do think it be right that we look at the work capability assessment and review it periodically not least because of the change we have see in homeworke and flexible working in recent year 
 what step his department be take to support more parent into work 
 there have be transformational change in childcare skill training and support for future employer as announce at the spring budget it be absolutely the case that from   april eligible work parent of year old will be able to access hour of free childcare per week from the term after the birthday plus there will be the delivery of more support for work parent of child over the age of month with free hour of childcare there be nowhere in the world that compare with our childcare offer on an ongoing basis we have virtually scandinavian levels.[official report   november vol c. 8mc 
 i be a huge supporter of the bold action that the government be take to tackle the cost of childcare and get more parent into work however some setting in my constituency report that the rate the government pay do not cover the full cost of provide that place put they in an untenable position can my hon friend work with i alongside the department for education to ensure that the scheme be fully work and that the childcare place be actually there to be able to take up this generous government support 
 i be happy to convene a summit with the department for education my hon friend and his unitary authority to discuss the way in which we be ensure that we be already work in partnership with the dfe to deliver this campaign and clearly the government be commit to ensure that the implementation of the expansion to hour be deal with in an appropriate and seamless way 
 what step his department be take to expand the support available through jobcentre 
 i be on a man mission to support my hon friend who be a doughty champion for don valley and get more people into job in his yorkshire constituency it be a pleasure to visit his constituency recently and meet the jobcentre lead in his patch to understand what we can do to drive forward great employment he will be aware of the £ package of support across the country some of which be be spend in yorkshire 
 i thank member of doncaster and thorne jobcentre for the job fair they have do subsequent to my meeting with the minister at yorkshire wildlife park job fair do a fantastic job do the minister agree that many people in their 50 be busy themselves at home when they could be have a wonderful career like i if he do agree with i what can he do to help they jumpstart into a new career 
 my hon friend will be aware of the plus champion that we have up and down the country the midlife mot be be roll out across the private sector and across jobcentre up and down the country old workers week be come up and there be no doubt that there be success up and down the country of worker beyond retirement age who be do amazing work whether that be the year old shop owner i meet in macclesfield or many of the other i have meet in the past few month these be great people whom we want to support into work on an ongoing basis 
 last week i receive a letter from the minister for social mobility youth and progression   the hon member for mid sussex mims davies say that she intend to close down the jobcentre plus on renfield street which be open on a temporary basis in i know from have meet the staff there that they have do a huge amount of work to get people in through the door and in particular to work with employer and into employment include a programme for ukrainians why do the department want to throw that all away and close it down 
 i think the clue be in the name it be a temporary jobcentre during covid i be happy that the specific minister will write and far explain the situation 
 we now come to topical 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 give that remembrance be still fresh in all our mind i take the opportunity to pay tribute to the armed force champion who work across our jobcentre network look after armed force personnel and their family they do a fantastic job and we should be very proud of they 
 these be financially challenging time but the dwp be up to that challenge hence all the cost of living payment that we have be hear about during question inflation be come down and real wage be begin to move up we continue to take a balanced and fair approach to encourage employment which have result in economic inactivity fall by about since its peak and almost quarter of a since 
 the trussell trust have report a increase in the number of emergency food parcel provide to portsmouth people in just year do the secretary of state agree that more and more people be push into poverty be not a lifestyle choice and that urgent government action be require to tackle the cost of live crisis ahead of another difficult winter for constituent in my patch 
 i certainly agree with the hon gentleman that poverty be not a lifestyle choice we have go through various statistic during question with few people in absolute poverty since few pensioner in poverty since and few child in poverty since we have also go through the cost of living payment the increase to the national living wage and all the other support that the government be provide 
 the good people of kettering would like to know what proportion of working age adult be neither employ nor actively seek employment and what the department be do to reduce that 
 my hon friend be a doughty champion for kettering he will be aware that of working age people be inactive down percentage point from last year and down percentage point from show that our drive to get more people into job be pay off the uk now have a low inactivity rate than the us france and italy we be do more every single day but we be also aware that there be more to do 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the health of our nation be critical to the health of our economy but after year of this government both be in a dire state the secretary of state should know that the number of young people out of work due to long term sickness have double on the government ’s watch predominantly drive by poor mental health labour ’s plan will recruit more mental health staff with support in every school and hub in every community to tackle these problem early on because i be feel generous today mr speaker 
 so be i at the moment laughter 
 i would like to make the secretary of state an offer if he be serious about get britain work why do he not swallow his pride do the right thing and adopt labour ’s back to work plan 
 the reason for that i be feel rather less generous be that we have see labour ’s plan in the past and no labour government have ever leave office with unemployment anything other than high than when they come to office under the last labour government we see people park on long term benefit for over a decade with many of they exactly as the hon lady describe long term sick and disabled under this government we have near record low unemployment and we have more people on payroll employment than we have in 
 i be afraid that the secretary of state be live in cloud cuckoo land record number of people be out of work due to long term sickness we be the only country in the g7 whose employment rate have not go back to pre pandemic level it be not just young people but the over-50s the office for budget responsibility say that the rise pose a serious risk to our prospect for growth and the stability of the public finance where on earth be the secretary of state ’s plan to sort it out perhaps i be be a bit unfair because it turn out that the government can get the over-50 back to work but only if they be former prime ministers 
 order i have be through this time and again when front bencher want to have an argument they need to come in early please and not soak up the time of back benchers whom i now need to get to urgently 
 will the secretary of state have a word with the current occupant of no and ask he to put as much effort into save other people ’s job and livelihood as he do attempt to save his own neck 
 very briefly i have set out our employment record which we be proud of in his last budget the chancellor set aside £ to fund measure to tackle long term sickness and disability that include a consultation on occupational health the roll out of universal support and work well about which the hon lady will hear more presently 
 the proportion of new claimant for incapacity benefit who receive the high amount with no work requirement have go from year ago to now an astonishing increase will the secretary of state reassure i that follow the propose reform to the work capability assessment it will work as intend and that those who want to work and seek work be able to get the help they need to do so 
 i thank my hon friend for his typically astute question and for his advice in this area over a number of month we have go out to consultation on the work capability assessment we have not come to our conclusion on how to move forward but right at the centre of that will be a strong belief that if people can work with our support and encouragement that be the good of all outcome 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the freeze on local housing allowance be have a devastating impact on housing provider scotland ’s housing minister write to the secretary of state on   may   to make that point and to make the case for restore it to the percentile why have he not reply will the government use the autumn statement to raise it back to the percentile 
 i will certainly look into the letter to which the hon gentleman refer but i assure he that lha and other housing matter be under constant review and form part of the discussion that my department have with the treasury from time to time 
 what step be the minister take to help ensure that parent pay child maintenance and that the system be fair particularly if there have be a difficult divorce or separation 
 the government be commit to ensure that parent meet their obligation to their child and that the cms have robust enforcement power where parent refuse to pay child maintenance that they owe the child support enforcement act receive royal assent in july and will substantially and rightly speed up that process 
 due to a series of error make by the cms a constituent of mine have fail to receive child maintenance payment and be now on the brink of homelessness i have be in contact with the dwp but this case need to be expedite will the minister assure i that my constituent will    receive their payment and will not be make homeless will she meet i to discuss this extremely important case 
 the hon lady be right every child maintenance arrangement play a vital role in ensure that both parent play their part to support their child whether they live with they or not i be happy to take up that case urgently on behalf of our noble friend in the other place 
 pension auto enrolment have be a great success but it have lead to million of people get a new pension pot every time they change job million of people now have multiple pension pot that they struggle to keep on top of cause confusion and increase cost do my hon friend agree that employee should have the option to save into a workplace scheme of their choice enable they to build up a pot for life a pot to save in not a pot to smoke 
 automatic enrolment have transform saving across the country i welcome my hon friend ’s strong support and his passion in this area the pot for life model offer attraction with the potential to help engage individual with their pension saving if it maintain the gain achieve under automatic enrolment i be sure he will discuss that with the future pension minister 
 if life be so peachy for pensioner and if the minister really be as passionate as he say he be about support pensioner why do independent age say that despite the long list he have give the uptake in pension credit be not reach the people who need it the most why in my constituency of glasgow north east be pensioner who i be passionate about support still miss out on several every year will he use that passion to follow the scottish government and have a proper target benefit uptake strategy 
 the hon lady will be aware that pension credit application be up clearly we be try to get that even high there be a nationwide campaign which include scotland 
 accord to the late figure there be household receive pension credit in banff and buchan but what more can we do as member of parliament to encourage more pensioner to apply 
 my hon friend ’s campaign in his constituency have be a massive success and i thank he for that it build on our nationwide campaign to support pension credit there be much we can do to promote it locally which i know my hon friend be do through our local council citizens advice and voluntary organisation 
 do the minister share my horror at rise homelessness among refugee who have be grant asylum because the timescale from decision to their   be transition to mainstream benefit be a mere   day will she meet i so that we can work together to stop those who have be grant the right to a new life here be force to begin that new life in destitution on the street this winter 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point other id form be there to help claim soon those grant refugee status have recourse to public fund and be able to apply for universal credit as soon as they can dwp staff be instruct to consider all available evidence and work with the home office directly to confirm status where unsure we be review our public guidance to ensure that all those get that status claim support as soon as possible 
 the cost of living payment from the government be undoubtedly bring real benefit to my constituent but what support be available for those who be not eligible for that specific support 
 i thank my hon friend for the opportunity to mention the household support fund provide local authority with further funding which be discretionary for those most in need particularly those ineligible for cost of living payment the late year long extension in england run to march next year buckinghamshire council receive nearly £ in its late extension 
 the proposal in the work capability assessment activity and descriptor consultation will mean some claimant will lose £ a month if they be reassess push they even far into poverty will the minister or the secretary of state please explain this huge financial impact on low income people with disability or a serious health condition 
 no final decision have be make we have have the consultation and we will respond appropriately in the normal way 
 may we have specific detail on the help that jobcentre be give to armed force veteran who must live with the consequence of decision make by government 
 a very pertinent point after the weekend when we pay tribute in our local community and after what we see on the elizabeth tower the dwp continue to work to identify universal credit claimant who be member of the armed force community with dedicated force champion lead and over armed force champion across our jobcentre network work with spouse and partner too 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 those trussell trust figure publish last week make grim reading do the secretary of state recognise that if working age benefit be uprate by less than september ’s rate of inflation in april next year there will inevitably be another big surge in food bank demand and destitution 
 the right hon gentleman have raise an important point i take the uprating process extremely seriously and as he will know i look at a number of factor include the effect on poverty however as he will also understand i be not able to comment on a parliamentary process that have not yet be conclude 
 may i ask a question about auto enrolment and pension what can the secretary of state do to build on our good record by extend and increase the total amount that young people i see that there be schoolchildren in the public gallery who retire on define contribution pension be likely to be able to save in their retirement 
 there be key point here consolidation will make a massive difference but more important be the transformation of workplace saving through auto enrolment for young people the figure have rise from below to well over and it will get big as time move on 
 for those who suffer from endometriosis crohn ’s disease and colitis incontinence be a daily challenge for the purpose of the government ’s propose change in the incontinence descriptor what capability assessment have be do and be there any consultation with those sufferer 
 i hear the point that the hon lady have raise we have of course have the consultation and many view be express we will now consider those view very carefully and come forward as appropriate in the normal way 
 on a point of order mr speaker may i take advantage of a rather quiet news day to ask if there be any way in which i can place on record the appreciation of right hon and hon member for the wise advice quiet efficiency and unfailing courtesy of mr peter barratt who recently leave the service of this house after more than year 
 i make a statement last week to thank mr barratt for all his service so it have not go unnoticed and have certainly not be forget 
 debate resume order   november 
 question again propose 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty as follow 
 most gracious sovereign 
 we your majesty ’s most dutiful and loyal subject the commons of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in parliament assemble beg leave to offer our humble thank to your majesty for the gracious speech which your majesty have address to both houses of parliament 
 it be a pleasure to open this debate on behalf of his majesty ’s government and to have the opportunity to speak about the long term decision that the government have be take for a healthy future for our country for our national health service and for our social care system 
 we be build our health and care system for today and for tomorrow we be increase the capacity of the nhs and social care system boost primary care and community care invest in diagnostic and in treatment build our nhs workforce with the long term workforce plan and build our social care workforce with our year vision put people at the heart of care we be give people choice and control over their health and care and invest in the facility and technology that need to be at the forefront of care and sustainable for the long term we be drive reform to prevent ill health join up health and care in integrate care system and deliver a shift towards prevention and proactive care keep people out of hospital and enable they to live independently in their community 
 every day since last winter we have be plan and prepare for the challenge that lie ahead this winter the ever nhs long term workforce plan underpin our plan for the future of the nhs it will double the number of medical training place almost double the number of adult nursing place and expand gp and ally health professional training number give the nhs the staff it need for the future create new role build new training pathway and deliver a huge boost in diagnostic capacity 
 by the end of this year we will have open new community diagnostic centre that be the big investment in mri and ct scan capacity in nhs history community diagnostic centre will bring care close to home on high street in supermarket car park and at football stadium they have already do more than test and scan get patient fast diagnosis for cancer heart disease and other life threaten condition that be not all we be do to diagnose condition fast the number of people receive blood pressure check at local pharmacy have more than double reduce thousand of people ’s risk of suffer a heart attack or stroke 
 we be expand primary care too there be now over more primary care professional work in gp practice than in march we will deliver more gp appointment by the end of next year and we   be invest more than £ in tech to end the   am rush for gp appointment pharmacy will give people another choice give pharmacist the power to prescribe treatment for common condition free up as many as gp appointment and as we put test result on to the nhs app that will free up gp time again 
 that be also of the way that this government be give patient more choice and control just as we be go to give people more choice in where they be treat when they be refer by their gp for specialist care we have commit to give patient a choice between by provider so that they be treat base on what matter to they be that short waiting time see a particular doctor or get care close to home we have give patient who be wait more than week the right to request treatment elsewhere make well use of available capacity across the nhs and bring in more capacity from the independent sector 
 on patient choice there be a clear dividing line between the government and the opposition the leader of the opposition call the welsh government the blueprint for what labour would do in power yet in wales under a labour government there be no legal right to patient choice and patient there wait on average week long for treatment than in england we know where labour ’s plan would lead we just need to look at its welsh blueprint less choice for patient long waiting list and more bureaucracy for doctor and nurse who just want to get on with the job 
 before the most disruptive industrial action in nhs history stall progress we be reduce the long wait last summer we hit our target to eliminate year wait for plan operation this june we have virtually eliminate wait long than month we be spend more than £ between and to increase elective activity include open over new surgical hub to deliver more operation we be invest almost £ in bed equipment and technology and this year we start prepare the nhs for winter soon than ever before 
 back in january we publish our recovery plan for urgent and emergency care set clear target to improve a&e waiting and ambulance response time and use £ of dedicated funding to provide more permanent staff bed and new ambulance we be see result in october average category ambulance response time be more than minute fast than in the same month last year delay discharge have be come down and we have bring forward flu and covid vaccination protect the most vulnerable from illness this winter and reduce the likelihood that they will need hospital treatment 
 a strong social care sector be also vital this winter and into the future that be why we have make up to £ available over this year and next to boost adult social care across the country this be enable local authority to buy more care package and help more patient to leave hospital on time together with hospital at home bed which mean that patient can receive their care where they be most comfortable recover in their own home with support from secondary care when they need it through social prescribing thousand of people up and down the country be benefit from activity such as read circle choir group walking and football we be drive reform to the intermediate   and proactive care framework which set out how local system should support adult who need support after discharge free up hospital capacity for those who need it most and give people more care as they need it in their community away from a&e and out of hospital 
 we be roll out technology that will give patient life save treatment now and in the future by the end of the year every stroke network in england will have ai technology that can examine brain scan an hour fast cut stroke patient risk of suffer long term consequence by as much as third what be more almost half of nhs acute trust have win a share of £ to invest in ai accelerate the analysis of x ray and ct scan for suspect lung cancer patient that will save radiologist time boost efficiency and cut waiting time for the long term we be invest a furth £ to use ai to unlock treatment for disease that be incurable today be they novel treatment for dementia or vaccine for cancer 
 can the minister say something about the availability of new and specialist drug that the national institute for health and care excellence be not recommend will an effort be make to make these specialist drug which in many instance be effectively regard as miracle cure available for cystic fibrosis and cancer treatment for example 
 i understand what the hon gentleman be say and i know how strongly family and patient feel about this it be not for i as a minister to step on the independence of nice which have a remit to take those decision i be sure that the new secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins and other ministers in the department will continue to listen to the concern of family about access to those treatment 
 if we want to fully embrace preventive care we must tackle the single big preventable cause of ill health disability and death which be smoke unlike drink alcohol or eat fatty salty or sugary food there be no safe level of smoking it cause almost hospital admission every minute in cancer death and death a year 
 in smoker start by the time they be so the good thing we can do be to stop young people smoke in the place that be why this government will automatically raise the smoking age by year every year so anyone who be or young today will never be able to buy tobacco legally increase the smoking age work when it rise to smoking rate drop by almost a in that age group restricting choice be never easy but this time it be the right thing to do exist smoker will not be affect but the next generation will be smoke free save thousand of life reduce pressure on the nhs and build a bright future for our child 
 i hear what the minister say about the government ’s commitment to this policy but can she explain why the government be allow a free vote rather than whip back benchers to vote for government policy 
 i be not go to stand here and explain whip policy which be not my job as a health minister but i be delighted to see the potential of this legislation as with so many other worthwhile government policy such as increase funding for the national health service i would be delighted to see the right hon gentleman and other opposition members support this policy 
 we be also crack down on the alarming rise in vaping among child there be no doubt that vaping be safe than smoke and be a terrific tool to help adult smoker quit but like member across the house i be concerned that in child have try vaping which can be hugely damaging to their health the whole house know that no child should be use nicotine 
 the rise in youth vaping be no coincidence disposable vape be consistently market at child and be available at pocket money price with many retailer ignore their duty not to sell they to young people with more than be throw away every week disposable vape be also damage our planet we be act now to protect our child and our planet we be look at ban child friendly flavour restrict colourful packaging and mandate that vape be display only behind the counter we be also explore a ban or a restriction on disposable vape sale and empower local authority to dish out on the spot fine for sell vape to child all these proposal be be develop with parent and teacher across the uk and they will strike a balance between give adult smoker a choice to switch to vaping and prevent our child from take it up 
 i recognise the disappointment that the mental health bill be not include in the king ’s speech but i can assure hon member that this government be commit to achieve genuine parity between mental health and physical health improve the care of those detain under the mental health act and bring forward the bill when parliamentary time allow 
 we be not go to wait for legislation to make change we will continue to pilot model of culturally appropriate advocacy provide tailor support to hundred of people from ethnic minority to well understand their right if they be detain under the mental health act this come on top of the record investment and staff number we be put into mental health since the mental health workforce have grow by more than and by march we will have invest over £ more in mental health than year ago mean that more people include more than child and young people will benefit from mental health support 
 of the big issue raise by every school i visit in my constituency be mental health support and i be disappointed not to see the mental health bill in the king ’s speech will it be address in any other way where be it 
 as i say a moment ago let i remind the hon lady of this we be not wait for legislation in order to bring forward mental health reform that be why for instance we have already be roll out mental health support team in school we be already ahead of schedule on that we be give a quarter of england ’s school and college child access   to mental health support team a year ahead of schedule in addition thank to this government dormitory accommodation for mental health patient will soon become a thing of the past 
 it have be a pleasure to work with the new secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend   the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay and a huge honour to work with my hon friend the members for colchester will quince and for harborough neil o'brien as part of a government take the long term decision to build a health and care system for the future with more doctor nurse pharmacist physio and care worker well mental healthcare for adult and child more proactive care in the community great capacity the new technology and more choice where condition be diagnose quick or prevent altogether thus help people to live long and healthy life 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i congratulate the minister on be the great survivor of the department of health and social care she must surely be due a carriage clock or the long service medal by now the only long term decision for a bright future seem to be that she be still in her place although she do not offer much of a bright future 
 more positively i see far more than nervous face on the government benches i see lot of nervous face among those contemplate the next general election but be undoubtedly that of   the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell i congratulate he on his election and wish he well for his maiden speech which i can confidently say will be the good speech we hear from those on the conservative benches all day 
 at a time when patient can not get a doctor ’s appointment family be struggle to pay the mortgage and major conflict be have an impact on our economy and security the prime minister have spend the past day decide whether to sack his home secretary for publicly disobey he undermine the police and inflame tension on our street finally have have the sheer poor judgment to have appoint someone to such high office when she have already be force to resign for a serious national security leak he have summon up the gut to sack the bad home secretary in history yet as we see the merry go round of the conservative clown show continue after year the conservatives have run out of name at the bottom of the barrel so they be start all over again may i offer my sympathy to the conservative members who do not get the call from no today what kind of message do it send to their constituent that their own party leader can not find a suitable candidate for foreign secretary among the conservative mp who sit in this house 
 the arsonist have today return to the fire because when it come to the national health service lord cameron have quite a lot to answer for as the architect of austerity and the big top down reorganisation in the history of the nhs a £ disaster that have lead straight to the big crisis in the history of the nhs that be before we even begin to take into account his record of ushering in the golden age between britain and china   take police officer off our street and have food bank britain leave more than people dependent on charity to feed themselves and their family that be lord cameron ’s legacy and as the current prime minister admit some mistake be make who be he try to kid when he tell we that this recycle conservative government offer the change our country need 
 i would welcome the secretary of state for health and social care   the hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins   to her position but of course she be not here this afternoon have just be appoint early today she be the secretary of state for health and social care that i have face in this job in less than year although to be fair of those appointment be   the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay the government say they would make 
 long term decision for a bright future 
 but they can not even deliver a long term secretary of state for health 
 we know where the secretary of state be she will be in the department be brief about the challenge of the job and be bring up to speed no doubt she and new ministers will want to review the decision she be inherit and to start to think afresh about whether she want to proceed with those decision as they have be work through the machine that be why it be so grossly irresponsible to change ministers every minute and constantly churn from face to another when it be clear to everyone but the prime minister that it be not just a change of face around the cabinet table that we need but a change of government 
 as the secretary of state sit in the department be brief by her civil servant i will help they out with the induction by offer she a primer on what she inherit million of patient a month unable to get a gp appointment when they need hour in a&e not just a television programme but a reality for far too many ambulance not arrive on time if they arrive at all the month of the bad strike in the history of the national health service nhs dentistry in manage decline to the point where people be force to pull out their own tooth diy dentistry in century britain a generation of young people who have pay the price for lockdown with their mental health force to wait year for the support they need the long waiting list and the low patient satisfaction in history that be the record of the secretary of state ’s predecessor failure upon failure upon failure upon failure upon failure upon failure upon failure 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about that list of failure it be shocking i would like to add to the list that over autistic people or people with learning disability be detain in inappropriate unit when this government promise over year ago to close they all down 
 i thank my hon friend for her intervention as i make progress through my speech i will come back to the breath take complacency about mental health we hear from the minister a moment ago 
 give the scale of the crisis and give that the prime minister have make fix waiting list his priority hon member might have expect something in the king ’s speech to deal with it instead we get nothing on the nhs as it head into its most challenging winter yet and we get nothing on social care just kick the can down the road and delay reform until after the election there be nothing on dentistry despite even conservative back benchers cry out for a rescue plan and nothing on mental health despite the conservative party commit to reform not just in its last manifesto but in its last manifesto 
 it be the long king ’s speech in almost a decade with the few bills do that not just sum up the modern conservative party plenty of slogan but no solution what we get be a bill that will not come into effect until after the general election and a sack the nurse bill on the tobacco and vape bill the question be not whether labour will support it but whether the conservative party will support it government members will remember that i propose that smoke ban back in january i say they will remember because they make their feeling know in newspaper at the time they call it nanny state and 
 an attack on ordinary people and their culture 
 they accuse i of health fascism well they can now make their consider and nuanced view know to the new secretary of state i be sure she be look forward to receive they it just demonstrate that where labour lead the government follow 
 the prime minister may be too weak to whip his back benchers to vote that crucial measure through but on the opposition benches we will put country and party labour mp will go through the voting lobby and make sure that the legislation be pass so that young people today be even less likely to smoke than they be to vote conservative 
 i be afraid to disappoint the government but we will not be support the other bill in the king ’s speech that relate to health most people look at the crisis in the nhs and think it need more doctor and nurse the conservative party look at the health service and conclude that we need to sack more doctor and nurse the government be say that public servant should be sack for fail to provide minimum standard on strike day but the government have not meet the hour a&e standard since they have not meet the standard for treatment within week since and they be do so badly on meet cancer waiting time standard that they have simply get rid of the standard altogether if the conservatives be propose to sack doctor and nurse for fail to provide minimum service level can we now sack ministers for fail to meet minimum standard on non strike day 
 the new health and social care secretary have an opportunity to break with the past year strike be cripple the nhs and they be put patient in harm ’s way her predecessor may have think that they be a useful excuse for his failure but they be and be a misery for patient and staff alike the government must stop the scapegoating of nhs staff go into these negotiation with good faith work at find a solution and finally bring these strike to an end there will be   no progress on turn around our national health service until the government make some progress 
 when sum up i hope the minister will explain why action be not take on the mental health act because i be afraid the minister ’s opening remark be entirely unsatisfactory the bill have go through committee it have cross party support it be ready to go so where be it the treatment of people with learn disability and autism under the current act sham our society the disproportionate impact on black people who be time more likely to be sectioned than white people be appalling prison and police cell be no place for people with mental ill health surely that be not controversial in it be as the former prime minister   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may say a burn injustice i can not understand why the government have break their promise to address that matter finally 
 it be long past time that mental health be treat with the same seriousness as physical health labour will not only reform the mental health act in our king ’s speech but recruit thousand more mental health professional provide hub in every community and set up mental health support in every school so that young people can get the help they need when they need it interruption the minister say that they have do that what planet be she live on this be the problem with these minister even when the face change the line remain the same the minister have not change but she be still read from the same fail script this be the problem with the conservative party its message to the country be simple you have never have it so good everything be go really well the reason we be churn all the ministers in our cabinet be that they be do such a good job it be job do and time to give someone else a chance i be afraid that that be why these conservative be so out of touch and will struggle at the next general election if their message to the country be that it have never have it so good 
 furthermore unlike this government who crash the economy in the most reckless way we will pay for our policy make sure that they be fully cost and fully fund in this case by end tax break for private school and private equity fund manager politic be about choice labour choose the wellbeing of the many not the interest of the few and we will fight the election on those line any time i say call the election tomorrow because we be ready 
 when it come to dentistry i should also say farewell to former ministers the hon member for colchester will quince and for harborough neil o’brien as the hon member for harborough depart government i hope that he do not take with he his pledge to bring forward a recovery plan for nhs dental service it have be month since he announce that such a plan would be forthcoming yet it be now nowhere to be see indeed last week integrate care system be give permission to raid their dentistry budget underspend and to remove the ringfence that follow a pilot in cornwall trialle make nhs dentistry available only to child and the most vulnerable it be the manage decline of nhs dentistry before our eye if people want to know what the future of the nhs would look like with more year of the conservative government they need only look at the ghost of christmas past in nhs dentistry the conservatives blame the previous   labour government but they have be in power for year in we stand on a manifesto commit to reform the nhs dental contract they have have year to do it and they have fail again and again leave we in the situation that we be in today with dickensian story of desperate people perform diy dentistry and tooth decay be the most common cause of child age to be admit to hospital it do not need to be this way 
 i say to the new secretary of state and her team that she may not have a plan but labour do and she be more than welcome to nick it we will deliver more urgent appointment a year recruit dentist to the area most in need introduce supervised toothbrushing in school to prevent child ’s tooth from rot and reform the nhs dental contract so that everyone who need an nhs dentist can get 
 be that it 
 the minister say be that it it be more nhs dentistry appointment than her government be provide it be ridiculous the extent to which minister continue to parrot these ridiculous line be embarrassing if they want to intervene make my day i be perfectly prepared to confront any member with their own government ’s record of course they do not want to defend the government ’s record they have a hard enough time do that on the doorstep 
 turn back to his majesty ’s gracious speech there may not have be any bills for the health service last week but we do see the white flag being wave on the prime minister ’s pledge to cut waiting list hospital receive a letter tell they to cut the number of operation and appointment they be aim to offer this year at the same time an extra funding pot be announce so we be literally pay more and get less no wonder the nhs be in such a state no wonder waiting list have treble since no wonder hundred of thousand more patient be wait for treatment today than when the prime minister make his pledge 
 i want to make a plea for those young people with cystic fibrosis who have to take multiple medication and endure daily physiotherapy blood test x ray and hospital visit wait on many occasion as part of their normal routine just to stay well the shadow secretary of state and the labour opposition have give a commitment to endeavour to do well for the nhs will he do well for those young people who have cystic fibrosis 
 i be very grateful to the hon member for his intervention i be deeply concerned about the situation face child with cystic fibrosis in particular give that there be radically life extend treatment available that offer the hope to those young people not just of long happy healthier life but of reduce admission to hospital it be right that the national institute for health and care excellence make those judgment in a rigorous way look at the evidence i hope that it will be successful in bring down the price of those drug by negotiate with the pharmaceutical company to make sure that we can get affordable drug to family who desperately need they and be   desperately anxious that the announcement they have read about mean short life for their child no family should go through that agony and i hope that a resolution can be find 
 the government and the previous health secretary get into the habit of steal labour ’s policy i say that not as a complaint but as an invitation it be clear that the government do not have a plan to cut nhs waiting list but we do £ will be pay straight into the pocket of hard press nhs staff to deliver more appointment a year at evening and weekend pay for by abolish the non dom tax status because patient need treatment more than the wealthy need a tax break—[interruption conservative members groan when we mention charge non dom their fair share they groan when we talk about close private equity loophole and they groan when we talk about tax private school fairly they do not groan when taxis go up on work people they do not groan when benefit be cut for the poor people 
 we know who the conservatives be in it for they be in it for the few we champion the interest of the many that be the labour difference we believe strongly that people who live or work in britain should pay their taxis here too there be still time for the new secretary of state to lobby the chancellor ahead of the autumn statement this genuinely be an oven ready plan unlike some of the plan we have hear from the conservatives and i encourage the new secretary of state to nick it 
 after year we have an nhs that get to people too late we have a hospital base system gear towards late stage diagnosis and treatment which deliver poor outcome at great cost we have an analogue system in a digital age we have a sickness service not a health service with too many life hamper by preventable illness and too many life lose to the big killer it could not be clear the long we give the conservatives in power the long patient will wait this be an empty king ’s speech from a government who have run out of road run out of steam and run out of idea a conservative party too busy tear itself apart to govern the country a prime minister who can not decide whether it be time for a change or to go back to year 
 the future of the nhs after another year of the tories be emerge before our eye a tier health service where those who can afford it go private and those who can not are leave wait behind our nhs reduce to a poor service for poor people our country view as the sick man of europe it do not have to be that way the prime minister be right when he say 
 it ’ time for a change 
 but only labour can deliver it 
 labour have a different vision for our country in which no fear ill health or old age people have power choice and control over their own health and care the place people be bear or the wealth they be bear into do not determine how long they will live or how happy their life will be patient benefit from the bright mind develop cutting edge treatment and technology and child bear in britain today become the healthy generation that ever live 
 only labour have a plan to get the nhs back on its foot and make that vision a reality a plan to cut waiting list deliver more appointment a year   a rescue plan for nhs dentistry deliver more appointment recruiting dentist to the area most in need introduce toothbrushing for to year old in school and have an nhs dentist for all who need a plan to double the number of scanner so that patient be diagnose early a plan to recover our nation ’s mental health from the damage of lockdown a plan to cut red tape that tie up gps time so that we can bring back the family doctor a plan for the big expansion of nhs staff in history a plan so good that the government adopt it and give we a head start and a plan to reform the nhs to make it fit for the future to those who say that that can not be do and that thing can not be well i say this the last labour government deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history we do it before and we will do it again 
 it be not a change of face we need but a change of government it be time to call a general election and give the british people the choice more of the same with the conservatives or a fresh start with labour call a general election now so that labour can give britain its future back 
 we come now to a maiden speech so there will be no interruption i call steve tuckwell 
 thank you mr speaker for call i to deliver my maiden speech many word have be dedicate to this summer ’s by election campaign and the subsequent result in uxbridge and south ruislip so i hope you will allow i to add just a few more word base on my own experience rather than the conjecture offer by many commentator 
 let i begin with ulez the ultra low emission zone and its expansion across outer london it will come as no surprise to anyone that this be not the time i have mention those letter in this chamber even though the extended charge zone have now come into being i stand here no long the local candidate but the member of parliament still determine to fight the mayor of london ’s money grab and reduce the burden place on my resident and local business 
 for i however the by election be about much more than ulez and its unnecessary expansion it be about a variety of local issue such as secure a new hospital keep uxbridge police station open provide further support for childcare place and protect our green space for future generation it be a by election campaign fight on multiple local issue of substance so rather than dwell on ulez may i suggest that what also drive resident to the poll be the motivation to have an mp who understand the need of the community who appreciate the complexity of the community and who be truly embed in the community 
 since i have serve as a local councillor for the london borough of hillingdon hillingdon council be well respect and in some case even envy for its consistent year in year out performance in core service that resident expect be they weekly waste collection which be quite rare these day refurbishing library not close they and be of the green borough   in london with green flag award park and open space all of this and more be achieve through hillingdon council ’s continual focus on sound financial management that put resident i pay tribute to the leader of hillingdon council councillor ian edwards and his executive cabinet as well as sir ray puddifoot the former leader for over decade my fellow councillor both past and present and of course the officer team and frontline team across all department who deliver great service for their resident and my constituent 
 during the by election uxbridge and south ruislip see intense campaigning with a medium frenzy and a whopping candidate but be the centre of attention be not something new for my constituency uxbridge be home to the battle of britain bunker of the most popular heritage destination in my constituency for visitor near and far the bunker play a key part in the allied defensive network across britain during the world war and it be from that bunker that no fighter command be control no fighter command base in uxbridge play a crucial role in secure victory during the battle of britain indeed it be at the entrance to the bunker that winston churchill utter his famous word 
 never in the field of human conflict be so much owe by so many to so few 
 he repeat those profound word in this very chamber day later on   august 
 a bunker mentality be right for that time but now be not that time this be a time not to hunker down and hide away but to face the many complex challenge that face we here in the uk and across the globe the prime minister the government and my party be quite rightly look at the long term and have outline clear and decisive policy that be design to tackle the challenge we face they be not easy decision but decision that build on the long term horizon rather than easy short termism that have no foundation or substance i be elect to stand up for the interest of my constituent i be bear and raise in the constituency that i now have the privilege of serve as an mp
