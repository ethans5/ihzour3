national energy action say that of north tynesiders be in fuel poverty home have legacy prepayment meter and we be in the bottom for energy efficiency but the chancellor announce no new funding to help people this winter we be now in advent so what christmas message do the prime minister have for my constituent who be freeze in their home 
 the clerk at the table have inform the house of the unavoidable absence through illness of the speaker from the sitting of the house this week the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of inflation on public spending in wales 
 may i say how sorry i be to learn of the death of baroness kinnock i meet she when i be an intern in the european parliament many year ago and i have never forget how fearless remarkable and determine she be i send my deep condolence to   the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock   and the wide welsh labour family who also mourn the death of allan rogers who serve in this house as the member for rhondda for year 
 the uk economy have outperform expectation this year and the prime minister have deliver on his pledge to halve inflation follow the chancellor ’s announcement at the autumn statement the welsh government will receive £ in additional funding which can be use to support public service in wales 
 tory inflation and austerity mean that the welsh budget be worth £ less than it be when it be set and the autumn statement consequential do not make up for that the institute of welsh affairs have call the autumn statement a return to austerity with 
 tax cut at the cost of cut to public service delivery 
 it be the people of wales who be suffer poverty and cut to public service so i ask the minister instead of the autumn statement tax handout to the wealthy in london and the south east will the secretary of state not urge the chancellor to tax the wealthy to well protect welsh public service 
 the house will not be surprised to learn that i completely disagree with the hon lady ’s assessment it be not the amount of money the welsh government be receive but the way in which they be mismanage public service that be the problem the spending    review deliver the welsh government a record settlement of £ a year so i think that she need to recognise that the problem be on her own side in wales 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the hon lady to her role and thank she for her tribute to baroness kinnock and to allan rogers glenys kinnock be an inspiration to our labour movement to her many friend and colleague around the world but most of all to her family as the kinnock family grieve we send they our love and deep sympathy 
 on public spending in wales the prime minister promise when abandon hs2 that the north wales main line would be electrify at a cost of £ in the past year construction cost have increase by a year because of the government ’s economic mismanagement will the minister confirm that the last time any cost assessment be do on electrification be in and that the scheme will now cost between £ and £ 
 i join the hon lady in her comment about the kinnock family 
 it be important to recognise that this government be the in many decade to commit to that project i be sorry that she appear to agree with her colleague in the welsh labour government in cardiff bay who seem to say that this be not a priority conservative members feel that electrification and economic growth in north wales be a priority and i be sorry that she can not agree with that 
 if it be such a priority why have nothing be do since when the cost assessment be undertake the hon lady ’s government promise to electrify the south wales main line but they do not do so they promise to improve journey time and connection between south wales and london but they do not do that either she have not give an answer on whether the government will fully fund electrification so how can she stand there and claim to the people in north wales that this project have any prospect whatsoever of be complete by this hapless government 
 i say again that the hon lady ’s party have already dismiss this project as not a priority i also say again that north wales be a priority for this government we be determined to level up right across this country and especially to focus on area that the welsh labour government in south wales have completely ignore 
 i add my condolence and those of my party to the kinnock family on their sad loss 
 wales ’s public service assail by inflation and austerity now face the further difficulty of recruit the skilled migrant who have become so vital to care for our age population as the family threshold be to rise to £ that be £ high than the average wage in gwynedd with many of my constituent earn significantly less will the minister tell i what representation she or rather the secretary of state have make to the home secretary on the effect of the new threshold on welsh public service 
 as the hon gentleman will know the secretary of state have regular discussion with his cabinet colleague about the issue it be absolutely vital that we take tough measure to make sure that we sustain sensible level of migration that be exactly what the home secretary have announce this week 
 the change in the salary threshold will affect real people with real family and real people receive care my constituent daniel griffith be due to marry his brazilian partner next year they intend to make their home in wales but it be far from clear at present whether they will be able to do that under the new income rule why should daniel unlike the secretary of state the minister and everyone else in this chamber have to choose between his wife and his country 
 some of the policy put in place by the welsh labour government aid and abet by plaid cymru under the co operation agreement be disadvantage wales put off investor from create investment and job in wales again i say to the hon gentleman that it be his colleague in cardiff bay who need to have a look at what they be do 
 whether he have have discussion with the welsh government on promote and support narrow gauge railway tourism in wales 
 narrow gauge and heritage railway be important for our tourism sector although tourism   be of course devolve the uk government have demonstrate their support for the sector the secretary of state see that at hand on   june when he open corwen station which be partly fund by the uk government ’s levelling up fund 
 i welcome my hon friend to the dispatch box it be a pleasure to see she there 
 a little while back a friend of mine from rouen thierry fontenay come over to tywyn in gwynedd i ask myself how can i amuse he i take he on the talyllyn railway and we go from tywyn to abergynolwyn he be over the moon he take photograph of the engine and go on to the footplate he tell i that there be no narrow gauge railway like that if at all in france what can we do to promote in europe these wonderful narrow gauge railway that we have in wales 
 my hon friend be of course right wales ’s narrow gauge railway be part of our unique tourism offer so it be vital that they be market to the world that be why visit britain work to ensure that wales ’s brand value be reflect in the broad great campaign let i do visit britain and visit wales ’s job for they and warmly invite monsieur fontenay to come and see the premier narrow gauge railway the brecon mountain railway 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn statement on the welsh economy 
 the autumn statement set out the uk government ’s plan to grow the economy and incentivise work so that economic growth can be feel throughout the united kingdom that will include a national insurance tax change from january which will put £ back into the pocket of worker across wales 
 north wales have always be the poor relative to south wales where the welsh labour government in cardiff fund their voter basis however thank to the foresight of this conservative government money be now flow from whitehall to wrexham—£13 from the levelling up fund £ from the town fund £ from the share prosperity fund and the prospect of a £ investment zone we be work on a civil service hub do the secretary of state agree that after year of neglect from the welsh labour government this conservative government have put wrexham firmly on the map 
 i be absolutely delighted to agree with my hon friend the uk government be put wrexham on the map i be of course delight with the £ investment zone across wrexham in flintshire which be mark by a visit from the chancellor to the area the £ town fund for wrexham will ensure long term certainty and investment for the area and for the growth deal i believe that the freeport in north wales will also benefit my hon friend ’s constituent 
 accord to research from the bevan foundation nearly in welsh child have report have recently be worried about be cold and around in have worry about be hungry what be the government go to do about that 
 the uk government have spend £ on measure to help the least well off across the united kingdom throughout the difficult time bring about by the covid pandemic and the war in ukraine on top of that in the autumn statement we be able to announce a cut in national insurance which will put more money into people ’s pocket i hope that the hon gentleman will be talk to his constituent who be no doubt hit by the high taxis in the whole united kingdom as a result of the policy of the scottish national party government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i join other in pay tribute to glenys kinnock who be much love by we all 
 early this year the secretary of state tell my hon friend   the member for cardiff central jo stevens   that his government would prioritise help the most vulnerable yet welsh household still face the consequence of year of his government ’s economic failure with a historically high tax burden and his own constituent   pay on average £ more each month on their mortgage can he explain then why his conservative colleague in the senedd be call for the welsh government to withdraw their £ mortgage support scheme for those at risk of repossession 
 the uk government have already bring forward a mortgage charter to support anyone get into difficulty i hope that the hon lady agree that the fact that the government have deliver on their pledge to halve inflation over the past year will mean that everyone in wales be well off that the cut to national insurance will mean that everyone in wales be well off and that the increase in the living wage as well the government ’s commitment to ensure that pension and benefit be uprated in line with inflation will mean that everyone on low salary be well off 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential financial impact of proposal to implement a visitor levy for wales on the tourism sector 
 the uk government be invest in wales and in the welsh tourism industry which have be evidence most recently by the decision to allocate £ to the hay festival a project champion by my hon friend the under secretary it be a pity that the welsh government be not take the same view about the importance of the tourism industry and be introduce a tax that signal that wales be close for business 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer it be no surprise that hit tourist with a tax be likely to deter they from want to visit wales despite the natural beauty of place such as snowdonia and the attraction of visit location such as anglesey alongside highlight the folly of this move from the welsh labour government will he ensure that anyone advocate for a tax on tourism anywhere else in the uk be remind of the negative impact that it would have on our tourism sector 
 i can assure my hon friend that not only will i be remind the welsh labour government about the importance of support the tourism industry and the folly of introduce a tax but my conservative colleague in the senedd will also be make that point i hope that the welsh labour government will listen to they and also listen to the wales tourism alliance which have say that this tax will be a tax on job and a tax on an industry that employ in people in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the mph speed limit on rural community 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the mph speed limit on rural community 
 all of we support speed limit in place where there be a risk to life i have support speed limit outside school hospital and other place in my constituency but the welsh labour government ’s policy of bring in a mph speed limit on all mph road a blanket speed limit be damage for the economy by their own figure they have suggest that it could create a £ hit to the welsh economy they need to think again 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer more than people on ynys môn and almost half a across wales have sign the senedd petition to rescind and remove the disastrous mph law in fact more people have sign the petition than vote for labour in the last senedd election unlike the welsh labour government will the secretary of state listen to people across wales and join i in call for the welsh labour government to reverse this new disastrous mph law 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend and call on the welsh labour government to rescind the policy of a blanket mph speed limit across wales at the same time i call on they to rescind their policy of build no new road ever again in wales and i call on they to scrap their policy of bring in road charge for use the motorway network be it not interesting that not labour member present be willing to stand up to defend their own senedd government policy 
 we have already hear about the importance of tourism to the welsh economy have my right hon friend make any assessment of the impact on tourism which will disappear from wales as a result of this blanket ban 
 my hon friend make an interesting point people will now not only have to pay extra money to come into wales as a result of the welsh labour government ’s tourism tax but find it a lot slow to get around wales as a result of the welsh labour government ’s speed limit in my constituency of monmouthshire the labour council have recently decide for the time ever to bring in charge for people who want to use the shop on a sunday over the christmas period mean that it want we to slow down but not to stop 
 local authority in wales have have the opportunity to exempt road and village from the blanket application of a speed limit devon county council have have less discretion in may this year parish in devon apply to the county council to have a mph limit but only application be grant do the minister accept that an opt in system for mph zone depend on local authority have enough funding to exercise discretion 
 the hon gentleman ’s party be in charge in powys i be not sure whether he be aware of that the reality be that local authority across wales need more funding to implement such policy which have cost £ the welsh labour government be divert money from local authority so that they can spend it on their pet scheme include extra senedd members 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the impact of the autumn statement on household in wales 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague regard uk government support for household in wales so i be absolutely delighted that in the autumn statement the chancellor announce a rise in the national living wage provide an extra £ to the annual earning of full time worker 
 we be all think of the lovely glenys kinnock and her family especially my hon friend   the member for aberavon stephen kinnock at this sad time 
 the number of emergency food parcel distribute by the trussell—[interruption 
 order do it occur to hon member when they be converse in a normal speak tone rather than whispering while a member be ask a question that it be really rude and discourteous 
 thank you madam deputy speaker the number of emergency food parcel distribute by trussell trust food bank in newport west be on the rise in the number of parcel distribute be in the same period this year over be distribute to family there be nothing in the autumn statement that would make that situation well why not 
 with respect i disagree with the hon lady the fact that inflation have be halve will be of benefit to anyone receive food parcel the fact that there have be a cut in national insurance will be beneficial for people the fact that there have be an increase in the living wage will be beneficial for people the fact that pension and benefit be go up in line with inflation be go to be beneficial for people in her constituency what be not go to be beneficial for her constituent be the welsh labour government want to spend over £ create extra senedd members 
 the minister will be aware that he uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly have be meet in westminster this week it be make clear by the co chair natalie loiseau mep that glenys kinnock have make a huge contribution in the european parliament particularly in advocate for woman ’s right that be something that she want to record so it be not just in this parliament that glenys kinnock will be remember for her role in politic 
 do my right hon friend agree that the cut in national insurance contribution the improvement in the national living wage and the cutting of inflation be crucial to welsh household as they be across the uk 
 i agree with my right hon and learn friend on all those point that glenys kinnock make an enormous contribution to politic in this country as have her husband to whom we send our   condolence and as do her son who at this very moment be work hard to support steelmaking in south wales it be a pleasure to work with he on the transition board in port talbot even though we have disagreement from time to time on political matter may i add to the tribute and support everything that my right hon and learn friend say 
 i agree that the recent change in the autumn statement will be beneficial for people in wales 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on expedite the development of float offshore wind in   the   celtic   sea 
 i have regular in fact frequent conversation with cabinet colleague and stakeholder to support the float offshore wind industry which will create high quality job in wales the government fully support plan for up to gw of float offshore wind in the celtic sea and we be work to bring forward an additional gw through the 2030s with the potential to bring forward up to £ worth of investment 
 previous offshore wind development on england ’s east coast have show that appropriate planning be need to minimise disruption to community do my right hon friend agree that the development of float offshore wind in the celtic sea should mean single cable corridor to his side of the water and just to the north coast of devon or cornwall to reduce environmental and societal disruption 
 i know that the electricity system operator be currently review the design of connection for offshore wind project last week or possibly early this week i meet the crown estate and i have be meet national grid to discuss some of the issue around cable and the reconfiguration of the grid the decision as to where the cable will go and how many of they there will be be a fairly technical that i fear i be not qualified to take a view on but i can assure my hon friend that the crown estate and national grid would be more than happy to talk to she about that 
 any onshore and offshore wind in the celtic sea will affect fisherman in northern ireland as well can the secretary of state assure i that when it come to plan for offshore wind the fishing organisation in northern ireland scotland and wales will all have input on where it happen so that fishing will not be affect 
 the hon gentleman make a good point in spark a float offshore wind industry certain challenge need to be deal with together with various other government department he have make reference to challenge i can assure he that i have already have informal discussion about that and will be look to have more such discussion with the department for environment food and rural affairs and other government departments to ensure that we overcome all the challenge and create a vibrant sustainable industry for the future 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of energy bill in wales 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on a variety of issue include the cost of energy bill the government recognise the challenge pose by cost of living pressure which be why we be provide on average £ per household from to to support household and individual with the cost of living 
 the minister may not be aware of the very successful warm wales programme in the noughtie which see ten of thousand of home have their cavity and loft insulate save resident in neath port talbot and wrexham hundred of pound every year do the government recognise that concentrate scheme of that nature have a major impact on fuel poverty and will ministers steal our plan which would see hundred of thousand more household benefit 
 i be well aware that there be a number a renewable energy scheme that could have a positive benefit on householder in wales which be why the uk government have be so supportive of the potential for float offshore wind in the celtic sea and why in the last round we arrange high strike price for tidal energy we be look at a wide range of renewable energy system that can bring benefit to people in wales at the same time in recognise the cost of living pressure the uk government ensure that we be pay around half the average fuel bill for homeowner during the last winter period 
 what step he be take to support farming in wales 
 last week i have the pleasure of talk to farmer at the royal welsh agricultural society winter fair and at livestock market in sennybridge and talybont in my constituency the uk government be commit to back welsh farming most notably by allocate more than £ to the welsh government that deliver on our manifesto commitment to maintain funding for farmer and land manager at level 
 farmer across the uk from those in the country of wales to those in the village of wales in rother valley face increase pressure the minister will know that i be hold my next farmer forum with the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend   the member for sherwood mark spencer early next year in rother valley what be my hon friend do to support farmer in the country of wales farmer in the village of wales in rother valley and farmer across the whole of the uk 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his work to ensure that the voice of farming be hear by the minister like i he understand that farmer across   this country be the beat heart of the rural economy drive growth in rural constituency such as mine i must say that attitude stand in stark contrast to that of the labour party in wales which have already cut £ from the welsh agriculture budget we wait with trepidation to see what damage labour will do to welsh farmer next week 
 i call stephen doughty—[interruption order that just prove the point member be not pay the least bit of attention to a colleague who be about to speak he could not even hear his name be call it be rude to keep talk when someone be try to ask an important question 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of rail infrastructure in wales 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of rail infrastructure in wales 
 thank you for your generosity madam deputy speaker i too pay tribute to my very good friend in the kinnock family after the loss of glenys who be a dear friend to all of we and note the sad death of the former member for rhondda 
 i ask the secretary of state 
 order let the minister respond to the question 
 the uk government be commit to build a strong rail infrastructure network across wales which will improve connectivity and drive economic growth 
 my constituent want the parkway station to be build at st mellons that will require important work on the south wales main line for relief line will the minister meet i and colleague with the rail minister the minister of state department for transport   the hon member for bexhill and battle huw merriman to ensure that this important national investment be make so that the station can go ahead 
 i will be delighted to meet the hon gentleman to discuss that and the investment that the uk government be already put into rail infrastructure in wales 
 the secretary of state and the minister should know that i have campaign for year to close the dangerous level crossing in pencoed in my constituency no levelling up funding or transport bid funding have be approve for any of the application will the minister please talk to department for transport official to resolve this rather than allow dft official to keep announce more and more rail service which mean close the crossing more by stealth that be not acceptable to my constituent 
 i work well with the hon gentleman when i be in the government whips offices and i very much look forward to do so again i will write to he to offer a meeting about that 
 before we proceed to prime minister ’s question many colleague have ask i to pass on their good wish to mr speaker in his absence i be happy to inform the house that although mr speaker have test positive for covid and therefore can not be present in the chamber he be rapidly get well just as soon as that little test show negative he will be straight back here in his chair 
 the prime minister be ask 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the mayor of the west midlands on economic growth in that region 
 i welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker i know that the whole house wish mr speaker a speedy recovery before i answer my hon friend ’s question i also know that the whole house will want to join i in offer our condolence to the family and friend of alistair darling glenys kinnock and lord james douglas hamilton they each make an enormous contribution to public life and will be deeply miss 
 the hillsborough family have suffer multiple injustice the loss of life the blaming of the fan and the unforgivable institutional defensiveness of public body i be profoundly sorry for what they have be through today the government have publish their response to bishop james jones ’s report to ensure that the pain and suffering of the hillsborough family be not repeat i be immensely grateful that they share their experience i hope to meet they in the new year and the lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice will make an oral statement after pmq 
 turn to the question ask by my hon friend   the member for lichfield michael fabricant the government continue to work closely with the mayor of the west midlands to develop fully his plan to deliver growth 
 i join the prime minister in his comment about the hillsborough family 
 it be thank to margaret thatcher and her robust treatment of militant trade union in the west midland and to her contribution of £ at today ’s price to the motor industry in the west midland that iconic name such as jaguar and land rover still exist do the prime minister share my boundless joy that on the road to damascus and in recognition of her great heritage and all that she achieve another fanboy have join in her great belief the leader of the opposition 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for his area and because of the pro business policy of this government i be delighted to see that jaguar land rover have invest billion of pound in its move towards electrification in the region he be absolutely right i be always happy to welcome new   thatcherites from all side of this house but it say something about the leader of the opposition that the main strong female leader that he could praise be margaret thatcher not his own fantastic deputy 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday december 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the government be set to close the household support fund in march cut off crucial free meal for of rotherham ’s child in the low income family with the government ’s cost of live crisis in full swing and energy price about to increase again how do the prime minister justify take food from the mouth of my poor child 
 what we be do be ensure that no child should grow up in poverty that be why we have not only provide considerable cost of live support this year worth over £ to a typical household but provide more support this winter for pensioner a record increase in the national living wage and a full indexation and uplifting of welfare for the next financial year when it come to child and food not only do we fund free school meal for almost child but we introduce the holiday activity and food programme that programme provide not just food but enrich activity to deprive child up and down the entire country include in the hon lady ’s local authority 
 if there be place where everyone should feel safe it be in their own home but the reality be that for some of the most vulnerable people home be precisely where they can be most at risk they be terrorise by criminal who target they move in take control and set up a base camp from which they sell drug or facilitate prostitution in a horrendous form of exploitation know as cuckoo it have happen in eastbourne and it be happen across the country it be not an offence but it should be it be not cite in the criminal justice bill that we debate last week so will my right hon friend and the home secretary meet with i and concerned colleague to far discuss the issue 
 i agree with my hon friend that cuckooing be an abhorrent practice that often prey on the most vulnerable in society as part of the government ’s antisocial behaviour action plan the home office engage with relevant stakeholder about whether a new criminal offence be necessary the result of that engagement demonstrate that a range of exist power can be use to disrupt that activity but of course i will ensure that the relevant minister meet with my hon friend and update she on the work we be do to share effective practice to tackle this abhorrent problem 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 it be very good to see you in your place madam deputy speaker we wish mr speaker a speedy recovery 
 this week we lose giant of the labour family and i thank the prime minister for his comment alistair darling be a man of unassuming intelligence warmth and kindness he bring a calm expertise and in private a cut wit and his devoted love of his family be ever present our thought be with maggie his wife and calum and anna whom he love so dearly 
 glenys kinnock be a passionate campaigner for social justice who change life at home and abroad she be a loving and supportive partner and mother and her death be a huge loss to all of we we be think of neil stephen rachel and all the family i also   echo the prime minister ’s comment in relation to lord douglas hamilton 
 in relation to the hillsborough family they deserve justice in a previous capacity i work with the family they wait a very long time for the finding thank to people in this house and they have wait a long time for this response but i be glad it be now come 
 if the purpose of the rwanda gimmick be to solve a political headache of the tories own making to get people out of the country who they simply could not deal with then it have be a resounding success after all they have manage to send home secretaries there an achievement for which the whole country can be grateful apart from member of his own cabinet how many people have the prime minister send to rwanda 
 as i have be clear before we will do everything it takes—[interruption we will do everything it take to get this scheme work so that we can indeed stop the boat that be why this week we have sign a new legally bind treaty with rwanda which together with new legislation will address all the concern that have be raise everyone should be in no doubt about our absolute commitment to stop the boat and get flight off because this be the crucial point that the right hon and learn gentleman do not understand deterrence be critical even the national crime agency have say that 
 you need an effective removal and deterrence agreement 
 if you truly want to break the cycle of tragedy that we see what we hear this morning from his own shadow ministers be that they would scrap the scheme even when it be operational and work once again instead of be on the side of the british people he find himself on the side of the people smuggler 
 when the government announce this gimmick they claim rwanda would settle ten of thousand of people ten of thousand of people then the former deputy prime minister quickly whittle it down to mere hundred then the court of appeal in june make it clear there be housing for just the current number of people send there remain stubbornly consistent at the same time article of the treaty say 
 the party shall make arrangement for the united kingdom to resettle a portion of rwanda ’s most vulnerable refugee in the united kingdom 
 so how many refugee from rwanda will be come here to the uk under the treaty 
 madam deputy speaker—[interruption 
 order 
 the treaty as i have say address all the concern of the supreme court but it be a point of pride that we be a compassionate country that do welcome people from around the world let i just get the right hon and learn gentleman up to speed on what we be do we have reduce the number of illegal arrival from albania by increase the number of illegal work raid by and because of all the action we have take the number of small boat arrival be down by but what be the right hon and learn gentleman ’s plan what it come down to be that he simply do not have a plan to address this problem interruption no no i be probably be unfair because he do have a plan it be to cook up a deal with the eu that would see we accept illegal migrant 
 migration have treble on the prime minister ’s watch and all he can do be make up number about the labour party it be really pitiful i be not actually sure the prime minister can have read this thing article say the scheme be cap at rwanda ’s capacity that be article say rwanda can turn they away if it want article say we actually have to take refugee from rwanda how much do this fantastic deal cost we 
 as the home secretary be crystal clear about there be no incremental money interruption there be no incremental money that have be provide this be about we ensure that the concern of the supreme court have all be address in a legally bind treaty that will allow we to operationalise the scheme but i be glad the right hon and learn gentleman raise the topic of legal migration which i agree be absolutely far too high that be why this week we have outline a plan big than that of any other government before to reduce the level of legal migration by it be an incredibly comprehensive plan so if he care so much about it the simple question for he be do he support the plan 
 he clearly have not read it annex a say that on top of the £ he have already shower on rwanda when we send people there under this treaty we will have to pay for their accommodation and upkeep for year and that be not all a minister admit this morning that anyone we send to rwanda who commit a crime can be return to we i be begin to see why the home secretary say the rwanda scheme be it be something to do with bat be n’t it 
 what do the prime minister think attract mr kagame to hundred of million of pound for nothing in return 
 i have slightly lose the thread of the question the simple point be that if you believe in stop the boat as we on this side of the house do   you need to have effective deterrence and a return agreement it be as simple as that 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be not interested in stop the boat which be why he be not interested in the rwanda plan in fact we know they do not want to tackle this issue because even when this government be try to deport foreign national offender from this country they oppose it multiple shadow front benchers sign a letter to i to that effect but i do not need to tell he that because he sign it too interruption 
 order that be enough 
 i would say that this treaty have more hole than a swiss cheese but i do not want to wind up the prime minister by talk about a european country again 
 i have to give credit to the rwandan government they see the prime minister come a mile off i can only imagine their delight and sheer disbelief when have already bank £ of british taxpayer money without housing a single asylum seeker the prime minister appear again with another offer they can not refuse a gimmick will send taxpayer money to rwanda and refugee from rwanda to britain and will not stop the boat there be mention of margaret thatcher earlier—[hon member more 
 order there be understandable excitement about the mention of the name but the house must listen to the leader of the opposition 
 how do the tory party go from up yours delor to take our money kagame 
 when it come to this european thing and margaret thatcher this be the week that the shadow foreign secretary do not rule out rejoin the european union the leader of the opposition can roleplay margaret thatcher all he want but when it come to europe his answer be the same yes yes yes 
 forget the private jet the prime minister be obviously on a private planet of his own daily mail reader learn this week that he have begin to feel sorry for himself he have even be hear compare his plight to his beloved southampton football club i think that be a bit harsh because the saint have be on an game unbeaten run while as the song have it the prime minister get batter everywhere he go 
 if we want the perfect example of how badly the tories have break the asylum system last week the home office admit that people in the asylum system—[interruption 
 order come on now 
 thank you madam deputy speaker 
 if we want the perfect example of how badly the tories have break the asylum system last week the home office admit that people in the asylum system have disappear these be its exact word and they be hard to believe 
 i do not think we know where all those people be 
 now you might lose your car key you might lose your headphone you might lose your marble but how do you lose people 
 on the topic of football team the right hon and learn gentleman use to describe the rwanda policy as immoral yet his football team have a visit rwanda badge on the side of their shirt in the week when he make his big economy speech we be still wait to hear how he be go to borrow £ and still cut taxis and reduce debt it be the same old thing the sum do not add up while the opposition be struggle with their calculator we be get on and deliver a new treaty with rwanda the tough ever measure to cut legal migration our school march up the table and tax cut for million whether it be control our border or lower our taxis just like the saints the conservatives be march on 
 i be get feed up of sit in traffic jam in my constituency cause by contractor dig up road involve lane closure and temporary traffic light often invoke utility company emergency power when it turn out not to be an emergency and often with no sign of anybody do any work particularly over weekend i set up a campaign to name and shame these inconsiderate contractor but it turn out that when they cause all this chaos and breach the rule of their permit the maximum penalty be an £ fix penalty notice will the prime minister back my campaign and support well enforcement and realistic level of fine 
 my hon friend make an excellent point we have set aside £ as a result of our plan on hs2 which be enough to resurface over mile of road to improve journey a cornerstone of our plan but we be also introduce a range of measure as my hon friend say to reduce congestion from roadwork contain in the plan for driver be a scheme for great fine and penalty to ensure that work finish on time i will make sure that we look at his suggestion and i wholeheartedly back his campaign 
 i call the leader of the scottish national party stephen flynn

 order we really must hear the prime minister and we have a lot of question to get through interruption it be not the prime minister ’s opponent who be give he trouble 
 i say to the hon gentleman that margaret thatcher ’s view be to cut inflation then cut taxis and then win an election and that be very much my plan 
 of course it be not just in relation to margaret thatcher that the tory and labour leader appear to agree the same be true of the government ’s late migration policy those of we on these benches   be not afraid to say that we believe migration be a good thing it enrich our community it enrich our economy and it enrich our university our school our health service and of course our care sector why do the prime minister think it be acceptable to ask people to come to these shore to care for our family member while we show complete disregard for theirs what have become of this place 
 that be completely wrong as we have already say we have a proud track record of welcome those who be most vulnerable around the world over half a over the past few year from syria afghanistan ukraine hong kong and elsewhere and that be what this country will always do but at the same time when it come to economic migration and other form it be absolutely right that we take strong action to curb the level that we have see because they be simply far too high and place unsustainable pressure on our public service i make no apology for say that or indeed for say that it be important that those who come here contribute to our public service 
 i welcome the government ’s significant funding increase for year old pre schooling in but the illustrative department for education funding to dorset council for year old pre schooling look to be a net 17p per hour less than it be today and that be give west dorset preschool some nervousness about their sustainability will my right hon friend support i to ensure that educational funding formula will take into account the challenge of rural living and allow excellent preschool to

 we have also provide considerable support in the here and now for household with their energy bill £ of direct cost of live support this financial year on top of a record increase in benefit along with winter fuel payment of up to £ this winter for pensioner because they be particularly vulnerable we will continue to look at all the support we have to ensure that those who need it be get the help they deserve

 the government fail in their legal duty to publish   a report on spike by april state that they be reconsider whether their rationale for not introduce a specific offence for spike be sound will the prime minister clarify when and if the spike report will ever be publish do he agree with i and colleague right across the house that the only sound approach to this issue be to create a specific criminal offence for spike 
 this issue have be review by legal police colleague my late understanding be that exist law do cover the offence of spiking but i be happy of course to ensure that the hon lady get a letter that explain the position 
 not content with be the most indebted council in england with a debt of £ liberal democrat eastleigh borough council recently refinance its fail heaton heath housing project to the tune of £ with no house build and interest payment of £ per month will the prime minister now ask the department for levelling up housing and communities to intervene and independently investigate the development may i ask for a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss this terrible decision by eastleigh borough council 
 i be aware that some local authority include the my hon friend mention have take excessive risk with borrowing and investment practice that be why we have take a range of measure to strengthen the regulatory framework to prevent that from happen they include new power that make it quick and easy for the government to step in when council take on excessive risk through borrowing i will ensure that he get a meeting with the relevant minister to raise his concern because his constituent deserve well 
 national energy action say that of north tynesiders be in fuel poverty home have legacy prepayment meter and we be in the bottom for energy efficiency but the chancellor announce no new funding to help people this winter we be now in advent so what christmas message do the prime minister have for my constituent who be freeze in their home 
 as i outline we have provide considerable support for particularly vulnerable family this year and through this winter we be also invest record sum in improve the energy efficiency and insulation of vulnerable home through our home upgrade scheme and the warm home discount which on average can save people hundred of pound on their energy bill when they receive that support we be expand those programme across the country include in the north east

 we must show that the law be there on the front line and that it be capable of protect all 
 what support will britain offer the international criminal court to enable it to conduct investigation of the conduct of all party in israel gaza and the west bank before and since   october 
 as be well know we be a strong and long stand supporter of the international criminal court when it come to the situation in gaza we have be consistent in say that international humanitarian law have to be respect all party must take every possible step to avoid harm civilian and i can say that i stress that point specifically just yesterday to prime minister netanyahu 
 the prime minister be aware that the household tax know as the television licence fee be due to rise in   april in line with inflation give the ongoing household budget constraint with which all our constituent be face such as increase childcare cost as well as ongoing unresolved staffing issue at bbc northern ireland national bbc television and national bbc radio be this really the right time to proceed with an even large £ licence fee budget enhance yet again 
 we have already agree a fair settlement with the bbc that will see the licence fee remain frozen until however the hon member have raise an excellent point i have be clear about the fact that the bbc need to be realistic about what be possible in an environment like this and the licence fee should rise only at a level that people can actually afford the culture secretary have say that we be look at this issue right now and she will set out more detail in due course 
 longton the large town in my constituency have not benefit from future high street funding from town deal or from the late long term plan for town will my right hon friend ensure that it can have some investment from the government and do he agree that some of the late national lottery heritage fund award to stoke on trent should definitely be invest there 
 my hon friend be a tireless champion for his local community i know that there have be considerable investment in his area over the past few year in plenty of way but he have make an excellent point about make sure that no miss out on the considerable resource that be be invest in stoke and i will ensure that the department for levelling up housing and communities take his concern very seriously 
 rise 
 order we be run way over time i appreciate it would be a great disappointment to member whose name be on the order paper if they be not call so i be try my good to call they all but may i please make a plea for brevity 
 when the prime minister be take a dip in his pool or be on the beach at his place in california he do not have to worry about swim in sewage the rest of we do not have it so good so why will he not back labour ’s plan for criminal liability for water company boss who fail to clean up their act 
 we have already bring in regulation that ensure there can be unlimited fine for water company and there have be dozen of criminal prosecution i would also say however that when we have a debate in the house on exactly a plan that would do all this who do not show up to vote it be the labour party 
 in recent week i have see at hand the extraordinary work conduct by specialist care staff in accident and emergency unit as politician we be often guilty of use the nhs as a political football but when it become personal be   remind that what we have in the uk be very special will the prime minister join i in thank our superb nhs staff in bracknell across berkshire in neighbour basingstoke and frimley park hospitals and beyond 
 nhs staff be at the heart of what make our health service work there would not be an nhs without they without their skill their expertise and their dedication i be delighted i could pay they my thank last week in person i join my hon friend in thank nhs staff not just in his constituency but across the country for their dedicated hard work and public service 
 it be now year since bishop james jones publish the hillsborough report and only today finally do we get the government ’s response when will the government introduce not just a voluntary charter an independent public advocate or a code of ethical policing but a full hillsborough law to force those in public office to co operate fully with investigation and to guarantee fair funding to enable those affect by a major tragedy to challenge public institution 
 as i have say i be profoundly sorry for what the hillsborough family have be through and my right hon friend the justice secretary will be make a full statement immediately after pmq 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests have work as a junior doctor i understand that it be a demanding job and have sympathy with the challenge they face however the strike that be plan for the festive period threaten public safety and will delay treatment cause patient suffer in the pursuit of more money for oneself be in my view morally indefensible what concrete step be the prime minister take to prevent the strike and will he bring forward minimum service legislation to protect patient in case they do go ahead 
 my hon friend make an excellent point and speak from a position of experience on this issue the government have now reach settlement with every other part of the public sector include most recently consultant and i be grateful to they for their constructive engagement with the government the junior doctor be take action in the face of a recommendation from an independent body of a pay rise on average the high increase across the entire public sector the government have go beyond that in conversation with they but they have still decide to take damaging strike action it be wrong and that be why we have introduce minimum service level to ensure that we can guarantee a safe level of care for patient across the nhs it would be good to hear from the labour party at some point whether they will get off the fence condemn these strike and back these minimum service law 
 universal credit be break constituent tell i that the department for work and pensions be refuse to reimburse her childcare payment because it be day late due to a phone be break she be down £ and be   unable to pay for childcare she have lose her job and will likely have to move house with week to go before christmas she be extremely anxious and distressed do the prime minister realise the real consequence for real people of this break system 
 i be sorry to hear about the circumstance of the hon lady ’s constituent if the hon lady write to i i will make sure that we get specific support in place for her constituent and ensure that she can access what she need when it come to universal credit i strongly disagree with the hon lady it be only because of the action of my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   that universal credit be implement and the only reason we be able to get support to million of vulnerable people during the pandemic be that we have replace the legacy system with universal credit and that be oppose at every step by the labour party 
 it be always a pleasure to work closely with my right hon friend   the member for montgomeryshire craig williams   in deliver important project such as the llanymynech pant bypass on the border with north shropshire and today be another example of our partnership he be unfortunately unable to ask a question give his role as the prime minister ’s parliamentary private secretary so will the prime minister join i in highlight my right hon friend ’s work with the famers union of wales in organise the terrific celebration of montgomeryshire day in the jubilee room straight after question time 
 my hon friend be an excellent campaigner for his constituent as indeed be my right hon friend   the member for montgomeryshire craig williams it be fantastic to see these local project be deliver in their area and i be grateful to my right   hon friend for teach i how to pronounce pant llanymynech for my budget i be delighted to declare from the dispatch box that today be now officially montgomeryshire day and i look forward to everyone celebrate in the jubilee room straight after question time 
 i beg your indulgence briefly madam deputy speaker to wish my constituent who be attack in yesterday ’s serious incident in aberfan a speedy recovery i thank the emergency service and school staff for their swift and professional response 
 britain be get small on the world stage on this prime minister ’s watch his climate failure mean that our child and grandchild will bear the brunt of the cost his plan be undermine britain ’s energy security and bill be still sky high for work family yet he be hike the tax burden and real living standard be fall by more than tinker with a reset just do not compensate for year of failure do it prime minister 
 can i say that my thought be with the victim and her family after the awful incident that take place on the street of aberfan we wish they a full and speedy recovery and i join the hon gentleman in thank the emergency service for their immediate response 
 the hon gentleman talk about leave our child and grandchild with cost he be right to raise that because it be important that we do not do that the question then for he and the labour party be why do they want to embark on a green borrowing spree of £ a year that will just mean high taxis for our child and grandchild and high mortgage rate it be the same old story reckless borrowing and the british people pay the price 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i would like to make a statement on the government ’s response to bishop james jones ’s report the patronising disposition of unaccountable power’—a report to ensure the pain and suffering of the hillsborough family be not repeat and on the step we will take to respond to the point of learning contain therein 
 bishop james have do our nation a great service and his report be an exceptional piece of work i salute the hillsborough family for the assiduous care they have give to help to create the report and forge the response that flow from it i have the privilege of meet many of the family in liverpool in june this year alongside the former home secretary i be deeply move to hear of their experience and by the dignity with which they share they but perhaps even more affecting be their unflinche determination to make sense of the senseless and bring about change for other that be the true mark of compassion campaign selflessly for change know that nothing that any government can do will bring back their own love one or temper their grief 
 the hillsborough family have through their determined effort over decade create a lasting legacy a national legacy that be a tribute to their love one at the start of his report bishop james express his hope that 
 we might be a well nation for have listen to they 
 we be and they deserve the thank of our nation 
 i also pay tribute to those in this house who continue to campaign on behalf of the hillsborough family and for family bereave by other tragedy include   the right hon member for garston and halewood maria eagle   and the hon member for halton derek twigg for wirral south alison mcgovern and for liverpool west derby ian byrne i thank former member of the house who have give important support to the family include steve rotheram and andy burnham and i of course thank the former prime minister my right hon friend   the member for maidenhead mrs may i also thank glenn taylor for his vital work on the ongoing independent forensic pathology review 
 quite apart from its important recommendation bishop james ’s report lay bare the truly devastating experience of those bereave by the hillsborough disaster on   april an unimaginable tragedy unfold innocent man woman and child ultimately lose their life hundred more be injure and traumatise by what they see but for hillsborough ’s bereaved and survivor that terrible day be only day of an endure ordeal and in the day and decade thereafter it become clear that they suffer a double injustice there be the abject failure of the police and other at the ground to protect their love one failure describe in lord justice taylor ’s report as 
 blunder of the magnitude 
 then they face year of unforgivable institutional defensiveness 
 secondly the hillsborough family and survivor suffer what can only be describe as cruelty as innocent fan be cynically blame for their own death but that as be later to become clear be a web of lie spin   by those seek to protect their own reputation i emphasise that point because although the disaster may have be more than year ago such baseless narrative inexplicably persist in some quarter today so let i take this important opportunity to restate what be not a matter of opinion but unassailable fact fan attend hillsborough stadium on   april   bear absolutely no responsibility for the death and injury that occur in make that statement i echo what be say year ago by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead at this dispatch box when she read out the full finding of the inquest namely that man woman and child be unlawfully kill 
 since then andrew devine who suffer life change injury at hillsborough pass away on   july become the fatality of the disaster i would like to place on record my deep sympathy to mr devine ’s family and friend and indeed to all those who lose love one 
 the government ’s response to bishop james ’s report have be a long time come too long for some of that time it be necessarily hold back to avoid prejudice the outcome of criminal trial but there have be delay since and i recognise that this have only compound the pain of the hillsborough family and survivor the government apologise for that 
 as the house will be aware the government ’s response follow that of the police which be publish in january this year today the chief coroner be also publish his response which relate to his leadership role regard the coronial service collectively these response address the point raise by bishop james but this do not stop here we will of course continue to listen to the family of those involve in all major incident and to their concern 
 bishop james ’s report contain point of learn while he say that he consider each to be vitally important he be clear that in particular be to use his word crucial so let i turn to those he propose the creation of a charter for family bereave through public tragedy bishop james make it clear that he want to 
 help bring about cultural change 
 through commitment to change 
 relate to transparency and act in the public interest 
 it be worth reflect that in set out point of learn regard the hillsborough law which i will come on to bishop james say that he have draw heavily on that law ’s principle in the drafting of the charter so it be worth take a moment to consider the language of that charter it commit signatory the leader of public body to strive to place the public interest above the reputation of their own organisation to approach all form of public scrutiny include public inquiry and inquest with candour in an open honest and transparent way and to avoid seek to defend the indefensible 
 the deputy prime minister have today sign what will be know as the hillsborough charter on behalf of the government other signatory to the charter include the national police chiefs council on behalf of all police force the college of policing the crown prosecution service the national fire chiefs council and other we want the charter to become part of the   culture of what it mean to be a public servant in britain so the deputy prime minister will be write to all departments to ensure that everyone who work in government be aware of the hillsborough charter and what it mean for the way they work a reference to the charter will also be add to the central induction to the civil service for all new joiner the hillsborough charter and bishop james ’s report have also be add to the curriculum for every recruit who join the police this charter will now be embed in our public life 
 the crucial point of learn from bishop james ’s report be what he describe as the press need for the 
 proper participation of bereaved family at inquest 
 inquest be and foremost about answer question who where when and how an individual have die however as bishop james highlight the hillsborough family be let down by the very process that should have give they answer during the inquest and they then have to endure a which have be order by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead at the inquest the family be force to fund their own legal representation with a single barrister between they 
 we recognise that proper involvement in an inquest will in appropriate case mean that bereaved family should get legal representation especially when the state be represent that be why change have be make such that have the hillsborough tragedy happen today the family would have be eligible for free legal aid through the exceptional case funding scheme the government be determined to make this process as straightforward as possible which be why in january the ministry of justice remove the mean test for representation in relation to ecf case and in september the mean test be remove for legal advice at inquest we want to build on this progress so i can announce today that we will consult on an expansion of legal aid for family bereave through public disaster where an independent public advocate be engage i will come back to that or in the aftermath of a terrorist incident 
 i acknowledge that bishop james talk broadly about the proper participation of bereaved family at inquest where the state be represent we will seek to far understand the experience of these individual and i would welcome a conversation with bishop james on that early in the new year 
 we support the principle raise in bishop james ’s report that public body should not be able to spend limitless public fund on legal representation that be why we have for the time set out a requirement on government departments to 
 consider the number of lawyer instruct bear in mind the commitment to support an inquisitorial approach 
 we will now go on to set out that central government public body should publish their spend on legal representation at inquest and inquiry reaffirm that this spend should be proportionate and never excessive 
 we have also publish a set of principle to guide how public body should instruct lawyer at inquest these include a requirement to approach the inquest   with openness and honesty and to keep in mind that the bereaved should be at the heart of the inquest process we will also publish guidance to set the clear expectation that central government public body must instruct their lawyer in accordance with the principle of the hillsborough charter because how lawyer engage with the inqu process and with the bereaved family matter 
 i shall turn to the of bishop james ’s crucial point of learn a duty of candour for police officer as he describe it there be 
 a gap in police accountability arrangement 
 for officer who 
 fail to cooperate fully with investigation into alleged criminal offence or misconduct 
 that be why a new offence of police corruption applicable to police and national crime agency officer be introduce in punishable by up to year imprisonment in we update the police conduct regulation to introduce a new duty to co operate for individual officer during investigation and inquiry failure to do so can result in disciplinary sanction include dismissal last month we introduce legislation to place an organisational duty of candour on police through the criminal justice bill we will place a duty on the college of policing to issue a code of practice for ethical policing and for that code to include a duty of candour this duty be design to promote a culture of openness honesty and transparency and chief constable will be hold to account for their force performance against the code the new code of practice have be lay in parliament today 
 we want to go beyond the police to consider healthcare setting too in response to recent concern about openness in those setting we will be conduct a review into the effectiveness of the exist duty of candour for health and social care provider the term of reference for that have be publish today 
 i be aware that the hillsborough law call for a duty of candour on all public authority since the hillsborough disaster a comprehensive framework of duty and obligation have develop which cover public official and the different official proceeding such as inquest and inquiry in central government the civil service code require civil servant to act with honesty and integrity a breach of the code can result in a range of sanction include dismissal this sit alongside the nolan principle provide that 
 holder of public office should act solely in term of the public interest 
 secondly the legal framework surround criminal investigation statutory inquiry inquest and most other formal proceeding require that all individual regardless of whether they be a public official co operate with they for example there be a duty of candour in judicial review which amount to a duty on public authority to lay card face up on the table when it come to inquiry importantly these carry the potential for custodial sanction prison sentence in plain english 
 thirdly where a public official demonstrate a lack of candour and where this form part of their duty as a public office holder they can potentially be guilty of misconduct in public office which be a criminal offence we will keep these change under review to ensure that we achieve that culture of openness honesty and candour and we will not rule out take further action if it be need 
 today the government respond to all point of learning but i have focus this statement on those that bishop james describe as crucial very meaningful progress have be make but we will not hesitate to go far if require the discussion will continue and the government have commit to another debate in the new year to ensure that that dialogue progress i would also be happy to meet the hillsborough family should they wish to discuss any aspect of the government ’s response 
 finally i turn to improvement in the justice system bishop james make it searingly clear that the justice system which should have support victim and the bereaved after the tragedy be not set up to do so our response set out the step this government have take to ensure that bereaved family and survivor in the immediate aftermath of a public tragedy be guide through what can be a difficult complicated and forbidding process through the victims and prisoners bill we have introduce legislation to enable an independent public advocate once establish the ipa will be a strong voice for victim the bereaved and whole community affect by major incident the ipa as promise by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead will make sure that those affect by major incident know their right can access support service and have their voice hear at inquest and inquiry its design have be inform by the very difficulty that the hillsborough family face and our commitment to make sure that other family do not suffer the same injustice that can include hold public body to account for their commitment to abide by the hillsborough charter i be also grateful for the contribution of some of the family of victim of the grenfell tower fire and of the manchester arena bombing tell we what would have help they most in the aftermath of those terrible event 
 after listen to concern of the hillsborough family set out so powerfully when i meet they early this year as well as contribution from colleague across the house i be look at the right hon member for garston and halewood here i decide that we must go far by establish a permanent ipa it be vital that the ipa can be deploy as soon as possible after disaster strike and that they have time in advance to be as prepare as possible a permanent advocate will be able to advise the government on their response to major incident such as any subsequent inquiry or review and will ensure that the view of family be hear importantly they will also report independently to government about the experience of victim and bereaved family as well as publish an annual report all such report will be lay before parliament 
 the hillsborough family have be unrelenting in their pursuit of justice and bishop james have do essential work to support the family and have faithfully discharge the commission put upon he by the then home secretary and former prime minister to capture their perspective so that it be not lose follow the inquest today be therefore an important day it do not provide closure for the family of course as bishop james himself write 
 there can be no closure to love nor should there be for someone you have love and lose 
 grief be indeed a journey without a destination but today be a milestone on that journey it be a moment i hope when family will feel able to pause and take   quiet pride in the enormity of what they have achieve not for themselves but for other for the british people but i hope they will serve to cement and strengthen the hillsborough family legacy the change they have make to benefit an entire nation and to help ensure that never again can our people be so betray by the very organisation and institution mean to protect they i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be customary to thank the government for advance sight of the statement but give the gravity of this matter the fact that the report be respond to have be with the government for many year and the length of the secretary of state ’s statement this morning i be disappointed to have receive the copy of his statement much later than be customary 
 to describe the event of   april   as far reach be wholly inadequate to say that they be tragic miss the point the name hillsborough stand to this day as an indictment of institution individual and an entire culture in which transparency accountability and even simple human compassion be absent i be a child in when people die at hillsborough stadium in the bad sporting disaster in this nation ’s history year later alongside thousand of other law student i learn about the shockwave that the event of that day be still send through our court to the continue pain of the family that include the death in of the victim year old anthony bland who spend year in a persistent vegetative state before a court make legal history by agree that it be in his good interest to withdraw his feeding tube let we not forget that it be just year ago that the disaster claim its victim year old andrew devine who have live with a serious brain injury for more than decade it have now be year and to say that justice delay be justice deny would be a significant understatement in this context it be simply unendurable for any family to be make to wait this long for justice 
 i wish to echo the word of the secretary of state by pay tribute to bishop james jones to the many campaigner both inside and outside this house who have work for so long to establish the truth and above all to the bereaved family they have go beyond what anyone should have to endure to secure justice not only for their love one but for the victim of future disaster they be an inspiration and i speak for the whole house in say that all of we here know the debt we owe to all of they 
 i turn to the detail of the remark by the secretary of state the purpose of the government ’s response must be centre on the experience of the family just as bishop james ’s report be to ensure that their suffering be remember and crucially be never repeat that be the commitment that the opposition too make we will work to ensure that the government ’s proposal deliver meaningful justice we welcome the commitment to consult on expand legal aid for family bereave in a public disaster but there be nothing in what we have see from the government to date that go as far as we believe be necessary to require public authority to act with candour and transparency 
 to the public a duty on all public body to be forthcoming with the truth be a basic requirement if justice be to be do in the wake of terrible event that scar community and change life forever many will be shock to hear that this do not already exist as a matter of law the hillsborough law now campaign which as the government know include bereaved family who be still fight for accountability year later have tell we that without an effective duty of candour in place the risk be that reform will simply add another layer of bureaucracy to what victim must already endure it be for this reason that over a year ago the leader of the opposition commit to a hillsborough law that would and foremost impose a legal duty on public institution public servant and official to act in the public interest and with transparency candour and frankness when there have be a major incident 
 the secretary of state know that we have seek to amend his recent bill to introduce that more effective duty of candour during its passage through parliament but it be an approach that the government have so far reject we will continue our effort in that regard because the government ’s requirement for a code of ethic be not enough 
 we also welcome the commitment to a standing independent public advocate and have support the change to the victims and prisoners bill however as the secretary of state know we also believe and have say to he repeatedly that the duty of candour be the miss piece and it be vital to add it to make effective the change that have be introduce in respect of the independent public advocate 
 this issue be above party politic but we have a duty to say to the government that what they have announce do not yet go far enough they must deliver on that vital promise that what happen in and have continue to happen to the family for year will never happen again 
 i thank the hon lady for her response and i shall seek to address each point in turn 
 on the issue of legal aid we absolutely accept that in this particular case there be a manifest and completely unacceptable lack of equality of arm because it be treat as an adversarial process which be completely inimical to what the inquiry should have be design to get to the bottom of the culture be wrong in term of how the lawyer approach it and the equality of arm be non existent we have seek to address that in way in appropriate case that become adversarial because people be defensive as they have probably get something wrong it be necessary for the family to have the legal arm to take that on that be why if this happen today that funding would be in place this be not small amount of funding the total amount spend quite properly i have no complaint about this in the inquest be around £ this be a very significant change that have already be make as i say we be consult on whether we should go far still 
 the critical issue be of course about candour the importance of change the culture run through bishop james jones report like a message through a stick of rock across the house as the hon lady rightly point   out this be not a party political issue we must do everything possible to change that culture on the ipa it be important to note that in point of learn which be about the charter bishop james say 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to create an independent public advocate to act for bereaved family after a public disaster once a public advocate have be appoint i offer the charter to they as a benchmark against which they may assess the way in which public body treat those bereave by public tragedy 
 before go on to talk about the text of the charter we hope that it will play a very important part in embed that culture and hold people to account but this job be not over we continue to have the discussion and i look forward to engage with the hon lady about it 
 i thank the lord chancellor for his statement and welcome the government ’s response although like he i bemoan the fact that it have take so long to respond to this report not only do i commission it when i be in office but it report when i be still in office 
 what underpin the approach of the organ of the state at hillsborough be a desire to protect themselves and their reputation rather than serve the public they be there to protect or indeed search for truth and justice that attitude do not occur just on that day it have continue from those public authority through the decade since do my right hon and learn friend agree therefore that almost the most important point in the charter be that it require organisation to place the public interest above their own reputation what specific step will the government be take to ensure that that culture be instill across the whole public sector 
 as always my right hon friend get to the heart of the matter the critical and most important point in the charter be no 
 place the public interest above our own reputation 
 as my right hon friend have say those be word she have ask how they will be weave into the culture powerful example be that today the code of practice for ethical policing be be publish that code state in paragraph on page under the chapter head ensure openness and candour that 
 chief officer have a duty to ensure openness and candour within their force which will include the following implement the charter for families bereave through public tragedy see hillsborough stadium disaster lesson that must be learn 
 it will be there at the point of training for officer and induction for civil servant it be go to become part of the warp and weft of this country part of the culture of what it mean to be a civil servant in britain 
 as someone with great affection for the people of liverpool and merseyside i start by say that our thought be once again with the hillsborough family i join   the hon member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood   in her qualified thank for advance sight of the statement i be pleased that the lord chancellor thank and congratulate hon member as well as andy burnham and steve rotheram for their work in this area 
 i have question for the lord chancellor the chief executive of the college of policing have describe hillsborough as a touchstone for change but in the year since we have sadly see a familiar culture of cover up in relation to tragedy such as grenfell and the infected blood scandal the lord chancellor appear to accept the principle do he also accept that at some point the public will tire of hear about promise cultural change without visible action accompany it secondly no police officer have be discipline or convict of any offence relate to the hillsborough disaster do he agree that in case where it be prove that false evidence be give or inaccurate statement be make retrospective action up to and include prosecution must take place 
 finally part of the reason why the police be able to avoid full scrutiny around hillsborough for so long be irresponsible reporting of the disaster by section of the medium be the lord chancellor convince that reform in that area have go far enough or do he agree with many of we that more reform in that area be sadly need 
 i thank the hon gentleman for those helpful and pertinent question let i turn to the issue of the police yes it be thing to set the culture which i think it be reasonable to point out will now be weave into police training but accountability matter too thing that matter be that schedule to the police conduct regulations which of course post date the report include the follow police officer must be 
 honest act with integrity and not compromise or abuse their position 
 and 
 police officer have a responsibility to give appropriate cooperation during investigation inquiry and formal proceeding participate openly and professionally in line with the expectation of a police officer when identify as a witness 
 those standard be in the regulation their breach would provide a powerful case as the hon gentleman may think for dismissal or other suitable sanction 
 on the hon gentleman ’s point about retrospectivity plainly if evidence come to light about behaviour at the time it can be consider in the normal way i hope that he will be encourage by know that the offence of misconduct in a public office be be consider by the law commission with its usual and typical diligence and we will respond in the new year it be reasonable to observe that it have not operate as we might have like and be susceptible to reform we be give that very active attention 
 on the medium and irresponsible coverage my goodness the hon gentleman have a point i think that there still need to be a live conversation about whether thing have go far enough 
 the delay in the report have be unacceptable but it be absolutely no fault of my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor i thank he for his statement for its tone which be characteristically generous spirited and for the work that he have do to expedite it
