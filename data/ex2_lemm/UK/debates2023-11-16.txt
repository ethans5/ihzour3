 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of ai on the creative sector 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of ai on under represent group in the creative industry 
 i will endeavour to be succinct ai offer huge benefit and opportunity to the creative sector but it also bring challenge the government have engage extensively with the creative industry and other about it and will continue to do so 
 i thank the minister for his succinct response but as he know the select committee have call for the government to abandon the propose   copyright exemption for text and datum mining which the chief executive officer of uk music succinctly describe as a 
 green light to music laundering 
 can the minister confirm that the government will not undermine artist and musician by exempt ai datum mining from copyright restriction 
 as the hon gentleman be probably aware there be ongoing discussion between creative right owner and the platform and other through the intellectual property office but it have make clear that unless permit under licence or on exception make copy under text and datum mining will constitute copyright infringement 
 do the minister agree that the nature of ai system be such that when they be train on creative work both conscious and unconscious bias in music film and art against certain group in our society will be reinforce in generative output the government be seek a code of conduct on copyright and ai will they use this opportunity to address that issue and ensure that ai company take responsibility for protect against that type of harm be he consider an ai bill even though it be not announce in the king ’s speech 
 there be a great deal of work go on around ai to develop a framework of regulation as be originally set out in the white paper the hon gentleman ’s point about algorithmic bias be a serious it be be study by the centre for data ethics and innovation and obviously we will look very carefully at that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 people work in the creative industry have be completely let down by the tories include on real concern about the impact of ai the government have not respond to the consultation on their own ai white paper or the report on ai and the creative industry they have not get to grip with the issue at all creative people need to know whether they will be properly reward for their incredible talent now and in the future when will the government set out a proper plan to protect creator 
 the hon lady be new to her role and so may have miss the creative sector vision which be publish about month ago and set out an investment total some £ go into the creative industry over the next year a great deal of work be take place on the impact of ai on creative industry and we be hop to say more about that before the end of the year 
 that be just not good enough thank to the resilience and hard work of those in the creative industry they be grow fast than many other but it be people who make the good joy and the good culture not ai we be all well off when we draw on everyone ’s talent that be how we grow the creative industry with people from more diverse background in more job tackle ai be a fundamental part of that   to pick an example for the minister talent in the north represent just of employment in the creative industry under the tories so what be the government do to protect and increase that in the age of ai

 my right hon friend will be aware that many racegoer and people who work in a variety of job across the sector be concerned that increase affordability check could have a detrimental impact on british horseracing what assurance can he provide that affordability check will not be intrusive and that million of hard work brits will still be free to safely enjoy the great british tradition of a day at the race 
 i know that my hon friend have a keen interest in this area we absolutely recognise the relationship between bet and racing and have no intention of over regulating in fact it be the current system that be inconsistent and we want to bring some uniformity to it we have have several meeting with racing stakeholder the gambling industry and the gambling commission this week we have be very clear that we will not mandate check until we be confident that they be frictionless and that the majority of those who enjoy gambling safely can continue to do so while protect those who may enter gambling harm 
 a safe bet jim shannon 
 i thank the minister for his response the terrible weather condition in the last or week have have an impact on the horse- racing sector the race at down royal on the edge of my constituency be cancel because the flooding be of biblical proportion horseracing be very important to my constituent and many people be involve in it that have an impact on their ability to attend have the minister have discussion with other departments to ensure that any help that can be give to the horserace sector for those race that be lose be give 
 may i say what a pleasure it be to visit the hon gentleman ’s constituency a few week ago he be ask if i can do something about the weather i wish i could i understand the impact it might have i would be happy to discuss any specific issue relate to the racecourse he mention and to see whether i can talk to colleague in other departments about that

 i be pleased to visit south devon in august and to meet member of the great south west tourism partnership i be also pleased that cornwall and the isles of scilly have recently be accredit as a local visitor economy partnership and that devon be work with visitengland towards potential accreditation 
 as the minister know the tourism sector in our region be iconic but any rise in business rate bill that local hospitality business be require to pay could see many struggle while it be for the chancellor to set out tax change can he outline what representation he be make to the chancellor to freeze the business rate multiplier and extend the relief for hospitality for a further year 
 i discuss a range of issue affect tourism in devon with the great south west tourism partnership we cover a lot of ground and i know that those issue be of great importance to the tourism sector of course we be in regular dialogue with the treasury but it be a matter for the chancellor as my hon friend say

 journalist in conflict zone be put their life on the line to enable we to benefit from their accurate reporting my thought be with all of they and with the family and friend of those who have unfortunately lose their life i have raise support for journalist in conflict zone with the foreign commonwealth and development office 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer and for her understanding of the issue as so many news outlet be cut budget the reliance on freelancer report from conflict zone grow such reporter do not have a big corporate behind they to pay for their training their personal protective equipment and then their support and counselling when they come back a lot of good work be do here by the rory peck trust but it be desperately short of   resource will she speak to her colleague in government to see what more can be do to support freelancer through well funding for the rory peck trust 
 i be happy to speak to my colleague in government to understand how we can far support journalist we have lead a great deal of action recently and over a number of year to support journalist both here and abroad and we have set up a number of fund and taskforce to support they 
 when she plan to appoint an independent football regulator 
 what her plan timetable be for establish an independent regulator for english football 
 the government remain committed to put fan at the heart of football and to ensure that the game have a sustainable financial future the football governance bill be include in the king ’s speech and we intend to work closely with the football association the league and fan association to build the good independent regulator possible 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response my understanding be that while negotiation be take place between the premier league and the english football league there have not yet be agreement on redistribution of money be there anything she can do to bring the side together so that progress can be make on that very important issue 
 i understand my hon friend ’s concern it be really important that football come to a deal in relation to distribution i support he in encourage the football association to do so and i continue to urge they to reach an agreement in that area although our preference be a football lead solution give the importance of distribution to financial sustainability the independent football regulator will have target statutory power to intervene on financial distribution as a last resort if necessary if football fail to deliver a solution the regulator will deliver 
 like many people across the house i love football i always have do it be more than just a game it be the social fabric that run through community and it can make our weekend or break they but enough about united ’s current form the england manager gareth southgate have warn that the regulator be 
 another var wait to happen 
 with the government possibly look to solve complicated question with simple answer will the secretary of state explain how we will get this right and will she ensure that the regulator be implement swiftly so that more club do not go the way of bury in the meantime 
 i understand the hon member ’s concern bury have suffer in the past as have many other club across the country that be why we be bring in a   regulator i have have a number of conversation with the league my parliamentary colleague and fan to make sure that we get the regulation right we commit in our manifesto to bring forward a fan lead review white paper we have do so and we be at a very advanced stage have announce the football governance bill in the king ’s speech i note that labour do nothing in its year in office

 there be concern that the premier league make very late representation and try to water down the power of the regulator will the secretary of state say what the government ’s response to that intervention by the premier league be 
 we want to ensure that we get the regulator right it be essential that we protect fan and bring forward the legislation that the labour party fail to bring forward the legislation will strike absolutely the right balance between protect fan and ensure that our premier league and our football remain a competitive world class sport across the globe 
 we now come to the shadow minister 
 football club be more than business they be at the heart of community up and down the country but too many club be be push to the brink leave fan from scunthorpe to read worry that their club might be damage beyond repair by the time a regulator be bring in will the secretary of state update we on what immediate action and interim measure the department be take to ensure that an independent regulator for football be ready to go as soon as new legislation be pass

 whether the church of england be take step to support parish experience antisocial behaviour and drug relate crime in and around church building 
 the church of england be proud to have a presence in every part of the country but sadly that mean that our church and clergy be sometimes target in unpleasant way work with the police and local authority the church recognise that it have a duty of care to all its staff and it will always do everything it can to protect and assist they 
 it be right that parish church offer a beacon of hope and light to those go through the dark tunnel of addiction reach out the hand of christian fellowship but that can result in both clergy and church building be target by dark force who see that as a threat to their trade what further step do my hon friend believe diocese could take to ensure the personal safety of all involve

 what step the church of england be take to support asylum seeker and refugee

 i be very happy to congratulate those in the diocese of gloucester and thank they for the pioneering work that they be do on housing and i also thank my hon friend for the important leadership role he play locally in respect of that extremely important issue he be right to suggest that what gloucester be do have a wide application for other in need of emergency housing not just asylum seeker and refugee vitally important though that provision be i share his view that the need be urgent and that we should get on with this and other similar excellent initiative as quickly as possible 
 what step the church of england be take to support its parish ministry 
 parish ministry be at the very heart of the church ’s mission the church commissioners be distribute £ between and to support our mission and ministry this be a increase on the previous year period and a significant share of that funding will be distribute through diocese to strengthen our parish 
 what can the church hierarchy do to remove administrative burden from the clergy so they can spend more time in their community spread the good message ever tell the gospel of jesus christ 
 i think we all recognise that in any position of public responsibility there come a need for some administrative work but i very much agree with my hon friend that we should be free up our clergy and parish staff as much as possible to interact with their parishioner and to spread the good news of jesus christ as someone say the gospel be good news only if it be not too late i also note the tremendous work be do in his community by st john the evangelist in balby and indeed by many other church in his local area 
 last saturday i be privileged to attend the enthronement of the new bishop of lincoln at which there be a vast array of clergy in all their finery it be a very grand occasion lincoln be a predominantly rural diocese and many of the clergy serve or more parish can my hon friend reassure i that the church will focus on provide more clergy to rural area 
 i be delighted that my hon friend be able to attend the consecration of the new bishop of lincoln consecration be indeed very splendid affair 
 my hon friend be completely right that the beat heart of the church of england be what go on in the parish rural area really matter as do every part of the country i assure he that we will not forget rural area and i recognise the problem of large benefice

 the hon member for broxbourne represent the restoration and renewal client board be ask 
 if the board will take step to support the development of skill and creation of opportunity for woman in construction through the restoration and renewal programme 
 before i answer the question mr speaker can i say how nice it be to see the former clerk of the administration committee by your side our loss be your gain we always know he would go far and i be sure he have far to go 
 the r&r programme be commit to embed equality diversity and inclusion so that people from all background work on the programme can thrive although the main construction work be still set to be some year away the delivery authority be establish or explore relationship with skill and training provider across the whole uk that support initiative to promote woman in the construction industry the programme also actively support a number of awareness initiative that encourage woman into construction and engineering 
 it be welcome that during the work on the elizabeth tower it be a common sight to see woman in hard hat work on the scaffolding and other part of that important high profile work as we move through the restoration and renewal work it have be my observation that woman in hard hat be more likely to be see direct traffic around the estate than undertake this crucial frontline construction work 
 will my hon friend meet i and kath moore the excellent chief executive of women into construction to make sure that woman be at the heart of the high profile construction work be undertake on parliament ’s restoration and renewal programme 
 of course i will meet my hon friend and kath moore but before that my hon friend and i shall sit down to work up a list of other people for kath moore to meet so that she can have a really constructive engagement as woman into construction ’s representative across the house i would also like to invite she to come to the administration committee to talk about the work of her organisation interruption 
 i be just watch the clock tick 
 i also want to say what an honour it be to be answer question on behalf of the restoration and renewal client board in addition to the commission fabulous body lead by you mr speaker

 monday november conclusion of a debate on the autumn statement 
 tuesday november reading of the criminal justice bill 
 wednesday november remain stage of the data protection and digital information bill 
 thursday november general debate subject to be confirm 
 friday december the house will not be sit 
 i thank the leader of the house for give we the business 
 i thank all those who ensure that armistice day and remembrance sunday constituency event pass off safely 
 i want to ask the leader of the house about issue before the ink be even dry on the king ’s speech the prime minister have announce emergency legislation you could not make it up the supreme court ruling against the government be as damn as it be clear it conclude that deep and institutional issue in rwanda make it not a safe country that should not have come as a surprise to the government because they have be warn for month the prime minister bet the house that he would win and he lose before his new legislative programme have even get under way we have more desperate wheeze to salvage his sink plan a new treaty which could take week of parliamentary time to ratify and new law which a former supreme court judge brand discreditable why do the home secretary not say anything about that to parliament yesterday it be yet another announcement to the medium and not to this place 
 will the leader of the house tell we more about how this be all go to work what legal effect will this emergency legislation have when will we see it how much parliamentary time do she think this be all go to take what will be drop from the government ’s recently announce bills to make way for this if the government be so confident that this be what it will take why do they not do it month ago instead of sit around wait for this judgment as though parliament have not spend week and week consider these issue and legislate to deal with they the   government could have amend the illegal migration act instead could they not or be the former home secretary right when she say that the government 
 fail to prepare any credible plan b 
 be the new home secretary right when he say yesterday that he do not see a case for come out of international agreement or do the leader of the house agree with the prime minister that we could do so these be desperation tactic to try to make the government look as though they be do something when the truth be that this be a fail unworkable and costly plan that leave their pledge to stop the boat strand 
 secondly the prime minister seemingly could not find a suitable candidate to be foreign secretary from among his own mps and instead appoint david cameron to the house of lords at a time of war in europe a horrify conflict in israel and gaza and threat from china iran and elsewhere elect members here be now unable to hold the foreign secretary to account i agree entirely with you mr speaker that this house must be able to scrutinise his work effectively because let we be honest there be a lot to hold he accountable for his link with china which the intelligence and security committee say may have be engineer by the chinese state his policy towards china famously drink pint with president xi and hail a golden era and his involvement with greensill capital which be describe by the treasury committee as a significant lack of judgment but none the less make he personally million of pound rich the government proposal that the minister for development and africa   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell will stand in be entirely insufficient 
 the last time the house be in this situation conservative members be furious and demand that question must be answer in this place the then labour government be set to bring in the recommendation of the procedure committee at the time do the leader of the house agree that we should immediately dust off that report and bring forward a motion to put its recommendation in place quickly they include regular accountability session for the foreign secretary in westminster hall as a starter will she do that before we be next due to hear from the foreign secretary 
 finally can the leader of the house confirm whether the appointment of david cameron have be approve by the independent adviser on ministerial interest if not when will that be do or be this another case of make the wrong call such as when the prime minister appoint his deputy prime minister his home secretary and his minister without portfolio all of whom face serious allegation that later lead to their departure this be another poor judgment from a weak prime minister drift to defeat 
 i agree with the comment that the hon lady make about armistice day and remembrance weekend i thank all member who take part in event around the country and overseas to commemorate and thank our servicemen and woman and to remember the fall i particularly thank the police who have an incredibly difficult job on their hand in london at the weekend 
 it be a gift that every of we in this place can raise issue in debate via amendment and other device as a member and as leader of the house i will always   defend that right but it do not absolve we from think through the consequence of course of action over another the debate last night show the house include its main party and the bulk of members unite in its support for israel ’s duty to protect her people an end to suffer for all civilian and a long term peaceful solution 
 since the vote last night i know some member have come under increase stress no matter which way people vote it will have be a consider decision no matter whether people agree with they or not it be their duty to exercise their own judgment today all member should think about what they can do to defuse such threat make against our colleague in this place 
 i thank mr speaker for his care in ensure we can go about our business and do our duty i thank the family of those hold hostage by hamas for their time come into parliament this week to talk to parliamentarian i know i speak for all here when i say that we will do all in our power to bring they home 
 turn to the question raise by the shadow leader of the house her point be about rwanda she will expect i to say that further business will be announce in the usual way but as she will have hear from the prime minister we want to introduce this legislation swiftly it be part of a plan of action that he have set out and that have be work on by the home office and other departments together with the large ever small boat deal with france a new agreement with albania which have already return nearly people in the last month and cut albanian small boat arrival by more than an almost increase in the number of illegal work raid a triple in the number of asylum decision since the start of the year a plan to close the asylum hotel and the legislation that we have bring forward 
 there be many point of difference but key difference be that we believe there must be a deterrent element to our response the hon lady ’s party vote time against the legislation that we have bring forward and opposition members also support block the deportation of foreign criminal the people of this country want our border to be protect and control they want to ensure that we be free and able to help those we wish to and have the great obligation to under the last labour government the mode of illegal travel here be largely haulage we end that brexit have also give we many more option to shape who come here legally 
 we must end the scourge of these appalling people trafficker my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   and my right hon and learn friend   the member for fareham suella braverman assist by my hon friend   the member for corby tom pursglove my right hon friend   the member for newark robert jenrick   and other have help we thus far and i thank they for all the work that they have be do it have be difficult work there be more to do but we be a step close to the deterrent that we seek i urge the shadow leader of the house to support we in our effort we will introduce legislation it be quite normal as she know to do that even if it be not include in the king ’s speech there be many potential situation for that to arise on a number of issue face parliament in this session 
 the hon lady raise the issue of the new foreign secretary a person who have do a tremendous amount on the last topic that she raise combat illegal migration   through his work with professor paul collier and the work that he have do on conflict state he be ahead of the curve on that issue and i think that he will make an excellent foreign secretary she be right that the house must be able to hold he to account this be not an unusual situation it have happen before with the noble lords mandelson adonis frost morgan and i think other 
 the hon lady should be reassure that mr speaker have take advice on the matter my understanding be that the procedure committee will be consult on the good way forward she allude to some of the option that may be require of the new foreign secretary who i know will want to be accountable to this house there be very important matter in front of we next year will be an unprecedented year for election across the world with significant consequence for this nation and an ever- increase set of complex issue that i know all hon member will want to question the foreign secretary on she have my assurance in that respect further business will be announce in the usual way 
 i call the father of the house 
 the house and my right hon friend will know of my personal and political interest in residential leasehold reform when might the leasehold and freehold reform bill come to the house and will she join i in give more publicity to the consultation modern leasehold restrict rent on exist lease which start a week ago and will last for another week the ground rent issue affect up to household most people do not know that the government be consider alternative for restrict it will she help to publicise that and say when the bill might be introduce so that the house can consider the issue 
 my hon friend who be very experienced have already provide a solution to part of his question by get that on the record and advertise it to all hon member i will certainly ensure that the secretary of state have hear of his particular interest he will not be surprised to hear i say that further business will be announce in the usual way but i shall endeavour to ensure that he be keep inform by the department of progress on the bill 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 people in scotland learn something this week however much we dislike and distrust this tory government it be nothing compare with how much they utterly loathe each other those letter email and whatsapp message show that they spend their time attack each other leave no time to help people struggle with the tory mortgage and rent bombshell or with rocket energy bill and no time to reduce nhs waiting list in england now approach or to cap food inflation which be still run at over they be way too busy fight like rat in a sack even their squalid unlawful rwanda scheme have fall apart 
 however i bring good news to the leader of the house to cheer she up news from a part of the uk where a government be get on with the job where not a single day have be lose in the nhs to industrial dispute where teacher be the well pay in the uk   where the scottish child payment be take ten of thousand out of poverty where the railway have be take into public ownership where there be free school meal for all pupil p1 to p5 where there be more gps per head than anywhere in the uk where those age and over get free bus travel along with our under-22 year old and where we offer free university tuition free prescription free eye test and free personal care to our old folk that be in scotland under the snp lead scottish government as the leader of the house know but her government have a cunning plan to make everything come good a new minister for common sense a wokefinder general to search out wake thinking and eliminate it the job be in the safe hand of someone who be allow to attend cabinet but be prohibit from speak in meeting and anyone who know the new minister know that a period of silence may be her and overwhelming challenge for some light relief in this very bleak week for her government could the leader of the house help many of her baffled colleague and try to give we her definition of wake 
 i be sure that you mr speaker would take a dim view of it if i refuse to answer the hon lady ’s question if i just stand here in silence because i do not fancy do it or object strongly to the content and tone of the question have i do that you might ask why i show up this morning if i be not prepared to do my duty in this house and to show respect to the house it would be a bit like attend at the cenotaph and not sing the national anthem 
 the hon lady display a distinct lack of self awareness i grow tired of read out to she each week statistic on the performance of her own government but since she invite i to again let i give she statistic that address the issue she raise in england the nhs month waiting list be down by since september and a doctor or a headteacher in scotland pay approximately £ more in tax i will continue to do my duty to this house and to remind the snp of their appalling record in government which be obvious to everyone except they 
 finally on all sort of issue that many would perhaps describe as woke this government have a proud record because we recognise that compassion and care for everyone in our society be very important that be why we do the large ever lgbt action plan from which we want practical measure that would make a difference to people ’s life conservatism to i have always be about the practical impact that we have on people ’s life and step up and take responsibility not just for ourselves but for other people give her background and life experience i think that my right hon friend   the member for tatton esther mcvey who will now sit at the cabinet table will be very good in that role 
 transition toward net and increase renewable energy be critical but we need a just transition i be conscious that constituent in suffolk coastal feel that a lot of the onshore infrastructure be be put in an unsuitable place when far down the coast at bradwell in essex there be an ideal brownfield site to accommodate it will my right hon friend find time for a debate perhaps it could be the general debate next thursday which be   yet to be announce in which we could discuss the importance of rewire the national grid 
 may i place on the record on behalf of everyone in this place i be sure our thank to my right hon friend for all the work she do in her former department i know she be incredibly passionate about that work go right back to when she be a junior minister in that department and she should be very proud of the many thing she enable to happen on her double watch i thank she for raise this issue in her constituency which i know she be very concerned about the secretary of state have make it a priority and be give it a lot more attention and focus and i shall make sure that she be aware of my right hon friend ’s particular interest 
 i call and congratulate the unopposed chair of the backbench business committee ian mearns 
 i be very grateful mr speaker i have have the privilege of be in that role since june although i have a funny feeling this will be my last term in it for a whole range of different reasons—[hon member no well the holder have to be a member of the opposition as we speak the committee can not yet meet but i understand that all political party have make or be make nomination to the committee of selection as soon as it agree the nomination the backbench business committee can get up and run again i hope that the meeting can take place as soon as   tuesday november if it can happen before then we certainly will try to ensure that it do i understand from the clerks that there be already a queue of application to be present to the committee we will try to get that all together as soon as possible 
 bus driver and other staff employ by go north east be on indefinite strike in a pay dispute they seek pay parity with their company colleague in the north west region the strike leave constituent almost totally stranded and unable to get to work place of study hospital and shop can we have a statement from the secretary of state for transport about his intention to bring an end to this dire paralysis in my gateshead constituency and across the wide north east region go north east provide bus service to a large part of the north east region and i be afraid to say it be no go at the moment 
 i add my congratulation to the hon gentleman on remain chairman of the backbench business committee and thank he for all the work he do in that respect i come here every week to this dispatch box with reason to vote conservative and he have furnish we with another because we do not want to lose he as chairman of that committee he have my assurance that we be committed to the swift establishment of the committee if that can not be do before the general debate subject to be announce that i announce in the business question we will take a steer from the topic that his committee have already look at 
 i be very sorry to hear about the disruption to the hon gentleman ’s constituent ability to travel he will know that that be a concern to this government it be reason why we have bring forward legislation to   guarantee minimum service level in area such as transport and emergency service it be incredibly important that industrial action particularly when it take place over long period of time do not disrupt people ’s life and cause they for example to lose their job as have be happen in other part of the country i urge he to reflect on whether he could support those measure particularly for specific sector that we will bring forward in this session 
 about year ago i have an unlikely campaigning role that involve organise counter demonstration to certain mass march but area we never have to worry about be the vicinity of parliament because no demonstration be allow in parliament square the reason give for that be that member must not be impede in enter or leave the houses of parliament even if demonstration continue to be allow in parliament square it should be a common concern to those on both side of the house that member find themselves get advice from their whip on which exit they can not use for fear of be mob by an unauthorised demonstration that come right up to the gate of parliament this really have go too far soon or later there will be an incident unless security on enter and leave the houses of parliament be restore 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this important matter it be quite right that members of parliament and their staff should be able to go about their business in safety and security and should not be disrupt in do so mr speaker be particularly concerned about this even prior to yesterday ’s incident and have be work with palace security and other organisation to ensure the safety of member of parliament in particular since the deputy speaker be in the chair i shall make sure that mr speaker have hear my right hon friend ’s concern and i will ask that my right hon friend be keep inform of progress on such matter 
 i be sorry to ask the right hon lady about this again because i know she be of the angel on this matter but when i ask she last summer about conversion therapy she promise a draft bill on the subject in the last session there be no draft bill and there be nothing in the king ’s speech the government say that be because this be very complicated it be not complicated load of country have measure on this and have have for year be the real reason as i have be tell that the minister for women and equalities herself be block this much need reform 
 the right hon gentleman will know that bring an end to these practice be a manifesto commitment it remain a manifesto commitment he will also know that this be a complex situation a lot of work have already be do particularly by faith group to enable idea and solution to be bring forward i thank all member who have engage on this particularly with the minister who lead on the issue to try to make progress the secretary of state be still look at the policy on this and she be very aware that the house will want her decision bring forward i know that she be take great care to ensure that we can protect people who might be vulnerable to these kind of barbaric practice 
 later today councillor garry perry from my constituency will be attend the local government information unit and ccla councillor award garry have be shortlist for a lifetime legend award in recognition of his dedication to build a safe strong green and more resilient community will my right hon friend join i in wish he all the good in the award later today 
 i do not know whether it be audible to those listening but there be chorus of approval from around the house i speak on behalf of all of we when i say to councillor garry perry thank you for your decade of service to your community our councillor be all unsung hero they do a tremendous amount of work and good in their community and i wish garry and all other nominee who have be short- list for these award good luck they have our thank 
 air pollution be an invisible killer over people in the uk die each year as a consequence of dirty air the clean air zone introduce in bath by the liberal democrat run council have reduce nitrogen dioxide by over a quarter which be an impressive achievement save life can we have a debate in government time about the importance of clean air and what the government can do to support local council 
 the hon lady raise a very important point she will know that this have be a focus for the government they have identify zone around the country that need improvement and ensure that local authority can put measure in place to address these matter this be an area where we can benefit from share good practice across the country it be important that we do these thing while still enable economic growth to flourish as we know we can i be sure that if she be to apply for a debate on the subject it would be well attend 
 can we have a debate on the failure of the metropolitan police to investigate an openly terrorist support socialist workers party pamphlet which have be report on in several newspaper entitle palestine resistance revolution and the struggle for hamas it have be on sale during the protest march every weekend in london and it include the line 
 we unconditionally support hamas when it be engage in military or non military struggle against israel 
 this poison have be on sale for week include i be tell right outside this house in parliament square do my right hon friend agree that the police should act under section of the terrorism act 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for raise this important matter it be extremely disturbing to hear that he will know that the police chief have our total backing in use the full extent of the law to crack down on any criminality and what he describe sound like it fall into that category the police have power to arrest those who belong to or glorify terrorist group such as hamas under the terrorism act and anyone who incite racial hatred under the public order act and we support they in   use those power i be afraid that the socialist workers be rentagob who show up to all kind of protest spout all kind of hate and deserve a close look 
 as the leader of the house may be aware i be co chair of the all party parliamentary group for access to medical cannabis under prescription currently young teagan appleby who be a constituent of   the hon member for dover mrs elphicke be in hospital in london and very poorly the former minister make every effort in his role to break down the barrier for medicinal cannabis under prescription to child with epilepsy will the leader of the house please urge the new minister to call a roundtable of all the stakeholder so that those child can get the medicine they deserve 
 i thank the hon lady and my hon friend the member for dover for the work they have be do on this issue i will certainly make sure that the new secretary of state have hear about the hon lady ’s comment today and be aware of her interest in this matter 
 i bring some sad news to the house this morning my conservative predecessor sir thomas arnold die on tuesday he be know to many on the conservative benches for his year of work a decade or so as chair of candidate he be the godson of ivor novello and as well as inherit the right to various of his musical he also inherit his piano he be quite a character and be a great support to i and give i much wise advice whether i always follow it be a different matter 
 as chair of candidate sir thomas oversee the and election and be responsible or indeed culpable for a number of member be in this house today his guide word be these 
 the conservative party be look for man and woman who have a good work knowledge of contemporary politic and a prove track record of experience who above all know their own mind 
 with those word in mind might the leader of the house be able to facilitate a debate so that we can all learn how party across the house can attract such candidate to be elect to this place 
 i be sure i speak for all member present when i say how sorry we be at that sad news and that our thought be with sir thomas ’s friend and family he achieve the only conservative gain in the election which be the time he stand for parliament he be parliamentary private secretary in the northern ireland office and later in the foreign and commonwealth office he be vice chairman of the party under peter brooke in and i be tell that the most enjoyable time he spend in parliament be when he head the commons treasury select committee which include an investigation into the downfall of barings bank he achieve a great deal for this country and we remember he and his service fondly hon member hear hear

 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter which i know be a concern for many member across the house we have give the police new and update power and we will continue to look at what further support they can be give to tackle this appalling situation there can be absolutely no tolerance for anyone who facilitate or support terrorism that be very clear and i think that view be share on all side of this house even if some member sometimes find it hard to articulate it 
 as   the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi   have say teagan appleby my teenage constituent be at the moment in intensive care across the road in the evelina london children ’s hospital my right hon friend will know from my question and her answer in june that it be an urgent matter for teagan to have support from the government to have fund for and access to her medicinal cannabis which she need to manage her epilepsy that meeting my right hon friend be kind in her support for it and her follow up with the department of health have still not happen 
 can i ask my right hon friend to pass another message to the health secretary to say not that we need another the meeting on this issue but that we need action and that we need the funding to be available to every single child who need access to this medicine now there need to be in the autumn statement a special fund set aside to allow these child to have access to the medicine they need teagan ’s mother emma could not do any more and she be heartbroken when she send i a message overnight at midnight that teagan be now intubated and that she have to be keep in that medical state to manage day of constant seizure 
 i be extremely sorry to hear what my hon friend have say i do appreciate that member across this house will have have experience in which we be very invest in the wellbeing of our constituent and i know this will be a very difficult time not just for teagan and her family but for my hon friend and other who have campaign on this issue

 i know that immediately after this session even though i will be in the chamber my official will contact the department of health and through my parliamentary private secretary will contact the secretary of state for health to make she aware of this situation we appreciate that we can not make clinical decision on behalf of   individual patient but what we can ensure be that if a drug or medical device could benefit a patient the system be in place to ensure that they get access to it even if it be not for a nice approve treatment people in this country still have that right we will facilitate an immediate meeting with the department of health and i will be keep inform of progress on this matter 
 scotland be energy rich in the last month alone scotland export mwh of electricity through the grid to england yet along with the people of north wales scots pay the high electricity cost in the uk londoner pay £ a year in stand charge before a switch or a gas hob be turn on but in the part of the uk where lighting and heating be turn on far early and turn off far later these standing charge be over higher at £ a year do the leader of the house really think that be fair and if not will she facilitate a debate on these unjust standing charge 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this point i think standing charge should get scrutiny from this house i know that many hon and right hon member will have concern in all part of the uk about fairness and how some charge be be apply i will make sure that the secretary of state for energy security and net have hear what the hon gentleman have say i be sure that if he be to apply for a debate it would be well attend 
 as we see in yesterday ’s king ’s speech debate some view on the gaza conflict be become dangerously oversimplified and binary someone be either in favour of a ceasefire or they be in favour of the war continue that be not just misleading it be also provocative will the government utilise a statement or hold a debate to confirm britain ’s position on support a humanitarian pause a position that be adopt by united nations security council resolution last night 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise that issue he have great experience in this area he be right and i think the view be express well last night that in call for a ceasefire what people have be ask be for israel to deviate from its duty to protect its citizen and defend itself if israel put down its arm it cease to exist that be the situation now and only the end of hamas or whatever might try to take their place and a long term solution that guarantee peace will enable it to do that that be very important we have a proud track record of protect international humanitarian law and protect citizen we monitor closely what go on not just with this situation but with other include the attention to detail and care that israel be take in ensure that it be the right side of that line my right hon friend will know that on recent operation the israeli defence forces will have have humanitarian and medical professional embed in its force to ensure that that happen i repeat what i say at the start of this question whatever hon member decide to do in this place base on their conscience they should be allow to do it we can all take care of each other in this place when hon member inevitably and sadly come under threat for do so

 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that important point i will certainly write to the secretary of state and to other secretaries of state who will have an interest to ensure that they have hear what he say i recently visit birmingham to show support to the jewish community there in the wake of some of the attack that they be have to endure i be strike by the fact that the local muslim community have come over to the hebrew centre to show support to condemn hamas and to stand with the jewish community in the wake of those attack when i inquire why they have do that they tell i that as well as be the right thing to do in the wake of when the muslim community have come under attack and be associate wrongly with those terrorist atrocity the jewish community come and stand between they and an angry mob to protect they what be often lose in the recent scene we have see be the decade of quiet work between different faith community who all believe in the same god 
 may i ask for a debate in government time on the scrutiny of financial service regulation since we leave the european union that have be undertake by a sub committee of the treasury committee we have appoint expert adviser we regularly take evidence on new consultation from the regulator and we have publish report to keep the house inform about that scrutiny for well over a year now 
 i be therefore a bit surprised yesterday to see that the liaison committee in the other place have publish a recommendation that it set up a financial service regulation scrutiny committee paragraph and of its report suggest that that committee would substantially duplicate and potentially contradict our and of course it would cost parliament a significant sum to set up 
 if the leader of the house be not able to spare government time to debate this important topic would she be kind enough to write to her counterpart in the other place to express the concern of our cross party membership that the propose committee would duplicate the work that we be already do and have thoroughly establish in this house 
 i thank my hon friend for her question madam deputy speaker be smile at i to remind i i think of my responsibility i can not ask   the other place to change its scrutiny arrangement it be responsible for those however my hon friend make a good point about economy of effort and i will certainly be able to make sure that the lords have hear what she have say today i hope that a way forward can be find that be in the interest of both chambers 
 despite there be constituency in the great county of leicestershire more than half of all the illegal migrant in hotel in the county be locate in just of they my constituent thank the government immensely for that enrichment of our life

 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this important point i be sure he have meet the home secretary about his point if he have not to date i would encourage he to do so i be sure that if we be to hold a debate on this matter it would be very well attend i would like to use government time to bring forward further legislation that enable we to get the rwanda scheme work and i hope that the hon gentleman would support that he will know that the minister for immigration have announce the closure of the wave of asylum hotel i do not know if any of those be in the hon gentleman ’s constituency but he will know that that be the tranche of several 
 yesterday more than member of this house and the other place meet under the auspex of the all party britain israel parliamentary group and witness the video of the true atrocity commit by hamas on   october rarely have i see member of this house and the other place so silent and so horrified 
 in contrast overnight the israel defence forces have facilitate the medium to enter the al shifa hospital the rantisi child ’s hospital and the nasser hospital all of which have be demonstrate to be command and control centre and weapon centre at the child ’s hospital there be clear evidence that hostage be keep there by hamas and have subsequently be move that be in direct contrast to what many people have see in the medium across the world from those people who support hamas 
 may we have a statement from the government probably from a foreign office minister in this place on exactly what be happen in term of progress in liberate gaza from hamas and the attempt be make by the idf to minimise civilian casualty as this terrible war continue 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important point he be correct that it be now clear that hospital and other civilian place have be use by hamas that be not news a report by amnesty international allege that the shifa hospital have serve   as a hamas interrogation and torture centre for some time to reassure the house members will know that the israel defence forces be do a huge amount and take great care with regard to civilian life as they do the very difficult job of clear these area out and try to destroy hamas and their network the idf transfer incubator baby food and additional medical supply to hospital compound and on sunday they open up additional humanitarian corridor from various hospital for civilian and patient to evacuate on foot if they could or via ambulance to the south
