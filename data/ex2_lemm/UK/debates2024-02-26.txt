the sub postmaster have no trust or faith in the compensation process be handle by the post office or the government today ’s commitment will still not deal with all the inequality in the scheme or the undue influence that the post office still have on the process echo the sentiment of some of my hon friend may i ask the minister to agree to place the compensation scheme into an external independent body completely outside the influence of the post office i ask the prime minister as my hon friend   the member for bethnal   green and bow rushanara ali   have ask about the timescale for the legislation to overturn the conviction but we still have not get an answer if it be not before the general election will it be before the summer recess finally when will people be hold to account for this miscarriage of justice be it within the government the post office or fujitsu 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to tackle knife crime in greater manchester 
 what step he be take to tackle knife crime in bournemouth 
 as we have say often in debate this house knife crime be a terrible crime it tear family apart and all too often take young people from we as the house will know violent crime overall have reduce by since but there be more we can do that include funding violence reduction unit manchester ’s vru have £ of funding for the come financial year and run hotspot police in area where serious violence and antisocial behaviour be a problem the £ of funding for that across england and wales be in addition to the exist police funding settlement 
 in september my constituent rhamero west be chase across manchester stab and kill he be just his mum kelly have work tirelessly to make sure that no other family have to face the suffering she and her family have face include by raise money to fund a network of bleed kit across greater manchester and a youth project in fallowfield she want to tell rhamero ’s story to help save other young life so will the minister agree to meet she 
 yes of course it sound as though the hon gentleman ’s constituent be campaign bravely as so many parent do to try to bring some good out of a terrible personal tragedy so i would be delighted to meet he and his constituent 
 may i quickly put on record my thank to the security minister and the policing minister for their effort in upgrade mps security 
 across the uk ever more young people be choose to carry knife sadly that be the case in bournemouth as well violence reduction unit be dedicate police unit that have a prove track record of reduce knife crime in town centre in other part of the country not just through increase policing but by work in the community include at school to educate youngster on the danger of carry a knife i be grateful for the increase in police number in dorset but will the minister ask the chancellor to see whether extra fund can be provide specifically for a vru for bournemouth 
 i will convey my right hon friend ’s request to the chancellor and i put on record my thank for his tireless campaigning and that of other dorset mps for resource for that county and its police force dorset police will receive about £ more next year than it receive the previous year thank to the campaigning of my right hon friend and other dorset mps it also receive an exceptional special grant last year of £ to help campaign against violence 
 my right hon friend be right to say that violence reduction unit have a very positive effect in the next financial year £ will be spend on they for the police force area judge to have the most significant   violence problem dorset be not among those but i will pass his message to the chancellor and i know that through our work with the police and crime commissioner dorset police and the pcc will do everything they can to combat knife crime not just in bournemouth but in dorset as a whole 
 i call the shadow minister 
 with incident up by since the public be look for leadership on knife crime early this month the government would not support our plan which include broaden the ban on zombie knife to include ninja sword an end to end review of online sale and criminal penalty for tech exec who allow their platform to be use for illicit sale the government reject our plan but what they have in place simply be not work so we will push again during the remain stage of the criminal justice bill will they accept it then 
 the shadow minister should be aware that accord to the crime survey of england and wales the only reliable long term indicator for volume crime trend accord to the office for national statistics violent crime be down by since he ask about online knife sale he should be aware that when the online safety act be fully in force very strong action will be take for example against online marketplace and the illegal sale of knife online will become a priority offence under schedule he will also know that we be bring forward legislation to ban a range of machete and zombie style knife we define they in relation to the feature they have for example knife over inch in length with cut edge and serration will be ban those be just some of the measure we be take all of which have help to bring down violent crime by since 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the criminal justice bill on police homelessness and rough sleeping 
 the government be commit to end rough sleeping huge amount of money be be invest in get people off the street rough sleeping level in england be low than they be in criminal sanction where rough sleeping be cause a problem for example for business be very much the last resort in the criminal justice bill the resort be give people the support they need to find accommodation 
 as i walk here today i pass several rough sleeper in doorway and in tent the police already have the ability to move rough sleeper on under a number of different piece of legislation include the public order act the anti social behaviour crime and policing act and the highways act do the minister understand my concern that what be suggest in the criminal justice bill criminalise rough sleeper and do nothing to help they the police already have the power but be fail to use they 
 the power in the piece of legislation my hon friend list be not precisely the same as those in the criminal justice bill the bill do not criminalise rough sleeping in general it criminalise particular type of rough sleeping when it cause a nuisance that say as i have signal privately to various hon member include my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken the government be willing to look at the way those provision be draft to ensure that they be tightly and narrowly draw because out intention be that the stop will always be to offer support criminal sanction be appropriate only as a last resort if rough sleeping cause a serious problem for example for business 
 as draft the bill be a new vagrancy act with bell on rough sleeping be up since rather than criminalise people who happen to be rough sleeping should we not provide support and build the house they need 
 as i say my colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities be provide extremely comprehensive package of support rough sleeping be down by since and by since before the pandemic in the government be willing to look at change to make these provision tightly define and narrow the intention be to use criminal sanction only as a last resort where rough sleeping be disrupt a business for example and prevent it from operate it be a last resort the resort will always be offer help and support 
 what step he be take to reduce level of legal migration 
 what step he be take to reduce level of legal migration 
 on   december the government announce a package of new measure to far reduce net migration include but not limit to stop overseas care worker bring family dependant increase the salary threshold for skilled worker visa to £ and raise the minimum income requirement for family visa in stage to £ the change be be introduce gradually from early and be not retrospective 
 i welcome the measure take to reduce abuse of the immigration system but i also recognise the need to exempt critical occupation where we have a specific shortage from the new minimum salary for example health and care worker however in the migration advisory committee ’s interim review of the immigration salary list publish on friday several occupation have be remove because a discount salary of around £ be well above the go rate for such occupation give the vital and grow importance of food security across the country will my hon friend commit to a review of those occupation which although not the high tech or highest pay job in our economy be none the less critical for our food sector and our rural and coastal community 
 there be no strong advocate for the fishing industry in this house than my hon friend he will appreciate that we have receive that return from the mac we will look very carefully at its recommendation but my hon friend know that as a government we have be consistently flexible in respond to the need of the fishing sector i would argue that there be more we can do to promote domestic employment but let i take this matter away and consider his representation 
 a key issue often raise by my constituent be the desire to see a dramatic reduction in legal migration bear in mind that the opposition appear to have no plan in that regard can my hon friend reassure i that he will look at new way to stop this migration that he will make sure that everybody have the right to work in this country and that we will not decrease wage by bring in cheap labour from abroad 
 my hon friend be very supportive of the holistic approach that the government be take on this issue the measure that we have announce and be take forward will reduce the inflow by it be important to consider this against the back to work plan that the department for work and pensions be deliver to encourage more people to take on these role domestically she should be absolutely certain that we as a government will deliver on these measure and will continue to keep they under review to see whether we can go far that stand in stark contrast to those on the opposition front bench who have no plan at all 
 to cut a long story short a constituent ’s skilled work visa application be mistakenly withdraw by the home office the error have result in he no long have the right to work in the uk force he and his wife to leave their job his wife be month pregnant and although they pay their nhs surcharge the home office error mean that they be again get healthcare bill the situation be increasingly desperate so i ask the minister to meet i to look into this case and ensure that this home office error do not do any more harm than it already have for this young couple 
 the hon lady will appreciate that i do not have the specific of the case to hand but if she kindly share they with i i will look into the case as a matter of urgency 
 i hope the minister will take this opportunity to recognise that the right to claim asylum be allow under international law and that therefore there be no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker on that basis perhaps he can tell we whether he or any minister have meet people with live experience of the system and whether he will meet the people at the maryhill integration network in glasgow north to discuss these issue 
 the hon member will recognise that in an answer to of his hon friend i say that i would be willing to meet he and his glasgow colleague to discuss some of the challenge i have make an undertaking to he that that meeting will happen and i will make sure that it happen at the early possible opportunity i be keen to understand what the challenge   be and to make sure that the support that we be provide to help facilitate move ons for example be meet the need that exist 
 i call the shadow minister 
 since our last home office question the list of government failure on immigration have continue to grow relentlessly asylum seeker stick in limbo unable to be process due to the prime minister ’s legislative fiasco visa award to a care home that do not actually exist net migration treble and criminal free to fly into our country undetected on private jet have just sack the independent inspector of border and immigration be the home secretary sit on different report by the inspector because he be check for typo or be it because he be utterly terrified of what those report will tell we about this government ’s shambolic and fail immigration system 
 let i answer that point very directly have give proper consideration to those report we will be respond to they as i say in the house last week we will do so very soon the shadow minister mention the government try to dodge scrutiny when it come to the general aviation report for example it be our official who ask the inspector to take it forward far from dodge scrutiny we have invite it in that area we will respond properly and thoroughly to that report in exactly the way that i undertake to do last week 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 people who come here to work study and live make a significant impact on scotland ’s economy and society so reduce their number be entirely self defeating reunite families uk have highlight the disproportionate impact that tory change to visa income threshold will have on woman i have ask the minister this before and i have yet to have an answer when will he publish the full equality impact assessment on this damaging policy 
 we will publish the equality impact assessment associate with the policy in due course the hon lady will appreciate that the government ’s position be clear that the current level of net migration be not sustainable we need to take forward a set of policy measure that deal with that and that promote domestic employment wherever possible there be a strong moral case for the approach that we be take none of the measure be apply be retrospective but we be convinced that this be the right thing to do the british people think that action be need and action be what they be get 
 i spend a lot of time this weekend with member of the glasgow branch of the association of ukrainians in great britain which put on a major demonstration and a service in glasgow cathedral at the weekend to mark year since the escalation of russian aggression in ukraine the government ’s change to the ukraine scheme come with very little notice and cause a great deal of uncertainty and distress in that community will the minister tell i whether for example   a wife whose husband have be injure fight on the frontline against putin ’s war machine will be able to sponsor her husband to come here under these restrict rule 
 as we say when we debate this issue in the house last week the government be very proud of the amazing response from people across this country who have open their home to ukrainian refugee there will continue to be an out of country route through the homes for ukraine scheme to facilitate people be able to come here from ukraine ukrainian refugee here in the uk will be able to extend their visa we give that certainty way ahead of the curve when compare with our international partner ukrainian national who would have qualify under the ukraine family scheme will still be able to apply under home for ukraine 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of step take by his department to tackle transnational repression by hostile state 
 i thank the hon lady for her question she be aware that the government be continually assess the potential threat to individual right and freedom and to safety across the united kingdom i thank she for the effort she make to represent her view to i in a different forum 
 whenever we identify such threat we will always use every measure at our disposal include our intelligence service to mitigate any threat to individual in the instance i urge anyone concerned for their safety to contact the police the hon lady will no doubt be aware that the national security act include measure to tackle foreign interference include transnational repression the defend democracy taskforce be review the uk ’s response to develop our understanding of the issue and ensure a system wide response 
 transnational repression to silence dissent in democracy be extremely serious in recent month eyes nation have raise concern about the action of agent with link to india target sikh activist in the united kingdom most disturbingly there have be allege assassination and foiled assassination plot the us and canadian authority have take the lead at senior level to publicly call out this challenge to their sovereignty the rule of law and their democratic value give the report of british sikhs face similar threat what step be the government take to secure their safety will the minister show the same strength as our partner do in publicly defend their democratic right 
 let i be completely clear if there be any specific threat against any british citizen by any foreign power we will take immediate action the sikh community should be as safe as every other community in the united kingdom all british citizen be equal whatever their colour creed faith or political allegiance the reality be that we have take all the action we believe be appropriate at this stage we of course maintain a very close relationship with our eyes partner and we be absolutely clear that if the situation change and we need to take action we will do so 
 russia ’s deadly poison attack in salisbury iran ’s intimidation of iran international journalist and china ’s secret police station have long show the need for a robust strategy to counter transnational repression on british soil the minister mention that a review be under way into the uk ’s approach to transnational repression when will it be publish and will it be part of a wide strategy to counter hostile state activity in this country 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question the review be under way and it include many different element from community from around the world who be now settle happily in the united kingdom he will understand why i will not go into individual detail certain community have be target such as the hong kong chinese community which be now very welcome in the united kingdom under a policy that this government introduce i be very proud of the number who have claim asylum and take the opportunity as british national overseas to settle here and we be look at other we be open to any report of transnational repression and we be listen 
 what step his department be take to identify young people most at risk of be draw into violent crime 
 what step his department be take to identify young people most at risk of be draw into violent crime 
 since we have invest £ in violence reduction unit across england and wales and a furth £ have be commit this year violence reduction unit have reach more than young people they bring together specialist from health the police local government and community organisation not just to tackle violent crime but to identify the young people who be most at risk of be draw into it and provide evidence base intervention to support they 
 i be grateful for that answer child as young as be be recruit by local drug dealer in the central ward of stockton and be provide with pocket money huge sum for they to carry and deliver class a and class b drug many of they be in thrall to their balaclava wear controller who largely act with impunity although the police and other agency work hard to combat such organise crime cleveland have the high crime rate in the country and police and council do not have the fair funding need to deal with criminal or provide good diversionary activity for those vulnerable young people what will the minister do to sort that out 
 i can reassure the hon gentleman that under our tackle organise exploitation programme we be keenly aware of the difference between victim and criminal and that child be be draw into criminal enterprise and gang at ever young age i want to provide reassurance that where we have evidence of that happen the child should be refer through   the national referral mechanism the framework for identify victim of exploitation by county line group and equivalent that can be do with or without the child ’s consent and it provide the police with a vital tool not just to protect the child but to disrupt the criminal activity in which they be be enlist 
 last week bedfordshire police report that drug dealer who have traffic a vulnerable year old child from luton to sell drug be sentence under modern slavery law although that conviction be of course welcome i think we can all agree that this be not just slavery it be the despicable act of groom child into a life of drug gang and violence why do not the government back our plan for a new specific offence to lock up such criminal for exactly what they be do and stop they exploit child and young people for a life of crime 
 i agree with much of what the hon lady say the prime minister implement new measure to deal with child sexual exploitation in april of last year but part of that deal with organised exploitation which go wide i be glad to hear that those criminal be convict under modern slavery law i want to reassure she that under our criminal justice bill which be make its way through the house groom gang will receive enhanced sentence 
 it be deeply disturbing when child and young people be involve in violent crime experience from around the world show that a whole of government approach be crucial in tackle the problem as have be acknowledge in successive government strategy will the minister give we an update on how the government be ensure that that be deliver 
 if i have understand my right hon friend ’s question correctly i can tell she that we be do a huge amount on child exploitation only last week we implement the no recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse for mandatory reporting and we have more to come this remain a government priority 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister say that the government be do load but since there have be a huge increase in the number of weapon seize in school in some area of the country with knife and taser find in some instance our young people continue to bear the brunt of the tories decision to hollow out youth service and prevention work in our community meanwhile ninja sword and other weapon remain just a google search away parent should not fear for their child ’s safety at school when will the government match labour ’s ambition for a young futures programme and prioritise the safety and opportunity of our young people 
 i make no apology for the success of our violence reduction unit and the difference that they have make to young people ’s life since my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire make the point that the crime survey for england and wales show that there have be a fall in violent crime since more than that our violence reduction   unit work in conjunction with our grip hotspot policing have deliver a statistically significant fall in violent injury hospital admission for knife crime and equivalent have fall by since and overall knife crime have fall nationally by since all in the life in this parliament we have ban zombie knife and cyclone knife and our criminal justice bill will give the police more power to make pre emptive seizure 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of level of compliance with post charge police bail curfew condition 
 decision on bail condition be set enforce and monitor locally but it be very important that where police bail condition be set down they be adhere to in order to protect the public 
 member of my constituent ’s family be kill in an appalling dangerous driving case the offender be on police bail at the time with curfew condition for a separate offence give that legislation do not allow for tag in such case to enforce those curfew condition will my right hon friend consider bring forward change to the law so that electronic monitoring can be use for offender release on post charge police bail 
 my hon friend raise a very important point inform by a tragic case in his own constituency he be right that as it stand the legislation do not allow for tagging of people who be simply on police bail that be to say before their appearance in court there be some consideration to do with whether tagging constitute a form of punishment and whether that be appropriate prior to a court hearing however my hon friend raise a reasonable point inform by a constituency case and i be happy to take it away and look at it with he 
 i thank the minister very much for that response obviously with a renewed and reinvigorated northern ireland assembly and a minister in place we in northern ireland be very keen to work alongside the minister on some of the suggestion he have refer to will he contact the policing and justice minister in the northern ireland executive to ensure that what be go to happen here can happen to we in northern ireland and that we can all gain the advantage 
 i thank the hon member for his question it be of course very good news that the northern ireland assembly and executive have be restore policing be devolve so the assembly and executive can set their own policy however if they would like any information about the policy we be pursue in the england and wales jurisdiction i would be very happy to share that information and work constructively and collaboratively with all the devolved administration include in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with chief constable on deliver policing at a local level 
 we have very regular discussion with chief constable across the country about local policing in fact just this morning i have a discussion with the chief constable of staffordshire police about some local policing issue in that county it be a dialogue that happen on a regular and ongoing basis police chief constable be of course operationally independent but we work very closely in partnership with they 
 leighton buzzard dunstable and houghton regis be the and large town in bedfordshire yet they have a fraction of the police officer that be base in luton and bedford will the minister speak to the chief constable to ensure that we get a fairer allocation of the record number of police officer we have in bedfordshire spread across the county and with a responder presence 
 my hon friend be a doughty champion for his part of bedfordshire he be quite right to say that bedfordshire in common with many other part of the country and indeed with england and wales as a whole have a record number of police officer in the case of bedfordshire the number be and across england and wales as a whole we now have over officer that be more than we have ever have before and over more than we have under the last labour government 
 i speak regularly to chief constable trevor rodenhurst and the excellent police and crime commissioner in bedfordshire festus akinbusoye of course how they deploy their record headcount be a matter for they rather than for government but i will certainly mention the issue that my hon friend have raise when i next speak to they i think we be have a meeting quite shortly and i know that my hon friend will mention these issue as well 
 at the weekend i have to seek extra police support due to the far right abuse that i have suffer which have be inspire and unleash in part by the conspiracy theory and racist islamophobic anti muslim hate peddle by the members for ashfield lee anderson for fareham suella braverman and for south west norfolk elizabeth truss interruption 
 order you can not name member 
 it be peddle by member of the government party do the minister agree that there be no place in this house or society for such divisive language member have have the whip remove do the minister agree that other member should also have the whip remove or do he agree with the point that be make 
 this house as a whole should be clear that hatred base on religion or race have no part in a civilised country whether it be direct towards the   jewish community who have suffer a surge in antisemitism or the muslim community the conservative party be prepared to act extremely quickly as we do at the weekend a great deal fast than the labour party when it have an issue in rochdale 
 i be pleased that the minister make reference to his meeting with the chief constable of staffordshire police after a disgusting hate mob appear outside a stoke on trent conservative fundraiser on friday it appear that a police officer allow member of the public who be spew their hatred into the venue ’s private function room where they seek to intimidate harass and bully member old and young some as young as year old individual involve use to be a member of the now proscribe terrorist organisation hizb ut tahrir be it not about time that we in this house stand up because i be sorry mr speaker but the action of last week embolden these individual to take such action and say with a clear voice that democracy will not be subdue in this way 
 yes that be important we make it clear in this house that members of parliament elect councillor or anyone engage in political activity include attend political event should be able to do so without intimidation and without harassment no in this house should feel that they have to change their vote or change procedure as a result of external pressure 
 what happen in stoke city on friday evening be completely unacceptable a political meeting be disrupt and indeed close down by protest that be unacceptable this morning i meet the chief constable and the police and crime commissioner of staffordshire to make that clear i also speak this morning to the chair of the national police chiefs council chief constable gavin stephens to make the same point i be pleased to report to the house that people have now be arrest in relation to the incident in stoke city—[interruption.]—on charge under section 4a of the public order act and section of the criminal justice and public order act 
 order sorry minister but we can not both be stand at the same time 
 have the minister have a chance recently to talk to the conservative police and crime commissioner for devon and cornwall police which have be in special measure since and be now be sue by former and serve woman police officer for fail to deal with rape emotional abuse and beating over a number of year what can he do to reassure the public in devon and cornwall that these allegation will be thoroughly independently investigate and any wrongdoing act on 
 of course we have the independent office for police conduct to make sure that there be an independent body available to investigate serious allegation about police force or their conduct of particular investigation on the engage process the chief inspector of constabulary chair regular meeting of the police performance    oversight group where force in engage be look at and overseen devon and cornwall be of those force along with the west midlands and london 
 local policing be really important i have have some good news from my police and crime commissioner alison hernandez which be that liskeard be to have a new police inquiry office would my right hon friend join i in welcome this and will he look at what further funding be available for this to happen in other town 
 i pay tribute to the excellent police and crime commissioner alison hernandez for the work that she have do to get the liskeard centre open and of course i pay tribute to my hon friend for her tireless work campaign on behalf of devon and cornwall police devon and cornwall police now have officer which be a record and next year it will be receive £ more funding compare with the current financial year provide plenty of money to invest in service as my hon friend quite rightly request 
 thank you mr speaker for everything you do to keep member of parliament safe i know that so much of it go unseen 
 i know from talk to resident in hull west and hessle that they be deeply concerned about the rise in antisocial behaviour antisocial behaviour be not trivial it have a huge impact on neighbourhood and on the mental health of the people subject to it so why be the government fail to take it seriously 
 with great respect that be complete nonsense the government publish an antisocial behaviour action plan just last year from april of this year in just a couple of month time every single police area in england and wales will have funding—£66 in total to run hotspot patrol in area where there be antisocial behaviour or serious violence problem we have force area run pilot for immediate justice where people commit asb have to do immediate reparation and we ban nitrous oxide on   november   last year so an action plan be be implement and every single police force be have money to run hotspot patrol to combat asb 
 what step his department be take to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of asylum seeker in asylum accommodation 
 we continue to provide safe habitable and fit for purpose accommodation for asylum seeker who would otherwise be destitute the home office have establish procedure to hold contract accommodation provider responsible for the provision of the safety security and wellbeing of asylum seeker in addition asylum seeker have access to a helpline to raise concern and make formal complaint 
 recent tragic event demonstrate that even those who be at risk of suicide be ignore after repeatedly raise concern about their mental health in asylum accommodation why have ministers change the allocation of asylum accommodation policy to make it hard for people to prove that they be at risk of harm at a particular site will they learn the lesson from december ’s tragic incident 
 i do not accept the depiction that the hon lady paint of the situation we of course make appropriate case by case decision about accommodation arrangement for individual reflect the need they have and with proper referral make as would rightly expect to any other agency that may be require to ensure somebody ’s health or wellbeing and that any safeguarding issue be properly address migrant help support be of course available for people to access and raise any issue 
 what recent progress he have make with his french counterpart on tackle illegal migration 
 joint work with our french partner be crucial to stop the boat thank in no small part to that joint working small boat crossing be down by last year 
 my spy tell i that my hon and learn friend be in france just day ago be there any lesson to be learn from the french authority about more co operation that can go on to stop the boat even far 
 my hon friend be right i be in france day ago even while i be there a boat be seize but he be right to say that more need to be do personnel equipment and technology be key to break the business model of the criminal gang have meet the new préfet du nord i be in no doubt that this be a joint mission 
 will the minister update the house on the number of illegal migrant who have cross the channel and be currently be accommodate in hotel at the expense of the public purse how do that compare with the number of uk national who be currently homeless or sleep rough 
 i can confirm that the government have beat our target of close hotel by the end of january which i be sure the hon gentleman will want to welcome 
 what progress his department have make on close asylum hotel 
 the home office have be clear that the use of hotel be a temporary and short term measure to ensure that we meet our statutory obligation to accommodate destitute asylum seeker during a period of unprecedented   number of small boat arrival we be make significant progress in closing hotel with more than close by the end of january 
 i thank the minister for that answer shrewsbury have more list building than any other town in england and we benefit from beautiful architecture that attract a huge amount of tourism from across the united kingdom and overseas our top hotel in the centre of shrewsbury be be use to house illegal migrant we be give an assurance that the hotel would be take out of that use yet we have hear nothing far from the minister or his department when will the lion hotel in shrewsbury revert back to its normal use which be housing tourist 
 it be certainly the case that i have not give an assurance to that effect but i know that my hon friend will welcome the fact that we be track ahead of profile when it come to closing hotel and the number of people accommodate in hotel be go down we will continue to make progress in order to allow more closure i hear his representation about the hotel in his constituency we be committed to this we be make progress and we will see it through 
 obviously the overwhelming majority of those seek asylum here and who be in residential accommodation desperately do not want to be in that accommodation they want their application to be hear and process quickly the minister know that around quarter of those people will be grant asylum in this country do he agree that part of the process while a person be wait for their hearing and for their decision to be make surely should be look at integration give that be not time to give asylum seeker the right to work in this country that would be good for they morally but also good for the government and the taxpayer because they would contribute to their own upkeep 
 it be fair to say that such an approach would make a mockery of our legal migration system and people play by the rule lodge application and pay the appropriate fee it be right that where people be grant asylum we support they to be able to move on as quickly as possible work be a key part of that i just wish the hon gentleman have the same energy to try to help more of our people domestically to be able to take on these role rather than say that we should resort to migrant labour all the time 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of neighbourhood policing level 
 figure for local policing start to be publish in with role at the time the most recent figure for march last year show that the number have increase by to 
 with a grow number of my constituent not even report crime because they do not have access to a public police station will the minister reconsider additional fund to ensure that local police station such as tamworth ’s be reopen public face police desk 
 staffordshire constabulary will receive an extra £ next year compare with the current financial year which be a significant increase they now have more than police officer due to our uplift programme which have see record police number across england and wales 
 of the most commonly report crime in rother valley be burglary either to rob home or to break into home and steal car key do the minister agree that every area especially south yorkshire should have a dedicated burglary police team to deal with those particular issue and ensure we clamp down on those awful crime 
 the previous home secretary my right hon and learn friend   the member for fareham suella braverman   be successful in secure a commitment from police to ensure that every residential burglary have a visit from the police but my hon friend ’s idea for a dedicated burglary taskforce be excellent and i commend it to all police and crime commissioner 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a brief statement over the past few week we have see disgraceful attempt to intimidate this house to undermine the democratic process and to spread fear among those who have be elect to represent our country that be unacceptable it must end 
 to this house i want to say clearly that the government will defend our democracy we be work with the police and with parliament to ensure that disagreement be resolve in this house through debate not outside with threat of violence to those who seek to threaten this house i say this we will not be cow we will not be intimidate and we will not be silence we will do whatever be necessary to protect those elect to represent we to safeguard our freedom and to protect our right i know i speak for colleague across the whole house when i say we will always act in the interest of our constituent and our country 
 i thank the minister for that answer he will be aware that there have be a increase in islamophobic hate case in the uk since   october and a rise in antisemitic incident compare with that be affect our most marginalised and vulnerable group what step be the minister take to protect worshipper and faith school and to reduce unprecedented level of hate across these island 
 over the past year this government have increase the funding to the community security trust by around £ take the total to around £ we have spend a similar amount on other place of worship only last week i approve spending on security measure to mosque and church around the country exactly to counter the kind of hate crime that the hon member describe we have engage with not just the community security trust but organisation   such as tell mama which do a fantastic job of engage with we on anti muslim hatred it be extremely important that we all work together not just to support and protect every religion and community in our country but to ensure that we lower the tension so that we can all be free to express our view 
 steal from small convenience story be cause concern because of both the financial impact on owner and the threat of violence towards staff i be grateful to the minister for meet colleague and i to discuss this last week i pay tribute to the thames valley police and crime commissioner matthew barber for his excellent retail crime strategy will my right hon friend set out how the government plan to tackle those theft and threat 
 this be a very serious issue the government have a retail crime action plan agree with police which include make sure that the police always attend when a suspect be detain when police attendance be need to secure evidence or when there have be an assault it also include always follow up every single line of inquiry when retail crime occur include run footage of the offender through the facial recognition database and identify and go after the criminal gang that often be behind shoplift 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last week tell mama report that anti muslim hate incident have treble that follow recent report that antisemitic incident have hit a record high we all must challenge all form of threat prejudice racism and hate have hear the word from the former deputy chair of the conservative party of a muslim mayor who say that his mate be islamist extremist and that he have be take over by islamists be any home office minister now prepare to stand up and say not only that those word about the london mayor be wrong but that they believe they be islamophobic and should be condemn as such 
 within hour of those word be use this prime minister take immediate action by remove the whip from that individual if only all leader of every political party be as quick to remove the whip from those who spread hatred in our community as rochdale sadly demonstrate they be not 
 i be sorry that the minister who i know take issue seriously choose not to respond to my question rightly on all side of the house we have call out and condemn antisemitism and we must continue to do so if government ministers can not openly challenge islamophobia they play into the hand of extremist both far right and islamist the minister will know that hate crime fuel extremism if the government take any of this seriously they would not have just ditch plan for a new hate crime strategy or leave it year to update the counter extremism strategy do he agree that it be not just their inability to say the word but their failure to act that be leave our community expose 
 i be sorry that the right hon lady do not see the action as clearly as other in this house the whip be remove immediately because anti muslim hatred be wrong there be no hierarchy in hatred or racism it be all wrong anti muslim hatred be wrong the support that some have give to islamist community in our country be tragic and this government will work against it that be exactly why we have proscribe hizb ut tahrir because we will work against hatred from whichever community in whatever way it come 
 i understand that the government be look to far restrict the ability of sex offender to change their name should we not impose at least the same restriction or perhaps an outright ban on those convict of murder because they can continue to be a threat to the family of those they murder 
 the home office explore whether a name change ban should be extend to murderer and determine that the operational need do not exist anyone convict of murder automatically receive a life sentence if they be release from prison they be manage by probation for the remainder of their life and they remain under an obligation to notify probation within hour of any change of their name should they fail to do so they face immediate recall to prison and up to an extra year behind bar so far we feel that that be work adequately 
 next month it will be year since the publication of the cross party youth violence commission report which recommend violence reduction unit however knife crime and serious violence be soar across the country do the minister accept that his government ’s severe cut to police number which mean we be at the bottom of international rank table be leave our young people and community without the protection they need 
 perhaps i have not say often enough in this chamber that we now have record number of police officer across england and wales include in the metropolitan police area which have the high number of police officer per capita of any police force in the country despite that i be disappoint to see in the recent figure publish that while across the rest of the country exclude london knife crime go down on sadiq khan ’s watch in london it go up 
 in the period of service to be eligible for a police long service medal change from year to year sadly no decision be make to award it retrospectively mean that people such as sedgley resident guy hewlett who serve with distinction for year be exclude this seem to be fundamentally unfair will the home secretary agree to look into that unfairness as a simple remedy could be find to recognise officer who serve for the minimum year pre 
 change of this nature be generally not apply retrospectively i will look at that matter again normally when a length of service period have change it apply prospectively rather than retrospectively but i will look at the issue 
 last month tragically a young man be stab to death at strawberry hill station in my constituency the minister will know that the key to tackle violent crime be intelligence lead community policing but despite his previous answer we have see police officer cut by a since and regular abstraction from my constituency into central london when will the minister ensure that my constituent have a visible policing presence again so they feel safe 
 i be sure that be a question the hon lady will be pose to london ’s police and crime commissioner sadiq khan in the course of the upcoming mayoral election thank to government funding the metropolitan police in common with england and wales now have record police number in the case of the met there be about and in the rest of the country there be about in fact not only do london have the high per capita funding of any force in the country it have the high number of officer per capita of any force in the country so sadiq khan really have no excuse at all 
 under the new change the minimum income threshold for family visa be be raise incrementally over the next year however the only date we have be give so far for that threshold increase be   april for people like my constituent who be plan to get married and be make wedding plan will the minister set out when we will have further clarity and an update on the timetable for announce the future threshold 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and i recognise his desire for certainty what i can say be that we expect to complete the reform in early with further staging post to come we be of course carefully monitor the implementation through the period of deliver the initial increase it be right that we go about it in that incremental way to give certainty to people 
 in bristol we have sadly see a number of young people kill by knife crime in the last few week we have a conservative police and crime commissioner but unlike the minister i have no desire to party politicise this what be he do to work with the department for education to ensure school be involve in try to lead the fight against knife crime and young people get involve whether as victim or perpetrator 
 the youth endowment fund lead by jon yates have receive a £ endowment its mission be to work with young people and that include work with school in the way that the hon lady have describe to identify the most effective intervention that could stop young people get on to the wrong track a track that can often have tragic consequence the youth endowment fund be work with violence reduction unit in the police force area most affect which be spend £ a year to make the necessary intervention for instance in school to keep our young people safe 
 during a recent night out in wrexham where i be know as a nurse as well as the member of parliament i be ask to help   police with a man who have collapse as i be begin cardiac resuscitation the emergency call handler say that the responder would be with we in an hour and minute fortunately the man be stabilise but then come the wait we be well used to the level of service provide by the welsh labour government but have the minister make any assessment of how much time be lose by the police attend emergency service 
 i thank my hon friend for her work in help the community her service have be exemplary the police will of course help when there be a threat to life or safety or when criminality be involve but when the emergency be purely medical for instance when someone be undergo a mental health crisis it be for the nhs to respond and the nationwide roll out of the right care right person model across england and soon i hope across wales as well will ensure that a medical response come when it be need 
 yew lodge hotel in the north west leicestershire village of kegworth continue to accommodate male illegal migrant how much long will this blight be inflict on my constituent by the government 
 the hon gentleman make no mention of the fact that of the hotel in his constituency be be close but he might like to welcome that he should actually be back the government because we be get on with close these hotel we be track ahead of profile in that regard and we also have a credible plan to reduce the inflow of people cross the channel by illegal mean 
 in respect of the projection of an antisemitic terrorist originate slogan on to the big ben tower last week the metropolitan police commissioner claim that he be powerless that be utter nonsense among other option the police could use section 4a of the public order act which refer to the use of 
 threatening abusive or insulting word or behaviour 
 with 
 intent to cause harassment alarm or distress 
 it be behaviour and it be insulting to jews and many other the police could also have reasonably fear a breach of the peace order the removal of the projection machine and if there be non compliance arrest the individual for obstruct a constable under the police act i have personally prosecute people for these offence police who fail to do their duty can be discipline for neglect of that duty will the minister act 
 i be sure that all member be horrify when those political statement of which by implication call for the destruction of israel be beam on to the big ben tower it be totally unacceptable and incidentally it be also a breach of planning law i do expect the police to take action my right hon and learn friend a former attorney general have set out a number of ground on which it could have be take and he can rest assure that i have forcefully communicate that to the commissioner already 
 of my constituent have be wait for his asylum substantive interview for well over month he sit for hour wait for an interview to start but it be   then cancel with no explanation there be clearly systemic issue but can the department look at this particular case so that it can be resolve 
 i know that the hon lady will welcome the improvement that we be make in the processing of asylum claim which be reflect in the way in which the legacy backlog have be deal with but if she can give i some specific detail i will certainly ask the team to have a look at it as soon as possible 
 may i thank my hon friend for not only close the star newton park asylum hotel at the beginning of february but do so day early the villager and the people who use the v3 bus service be extremely grateful for this exceptionally good practice 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for her work in represent the view of her constituent on this issue she firmly back the government ’s plan which be allow we to get on with closing hotel such as the in her constituency and we will continue to make progress to deliver on our commitment 
 banking protocol clearly state that bank should contact the police when they detect fraud hsbc rightly prevent a vulnerable constituent of mine from conduct a bank transfer to fraudster in south africa however owe to a failure to notify the police the fraud continue and as a result my constituent lose more than £ transfer with the use of apple gift card what advice can the minister give what recourse have my constituent to recover the money from hsbc if it have follow the protocol lay down appropriate safeguard would have be put in place 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this issue fraud be a blight on our society and leave many people feel vulnerable and extremely nervous about use online service and the wide economy i be delighted to say that fraud be already down by and there be more we be do on this issue i urge his constituent to follow the advice of the advertising campaign we be launch which be stop think fraud this be a huge issue on which we be work with police force around the country which be why we have new police officer in the national fraud service and the national fraud intelligence unit 
 last september my private member ’s bill which make public sexual harassment a criminal offence receive royal assent will the minister say when that act of parliament will be commence and when guidance to police force will be issue 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question it be a pleasure to support his bill as it go through the house i can not say exactly when it will be commence but i hope he will be reassure to hear that i have a meeting with official about commencement early this month 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last week the home secretary fire the chief inspector of borders and immigration after lose confidence in he when he go public with his concern as the home office fail to publish report from the inspector despite an agreement that it would publish they within week of receipt and with matter of border security at stake be mr david neal actually a whistleblower 
 as the right hon lady know mr neal ’s appointment be terminate after he breach the term of his appointment and lose the trust of the home secretary in relation to the report that she mention as she would expect report and recommendation be always consider carefully by minister and they will be publish in due course 
 the slogan that be project on to big ben last wednesday be extreme and antisemitic to many it call for the destruction of israel and be see as a genocidal statement decent people around the country not just jews find that appalling do the minister agree that there be criminal offence that could be use for prosecution and will he reiterate his call for the police to prosecute those responsible 
 i share my hon friend ’s view as the former attorney general my right hon and learn friend   the member for northampton north sir michael ellis   point out a few minute ago there be a number of basis on which the police could have act to prevent that projection big ben be not a canvas for political campaigning particularly where the slogan be deeply offensive in nature and that be a view i have make very clear to the commissioner 
 last week i raise on a point of order the case of my constituent marte prenga and her year old daughter who be stuck overseas and i be assure that those on the treasury bench would pass on to home office ministers the detail of their plight can i please have a meeting with an immigration minister as this issue be still unresolved 
 i think the hon gentleman know that we ministers be always approachable and accessible and i would be happy to speak to he about that matter 
 thames valley police have consistently set the pace on combat rural crime and next year ’s budget include provision to effectively double our rural crime taskforce will the policing minister join i in congratulate thames valley police on all they be do and more importantly ensure that the home office learn from their good practice so that it can be apply across the country 
 i pay tribute to thames valley ’s excellent police and crime commissioner matthew barber for the work he be do in combat rural crime and crime more widely we have fund a rural crime unit within the national police chiefs council but i be happy to look at the excellent work in thames valley to ensure that lesson be learn across the country 
 on a point of order mr speaker member from across the chamber probably do not need reminding of event last week on snp opposition day we bring forward a motion seek to ensure that this house speak with voice in favour of ensure the release of the hostage currently under the control of hamas and to ensure that an immediate ceasefire take place to protect civilian life in gaza that snp opposition day turn into a labour opposition day in that regard mr speaker you apologise to the snp and this house you say 
 i make a mistake we do make mistake and i own up to mine we can have an so24 to get an immediate debate because the debate be so important to the house ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 those be your word mr speaker 
 in good faith my colleague and i seek to bring forward an so24 debate which among other thing would have seek to end the sale of arm to israel and call on the government to use their voice at the united nations to exercise our view in favour of an immediate ceasefire it be my understanding that that so24 application have not be accept can you please advise i on when it will be accept 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for give i notice of his point of order the standing order say that i should not give the reason for any decision regard a   standing order no   application indeed properly we should not be discuss what be a private application to the speaker however give the exceptional circumstance we find ourselves in today my view be that i ought none the less to explain my reasoning 
 in determine whether a matter be proper to be discuss under the standing order i must have regard to criterion the be the extent to which it concern the administrative responsibility of ministers of the crown or could come within the scope of ministerial action i be satisfied that the matter do relate to area of ministerial responsibility and fall within the scope of ministerial action secondly in determine whether a matter be urgent i must have regard to the probability of the matter be bring before the house in time by other mean the house come to a resolution on this matter on wednesday last week far i understand that the government be ready to make a relevant statement tomorrow so there be a very imminent opportunity for this important matter to come before the house 
 that be why i decide that the application for an emergency debate should not proceed that decision of course do not mean that member can not apply for a debate at a later stage when circumstance might have change while the decision be mine to take i have consult my deputy and the clerks on this matter and we have agree on this approach 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on the recent response to houthi aggression in the red sea year ago the united nations convention on the law of the sea come into force that agreement be ratify by nation and it state explicitly in article that 
 ship of all states whether coastal or land locked enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea 
 since   october   the houthis aid and abet by iran have launch a ruthless and reckless campaign of attack against commercial shipping these attack be not solely limited to commerce our military vessel be also in the houthi crosshair the royal navy the us navy and most recently the french navy have also be target vessel own by chinese and bulgarian company and crew from india sri lanka and syria have be target indiscriminately make a mockery of houthi claim that this be all about israel 
 from the outset we have be clear that this can not carry on freedom of navigation underpin not only our security but our prosperity around of trade good be carry over the sea as be about of the good arrive in the united kingdom these necessity on which we depend arrive through a small number of critical waterway so uphold these precious freedom be essential for the preservation of life this government be determined to help restore the tranquillity of the red sea that be why the uk be of the member to join the us lead taskforce operation prosperity guardian with hms richmond now take over from hms diamond to patrol in the red sea to help protect commercial shipping it be why we be work in tandem with the us and other ally to reduce the houthis capacity to harm our security and economic interest to limit their impact on the flow of humanitarian aid to prevent further regional escalation and to show iran in no uncertain term that we will push back against its destabilising behaviour 
 on occasion in response to specific threat and in line with international law and the principle of self defence we have tackle the houthi threat head on since   january we have conduct a number of precision strike against houthi target in these previous round of strike raf aircraft successfully strike some target at different location include drone ground control station as well as other facility directly involve in the houthis drone and missile attack on shipping i be pleased to say that it remain the case that to date we have see no evidence at all to indicate that the raf strike cause civilian casualty and the un have note that it have observe no civilian impact arise from the raf strike 
 although we have erode the houthis capacity their intent to prosecute indiscriminate attack against innocent vessel remain undiminishe just last week mv rubymar a belize flag british register cargo vessel be target in the gulf of aden near the bab al mandab strait hit by missile the crew be force to abandon ship an oil slick cause entirely by damage sustain in the houthi attack now stretch   many mile from the vessel on thursday the british register mv islander be similarly target it be strike by missile result in a fire on board fortunately there be no loss of life 
 this all come not long after us register bulk carrier mv navis fortuna and mv sea champion suffer minor damage from houthi strike the attack on sea champion highlight the houthis recklessness and near sightedness consider that sea champion have deliver humanitarian aid to yemen time in the past year and be due to unload thousand of tonne of much need aid to the yemeni people through the port of aden and hodeidah the houthis attack be quite simply callous as near sighted as these attack be they continue to have serious and potentially long term consequence across the region as they cut off vital aid to civilian in yemen and syria restrict crucial food import to djibouti and threaten significant impact in egypt 
 last time i speak on this issue i tell the house that we will not hesitate to act again in self defence we have give the houthis ample opportunity to de escalate but once again the houthi zealot have ignore our repeat warning as a result we have once again take action to defend ourselves against these intolerable attack on saturday night a royal air force package of typhoons support by voyager tanker join us force in a deliberate strike against houthi military facility in yemen that have be conduct missile and drone attack on commercial shipping and coalition naval force in the bab al mandab strait the southern red sea and the gulf of aden as the house know it be the such operation to degrade the houthi capability that be be use to threaten global trade in the red sea 
 intelligence analysis indicate that the strike be successful and that the site we attack be be use by the long range drone that the houthis use for both reconnaissance and attack mission include at a former surface to air missile battery site several mile north east of sana’a our aircraft use paveway iv precision guide munition against the drone and their launcher assessment continue at this still early stage but the analysis so far indicate that all raf target be successfully strike building be hit at the bani military site and way attack drone be assess to have be destroy at the sana’a military site 
 on plan these strike as be normal practice for the raf operation be carry out meticulously and consideration be give to minimise any risk of cause civilian casualty assessment so far indicate that across the set of airstrike some military target have be hit at different houthi facility i pay tribute to the immense skill and tireless dedication of the man and woman who make that possible 
 once again i would like to make it clear that military action be only aspect of our approach to the crisis in the red sea the whole international community have an interest in stop these attack and we continue to work with it to turn that intent into action the prime minister have engage regional leader include the sultan of oman as well as g7 partner the foreign secretary and i have travel repeatedly to the region in recent week to discuss regional security we be determined to end the illegal flow of arm to the houthis use   whatever lever be available include endure diplomatic engagement and determine to continue to intercept illegal weapon and the shipping that help to feed that supply we be cut off the houthis financial resource to far degrade their capacity to conduct attack for example jointly with the us we be sanction houthi leader and we will continue to work with the us to cut the flow of houthi fund 
 despite the good effort of the houthis we also continue to provide humanitarian help to people in the middle east this year we will send some £ of humanitarian support to yemen which will feed yeminis every month the uk have recently work closely with our jordanian partner to airdrop life save supply directly to the tal al hawa hospital in northern gaza 
 the houthis could stop this barbaric behaviour any time they want instead they callously choose to continue their reckless act of aggression cause harm not just to innocent but to their own people in yemen until they stop we will continue to act but consensus continue to grow that the houthis violation simply can not continue that be why recently the european union officially launch its operation aspides member will know that aspide mean shield in ancient greek we very much welcome the commitment of our eu partner to join in the work that have be go on because no nation should ever be able to threaten the artery of global commerce 
 year ago nation of the world all come together to protect innocent passage on our high sea year on the house should be in no doubt whatsoever that we will continue to stand up for those right and do all that we can to defend life and limb of sailor everywhere and to preserve their precious trading route on which we all depend i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the defence secretary for advance sight of his statement we accept that the weekend ’s airstrike be legal limited and target to minimise the risk of civilian casualty we pay tribute to the total professionalism of all force personnel involve in the operation which be conduct to protect shipping in the red sea and uphold freedom of navigation for all nation as the defence secretary say the houthis have be attack ship of all nation chinese bulgarian and french ship have be target danish greek and uk ship have be hit and even aid vessel destine for yemen have be in the firing line the uk and us navies have be force to shoot down drone in self defence 
 today the british chambers of commerce report that more than half of british exporter be be hit by high cost and delay because of the houthi attack the houthis be threaten international trade and maritime security and put civilian and military life in serious danger that be why the un security council last month pass a resolution condemn the houthis action in the strong term and demand that their attack cease 
 we accept that the military action over the weekend be justify but be it effective what be the objective for these late strike be they fully meet be the target at both sana’a and bani destroy minister have say that the aim of early strike be to deter houthi attack and secondly to degrade their capability but deterrence do not feature in the weekend ’s nation joint statement in support of the strike and the defence secretary say this afternoon that houthi intent remain undiminishe have deter attack be drop as of the government ’s objective for this military action 
 as the defence secretary say this be the such operation since   january when will the government judge this to be a sustained campaign at what stage do the government think that parliament need a say it be the prime minister ’s responsibility to authorise uk military action and account for it to the public in this house when will we hear from he 
 any military action against the houthis must be reinforce by a diplomatic drive in the region aim at stop the flow of iranian weapon cut off houthi finance and settle the civil war in yemen what more can the defence secretary say about the government ’s wide action we continue to back the royal navy ’s role in defence of shipping from all nation through operation prosperity guardian how be that us lead taskforce co ordinating with operation aspides the european union ’s new naval presence in the red sea 
 finally i totally reject houthi claim that fire missile and drone at ship from around the world be somehow link to the conflict in gaza those attack do absolutely nothing for the palestinians whose agony be extreme last week parliament pass labour ’s motion call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire we all want an end to the fighting now no ground offensive in rafah all hostage release and aid to gaza ramp up greatly let we come together this week to work for a ceasefire that be observe by all side and that can build into the political process that be need if we be to secure last peace through a state solution for both palestine and israel 
 i be grateful for the right hon gentleman ’s comment he ask a series of question and i will respond directly 
 on effectiveness we believe that this set of attack be effective and early reconnaissance show as much as i outline in my statement as ever it will take a few day to get a full picture but we have no reason to think that the action be not entirely successful 
 we very much intend our attack on houthi infrastructure to be a deterrent the houthis think that they can continue their action our strike will ensure that they understand the consequence of those action and the price to pay for they but perhaps other people control other waterway will also understand that the world will not simply stand back and allow those action to take place 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the prime minister come to the house i gently point out to he that technically he be wrong the defence secretary have the legal authority to sign off action as part of royal prerogative legally i have responsibility for the attack   although as he rightly point out the prime minister come to the house to give the statement on they as the message in each of those statement be similar and i have legal responsibility it seem proper and right for i to come to the house and respond to question we have have very full statement after each round of attack 
 the shadow defence secretary be quite right to say that this sit within a much wide diplomatic context i go into some detail in my comment but i be happy to talk more about the wide work that be go on in the region to try to bring to a successful conclusion the wide conflict which be in my view and i think i hear he say in his view nothing to do with why the houthis be attack shipping in the red sea 
 finally i would just gently say although many of the snp be not here that to claim that the house pass in full agreement a particular resolution last week be a little bit rich give the circumstance 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 open source information suggest that the strike be diminish the capability of the houthis to attack international shipping as that be both welcome and important will the secretary of state concur that that be also his assessment it be welcome that aspides and prosperity guardian be co ordinating but do that also include on the interdiction of weapon be smuggle from iran into yemen 
 my right hon friend be right that we be degrading attrite as they say in military term that capability however it be still the case that the houthis be capable of launch attack to what extent well the house will come to its own conclusion but it will note that the gap between the round of attack be relatively short and that the gap between that and this round have be long again we will wait to see what the response be 
 on interdiction yes we will certainly continue to try to ensure that iran be not resupplye the single good message to go out from this house be that iran should stop that activity it be worth note that it have be only britain and the us that have be do interdiction in the past few year and of course we will continue to do so 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 let i thank the secretary of state for due sight of his statement i think that as an opposition party we would give it our tentative support what the shadow defence secretary say about possible mission creep do give we concern but i be sure that it be the role of the opposition to keep ask those question 
 the secretary of state know that my last question regard this issue be on the position of the people ’s republic of china until recently export between europe and china be in excess of £ a year and there be no doubt that they will suffer as a result of the extended time that it take to travel between china and europe but what beggar belief be china ’s utter silence in relation to what be go on notably give that it have a military naval capacity in djibouti 
 the secretary of state and i will disagree on the issue of gaza if we have secure a real vote last week we would probably have see that record formally in the house gerald m. feierstein the former us diplomat have say that 
 the houthis effort to insert themselves into the gaza conflict 
 be aim at 
 strengthen their support base in the country and cement their movement more firmly in the axis of resistance 
 i wonder whether like i the secretary of state be concerned that we be not only strengthen that axis of resistance but with illicit chinese and russian support now broaden it in the red sea 
 i thank the hon member for his as he have describe it tentative support i have note that the house have be largely unified on this issue during the past statement follow previous attack he ask about the mission creep situation i hope he feel reassure by the concept that we have wait long in part because the houthis capability have be damage so that there be a long gap and we do not see this thing speed up we have no intention or desire to see it increase but we will act if there continue to be attack on commercial and naval shipping 
 the hon member ask about china and russia and i have to say that i agree it be important that country that be impact by this the entire world but perhaps china in particular do speak up we would welcome china be more vocal about the situation as i mention in my comment a chinese vessel have be attack so this be of direct concern to the country i call on china and of course russia for what it be worth to be more vocal on these issue 
 lastly i just do not accept this gaza houthi connection i remind the house that the houthis be against hamas until and now they arrive on the scene and pretend to support they they be opportunist thug take advantage of the situation and of people ’s life and misery not just in gaza but in yemen and they should stop and desist immediately 
 the secretary of state will recall that in handle this topic on   february he strongly endorse the suggestion that a lot of this trouble in the middle east be link to tactic to divert from the war in ukraine give that the route from what be happen in ukraine to what be happen in the middle east be via russia and iran be he satisfied that there be no inconsistency between the tough line be take by the ministry of defence against the houthis and the soft line be take by the foreign office against their iranian sponsor 
 i somewhat reject that characterisation to be absolutely clear we be very much of the view that iran be responsible it fund train and provide equipment to the houthis and many other iranian sponsor proxy in the region it be also the case that it have probably lose control of some of they it be important that we deliver those message in many different way to the iranians i have see the read out of the way they have be deliver include directly by the foreign secretary and they be anything but weak 
 i put to the secretary of state a similar question to the that i put to the prime minister on   january of course we want a diplomatic solution any ramping up of a military solution have its consequence but for how many more month be the secretary of state and the government go to allow this to continue do the government and the ally have a plan b 
 of course the whole world be work on the overall context of the middle east i know the hon gentleman will have see the report over the weekend about the discussion take place in relation to the hostage we want a comprehensive settlement the government ’s policy be of course a state solution the middle east could be normalise in many way include through saudi normalisation with israel as part of that broad package the government be work proactively on this as i say i be conscious that we should not link these thuggish pirate 
 indicate dissent 
 i be not say the hon gentleman do that but i be keen that we do not see the issue as inextricably link i accept that the hon gentleman be not try to do that we be work very hard on the wide solution 
 i welcome this statement and the defence secretary ’s leadership it be clear that the houthi threat may last month and it be right that britain play our role in protect international shipping but typhoon be task from cyprus only because our surface fleet can not hit target at range on land i know the defence secretary be look at a new vertical launch system to rectify that but do he agree that an urgent operational requirement to introduce guide multiple launch rocket system with the new precision strike missile would allow our royal navy already task to the red sea to help eliminate the houthi threat 
 there be always good reason to introduce new capability in fact i be recently down on hms somerset at devonport where a system be be fit and trialle it be not the case as it be sometimes characterise that we be use typhoons because we do not have another option our preference be to work in this way for a range of reason that i can not enter into at the dispatch box it be worth note that when the us carry out action in iraq and syria its plane fly all the way from the united states and i be not aware of anybody say that that be because it do not have facility close to hand we be use the correct facility for the particular operation notwithstanding the fact that it be always nice to have new facility 
 i agree with the secretary of state that we must always think about our servicemen and woman who carry out these task as a former defence minister it be news to i that it be up to the defence secretary to agree to any strike but perhaps this defence secretary have more power than his predecessor 
 what be the policy and strategy behind this set of circumstance i and a number of other defence committee member meet the defence minister of italy a few week ago in rome italy be deploy to the region how be it that this be now a us and uk lead operation what be we do to build alliance with italy and other european nation that have an interest in do so as my hon friend   the member for halton derek twigg   ask what ultimately be plan b and the long term endgame 
 i will avoid get into the constitutional position of how that authority run it would be inconceivable to do that without the prime minister but it be technically the case that the royal prerogative run to the defence secretary for what it be worth 
 i be very familiar with my friend minister crosetto whom the right hon gentleman meet in rome the italians have as he know opt to join aspides the eu operation we will work closely with our european friend and ally to ensure that that interact properly with the wide prosperity guardian and the direct action that we be take of course we welcome action from other friend and ally in that regard 
 i be very interested to hear the secretary of state say that it be just the united kingdom and the united states do the interdiction to ensure that there be no rearmament of the houthis but what assessment have he make of the source of that rearmament what percentage do he think come from iran through syria or through other agent 
 we be pretty certain that it all originate in iran—[interruption actually i have just be inform by my parliamentary private secretary that actually there be also a french interdiction of some weapon in so let i put that correction on the record to answer the question i believe that it all originate from iran which rout it take in be another matter but much of it come ultimately by sea and we continue to work proactively to ensure that we prevent those shipment whenever we can 
 will the secretary of state answer the question ask by the shadow defence secretary which he avoid early now that this appear to be sustained operation might a vote in this house be appropriate 
 we will continue to gauge the view of the house on these matter i have note that each party ’s representative have from tentatively to fully support these measure response if the rapidity or severity of the attack increase for example my judgment at the moment would be that it be possible to read the mood of the house but we will keep that under review and ensure that we continually come back to the house to provide defence intelligence briefing to member who require they 
 accord to a survey release by the british chambers of commerce over half of british retailer and exporter have be impact by the disruption in the red sea which be cause logistic delay push up cost and risk high price and   few choice in british shop and elsewhere can my right hon friend confirm that our military action be consistent with the uk ’s overarch aim of de escalating tension and restore stability in the red sea 
 yes i can absolutely provide that reassurance my right hon friend be absolutely right to point out that the situation be already have a cost for british consumer as i mention in my comment globally about of good move by sea for the united kingdom it be about give that we be an island it be very important therefore to show both for the purpose of deterrence and to weaken the houthis ability to attack shipping that we mean business when we say that this can not carry on 
 after separate strike in week this appear to be a prolong military campaign so i ask the minister again as i do on   february what be the long term strategy and how do this relate to the ongoing precarious situation in yemen itself if the government ’s plan be to sustain military action will he speak to the prime minister to ensure that parliament accordingly have a vote or a say which be only right 
 i hope the hon lady will join i in welcome action against the houthis who have attack a ship that as i mention have provide aid to the people of yemen on multiple occasion i know that she do not make this mistake but some people think that the houthis be somehow the yemeni authority they be not they be not the government they be destroy that country through their action and be actually prevent aid from get to the people of yemen so it be absolutely right that we take this action 
 to assure the hon lady the previous attack be day apart or so it have be a long period this time we have be able to wait long perhaps because the houthis have few option to attack shipping but i stress that we will continue if they carry on attack shipping the simple thing for all of we to do be to send a clear united message to the houthis that they must stop attack innocent shipping 
 the secretary of state be absolutely right to say that military action be necessary but not sufficient to deal with the long term problem of the houthis he have mention the necessity of tackle financing and the illegal shipping of weapon but global shipping be peculiarly vulnerable to cyber attack what be the secretary of state do to ensure that the uk ’s cyber capability be share with our international partner to protect our global shipping interest 
 there be essentially form of warfare that my hon friend be point to be direct cyber attack and the other be the use of electronic warfare to cause particular outcome i be afraid that we have see a lot of that particularly in the theatre in ukraine and we be very conscious of the way it be be use in the red sea region as well we will continue to do all we can to help through the prosperity guardian element of this operation and to make sure that we be a step ahead of those who would through preference destroy the ability for world trade and good passage through open sea to take place 
 i assure the minister that he have the full not tentative support of dup members for the action he have take because as he have point out what be happen will affect business and consumer in the uk through inflation and the inability to get supply however those effect be not limit to the uk almost every european nation rely on those shipping lane be keep open why be it that we be do the heavy lifting when it come to attack the houthis and other nation be not join in 
 i be very grateful for the support of the right hon gentleman ’s party secondly factor have to be in play in order to take action the will to do it and the capability to do it quite a large number of nation be involve either through prosperity guardian or direct support for the military action which include intelligence officer and other mean of assistance we be receive support from a whole range of people we now also have operation aspides which the europeans be launch we look forward to see what they bring to this action but i stress that it be our capability and willingness combine that mean that the united kingdom be able and willing to act when perhaps other be not 
 have my right hon friend the defence secretary consider engage with the currently unrecognised country of somaliland i visit it recently as the register of members financial interests will show as it have a border with the gulf of aden its port at berbera might be useful to his majesty ’s government 
 i know that my right hon and learn friend be a big fan of somaliland i have visit it myself in the past and i know that in a difficult environment they do a very good job administratively and otherwise of try to run their government i will take his comment away and confer with the foreign secretary
