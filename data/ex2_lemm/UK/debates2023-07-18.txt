with permission i would like to make a statement on the publication of our refresh defence command paper it be just over year since we publish the original command paper in march in those year our security have be challenge in so many way this be defence ’s response to a more contested and volatile world 
 in the last year that i have be defence secretary i have be consistent about the reform i have seek to implement i want defence to be threat lead understanding and act on the threat face our nation as our sole mission not protect force structure cap badge or much love equipment but ensure that we be focused on challenging threat 
 i want the ministry of defence to be a campaigning department adopt a more proactive posture and our force more forward and present in the world with a return to campaign assertively and constantly push back those threat and our adversary i want defence to be sustainable in every sense for too long defence be hollow out by both labour and conservative government leave our force overstretch and underequipped we must match our ambition to our resource our equipment plan to our budget and take care of our people to sustain they in their duty we must never forget the travesty of the snatch land rovers in afghanistan 
 the defence command paper be true to those principle and with some tough choice present an honest plan for what we can and will achieve a credible force capable of protect the nation ready to meet the threat of today but invest heavily to modernise for those of the future a force in which every major platform would be renew by from armoured vehicle to dreadnought submarine frigate to satellite 
 we do not plan on issue a new command paper just year on many of the conclusion of that command paper remain right russia be and be the great threat to european security and china ’s rapid military modernisation and grow assertiveness in the indo pacific and beyond do pose an increase challenge to we all however i have always say that as the situation change we must change with it since the dcp be release the world have shift once more from a competitive age to a contested and volatile world the technology advance we predict materialise the threat and challenge we fear have manifest 
 there be no more immediate threat than russia its full scale invasion of ukraine be not simply an assault on a proud and sovereign nation but an attack on all our value european security and the open international order on which stability and prosperity have depend for over quarter of a century right now the people of ukraine be suffer the tragic consequence of president putin ’s illegal unprovoked invasion his naked aggression and imperial ambition have play out in a tragedy of epic human suffering the brave citizen soldier of the armed force of ukraine be protect their own nation and people quite heroically take on the once mighty russian force the whole   house recognise that they fight not just for their freedom but for our they be not just liberate their homeland but defend the rule base system 
 as defence secretary it be important to import the lesson learn from the conflict to our own force while i wish such lesson be generate in a different war the conflict have become an incubator of new way of war they be prove the way for warfare in the 2020s whole of nation internationally partner innovative digitise operate with a tempo precision and range requirement and a recognition that there be a trade off between assurance level and operational impact 
 i be proud too of the role the uk be play in support ukraine whether provide equipment training or political support or galvanise european and international ally and industrial partner to do likewise but the return of war to the continent of europe alongside grow threat elsewhere in the world have mean that we must sharpen our approach the integrated review refresh publish in march outline how we would do that it would shape the global strategic environment increase our focus on deterrence and defence address vulnerability that leave our nation expose and invest in the uk ’s unique strength 
 defence be central to all those effort that be why after decade in which all party have continue draw the post cold war peace dividend this prime minister reverse that trend and provide defence with an additional £ over year he and the chancellor have go far since in response to the war in ukraine next year we will spend over £ on defence for the time in our history that be nearly £ a year more cash investment than when i become defence secretary in a real term increase of more than this government have commit to increase spending yet far over the long term to of gdp as we improve the fiscal position and grow our economy 
 our defence plan and the armed force to deliver they must be robust and credible not fantasy force design unfunded gimmick or top trump number as russia have so effectively prove there be no point have parade ground army and massed rank of man and machine if they can not be integrate as a single full spectrum force sustain in the field under all the demand of modern warfighting that take professional force well equipped and rapidly adaptable support by critical enabler and vast stockpile of munition that be why in this document hon member will not find shiny new announcement comms lead policy drive unsustainable force design or any major new platform for military enthusiast to put up on their chart on their bedroom wall we stand by the command paper we publish in but we must get there fast do defence differently and get ourselves on to a campaign foot to protect the nation and help it prosper 
 as i say stand here when dcp21 be announce we owe it to the man and woman of our armed force to make policy reality the work be just begin in this refresh we have focus on how to drive the lesson of ukraine into our core business and on how to recover the warfighting resilience need to generate credible conventional deterrence the great advantage of have serve in defence for some time be that my ministerial team and i have now take a proper look    under the bonnet consequently we be clear that our strategic advantage derive from key source which require urgent prioritisation 
 and foremost be our class people our man and woman be not just brave and committed but talented and incredibly skilled they be our real battle win capability it be our duty to ensure they be as well support prepared and equip as possible so we be go to invest in they last year i commission richard haythornthwaite to conduct the review of workforce incentivisation for almost year it be such good work that we be incorporate the response into our command paper and today i be unveil a new employment model and skill framework for our armed force it will offer our people a spectrum of service that allow far great career flexibility make it easy for military personnel to zig zag between different role whether regular or reserve or between the civil service and industry 
 we be transform our force overall employment offer by adopt a total reward approach to provide a much more compelling and competitive incentivisation package since all our armed force personnel deserve the good quality accommodation we be inject a furth £ to improve our service accommodation in the next year many of we over christmas will have be frustrate by the poor support our service personnel and their family receive from those task with look after their accommodation it be for that reason that i have withhold their profit and use the money to freeze for year only the rent increase our personnel be due to pay take together alongside such initiative as wraparound childcare they be intend to enrich career and enhance the ability of our most talented people to keep protect the british people and to ensure they be reward and fulfil while they do so 
 our priority be far strengthen our scientific and technological base we be already world leader in specific area but to continue outmatch our adversary we must stay ahead of the curve in digital datum and emerge scientific field in we say we would invest £ in advanced research and development in fact we be now invest significantly more to stay ahead in the technology prove themselves vital on the battlefield of ukraine such as ai quantum and robotic we be enable a culture of innovation across defence pull through those r&d breakthrough to the frontline follow in ukraine ’s footstep we be increasingly source the £ solution that can stop £ threat in their track win both the kinetic and economic exchange of modern warfare 
 of course our ability to do that depend on the quality of our relationship with the industry which be our priority i be push the ministry of defence to form a close alliance with our industrial partner a genuine partnership to sustain our defence will mean do thing differently ukraine remind we that time wait for no it be no good hold out for the solution that be obsolete by the time it be launch often be good enough especially if it mean swiftly put kit into the hand of our service personnel capability can be rapidly upgrade spirally develop for the relentless cycle of battlefield adaptation to win   the innovation battle instead of stick to acquisition programme that drag on for decade we be set maximum delivery period of year for hardware and year for digital programme 
 our priority be productivity and campaigning to face this increasingly contested and volatile world we need to make major change to the machinery of the department and its method we be emphasise an ethos focus ruthlessly on the delivery of real world effect increase the bang for buck in everything we do this approach reach into every part of the defence enterprise from the front line to the back office and involve a major redesign of the department we must shift our whole organisational culture away from the previous peacetime mentality to where we live and operate as we would fight focus more on output than input and achieve a well balance between risk and reward that mean empower people to live and operate alongside partner and sometimes to be enable by they when in low threat environment that mean ensure our equipment whether type challenger or typhoons have the infrastructure and supply need to sustain operation more of the time and to deliver real world effect wherever and whenever it be need and it mean work with the relevant regulatory authority for example the military aviation authority to accelerate the experimentation testing and innovating of new technology while remain within legal bound 
 i want to emphasise final aspect of the command paper refresh namely the development of a global campaigning approach we start with a review of our head office where we break out campaign delivery from policy formation and establish integrated campaign team they have adversary focus not geographic and will drive our endure campaign in the same way operational commander lead our force on deploy operation the indivisibility of operational theatre in today ’s world mean defence must be constantly ready to respond globally to safeguard our interest and those of our ally sometimes it will be to evacuate our citizen in moment of crisis such as in sudan other time it will be to deter an adversary or reassure a friend as we have show through our support for ukraine the uk government have the political will but that only matter if it be match by our military agility today we be establish a defence global response force ready integrated and lethal it will well cohere exist force from across land sea air space and cyber to get there in response to unpredictable event around the world 
 crucially today ’s paper also recognise that it be in the interconnected world and that the uk be unlikely to act alone partnership be critical to our security and prosperity in future we will be ally by design and national by exception our support for nato will remain iron clad but we will continue to prioritise our core relationship we will invest in deepen relationship with our new partner it be why we have invest to expand our global defence network improve communication and co ordinating defence attachés within our intelligence function none of that be headline grab stuff but it be the fine detail that make the difference to our national security 
 to conclude the paper be the result of have several year in the department to understand where it need most attention that continuity in office be improve   and i be incredibly grateful to the long serve minister for armed forces my right hon friend   the member for wells james heappey whose experience in uniform and public office provide the basis for this paper we be grateful to the hundred of individual and group who contribute to the challenge phase of its drafting from academic to serve personnel and industry representative not to mention the many member of this house most of what we learn from they be encapsulate in the document 
 this be likely to be of my last appearance at the dispatch box it have be the great privilege to serve as secretary of state for defence for the last year i thank my team civil servant special adviser and members for their support and their challenge all of we here have the common interest of defend this fine country its value and its freedom of all the many function of government defence be the most important and be more important than ever as the next year will be more unstable and insecure the man and woman of our armed force be to none and britain ’s place in the world be anchor in their professionalism and sacrifice i believe we will increasingly call on they in the year ahead we must ensure that they be ready to answer that call i wish they and whomever replace i well i commend the statement to the house 
 i thank my right hon friend for his work on the report and for his campaigning let i also say however that procurement have start to improve in the average time delay on a project be it be now the average cost overrun be on a project in it be now the direction of travel be improve the number of civil servant at de&s go from to so we be cut away the bureaucracy and the direction of travel be improve in my time as secretary of state for defence i be also determined to put to bed some of the problem project that we be all inherit i be pleased to say that as i speak ajax be back on track and start to be deliver to the unit the unit be start to train in it now we could all have a discussion about whether we would have choose ajax all those year ago but fundamentally it have not cost the taxpayer any more money and it be be deliver to our frontline i be determined to put that right or take other step to deal with it that should always be the case 
 the other thing that i have always try to do which be not in the document but which i recommend in defence procurement be to never defer either delete or deliver if you defer it cost hundred of million of pound defer the aircraft carrier cost £ under the labour government defer the f-35 cost £ deferral create the black hole delete or deliver but do n’t defer 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help support the de escalation of violence in israel and the occupied palestinian territories 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of illegal settlement in the occupied palestinian territories 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of recent violence in israel and palestine 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of recent violence in israel and palestine 
 what step his department be take to help secure peace in israel and the occupied palestinian territories 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of recent violence in israel and palestine 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of recent violence in israel and palestine 
 the accelerate cycle of violence in the west bank be a cause of enormous concern and the government be intensely focused on the situation while the uk firmly support israel ’s right to defend itself and its citizen against terrorism we urge the israel defence forces to demonstrate restraint adhere to the principle of international humanitarian law and ensure that civilian be protect the uk ’s position on settlement be clear settlement be illegal under international law and call into question israel ’s commitment to the state solution 
 regrettably a last peace deal seem as far away as ever in dozen of palestinian child have be kill in israeli military operation we should never become immune to the tragedy of those death but will the minister urge the israeli government to show compassion and restraint and urge all side to put respect for human life 
 my hon friend make an important point every of those death be tragic and a real tragedy in the annual human rights and democracy report publish by the fcdo last week the opt be identify as a human right priority the uk will continue to oppose violation and abuse of international human right law and international humanitarian law by the government of israel the palestinian authority and hamas include through our ongoing support for civil society actor it be vital work 
 year ago in this very chamber i raise the case of year old nora and her family who face be force out of their home by israeli settler despite international opposition last week she be tragically drag from her home of more than decade if this case be not it what be the government ’s red line how many more palestinian grandmother must be forcibly evict will the minister stand by the word of his own former prime minister and leader david cameron who tell i on that day year ago that what we be see in occupy east jerusalem be now more than an expansion of illegal settlement but an encirclement 
 demolition and eviction of palestinians from their home cause unnecessary suffering to ordinary palestinians and call into question israel ’s commitment to a viable state solution in all but the most exceptional case demolition by an occupy power be contrary to international humanitarian law lord ahmad have raise this case with the israeli ambassador and make it clear that we urge israel to reconsider forthcoming eviction 
 this year have already be the deadly for violence in the west bank since the expansion of illegal settlement keep on grow the uk government now have the presidency of the un security council will the minister commit to support an international criminal court investigation into the killing of innocent palestinians and suspend all arm sale to israel until it abide by international law 
 we be use our power as president of the un security council to convene and bring people together we be concerned about the ongoing deterioration of the situation we continue to monitor the situation on the ground with our international ally 
 early this year i be privileged to visit healthcare facility support by medical aid for palestinians in the west bank this week it have take the unprecedented step of provide bulletproof vest and helmet to medical worker in the west bank because of an increase in the attack they be face in last week ’s urgent question on violence in the west bank the minister of state   the right hon member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan   announce that the minister responsible for the middle east and north   africa lord ahmad would be speak to the israeli ambassador to demand that access to medical care be allow accord to israel ’s obligation under international law can the minister set out what assurance he have receive from the israeli authority that violation against healthcare worker and barrier to health access in the west bank will be bring to an end 
 lord ahmad do meet the israeli official and talk through the importance of this matter as the hon lady rightly highlight international humanitarian law require military force to allow medical access in order to evacuate and treat the wounded we be always urge israel to live up to those important requirement 
 this year have see the high number on record of settlement in the west bank in just the half of the israeli government promote housing unit and new outpost the total number of settler in the west bank be now this be contrary to international law and further displace many palestinian family as their house and land be take away how will that help the peace process what be the government do to uphold international law 
 that be an important question as be lay out in the foreign secretary ’s trilateral statement with the foreign ministers of australia and canada on   june the continue expansion of settlement be an obstacle to peace and negatively impact effort to achieve a negotiate state solution we call on the government of israel to reverse these decision and we have continue to do that with the foreign secretary speak to his counterpart on   july 
 in the month of the united nations record instance of settler relate violence result in casualty or property damage which be the high daily average since what plan have the minister get to request that the israeli authorities take action to prevent settler violence against palestinians as the settlement be consider to be illegal under international law will he commit to a ban on the importation of settlement good as have be do with good arise from other breach of international law 
 we welcome the joint statement from the head of the israel defence force the israeli security agency and israeli police as well as statement by other israeli leader that condemn these criminal act we call on the authority to ensure accountability for all perpetrator of violence it be important that word be turn into action 
 back in i be part of a parliamentary delegation that visit the sub laban family in their home of year in the occupy old city of jerusalem last week israel forcibly evict they to make way for illegal settler as have be replicate time after time across occupy east jerusalem and the rest of the west bank how many such violation of international law by israel will have to take place before the government act include by ban uk trade with illegal israeli settlement in the occupied palestinian territories as organisation such as oxfam amnesty international and human rights watch have call for 
 as i say we be concerned about demolition and eviction of palestinians which call into question israel ’s commitment to a viable state solution we be push for it to reconsider forthcoming eviction 
 for those of we who be friend of israel and proud to be of its strength have be its independent judiciary which have on occasion strike down arbitrary action by israeli authority will the minister say as friend to his israeli counterpart when he next meet they that any proposal that might reduce the independence of the judiciary in israel would not help israel ’s cause would not help stability in the region and would make it hard for its friend to advocate for its cause 
 i understand my hon friend ’s important point we endorse the word of israeli president isaac herzog who be seek a compromise he recently say 
 in the midst of a deep and worrisome crisis the responsible act of leadership must be to sit and talk 
 what make this late tragic wave of violence even more concern be the emergence of new terror group in the palestinian territory such as the lions den and the jenin brigades alongside hamas and palestinian islamic jihad couple with the seem loss of control of the palestinian authority do my hon friend share my concern about the influence of outside actor namely iran in enable and encourage violence in the region 
 my right hon friend make an incredibly important point the action of iran be abhorrent and cause all sort of challenge in regional instability and they need to be call out 
 recently publish document reveal an ambitious peace project to establish a continuous land bridge directly connect israel to jordan and other arab state what step be the foreign office take to support our middle east ally on this welcome peace project 
 we welcome all step to help move forward with the middle east peace process and follow those particular point with interest 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the minister will have hear the strength of feeling across the house this morning recently in israel and the occupied palestinian territories we have see new illegal settlement announce increase violence and terrorist attack and a rise in civilian death all those step imperil a state solution yet the government ’s focus have be on their ill conceive and badly design economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill report suggest that our diplomat warn ministers that it would breach our obligation under un resolution be that true if so why be the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities   the right hon member for surrey heath michael gove undermine uk foreign policy 
 the shadow secretary of state be correct that these be really concern issue and there be a lot of passion on both side of the house the government ’s position be agree by the fcdo and all relevant government departments the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have write to the chair of the foreign affairs committee on that issue 
 if he will take step with his sri lankan counterpart to ensure accountability for alleged war crime in sri lanka 
 the foreign secretary meet sri lankan foreign minister ali sabry on   july when they discuss sri lanka ’s human right initiative we will continue to urge the sri lankan government to make meaningful progress on human right justice and accountability that include at the un human rights council where the uk and our partner make resolution on sri lanka in october last year 
 will the minister appeal to the   sri lankan government to ensure that the possible establishment of a south africa style truth and reconciliation commission do not mean that those responsible for war crime in sri lanka will not be bring to justice 
 we recognise the concern from some member of the sri lankan public and victim group about the creation of a credible domestic accountability process give the history of impunity and unfulfilled commitment we encourage the sri lankan government to create an environment for meaningful reconciliation by address those long stand and emerge concern that include ensure proper consultation sufficient consensus of key community and a commitment to accountability 
 human rights watch have report that tamil family look to memorialise those who die in sri lanka ’s civil war remain subject to intimidation and ban order alongside the minister ’s sri lankan counterpart what step be she take to promote free expression in sri lanka 
 as i say we all understand and see that long history of impunity and broken commitment we will continue to encourage the   sri lankan government to create that climate of recognition for all party and community make sure that no be leave out of that process 
 nearly year after the end of sri lanka ’s bloody civil war the sri lankan government continue to evade accountability and delay any scrutiny as the minister say instead of justice there be impunity last week ’s fcdo human right and democracy report recognise sri lanka as a priority so in simple term will the minister say when the uk will sanction those individual responsible for the bad human right abuse in that conflict 
 we will continue to urge the sri lankan government to uphold their constitutional and democratic process those concern be make clear in statement to the un human rights council most recently on   june impose sanction be response among other diplomatic tool to tackle serious human right violation and abuse but the shadow foreign secretary know well that it would not be appropriate for i to speculate about future designation because that could reduce the impact 
 what recent step his department have take to help meet the uk 's international climate finance commitment 
 as the prime minister set out at cop27 we be committed to spend £ on international climate finance over the timeframe originally envisage 
 i take some comfort from the minister ’s reply he will know that there have be much speculation and indeed some leak in the national medium that demonstrate real concern that the government be renege on their climate finance commitment could he explain to i and the cross party mp and peer who have write to the prime minister about this when the £ will be deliver in full break down by each year could the minister explain how the commitment will be meet and assure we that it will not be by raid the aid budget he will know that the money be mean to be new and additional it would be wrong for it to come at the expense of recipient who be expect that aid budget and should have it 
 the hon lady will have notice yesterday that there be a very considerable return of transparency in the figure publish by the foreign office she will have see that the allocation for aid for next year be nearly double what they be this year we have a commitment to great transparency and i expect to be able to publish in full how we will reach the £ probably in september 
 the minister will realise that £ be quite a lot of money how do the uk ’s international climate finance commitment compare to other g7 and g20 country or historically to before 
 we be a global leader on these issue as my hon friend know and we have set a lead part of that leadership but only part of it be in respect of money the uk have deliver extraordinarily on its commitment for example we meet our previous climate finance commitment include spend nearly £ between and 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the effect of climate change be intensify nasa have just report that june be the hot month ever record so it be important that    the government stand by their promise to double international climate finance will the minister at the dispatch box confirm that that be exactly what they will do or be the rumour that they be about to renege actually the case 
 the hon gentleman will have hear my response to   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas i can tell he that we be committed to triple our adaptation finance from £ in to £ by i hope he will wait with admit patience until september when we will be able to set all these figure out 
 what step he be take to support the right of woman and girl in afghanistan 
 we condemn the taliban ’s decision to restrict the right of woman and girl we be work with international partner to urge the taliban to reverse its decision to ban woman from work for the united nations and non governmental organisation and to deny girl access to education 
 i thank the minister for his answer as he say in afghanistan household lead by woman be effectively ban from leave the home and be therefore wholly dependent on female afghan aid worker with the taliban now effectively ban female aid worker from deliver humanitarian aid even a or week delay in reach family mean that mother be turn to appallingly unacceptable negative cop mechanism such as child marriage what be the impact assessment of the taliban ’s policy on the distribution of essential aid and what be the government do about it 
 the impact assessment be truly horrific the effect of the taliban ’s decision be absolutely appalling and we be work with other country to press the taliban to reverse its decision on education especially that on   march   and the ban on girl go to secondary school on the specific point the hon lady make we be do everything along with our likeminded ally and other with great influence on the taliban to try to rectify that 
 what step he be take to improve diplomatic relation with the indo pacific region 
 what progress his department have make on improve economic relation with the indo pacific region 
 as be make clear in the integrated review refresh publish a couple of month ago the government be commit to long term economic and security partnership with the indo pacific the foreign secretary be in jakarta last week for the association of southeast asian nations foreign ministers meeting meet regional and global partner the foreign secretary ever to attend that   meeting this weekend we sign the agreement there will be a discussion on this later pave the way for the uk ’s formal accession to the indo pacific trade block the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership which now cover an area with a total gdp of £ 
 with aukus sub at barrow and team tempest continue to progress at warton the uk ’s relationship with ally in japan and australia be not only defend our demographic value but create job in fylde and across the north west what assessment have the minister make of the role the skill of those work in the defence manufacturing industry have play in develop diplomatic partnership across asia and the pacific 
 our world lead defence industrial base underpin our national security british ingenuity and skill have therefore make we a seek after partner as be demonstrate by the global combat air programme with japan and italy and aukus with australia and the united states these enhanced partnership will help we collectively to deliver well security for our citizen and ally moreover aukus submarine will be base on the uk ’s world lead submarine design this project will bring extensive new job and skill to the uk as well as the opportunity to help australia in particular to build up a new cohort of expert 
 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to cambodia and laos may i ask what my right hon friend think the new and improve relationship in the indo pacific region will mean for uk trade 
 the indo pacific be important to uk security and to prosperity it be home to half the world ’s people at least british citizen live in the region and give the new trade deal with australia and new zealand the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the improved relation result from the uk ’s status as a dialogue partner of the association of southeast asian nations the importance of our relationship with the indo pacific include those with cambodia and laos in which regard my hon friend ’s work be hugely appreciate will continue to present opportunity to the uk and indeed protect our security 
 tomorrow thailand ’s parliament will vote for a time to choose a prime minister follow the may election win by the move forward party which be now lead an alliance of party oppose to the military junta that seize power in it be likely that move forward ’s leader pita limjaroenrat will again be block from take office by the senator in the upper house all of whom be appoint by the junta while the uk may not be well place to advise on the role of unelected chambers our country be a good friend of the thai people what representation have the foreign secretary make to the thai authority to let democracy take its course 
 we welcome thailand ’s strong show of support for democracy through the huge turnout in the may election and we look forward to work   with the new administration we continue to work closely through our team in thailand to support those who will make up the next parliamentary group 
 i be pleased to hear the minister talk about democracy in the indo pacific area but at present prime minister modi seem to be a very popular man in country around the world include the united states and this country should we not look laser like at his real record for instance his systematic persecution of christians in india and his takeover of press freedom and other civil liberty 
 we have a close and endure relationship with india we talk of a live bridge between our country and we be work closely with india on our road map however as with all our international partner with which we have close link we be happy to raise concern and we do so privately on a regular basis 
 what diplomatic step he have take to help strengthen nato unity 
 my right hon friend the foreign secretary engage regularly with nato ally and do so most recently at the nato leader summit in vilnius last week where ally be unite on the delivery of a strong package of support for ukraine that will bring it close to nato 
 the prime minister have make it very clear that the uk ’s position be that ukraine belong in the nato family what step be my hon friend take to help our other nato ally to reach the same conclusion 
 at the historic summit in vilnius nato leader agree that ukraine would become a member of nato at a time when ally agree and condition be meet like the foreign secretary i will continue to engage with nato ally and with ukraine not least because we know that ukraine be a hugely valuable and courageous partner in the defence of freedom 
 will the minister inform the house whether the government will be support or oppose ursula von der leyen ’s bid to become the next secretary general of nato give her lamentable performance as germany ’s defence minister i would urge the latter but it be clear that she have preferment and despite all her failure she have always fail upwards 
 no 
 whether his department have receive recent representation on the adequacy of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
 the uk be a state party to the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and work closely with partner to eradicate the use of torture 
 war manifest itself not just in today ’s combat but for future generation as a signatory to the convention on cluster munition the uk be aware of the reprehensible nature of these weapon will the minister assure we that us supply of those weapon to ukraine will not be allow through us airbase in the uk 
 the hon member make a point about cluster munition and the position of the british government be very clear we have sign the treaty against their use other country position be a matter for they but that be the very clear position of the british government 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the issuing of arrest warrant for hong kong national live overseas 
 the hong kong authority egregious targeting of individual live overseas be unacceptable the uk and our ally be swift in our condemnation and on   july at the foreign secretary ’s instruction his senior official conduct a démarche of the chinese ambassador with our ally we be develop a shared understanding of transnational repression its scale and its impact on our democracy 
 in the last week there have be repeat example of the chinese government ’s attempt to intimidate those who have bravely stand up for the freedom promise to hong kong do the minister accept that we must urgently improve our own protection of the hongkongers especially give our moral and legal responsibility and take the lead role in international discussion on how to protect the hongkonger community 
 we absolutely support the individual in the uk for bravely speak up and use their voice to challenge activity in hong kong we will always champion freedom of speech but i will not comment here on any support that may be in place as i do not wish to compromise that in any way 
 what discussion have my right hon friend have with the home secretary or other in the home office regard the availability if that be the word of chinese police station operate here in the united kingdom 
 early in july the foreign secretary set out that any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual or community in the uk will not be tolerate we have make it clear to the chinese authority that the existence of any undeclared   site sometimes know as secret police station in the uk be unacceptable their operation must cease the chinese authority have confirm that they have be close 
 many hongkongers have seek refuge not only here in the united kingdom but in other commonwealth jurisdiction principally canada and australia what work be the foreign secretary do with our counterpart in those country to ensure that there be a united and concerted effort to support hongkonger in those country in the face of china ’s repression 
 we work closely with our ally and friend and we be very proud as the uk to have make available british national overseas visa so far i think have take up the opportunity to be here in the uk 
 the chinese communist government have break british law in their threat against people legitimately give safety in the united kingdom if my right hon friend and other ministers have speak to their counterpart they will know that they have bring in sanction against official in hong kong and s freezing of asset what have we do and if as i suspect we have not do anything why not 
 as i say the foreign secretary ask a senior official to call in the chinese ambassador last week which he do highlight that the issuing of arrest warrant and bounty for individual live overseas be unacceptable we obviously continue to express our ongoing opposition to the imposition of the national security law and as my hon friend know we continue to consider the use of diplomatic tool include sanction where appropriate i can not discuss what we may do in future 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last week ’s intelligence and security committee report expose the consequence of more than a decade of conservative division inconsistency and complacency towards china it look rather like a bad ofsted school inspection report it describe the uk ’s approach to china as completely inadequate and it say it have leave we severely handicap in manage britain ’s future security national security be the responsibility of government what will the government do in response to this report to rectify their past mistake and raise their standard 
 the integrated review refresh publish in march set out very clearly the prime minister ’s strong and robust position on china the foreign secretary ’s speech at chatham house a few week later also identify that we will protect uk asset and interest that we will engage where appropriate that we will align with our international partner to ensure that issue we consider unacceptable to we the coercion we be see from china be be make very clear and that we will use the tool available to we as require 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the human right situation in kashmir 
 we recognise that there be human right concern in both india administer kashmir and pakistan administer kashmir we encourage all state to ensure that domestic law be in line with international standard any allegation of human right violation or abuse be deeply concern and must be investigate thoroughly and transparently 
 many of my luton south constituent have express concern at the recent appeal to change jammu kashmir liberation front leader yasin malik ’s sentence from life imprisonment to the death penalty due to be hear on   august the uk be home to significant diaspora community of pakistanis indians and kashmiris and emerge issue relate to kashmir have the potential to affect community cohesion if not handle sensitively will the minister ensure that the government conduct any action relate to kashmir sensitively and with consideration of the concern of the diaspora community 
 the hon lady be right that these be difficult situation and that we want always to reassure those who be here but it be not for the uk to comment on an independent judicial process in another country we encourage all state to ensure that their domestic law adhere to international standard on free and fair trial and that their treatment of detainee respect international obligation the uk government oppose the death penalty in all circumstance as a matter of principle in every country 
 we be approach the anniversary of the abrogation of article and the other temporary change to the indian constitution which be finally remove after more than year do my right hon friend agree that this mean equal right be restore to people in jammu and kashmir and particularly that woman now have the right to property which be deny under those temporary arrangement

 i can give my hon friend that assurance in november britain will host a major event in london focus on prevent child from starve to death and on prevent malnutrition and food insecurity 
 it be all good and well that the uk be host event but the reality be that the amount of money it have to invest in food security be decline because of cut to the aid budget and now because of the home office ’s use of official development assistance to house refugee if the home office really want people not to come here on small boat perhaps it would be well to spend that money on famine relief and food security so that people do not flee their country in the place

 last week thank to the british group inter parliamentary union a cross party delegation of parliamentarian visit serbia an incredible nation at an east west crossroad with an alluring tempestuous history and so much potential i impress upon they the need to work together for peace and prosperity in the balkans but they consistently express concern about the situation of the ethnic serb minority in kosovo what step be the minister take to help ease tension and ensure that the mayor of the serb majority municipality in kosovo be truly representative of the area that they serve

 in april member of the british israeli dee family be kill in an appalling terror attack the palestinian authority continue to proudly send hundred of million of pound to the terrorist behind these very same attack will my right hon friend join i in condemn this grotesque pay for slay policy 
 the uk have not directly fund the palestinian authority since official development assistance reprioritisation in we do not fund prisoner payment and we believe that the prisoner payment system should be reform so that it be need base transparent and affordable we continue to raise this at the high level with the palestinian authority 
 we talk of a state solution but we be witness an increase in illegal settlement and an increase in violence not least in jenin recently how be the secretary of state use the power of his office to set a new framework use the article of the un declaration on human right to bring about a movement towards peace so that we see not just talk but action 
 we remain committed to the middle east peace process and to find a way forward we use our convening power as the current president of the un security council and the foreign secretary will no doubt be discuss these issue while he be in new york at the un security council 
 most of nato include america canada france and germany have repatriate their citizen from detention facility in syria the united kingdom repeatedly refuse to do so and be now an international outlier british family be hold in syrian detention facility without charge or trial our independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have say that without action this will become our guantanamo will the foreign commonwealth and development office review this policy to avoid our suffer international embarrassment for fail to take responsibility for our own citizen

 i be grateful to the hon friend for raise that matter i will investigate and provide an update 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 thank you mr speaker and thank you for your strong response to the point of order last week on the threat against i by president vučić of serbia colleague here raise the daily report that we be receive about extreme identity violence in darfur which will only get bad as a uk penholder what be we do to create a protective wedge between civilian and the militia will my right hon friend show leadership at the dispatch box by declare these as crime against humanity because it matter that britain say that now 
 i fully understand what my hon friend be say about darfur she will know that i go there with david cameron in and see what be happen on the ground what george bush call a genocide we will do everything that we can to protect    the civilian there who be in great jeopardy today that involve the use of word as my hon friend say and action at the un we will do everything that we can as holder of the pen to ensure that progress be make 
 last month the un ’s world food programme announce the cessation of food aid in ethiopia follow the large scale diversion of supply the un have this week estimate that people in northern ethiopia be in need of food aid and severe malnutrition have increase by over the past year will the minister set out what the government be do to respond to this desperate humanitarian crisis 
 we be work incredibly closely with the un agency in particular the world food programme we be conscious of have investigate and i think have now deal with the issue of food be steal we announce recently that we would spend £ on humanitarian support in the horn of africa 
 i welcome the write ministerial statement on the international development white paper although an oral statement to the house would have be well how do my right hon friend the minister intend to achieve the consensual approach that be clearly his aspiration for international development and do he agree have hear many example this morning that nutrition and combat hunger must be at the heart of any strategy 
 i be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for his comment as he know we will hold a summit specifically on stop child starve to death in november i hope that the white paper will be announce at that summit but of course he be right this be a cross party white paper design to ensure that we reach the sustainable development goal which be way off target at this midway point and do something to combat the appalling danger that the world face and which we have see so graphically in recent day on climate change 
 for more than a year the house have be highlight the threat of atrocity crime return to sudan as the minister have hear again today cross party last week we see more mass graf and widespread and systematic identity base targeting of community how much evidence do the government need before they acknowledge those crime against humanity and act on their own policy to take effective action to prevent and respond to atrocity 
 the hon lady be entirely right in the language that she use about the atrocity take place in sudan and darfur that point have be extensively ventilate at this question time all i can say to she to add to what i have say already be that we be work very closely with our ally particularly the americans on precisely the subject that she have identify 
 murder rape and pillage continue on a massive scale across sudan as well as ensure that humanitarian aid get to those on the border and the financial sanction that we introduce last week will the ministerial team look far at way   to cut off the source of funding for this violence in particular by sanction al khaleej bank and omdurman national bank which be associate with the war general 
 my right hon friend who know a lot about the subject can rest assure that we be look at all possible sanction and other measure that we can take she refer to humanitarian access she will know that humanitarian worker have be murder during the course of the violence but we will do everything that we can to ensure that what she want to see happen happen 
 the department ’s travel advice be highly respect with observance consider mandatory by many business what advice will the minister give to a british organisation that need to send an employee to uganda advice that protect the right of that employee and their privacy while also protect lgbt+ employee in this country from exposure in uganda to its cruel anti- homosexuality act which criminalise lgbt+ intimacy and freedom of expression 
 the hon lady be absolutely right the british government and the whole house be appal by the law that have be pass by uganda we make very strong representation our high commission there work closely with affected group and we always keep travel advice under sharp and close review 
 child be able to play be something we take for grant yet minister will know from their travel that it be not something that all child around the world get to do play instil confidence build life skill enhance resilience and restore hope so will a minister commit to the house that they will take a lead role in the forthcoming un general assembly to support the resolution for an international day of play which be spearhead by a coalition of organisation such as lego and ikea to ensure that every child ’ right to play be protect 
 the idea of an international day of play be very important and we take it seriously i will pick the matter up with the noble lord ahmad and keep in touch with my hon friend 
 in the past decade more than people have be affect by climate disaster through displacement drought and food insecurity the climate crisis be both create and aggravating humanitarian emergency where be the ambitious strategy for uk aid to build resilience and offset the implication of climate breakdown 
 the hon lady be right to identify climate change as the great existential crisis of this era week ago we have the hot temperature see in the world ever on the monday it be then exceed on wednesday and exceed again on thursday way we have change how humanitarian work be do be by build in more adaptation and resilience when we deploy humanitarian support and we will go on do that 
 evidence suggest that malaria be on the move it have appear in part of the us and be creep across europe can the foreign office please confirm that it be serious about eradicate malaria and neglect tropical disease across the world and say what plan be be take if any to keep british people safe 
 my hon friend be entirely right i be recently in mozambique where they have manage to cut malaria infection by but we see that climate change be now lead to its increase again we will do everything we can to make sure that what have previously be a successful policy of malaria eradication get back on track as soon as possible 
 a loophole in the sanction regime have see russian steel process in turkey and export to the uk the increase in russian steel export to turkey in the last year alone show the extent of the problem the government have belatedly introduce a ban on import of such steel but without enforcement the ban will be meaningless can the minister tell the house what the government ’s plan be to enforce the ban on import of russian steel process in turkey 
 as i have say we continue to work on our sanction policy to ensure that we get to grip with any potential circumvention but it would not be appropriate for i to announce any future plan yet 
 whether it be the accession to the trans pacific partnership the free trade agreement with malaysia and brunei our foreign secretary at the association of southeast asian nations summit or the joint economic trade committee with indonesia on thursday the government be rightly do all they can to bring alive the benefit of our trans pacific and indo pacific pivot do my right hon friend agree that we in this house should all do everything we can to bring alive the potential for business in our nation whether in design frigate cyber edtech or anything else 
 mr graham do not push it too far i be not be funny it be totally unfair some member be not go to get in now 
 my hon friend be right the opportunity the indo pacific bring for uk citizen and business be enormous and we look forward to   the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership be more new opportunity for they to discover of the most exciting part of the world 
 follow up the question from my hon friend   the member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah a billingham constituent be regularly in touch with i her ugandan girlfriend live in fear of her life every day as new law have see more and more lgbt+ people persecute what more can the government do with our ally to help people such as my constituent ’s girlfriend and protect lgbt+ activist and human right defender in uganda 
 we be make representation as often as we can there be limit to what we can do but we be seek to stretch those limit as far as possible i speak to the ugandan foreign minister on   may   to underline our opposition to the anti homosexuality act and highlight its impact on the safety of lgbt+ people in uganda both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have speak to the ugandan foreign minister and the ugandan high commissioner in london 
 the environment food and rural affairs committee be finalise our report on food security which have come into sharp focus because of the pandemic and the war in ukraine with russia regrettably pull out of the black sea grain deal will my right hon friend reassure the house that the uk government be work closely with the un and nato ally such as turkey to restore that deal which be so important for food security across europe and in develop country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right of course we should make it clear that what russia be do be lead directly to people starve in africa everyone should understand that as well as the atrocious action that russia have take in invade a neighbouring country 
 the minister be aware of the arrest of yasin malik a kashmiri political prisoner whose only crime be oppose the indian military occupation of kashmir what talk have be have with the indian government about his death penalty 
 as i say in response to an early question the uk oppose the death penalty in every country in the world include india 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on the interim report of the post office horizon it scandal inquiry relate to compensation 
 i thank the right hon member for his question and his tireless campaign on this issue i be also grateful to sir wyn williams for his work and for publish his interim report we will of course consider that properly in the come day and provide a formal response to the house 
 sir wyn ’s report recap the progress make in deliver compensation he note our repeat commitment which i reiterate again that that compensation should be full and fair he note allegation from some lawyer that there be impediment to provide such compensation but say that he can not see any legal reason why we can not deliver our commitment he be right and that commitment will be deliver 
 sir wyn ’s recommendation deal with the advisory board of which the right hon gentleman be a member as he know the board be establish at the instigation of my department and its composition and remit be extend as a result of discussion between minister official himself and the rest of the board it have already perform a very valuable service notably its last meeting make recommendation about an appeal process independent of the post office we be consider that recommendation and will reply in due course 
 sir wyn also refer to the tax treatment of compensation payment the right hon member will acknowledge that when we work with he and the board on that matter it result in £ of additional payment in the historic shortfall scheme and exemption from income tax capital gain tax and national insurance contribution sir wyn also suggest that we should legislate to extend the deadline for the group litigation order compensation scheme 
 as we have state we will not let an arbitrary date stand in the way of pay full and fair compensation to postmaster as compensation be be deliver under the sole authority of the appropriation act spend on it be limit to a year window that close in august next year the government be determined to deliver compensation by that date that remain perfectly possible but challenging if it seem likely that we will not be able to compensate everyone in time we shall of course consider legislation as sir wyn recommend i want to deliver by that date not for some legalistic reason but in the interest of postmaster who have wait too long for justice 
 may i start by declare an interest as a member of the horizon compensation advisory board i thank the minister for his remark and for the positive and constructive approach with which he have address this issue i also thank sir wyn and the inquiry for their ongoing work i agree with many of sir wyn ’s recommendation i would be interested to know exactly   when they will be respond to especially because a lot of they be in the note that the advisory board send to the minister at the last meeting 
 the compensation scheme have become unwieldy but the fundamental point be that equal and fair compensation have to be pay to all the people across the scheme i would be interested to know from the minister when the recommendation will be address particularly on extend the remit of the advisory board i accept what he say our aim and certainly his be to get compensation to people as quickly as possible 
 the elephant in the room that need to be address be the continued obstructive role of the post office i find it remarkable that yesterday on bbc radio the chief executive nick read say that the sheer scale of the problem have 
 go above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect 
 that beg the question of what he have be do for the last year and why he have be accept bonus for his and his management ’s role in the inquiry 
 the inquiry be stall last week because again the post office fail to disclose document to it when be this issue go to be deal with it either get deal with or nick read and the entire board have to be sack the minister know because he have meet many of the people who be wait for compensation that they have go through a lot they need justice and they need action ill conceive comment from the present chief executive of the post office be rub salt in the wound of the victim either he have to go or something have to radically change at the post office 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his work he be right to say that there be scheme which might be describe as suboptimal as sir wyn have say on this occasion and previous occasion we be where we find ourselves and we must push on that be the easy way and the good way to get compensation for those affect 
 i refer in my initial remark to the request that the right hon gentleman have make for an appeal mechanism we be consider that carefully i think he would acknowledge that whenever he have come to i with something that he think we should consider we have always do that and be keen to deliver the mechanism that the board require 
 the delay in disclosure be unacceptable without question and the post office have apologise for that you be only as good as your last game and the post office have to up its game there be no doubt about it we have a governance review into early issue around remuneration and the metric regard bonus which be find to be completely inappropriate we be wait for that report which i should receive by the end of this month we will take that under advisement as we do any other evidence we receive about the operation of the board of the post office 
 i thank my hon friend for the update some individual have suffer incredible destitution and injustice for far too long this have go on for more than year and some people have die during this process will he ensure that   the post office own up to what it have do and that the individual who be responsible for cover this up year ago be bring to justice rather than this leave a stain on the reputation of the postmaster and postmistress who be totally innocent of any crime 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his work on this issue he be right people have pass away while await compensation it be simply unacceptable my department be look at creative way of accelerate the process of provide compensation to the victim 
 i agree with my hon friend about the need for people to be hold to account and i speak about that on a number of occasion from the back benches it be right that people be hold to account it be also right that due process be follow sir wyn williams ’s inquiry be there to identify what go wrong and why and who be responsible and once that be do we should make a judgment about what happen to those people but i be keen like my hon friend that people be hold to account 
 i call the shadow minister 
 prosecution all the postmaster involve have their own story of dream crush career ruin family destroy reputation smash and life lose innocent people have be bankrupt and imprison this may well be the large miscarriage of justice in our country ’s history and i pay tribute to member on all side of this house who have work for justice none more so than my right hon friend   the member for north durham mr jones i also thank the advisory board and sir wyn for their work as well as the minister for the constructive approach he have take on this issue to date 
 however as sir wyn ’s interim report make clear the compensation scheme for postmaster be a mess the commitment to give fair compensation should apply to all postmaster sir wyn specifically recommend that term of reference should enable the monitoring of individual case can the minister say that he will act on that recommendation and when can we expect he to respond in full to the report ’s recommendation include maximise the use of the horizon compensation advisory board and provide clarity about the tax status of compensation payment can he also provide a final figure for claim that have be make to the historical shortfall scheme and how much the government anticipate the final compensation will cost 
 i also ask the minister what he be go to do about post office management as the only shareholder in the post office do his department take responsibility for address those management issue the leadership team accept bonus for their work on the inquiry which be just unacceptable when will the minister deal with this sub postmaster have have their life ruin they must be confident that lesson will be learn from those failure sadly it seem that the post office have fail to do so 
 i add my thank to the advisory board and the right hon member for north durham but also to lord arbuthnot who be a tremendous campaigner in this area and other individual such as   professor moorhead who we be keen to include on the advisory board i also thank campaigner on both side of this house who make sure that the issue come to light and that action be take to address these horrendous situation 
 on individual case as i say to the right hon member for north durham we be look at sir wyn ’s recommendation there be an appeal mechanism and condition d of the term of reference do not prevent we from look to make sure that claim have be settle fairly and fully that be something we be look at and we will respond in due course on the tax position as i say early we have provide an extra £ to address that we be keen to make sure that not only all the settlement but all the tax treatment of those settlement be fair across the board on the total for the historical shortfall scheme we have make offer total over £ in value and £ have be accept so we have make good progress but we be keen to make further progress on the remain claim that be yet to be accept 
 on the post office management there have be a number of unacceptable matter relate to what have happen in the governance of the post office that be why we put in place a governance review which be be conduct by a very competent legal firm it be due to report by the end of this month we will study that review carefully and respond accordingly 
 the minister in place at the moment will realise that former colleague have stand at the dispatch box and give excuse the procrastination from his department have be terrible and the effect be ongoing fulsome and full compensation be to be welcome but the word that be miss from the minister ’s statement be timely therefore the part of my question be this why year why not month or week pay the compensation to the postmaster affect 
 the part of my question be about the senior management team so far they have get away with it they need to be hold to account as do their it consultant when will something positively be do to bring those people to book 
 again i know my hon friend be of the key campaigner on this particular issue i can not speak for previous minister although i have a great regard for my immediate predecessor certainly who have deal with this issue i have not see any procrastination and we be drive this as quickly as possible within the department 
 on why not week rather than year settle compensation claim be complicated it be about specific instance of pecuniary loss and non pecuniary loss it be complicated we be keen to get that money out the door as quickly as possible and as i have say we be look at creative way to do that i be just as ambitious as my hon friend be to get that money into the hand of the people who need it there have be interim payment of around £ on both outstanding scheme the glo and overturned conviction scheme nevertheless full and fair compensation be what we desire 
 on people be hold to account i refer my hon friend to what i say early we need to see the result of the inquiry that be what sir wyn williams be there   for and we need to see the outcome of his inquiry and where he can identify blame we be very keen to make sure those people be hold to account 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i do not know where to start there be so much but here i go the snp welcome sir wyn williams ’s interim report on compensation his recommendation would go a huge way to ensure that victim be fully and fairly compensate and it be about time the enhanced role for the horizon compensation advisory board be welcome as well but the question as hon member have already say be when be this all go to happen i know the minister can not give we an answer to that today but he update something i have in my note it be now claimant who have die without receive full and fair compensation we need to move this on 
 funnily enough we have a meeting of the all party parliamentary group on post office this morning at which the chief executive officer of post office ltd appear and answer some question the culture at post office ltd have not change since the new ceo take on his role in he promise to change the culture he have not yet do so we be mire in obfuscation still and we can not get to the truth of stuff because of the delay in provide evidence to sir wyn ’s inquiry will the minister agree to put pressure on the ceo to get this do 
 the hon lady be of the members of parliament i engage with more often than not in this place and she do a fantastic job not least in chair the all party parliamentary group on post office so i thank she for her work i agree with everything she say about the pace of delivery the quality of delivery from the post office and make sure it meet its obligation we have this constantly under review and we be drive this issue we be determined to look at creative way to accelerate compensation for all those affect by this so we can finally draw a line under the matter i accept we will not draw a line under it until we have hold people to account for what have go wrong so that be something we be extremely keen to do 
 where there have be such a grave miscarriage of justice it strike i that we should be pull out all the stop to ensure that justice be do and in a timely fashion so perhaps the government might consider bring criminal charge against the post office and its it adviser as a way of accelerate the process 
 on pull out all the stop i could not agree more and that be definitely what we be do in the department my day be never without or other post office issue which be not the situation we want on bring forward criminal charge of course the government do not do that but when our enforcement agency determine that there have be criminal action wherever those criminal action have emanate from we would of course expect they to take action 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 the victim of the post office horizon scandal should be fully compensate so that they be put back into the position they would have be in have they not be a victim of this miscarriage of justice in the place the minister have agree with that statement from the dispatch box before but it be not happen can i say that it be not a complicated process to be able to quantify their loss and to be able to compensate they fully my committee i understand the advisory board and the statutory inquiry have suggest that way to try to improve this be to remove the post office entirely from this process and to make it an independent process properly budget with the requirement to fully compensate the victim in the way i have describe why will the government not just do that 
 i thank the hon member for his work in challenge we in this area i would probably push back a bit it be complicated to assess loss both i and the right hon member for north durham sit in on a long call with the hss panel recently and some eminent lawyer give we a lot of confidence that this be be do right on an inquisitorial basis but it be complicated to assess those loss i would refer to sir wyn williams ’s comment he basically say that we should carry on what we be do he would not necessarily have advise this route in the place but what he say now be that the good thing we can do be push on with the framework we have in place there be different scheme we need to push they on more quickly of course and i be very keen to do that 
 as a former post office counter clerk myself i understand at hand how the horizon it debacle have a devastating impact on postmaster their family and their business will the minister assure the house that lesson have be learn from this terrible case 
 certainly we have learn the lesson in this place to heed those warning more quickly i be sure the new management of the post office have see what have go wrong and we be clearly keen to make sure it never happen again i do not think we will be able to say we have learn the lesson and this will not happen again until we have receive the final result of the inquiry and then decide what action can be take against the individual responsible because that will be the ultimate deterrent in stop these thing happen again 
 the significance of sir wyn bring forward an interim report of this sort be something that should not be underestimate i be with   the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows   in the appg meeting this morning and it be clear that as far as the chief executive of the post office be concern in deal with historical matter such as this he see it as a major barrier to change the culture within the post office whether that be a reason or an excuse remain to be see but he have to ensure that that barrier be remove so that there can be no further excuse about change the culture 
 i agree and we be determined to play our part in that of course i be very grateful for the report and i have read the recommendation clearly   there be a lot of detail in the report that i want to study and consider fully but i think it be very helpful i do not see anything in the recommendation i immediately object to as i say i want to make a good study of those thing but a number of different process have to take place we have to give due process the time to do its work in make sure that we establish exactly what have go on so that we can put those matter right 
 i like many other have sub postmaster who have suffer in this space i would just like to thank member across the house most notably the minister his predecessor my hon friend   the member for sutton and cheam paul scully   the hon member for bristol north west darren jones i be on the select committee when we be particularly look at this issue and thank he for his time on that and obviously   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   for his energy there could i just reiterate what so many have say and ask the minister to accelerate with all energy the payment to the victim and will he please follow through on the consequence for the post office leadership and its it consultant 
 i thank my hon friend for the point in his question and we absolutely agree that we need to accelerate compensation payment as i say we have make significant progress on the hss scheme for the other scheme the glo scheme and the overturn conviction scheme we need to get those payment resolve as quickly as possible there have be around £ of interim payment through those scheme but the full and fair compensation the final compensation be where we need to get to on hold people to account he will have hear what i say early and i absolutely agree with he on that point 
 the report state that there be 
 something like late application to be determine and that there may yet be significantly more 
 late application as well can the minister confirm that those application will be seriously consider and that those victim may be entitle to compensation can he provide an assessment as to whether the number i have quote be accurate or be actually high
