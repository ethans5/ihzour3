 i thank   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for raise this issue and for present his argument in the way that he do we have speak about this case on a number of occasion so he will know that i take responsibility for make sure that we make the correct decision on arap when i be on the opposition front bench where   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   be now sit i raise concern about the functioning of the arap scheme in office we have make change to the scheme to make sure that it function well which i will come to   the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain   mention communication and i believe   the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis   quote the secretary of state ’s comment on the triples review but i will address the issue raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green in the instance 
 i very much appreciate the right hon member ’s advocacy for the individual involve and his passion for afghan resettlement in general he be absolutely right to say that we owe an obligation to the people who serve alongside uk force what we have do with the arap scheme be implement as a nation under the last government and this probably the most generous afghan relocation scheme of any of the ally that serve in afghanistan and we have draw a set of eligibility criterion that with the exception of the triples which i will come to in a moment have broadly remain the same under this government and the precede government i hear the right hon gentleman ’s concern about element of that which i will seek to address 
 as a former minister he will know that i will not be able to address the individual circumstance of the case without permission so i will make some more general remark in respect of that individual case however i hope the right hon gentleman will not mind my saying that we have meet previously on this matter and i very much understand and appreciate his ongoing engagement i have to be honest with he and say that when he and i speak about this case and i be brief on it i too be surprise by the decision that be make that be why i undertake to take it back to the department and to check on the eligibility of the case which i do have do that i be confident that the official have follow the publish criterion and apply they correctly to the evidence provide the decision be appropriate and should stand i should also be clear that there be no plan to ask to expand the criterion which be implement by the previous government 
 i do however recognise the context of this particular matter and i be happy to take up the right hon gentleman ’s challenge to see whether exceptional route may be available i do not want to give he false hope i be not certain there will be such a route but have speak to he previously about this i know the seriousness of the matter he raise and i be happy to see whether we could look at additional opportunity to provide support in this case 
 when it come to the publish criterion for arap we must be absolutely clear about eligibility and it be my job as the minister responsible for afghan resettlement to make sure that decision be make correctly against the publish eligibility criterion where decision have be make an individual have access to a review and where there be a concern over an individual ’s security while that review be ongoing especially circumstance in which the life and safety of that individual be threaten there be the ability to request an expedite decision 
 i entirely understand where the right hon gentleman be go with that argument under the criterion in the scheme we inherit from the previous government which we have continue we have make the decision with the exception of the triples to keep the eligibility decision the same 
 let i turn to the triples which the right hon gentleman raise i believe that the quote of the secretary of state when in opposition be in relation to the very concern situation i believe it be a concern to he and to i when in opposition that decision be make in respect of the afghan special force the triples that be inconsistent with the evidence that be be provide we back and call for the triples review which be initiate by my predecessor in the previous government phase of that review have now complete and we have achieve an overturn rate of around a write ministerial statement on that be publish i think last month should the right hon gentleman want to refer to the full detail 
 in that work we interrogate the datum that be available the record keeping of that period be not good enough as i have say from the dispatch box a number of time since take office as part of that trawl we discover information in relation to top up payment which previously have be exclude from the criterion because they do not constitute the relationship with the uk government that would have create eligibility our belief be that the way those top up payment be apply may now constitute a relationship that need to be re examined so phase of the triples review which will be the final phase of the review be look at top up payment it be right to do that because there be a clear point 
 in the case raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green i be very happy to try to see what be available to support it i feel very deeply that we need to honour our obligation to those people who serve alongside our force from the afghan translator and interpreter who live in the constituency i represent to the people who fight and in some case die alongside our force the arap scheme be a generous scheme but it be not intend at its point of initiation or now to cover all afghans who fight in that conflict over year it be design to support those who we can evidence have a close connection to uk force often define by a contractual or payment relationship in blunt plain english term where a   sizeable commitment have be make that draw a line for some individual who be employ by the afghan national army the afghan government and element of the security structure that the afghan government have at that time for which eligibility be not create despite their role the taliban regime have create chaos instability and terror through many community in afghanistan since our departure that be why as a government we be try to accelerate and deliver the afghan scheme 
 the hon member for north east fife mention communication that be entirely right it be something i have be raise since become a minister we will introduce from the autumn a new series of communication design to help people understand where their application be in the process the new performance indicator will kick in from september time roughly in the autumn and that will seek to help people to understand where they be in the process there be concern around understanding for how long a case will be deal with i also hope the performance indicator will have time bind target to help people be able to rate the performance of the ministry of defence certainly when the defence secretary publish his statement on the afghan resettlement scheme at the end of last year he make the case that we need to complete our obligation and bring the scheme to a close and it be our objective to do so 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what step he be take to strengthen emergency preparedness 
 the government be take a range of measure to strengthen our emergency preparedness later this year we will update a national pandemic response exercise and undertake a full test of our emergency alert system in april the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster also open the new uk resilience academy which will train up to people a year the government will shortly publish our update resilience strategy 
 we seem to get once in a generation weather event once every couple of year these day although some party on the opposition benches do not want to take their responsibility in that regard seriously i know that this government will on flooding the village of king ’s bromley in my constituency have suffer on several occasion over the past few year because all of the road lead to the village have be cut off although there have be no property flooding what step be the minister take to measure and mitigate the impact of that type of serious flooding 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and for raise the issue in king ’s bromley we be work closely with our colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs who be responsible for manage significant flooding this include the flood resilience taskforce which i co chair with the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy early this year we announce that we would commit a record £ to build and maintain around flood defence to protect life home and business which be a uplift per annum on what the previous government be spend 
 i thank the minister for her answer when it come to strengthen emergency preparedness i have to point out that flood do not just   happen in london or cardiff they also happen in northern ireland which have the same problem have the minister have the opportunity to talk to her counterpart in the province to ensure that when it come to emergency preparedness the department and the council that have responsibility in this area work together as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland so that we can do the same thing wherever we live 
 we like to work with the northern ireland executive on this issue it be important that we share good practice and deal with the problem across the board 
 what step he be take to strengthen cyber security 
 what step he be take to improve national resilience against cyber security threat 
 cyber defence be an important part of our national security with daily attack against government business and individual member across the house will have see the recent attack against british household name such as marks spencer and the co op and indeed the government ’s own legal aid agency early this week the prime minister announce that responsibility for public sector and government cyber security will sit with the department for science innovation and technology that will strengthen technological resilience by well integrate cyber security and expertise into the government digital service 
 in recent week we have see a series of cyber attack on retailer include on my former employer marks spencer and on government service such as the legal aid agency will the minister update the house on what discussion he have have with the uk ’s national cyber security centre and other to ensure that these incident be deal with as swiftly as possible and that more be do to prevent such attack succeed in the future 
 early this week i meet the chief executive of the national cyber security centre which work with impact organisation to investigate what have happen and who be responsible and to help they rebuild it have be work with all the organisation that have be hit by recent cyber attack i also make a speech about these issue at the cyberuk conference in manchester a few week ago 
 i thank the minister for his answer as have be mention we have recently see attack against private institution with group such as marks spencer be target i would be very interested to learn about the approach that have be take by the statutory organisation and those in the military sphere but i would like to know what effort have be make to protect private business from cyber attack and to   ensure that my constituent in mid dunbartonshire and people across the uk have access to their daily essential 
 the hon member be absolutely right the national cyber security centre offer advice guidance and tool such as cyber essentials to business to help they prepare as good they can for attack unfortunately organised crime carry out some of these attack and the extortion of money be often at their root it be really important that government business and individual prepare as good we can to act against the bad actor who be try to explore cyber vulnerability and often as i say extort money 
 i call shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster 
 the government ’s own cyber expert innovate uk have warn the government that the propose chinese embassy at the royal mint threaten to compromise the telephone and internet exchange that serve the financial city of london the expert be now tell the government what everyone else have know all along the super embassy pose a super risk yet the deputy prime minister ’s office have say that any representation on the planning application have to be make available to the applicant perhaps the real deputy prime minister can clear this up be the government seriously say that if mi5 or gchq have concern about security on this site those concern will have to be pass to the chinese communist party or have the deputy prime minister get it wrong 
 when it come to both engagement with china and with an issue like this we will engage properly while always bear in mind our own national security consideration the approach we do not adopt be to withdraw from engagement which the previous government do for a number of year flip flopping from that to the previous era that they call the golden era we will engage with china when it be in our economic interest but we will always bear our national security interest in mind 
 the previous government do not engage sorry they do not disengage at the heart of this be simple fact the government already know that this site be a security risk it be a security risk to the city of london and through it our economy and the economy of all nation that trade in london secondly the government have the power to block it ireland and australia have both already block similar embassy development why be this government too weak to act 
 the hon gentleman be right the time when he say that the previous government do not engage enough as i say a decision on this application will be take with full consideration of our national security consideration those consideration be always part of these decision and our engagement with china and other country where i agree with he be that when it come to national cyber security we must bear in mind state threat as well as non state threat and that be very much part of our thinking as we respond to what be go on in the cyber sphere 
 hopefully lancashire will help with that with the new centre at samlesbury 
 what progress he have make on join up government 
 we have be clear from the outset that we want to govern in a join up way though as we all know the dna in the departmental system be strong and have last a long time deliver our plan for change will require departments to work together whether that be to build more house give child the good start in life today we announce access to free school meal for child of people on universal credit or to protect the country against crime and security threat it be very important that these be not goal of departments but of the government and that be why we work together to achieve they 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer bury st edmunds and stowmarket be privileged to   host thousand of servicemen and servicewoman from raf honington raf lakenheath and raf mildenhall they play a crucial part in the life of our town and village can the minister assure i that the ministry of defence be work with other departments to ensure that place such as bury st edmunds and stowmarket will benefit from the announcement in the strategic defence review in the form of job housing investment and apprenticeship 
 my hon friend raise an important point when the prime minister announce the strategic defence review a few day ago he be clear that the uplift that have be approve by the government in defence spending be a matter not just of the ministry of defence budget but of industrial policy and skill policy for example we have announce an extra £ for munition over the next year create new munition factory and over job it be really important that these investment be of benefit to different part of the country as we make the necessary investment to improve our defence and national security in response to a change world 
 i welcome the minister ’s word on want a more join up government but i have concern that the department for transport and the ministry of housing communities and local government be not work well enough together both generally and specifically on cross solent transport to the isle of wight will he encourage well joint working between those departments both generally and specifically for that most important issue for my constituent where clearly local government and transport need to work together to create regulation to improve passenger experience 
 the hon member make a strong point i spend every day encourage department to work together but he will have hear i say that departmental dna be strong he be right that if we want to achieve thing we must overcome departmental dna   sometimes and ensure that department work together to deliver good project that be exactly what we be try to do 
 a key function of join up government be join up procurement and i have have the pleasure of work with the crown commercial service as a supplier for over year there be an ongoing issue that the ccs run its major procurement during holiday exercise and this summer be no different the construction professional service framework which be worth billion of pound have be delay and will run over the summer mean business and family have to cancel summer holiday and change their plan what more be the department do to address the culture in the ccs of buyer know good and not respect supply chain 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of the ccs we have task the ccs with work with supplier and review how it run framework to maximise the spend with small and medium sized business that should include the timing of the framework so that everyone can take part as well as possible 
 a couple of week ago the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster make a statement at cyberuk about the golden valley development in my constituency which be welcome in the constituency since then a decision have be make on join up government with the function of public sector and on government cyber security move from his department to the department for science innovation and technology be he have discussion as part of that process to ensure that his dsit colleague be well aware of the huge opportunity and the risk to that project at west cheltenham 
 i refer to the machinery of government change that we announce a few day ago we be build up a real sense of expertise in dsit and we think it make sense to make that change to bring together the operational and security part of cyber policy i be sure that my colleague in dsit be well aware of the hon member ’s view and of the importance of the issue that he raise 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 the historic deal that we sign with the eu on   may   be in our national interest and good for bill border and job it slash   red tape and bureaucracy boost british exporter and make life easy for holidaymaker indeed i be delighted to confirm that faro airport in portugal will start the roll out of e gate access to uk arrival this week 
 after year of closed door under the conservative party i warmly welcome this labour government ’s landmark deal with the european union and the opportunity that it will open up for our young people again i welcome in particular the commitment to work towards a youth experience scheme and to explore a return to the erasmus programme will the minister set out what progress the government have make on the talk thus far and will he reassure the young people in my constituency that we will move at pace to deliver 
 we have agree that we will work towards a balanced capped and time limit youth experience scheme we will also work towards erasmus+ association on much well financial term for the uk the exact parameter will be subject to negotiation but we want to move forward as quickly as possible 
 i be so pleased that there be cross party agreement in welcome a new youth experience scheme my young constituent in bath be unequivocal that they want the uk to join erasmus+ again because that give they the good opportunity for study training and internship abroad will the minister reassure my young constituent in bath that join erasmus+ will be of the high priority for the government as they enter into further negotiation with the eu 
 certainly there will be great opportunity for young people both in the youth experience scheme and in associate with erasmus+ i too welcome the cross party consensus even the shadow minister   the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood back the youth experience scheme in the debate a couple of week ago 
 today be start to feel like a bit of a love in last week i meet a group of constituent who present i with a petition that demand well access for young people to learn and work in the eu i have hear the minister ’s response to the last question but will he reassure those young people in my constituency that there will be opportunity for they to learn and work in the eu in the very near future 
 we will see how long the love in will last none the less the deal provide great opportunity for young people as i indicate a moment or ago we will work towards establish a balanced youth experience scheme that be time limit capped and subject to visa control like the we already have with different country around the world 
 local business across ashford hawkinge and the village have warmly welcome the new agreement that this government have sign with the european union tell i that it will make it easy for they to sell their product to our large trading partner do the minister agree that to build on that agreement everything possible should be do to find long term solution to current post brexit uncertainty such as   the entry exit system and the regular deployment of operation brock on the m20 to help uk base business far develop trading link with europe 
 my hon friend ’s local business be in agreement with many other that welcome the package with the eu it cut red tape and open up access to the eu market 
 on operation brock the deployment be a decision for the kent and medway resilience forum but the department for transport and kent partner be work to keep it and other traffic management measure under review to ensure that they be design and implement in the most effective way through action such as traffic forecasting use well datum and explore the use of ai for that purpose 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i do not know how much long the love in will last hon member aw i will start off nicely 
 the minister have be commendably clear that the youth mobility scheme must be cap and have make comparison with agreement reach by the previous government with country such as australia canada and uruguay he will know that last year youth mobility visa be issue to australian national to canadians and just to uruguayans will he be equally clear in set out what he think would be a reasonable level for that cap or be it just a matter of whatever brussels tell he he have to accept 
 it certainly will not be it will be subject to negotiation i genuinely welcome the opposition ’s support for a youth mobility scheme i think it come as a bit of a surprise to some of their back benchers in that debate but none the less i welcome it what i have say and this be what the wording of the common understanding set out be that it have to be balance capped and time limit that be the negotiation we will take forward 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be go to resist all attempt to involve i in a love in however the liberal democrats very much welcome the progress that have be make in the uk eu reset we be particularly pleased to see the prime minister listen to our long stand call on a defence fund on a veterinary scheme and on youth mobility or youth experience whatever we be call it now the minister know that i be go to continue to press he on the matter we welcome the announcement but we need more certainty of the scheme ’s scope and timescale i be think particularly of those young people who want to start make plan for their future perhaps not for this summer but maybe for next will the youth experience scheme be open to they can they start to plan for experience in the eu may i press the minister for more detail on the timeline for introduce the scheme 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her support in fairness she have be supportive of the youth experience scheme throughout have   secure the agreement at the summit we will obviously move now into a different phase of the negotiation look at implementation whether that be in term of the link with the emission trading system the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement or the youth experience scheme we obviously want to move forward as quickly as we can with implementation 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of the new trading relationship with the eu 
 there be no question but that the new arrangement we have with the european union will grow our economy it will put more money in the pocket of work people and the proof will be there for all to see as it ease pressure on food price and cut red tape more prosperity more safety more security but unfortunately it seem that the opposition ’s position be to unpick all of that 
 the government continue to celebrate last month ’s late eu surrender deal continue their long term ambition to undo the result of a democratic vote that their leadership have never agree with and   be do its good to reverse at every opportunity the government have already prove that when labour negotiate britain lose can the minister reassure the house that this government have no further intention to surrender any more hard win brexit freedom 
 the only thing that have be surrender be the credibility of the conservative party this government have use the independent post brexit trade policy to secure a deal with india a deal with the united states and a deal with the eu that be good for job good for bill and good for border the conservatives will have to explain at the next election why they want to undo all of it 
 what step he be take to relocate civil service role to location outside london 
 what step he be take to relocate civil service role to location outside london 
 the state have to reform to secure well value for money and outcome for the public and to ensure that government well reflect the country it serve i often say that i want a civil service that speak with all the accent of this great country we be committed to half of uk base senior civil servant be base outside london by the end of the decade last month we confirm plan to relocate thousand of civil service role to town and city across the country the aim be to bring the civil service close to local community and to bring good employment prospect to different part of the country 
 i welcome that reply and it be really progressive that the government be now relocate job away from london but can i urge the minister to look closely at how people in place like my constituency of blyth and ashington people everywhere in rural and semi rural constituency as well as in more urban one can benefit from this fantastic policy we all need to be able to benefit from this policy not just certain people in city constituency 
 i very much hear what my hon friend say i can not stand here and say that there will be a civil service location in every single constituency in the country but we be happy to have dialogue with mps and local authority from all part of the country to get the big benefit possible from these decision to locate civil service job around the country the truth be in this day and age not everyone have to work in central london we can get well value for money and as i say a public service that be close to the public it serve 
 i particularly welcome the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say that he would like to hear more accent from different part of the country in the civil service billingham in stockton north be home to the uk ’s big biomanufacturing cluster and we be also somewhat expose to international trade with our steel chemical and automotive sector i very much welcome the expansion of the darlington economic campus in the area of business and trade do my right hon friend agree that this will provide good job for my constituent in stockton and billingham and will he ensure that policy implementation be close to the source of economic activity 
 we have the former prime minister   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak with we today he push for the darlington economic campus which be a good innovation and i know the current chancellor of the exchequer value it greatly we want not just to relocate job though that be important but to have thematic campus that can build up real area of expertise whether in digital skill financial skill energy skill and so on to make a real difference to the community in which these office be locate 
 i thank the cdl for what he say because the darlington economic campus have be a huge success it recently pass the milestone of job but crucially of those people be recruit locally provide opportunity for constituent in my rural area and across the north east as we have hear 
 the darlington economic campus be also pioneer a very strong cross government approach to working which be help to combat the strong departmental dna that the cdl mention will he join i in praise the leadership team at dec for establish themselves as an indispensable part of government policymake and will he join i in ensure that darlington can serve as a model template for other campus across the uk 
 i join the right hon gentleman in praise the leadership team at dec he touch on a very important point because we do not want just to   relocate job we want people to have a good career path too in some of the civil service office i have visit around the country since last year people have raise the question can i pursue a career here that get i promote it can not just be about relocation it have to be about the chance to build a career in these place 
 my party be pleased to hear the announcement that gb energy be come to aberdeen which we have consistently say be the only sensible place for it as member would expect an aberdeen mp to say give that gb energy will bring a maximum of job over the next year will the right hon gentleman please encourage his ministerial colleague not to suggest that those job will replace the job a fortnight that we be set to lose in the offshore energy industry over the next year 
 investment in renewable be an energy policy but it be also an economic and employment policy i can assure the hon member that investment from both the public sector and the private sector will see many good new job create in new source of energy over the come year and decade 
 i welcome the relocation of civil service job across the country with a recent study show that dudley have high level of economic inactivity what reassurance can my right hon friend give i that young people in dudley will have every opportunity to build their career in the civil service whether through training apprenticeship or mentorship 
 my hon friend will not be surprised to hear my strong enthusiasm for great employment opportunity for young people in the black country when we make the announcement about the relocation last week we also announce a new apprenticeship scheme because we not only have to change location we also have to change recruitment pattern if we be really to get a civil service that speak with all the accent of the country 
 when the minister be move civil service job outside london may i remind he that there be much more to the north than just manchester and leed why be the government move the information commissioner ’s office away from wilmslow to manchester and what assessment have be do of the impact of that move on the economy of wilmslow 
 mr speaker as you can see this issue will prompt a lot of member to stand up for their area and they be quite right to do so as we do this we will try to bring thing together in a way that create real expertise and it be not just about city it be about other urban and semi urban area too the technology that allow we to move job outside london also allow we to do that 
 what recent engagement his department have have with the intelligence and security committee 
 the intelligence and security committee do important and valuable work the cabinet office engage constructively with the committee and will continue to do so over the come month we have agree to the committee ’s request uplift on budgeting and resourcing which should help it do its job properly over the course of the next parliament we be also work with the isc to identify the good operating model 
 have the minister have a discussion with the intelligence and security committee as to why our normally sophisticated operation have not succeed in make any significant dent in smash the gang and stop the boat perhaps he might ask the committee whether its view be that such be the pull factor and the desperation of these people that the only way we will stop the boat be to do what my right hon friend   the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak   be go to do arrest they deport they and send they back to where they come from 
 i be not quite sure that be the previous government ’s plan maybe the right hon gentleman wish it be this be a hugely important issue for we it be a security issue as well as an immigration issue of course international policing and security operation to stop these gang and this trade be a vital part of try to combat it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the intelligence and security committee of parliament be unique make up of privy counsellors from both houses however last month the committee take the highly unusual step of publicly criticise the government for their failure to allow the committee the staff and independence to fulfil its role oversee the circa £ annual spend for which 
 there be no oversight capability 
 the committee be lead by an experienced labour peer and it just want the basic to have staff who be not totally beholden to the cabinet office so that they can do their job on behalf of parliament and the country and to meet the prime minister the work of our intelligence service have never be more important give the grey zone that state be act within at the moment which must be properly oversee 
 i ask a write question about when the prime minister would deign to meet the committee the parliamentary secretary cabinet office   the hon member for erith and thamesmead ms oppong asare say that be be arrange have that now happen i also ask write question about the independence and resource of the committee and be tell that discussion be ongoing on a matter of this seriousness do parliament not deserve more than fob off half answer and will the minister provide further detail now 
 i do not think the shadow minister listen to my answer for the avoidance of doubt i say that we have agree to the committee ’s request uplift on budgeting and resourcing of course the prime minister will be happy to meet the committee at a convenient time that both can agree 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of increase the year time limit for civilian gallantry award 
 civilian gallantry award rightly recognise the bravery of people who put themselves at risk to save or attempt to save another person ’s life honours policy be not the gift of ministers as it be oversee by the committee on the grant of honours decorations and medal however long stand practice over many decade be that the incident must have take place in the last year and the only exception to this be where legal proceeding be ongoing 
 i thank the minister for her answer and for meet i she know that i have be support the family of pc taylor and ds hunt in the search for recognition of their bravery which result in their death some year ago they can not understand why there be a committee to consider historic military medal but not civilian one it appear to they that set of people who put themselves in harm ’s way to protect our country can be recognise but another set can not i appreciate what the minister say but can we look at institute an equal committee for civilian honour these family just want the proper recognition that historical administrative failure prevent they from receive 
 i know that the hon member be frustrate and have work really hard on this i express my deep sympathy to the family of ds hunt and pc taylor i be sure she will agree that it be good that their family be award the elizabeth emblem by his majesty in december in recognition of the sacrifice they make honours policy be not in the gift of ministers as i mention it be set out by the committee on the grant of honours decorations and medals i recognise that she have write to the chair of the committee on this issue and i be sure he will reply 
 i call dr caroline johnson not here 
 what recent progress he have make on establish an infected blood compensation scheme 
 what recent progress he have make on establish an infected blood compensation scheme 
 payment to infected people start at the end of last year the government expect payment to affected people to start by the end of this year the infected blood compensation authority which be independent of government publish update figure fortnightly as of   june it have contact people to begin a claim and make offer to people   total £ there be much furth to go but progress be be make in deliver justice to the victim of this devastating scandal 
 in wirral west my constituent become a victim of this scandal over year ago when she be a child and it have affect her life ever since in her own word victim have go through horrible level of distress and now they wait for compensation that wait be not just for financial security it be for closure could the minister please give i and my constituent assurance that the speed at which the payment will be make will be ramp up 
 my hon friend ’s constituent be entirely right to talk about the deep distress that victim have be through ibca be contact an average of people to start their claim every week and expect to have bring into claim all those who be infect and register with a support scheme this calendar year i will continue to support ibca to deliver compensation as quickly as possible 
 the infected blood inquiry hear from black and asian victim who say that they be even more dramatically let down due to discrimination which have help to create an understandable mistrust of the authority and a lack of faith that justice will be do please could the minister ensure that he do all he can to reach out to all community to encourage everyone who be entitle to apply for the compensation scheme to do so 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the need to reach out to all community and ensure that every single victim secure justice i assure she that that be absolutely what the government be commit to do 
 i welcome the progress that be be make by ibca of course the minister be not directly responsible for how quickly that be roll out i note that ibca have announce that its plan be to prioritise those infect who be still alive indeed my constituent daryn craik be contact last week i suggest that the minister set up a metric that ibca could agree to for the time between when people be contact and when they receive their payment he could then report that interval back to the house which would hold ibca to account on the delivery for these infected people who have suffer for too long 
 i again pay tribute to my predecessor as paymaster general for the work he do in stand up for the victim of this scandal he be right to raise the case of his constituent and about the balance between respect ibca ’s independence and the lever assistance and support that minister and i specifically can offer to ibca i would be more than happy to have a discussion with he about his specific suggestion 
 my constituent phill be of the people in the special category mechanism who be suddenly and inexplicably exclude from the government ’s infect blood compensation scheme when it be publish in february   this year even though the government ’s expert group have say in august last year that they should be compensate why do the criterion inform the eligibility for the scheme change without explanation and can the minister please provide a list of all the condition include in the core award 
 the hon lady be right to raise this issue component of the scm criterion be plan in both the core award and the supplementary route and those in receipt of scm payment can continue to receive those payment under the infected blood support scheme route however as i say in my evidence to the inquiry only a few week ago that be a matter that i will consider far 
 what step he be take to reform the civil service 
 we want to see a civil service that deliver for the public the reform that we be push through include great adoption of technology relocate civil service job around the country as we have discuss and critically a focus on outcome in key public service area not just the process that lead to they 
 many of my chelmsford constituent be civil servant who travel into london most day of the week to perform their job last month a centre for economics and business research report reveal that the uk may need more public worker by to maintain the same level of output due to fall in productivity in the sector however the cabinet office have refuse to comment on report in recent day that the government plan to cut the number of civil servant by by the end of the decade which will have an impact on my chelmsford constituent will the minister confirm today whether a cut to civil service headcount be plan and if any of that will take the form of compulsory redundancy 
 it be fair to ask for productivity improvement from civil servant on behalf of the taxpayer we have have an increase in hire over the past year we do not have a target for a headcount reduction that be try under the last government and do not work but we do have a target for reduction in admin and overhead spend we want to work with civil servant on how that will be do i say to the hon lady that when the taxpayer be commit fund to public service we want to ensure we get maximum productivity in the public sector we can not just resign ourselves to lower productivity and the answer always be to hire more people 
 how be the cabinet office work with the department of health and social care to bring down waiting list not just in blackpool but across the uk 
 my hon friend will know that waiting list have fall by around since the election we set an aim of extra appointment in the   year we have not have extra appointment but and the year be not yet over we be work closely with the department of health and social care on that we know it be just the start it be a good start but we have a long way to go to get the health service back to the level that we want to see 
 what recent progress his department have make on strengthen national resilience 
 in april we launch the uk resilience academy we will be undertake a full national pandemic response exercise that will test the uk ’s capability plan protocol and procedure in the event of another major pandemic i have engage with a wide range of stakeholder to identify the gap as a result we have develop a new risk vulnerability map to identify area with high number of people who may need more support in a crisis 
 after a decade of under investment in our critical mineral industry the conservative government have leave the uk wildly over reliant on chinese supply chain in order to strengthen our national economic resilience do the minister agree that the uk ’s industrial strategy must support rapid acceleration of domestic production and processing of critical mineral 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the industrial strategy which will be publish shortly it will set out our vision to deliver growth and economic security and resilience alongside that the government be work closely with industry to publish a new critical mineral strategy this year to help secure our supply chain for the long term and drive forward the green industry of the future 
 economic resilience be a key part of our national resilience of the strong way in which the government can have it be to support the delivery of good and service via british company in the instance do the minister agree can he update the house on what step the government be take to bolster procurement policy so that they put british supply chain 
 this government be commit to work with and support british industry that have be at the heart of our plan for delivery which be why we have work across and engage with industry our industrial strategy be key to ensure that that happen 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since our last oral question session the government have secure a historic agreement with the european   union that remove a huge amount of cost and bureaucracy from our food and drink industry that back british job and that will help british consumer i thank the paymaster general for all his excellent work on secure that agreement we have also set out detail of how we will reform the state move thousand of civil service job around the country and launch a new apprenticeship scheme so that young people wherever they live have a well chance of good work in the public service 
 this week i uncover the government ’s shocking decision to designate the oxford to cambridge railway line as an england and wales project it be clearly nothing of the sort and the decision will cost wales £ worth of funding for our own network will the minister commit to devolve full rail infrastructure power to wales in this parliament 
 i urge the hon member to have a little patience until the spending review in a few day time we get a taste of it yesterday with the chancellor announce funding for major transport project around the country we be invest in public service not just in england but right across the united kingdom the hon member will hear a lot more about that in a few day time 
 despite the majority of hereditary peer leave the other place and the limitation post- election on the opposition ’s ability to appoint new peer the house of lords will remain disproportionately dominate by opposition peer why not tweak the fowler recommendation set a new limit of and legislate for that in the last year of this parliament when that be block as it will be why not leave reform of the house of lords to be an issue at the next general election 
 i thank my hon friend for his innovative suggestion he rightly point out that follow the passage of the house of lords hereditary peers bill the opposition will remain the large party in the other place that bill which we be keen to see on the statute book as soon as possible be the step in lords reform the government set out in our manifesto a number of proposal to bring about a small more active chamber that well reflect the country it serve 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have already tell the house about plan for a reduction in civil service number since he come into office how many civil service role in the cabinet office and its agency have be eliminate 
 we hope to see a reduction of around in cabinet office number over the next few year we have institute a voluntary exit scheme which will make the management of headcount easier and will come into force very soon 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster very skilfully talk about the future rather than the past year i will let he know that during the past year the number of role in his department and its agency have increase by that can not give the house a great deal of confidence that his future cut will be effective will he guarantee that that be a off and that he will go back and ensure that the cabinet office be actually reduce in size 
 the hon gentleman be part of a government who regularly produce headcount target for civil servant that be about as reliable as the immigration target that the conservatives also produce i have make it clear that we do not seek a particular headcount target it depend on what people do we be try to reduce the overhead spend but we be prepared to hire more people when it come to frontline public service delivery that be why we be hire more teacher and get the waiting list down we be not adopt the hon gentleman ’s approach therefore i will not fall into the trap that he be try to set 
 business in my constituency often complain about the shocking brexit deal that the conservative party give we with more cost more red tape and more paperwork that be why labour member welcome the new eu deal negotiate by this government can the minister set out how business in my constituency in loughborough shepshed and the village will benefit from our new grow up relationship with the european union 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the package will cut red tape and reduce barrier to trade for business make it easy for business to export iconic product such as melton mowbray pork pie red leicester cheese and stilton cheese and open up wide access to the uk market that be why it have be back right across the business sector 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 fellow right hon and hon member will have notice that some political party have begin accept cryptocurrency donation far be it from i to suggest that this might be an attempt to dodge the transparency requirement for donation do the minister join i in welcome the electoral commission ’s clear guidance that donation that do not come from a permissible or identifiable source must be return and will he be speak with ministerial colleague in other departments about make sure that the forthcoming election bill ensure that any political donation involve crypto be fully transparent and in line with our law 
 it be absolutely right that as finance evolve so too must the rule we have to ensure transparency and probity in election therefore the rule regard the source of funding and the bona fide character of the donor must apply whatever currency be involve 
 labour ’s plan to make work pay promise to bring about the big wave of insourcing of public service in a generation insourced service be   often show to provide well value for money will the government provide an update on their work to ensure that public body carry out public interest test when outsource contract expire 
 the government be determined to deliver high quality public service and well value for money for the taxpayer we have commit to introduce a public interest test to assess whether expiring contract could provide well outcome and well value in house and that be include in the national procurement policy statement 
 a recent cyber attack on school and early learn it in my constituency knock out online access but also underline the need for a positive interaction between scotland ’s government rather than the constant constitutional bickering we have see in recent year with cyber security about to move out of the cabinet office can the minister assure we about the way in which a positive cross governmental and intergovernmental approach to these relationship will be secure 
 the hon lady raise a good point at the meeting of the council of the nations and regions that take place a couple of week ago issue of technology be very high on the agenda we take these forum for dialogue very seriously and i think i be right in say that we can have a discussion on this issue without some of the heat that characterise other subject that come up 
 give the extremely welcome recent news that economic growth for the quarter of be indicate that the government ’s mission to kick start economic growth in the uk be begin to work can the minister set out what plan exist government wide to make sure that that prosperity make a positive difference to all family in the uk include in the most deprived neighbourhood such as swanscombe and temple hill in my constituency 
 my hon friend be right to celebrate the recent figure show that the uk be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the quarter of this year a sign that this government ’s focus on growth be begin to bear fruit we be determined to drive growth in every corner of the country the low thames crossing which my hon friend have long campaign for and this government have approve will deliver big benefit in dartford and beyond 
 in term of encourage public participation in democracy and in politic i have find that school visit be constructive even in the far north of scotland and that be on a strictly non party political basis what thought might the government have about encourage other mp to engage in that way it be informative and constructive 
 visit school in my constituency be of my favourite part of be a member of parliament and i encourage all mp to do the same we will   legislate to lower the voting age to for all uk election when parliamentary time allow and follow engagement and plan with relevant stakeholder as a way to drive forward participation in democracy 
 at yesterday ’s meeting of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood we hear from someone whose father be terminally ill and unlikely to survive to see the compensation to which he be entitle it be not fair on people who have wait year for justice that they be leave at the starting line for compensation be there any way we can make a list of people who be in that situation and calculate their entitlement for their estate 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the work he do with the all party parliamentary group he will know that the infected blood compensation authority have publish a prioritisation list in recent month i can also update the house that ibca be contact an average of people every week to start their claim and it expect in this calendar year to have bring in to claim all those who be infect and register with a support scheme 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster will know that the uk have some of the good intelligence agency in the world and they have huge power and huge budget which they use to keep our country safe every single day of the week    he also know that in any large organisation mistake be make and public confidence in those agency be vital give that the intelligence services act be more than year old there have be some other act be it not time for the intelligence and security committee to have new power of oversight and even new power of sanction so that the public can have confidence that our intelligence agency have proper scrutiny and oversight 
 let i echo the right hon member ’s word in pay tribute to the work that our intelligence and security agency do in keep we all safe every day we discuss the committee early in these question the government have approve an uplift in resource for the committee and we be work closely with it on the good operating model for do its job as effectively as possible

 today have a great double significance as the house may know it be world environment day when we celebrate the natural world and recommit ourselves as a parliament to seek to protect it and it be also the putative date of birth of adam smith of my great hero who do as much as anyone have ever do to explain the world in which we live if i may move from the sublime to the sublimely incompetent this week have otherwise be disaster after another for the government 
 on monday we have to drag the leader of the house to the dispatch box yet again and she have to apologise yet again for the government ’s flagrant disregard for this house of commons in brief out the strategic   defence review over the weekend there be no more important issue than the defence of the realm it be a uk wide long term all party matter and have always be treat as such yet the government choose to share the document not only with their friend in the medium but with the industry at least hour before it come to this chamber or to opposition party it be a matter of deep embarrassment for the government and raise serious question about the private sharing of financially sensitive information the leader of the house and the defence secretary be both honourable people and i have no doubt that she have make the case every week in cabinet for do such communication properly it be just extraordinary that these member of the cabinet be be hang out to dry every week by the year old in downing street 
 you could have grant an urgent question every single day this week mr speaker such have be the deluge of important announcement prematurely make outside this house today it be free school meal yesterday it be the reannouncement of northern rail spending the only mitigate factor be that the government have be so incompetent in handle their slow motion u turn on the winter fuel allowance that no have notice anything else though we still await a statement to the house on that issue as well 
 what about the strategic defence review itself we should start by thank the reviewer for their hard work over many month i know everyone in this house will want to do that but if we look at the hard substance of the review matter become more difficult of all many of the announcement largely repeat the decision of previous government for example on submarine on aukus and on warhead secondly and most crucially where be the funding government ministers have tie themselves in knot over the last few day as to whether the of gdp target be an ambition an aim or simply to be undertake when fiscal circumstance allow or in the next parliament 
 luckily general richard barrons of the sdr reviewer be more honest say that the sdr ’s financial profile the assumption against which the reviewer be work assume that defence will get of gdp in financial year and of gdp by no later than the great irony be that not week from now we will have the nato summit which will call not for but for plus we be light year away from that commitment the awful truth be that real money will not begin to flow into the armed force until the defence industrial strategy and the defence investment plan be announce later this year hopefully in the proper way to this house that will be month after the government take office it be lucky that we do not have a war in europe 
 thirdly where be the threat to our adversary no extra cash mean no extra commitment no commitment mean no credibility and no credibility mean no increase sense of threat to those we face what do we know we know that there be a war in europe in which russia be move man and matériel not merely to push on in ukraine but to threaten the baltic state ukraine have a glorious victory in the past few day but we can not rely on such victory and we must support it in its struggle against russia 
 what do we know we know that xi jinping have direct the people ’s liberation army to develop the capability to invade taiwan by and we know that   nato ally who have a collective responsibility to each other in some case have a long way to go before they be even at of gdp let alone instead of give real leadership and put cash on the table our own government be talk about ready the country for war while in reality they continue to dither and delay 
 mr speaker i understand that today be press association parliamentary editor richard wheeler ’s last day in the gallery he have cover our proceeding for year and i be sure we can all agree that that be quite a shift with brexit covid prime ministers and many intervention from   the hon member for strangford jim shannon all have be cover by he 
 as i have announce on   monday june   we will debate a motion in my name to implement the recommendation of last year ’s independent kernaghan review of parliament ’s independent complaints and grievance scheme the icgs be set up in in response to many serious incident of bullying sexual harassment unacceptable behaviour and poor culture through its work and its existence stride have be make in address our reputation and improve work culture however we must continue to do well and to respond that be why i have table proposal from the independent review to strengthen and improve the process of the icgs i have ask its director for a full briefing which upon receipt i will place in the library ahead of the debate so that member can consider these issue more fully 
 i thank the shadow leader of the house for want a replay of the urgent question on monday follow some of the question that be put to i then i do say that with your permission mr speaker i would come back to the house on some of the issue that be raise without go through the whole thing again i want to be clear about some of the thing that do and do not happen the government be endeavour to act in good faith and to follow the procedure and practice for many previous sdr and i have look at all of the procedure and practice for previous sdr 
 we recognise that there be room for improvement there always be but i want to let the house know that advance briefing be offer to all opposition spokespeople the chair of the defence committee and a select few from the defence community an embargoed copy of the full sdr be provide to the select committee clerk shortly after am and hard copy be provide to the conservative and liberal democrat spokespeople minute before the statement as i reiterate on monday the full document be lay in the house in the afternoon i have speak with you mr speaker and the defence secretary who i be sure the whole house will agree take his responsibility to this house incredibly seriously he want to draw up a clear process for this government and future government to follow so that the expectation of all concerned be clear 
 i really will not be take advice from the right hon gentleman about respect parliament he be a minister and a member of parliament under the previous government whom the supreme court say have act illegally by prorogue parliament there could be no great disrespect to this house than that he also   serve under the former prime minister who be find to have mislead parliament again no bad crime than that could be commit 
 the right hon gentleman want to talk about defence spending but the conservatives have year in government to get to the target do they get to in any of those year no they do not when be the last time this country spend on defence oh yes it be the last time labour be in government that be what we be do again now so he might want to look at his own record on that 
 i see that today we have have a big move on the economy from the conservatives yes a big move they want to draw a line under liz truss but where be the apology because i do not hear they finally seem to recognise that crash the economy be a big error but they do not seem to understand that it be the ordinary work people of this country who be still pay the price for their action the conservatives should be apologise for that yet the right hon gentleman want to go around spend more money he do not seem to have get the memo on that 
 let we just be clear it be really important that we be clear about why we take the decision we do at the start of this parliament the right hon gentleman ’s government leave no fiscal responsibility something they now want to try to retain and they leave huge gap black hole in the public finance borrowing cost be at record high and there be a cost of living crisis crush ordinary people when market lose confidence which be what they do under his government and what they be potentially do at the start of this parliament and the economy crash it be those on low fix income such as pensioner and family live in poverty who see the cost of live go up it be they who pay the heavy price when the economy crash that be why this labour government put economic stability that be our priority because we recognise who pay the heavy price when that go wrong 
 i welcome the recognition from the shadow chancellor today but it do not seem like everybody get the memo the right hon gentleman seem to want to spend even more money from the dispatch box without say where it will come from the shadow business secretary   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith seem to want to get rid of some of the tax increase from the budget again without say where the money will come from 
 now that we have stabilise the economy we be put our value into practice far we be see huge investment in the north and in the midland on key transport infrastructure investment in the job of the future bring down waiting list month after month after month and more nhs appointment the right hon gentleman do not want to mention this but today we be announce the big expansion of free school meal in year lift child out of poverty that be the difference a labour government make secure the real income of ordinary work people put our public service back on their foot and lift child out of poverty 
 as it be world environment day do the leader of the house agree that while the uk have beautiful national park local park and green space in urban city such as southampton   be just as treasure and as valuable in bring community together and improve health and wellbeing make such city the great place that they be community in my constituency enjoy a week long urban wild festival during the half term holiday as part of southampton ’s journey in become the uk ’s national park city outside london will she join i in congratulate christelle blunden in particular but also the army of volunteer friend of group charity and many more who champion our local nature every day and who be behind southampton ’s national park city campaign finally 
 order please sit down this be a very important subject and i congratulate the hon lady she do ask i at the beginning and it be fantastic news but i have to get a lot of member in today so please i be sure the leader of the house have grasp the message 
 my hon friend make a compelling case for southampton ’s national park city status and indeed for the fantastic contribution that green space nature and wild place make to our city make place such as southampton a great place to live 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats warmly welcome report that eligibility for free school meal be be extend to all child in england whose parent receive universal credit this be a lib dem policy on which we have campaign for a long time and it be a positive step to help to lift child out of poverty of course there be much more to do among other much need change we would point to the importance of fully fund the policy for school and auto enrolling eligible child to ensure that they get the support they need 
 i will also highlight once again something that be raise in business question nearly every week special educational need in march it be report in the medium that the government will produce a white paper on special educational need to address the crisis in school for child with special educational need and disability we be hear rumour that this white paper may be delay until the autumn or possibly until next year child with special educational need be still without support parent be still battle with local authority school be still struggle to cope and council be still leave star at the prospect of a £ deficit next year from send be add to their budget will the leader of the house implore the government to at the very least provide a timescale for publish the white paper 
 i thank the hon lady for what she say about free school meal i know it be a policy the liberal democrats have also campaign on but it be this government who have a proud record of advance free school meal and lift child out of poverty which be exactly what we be do today and will continue to do over the come week 
 the hon lady raise the matter of special educational need which she be absolutely right be raise very often in these question i know that it be an issue of great importance to our constituent and to many member   across the house as i be sure she will accept i will ensure that any development in this regard be bring to the house and that member have ample opportunity to contribute to they i be sure she will agree with i that in recent year our special educational need system have not deliver the outcome for those who need it most and that the process be not good for parent and family either we need to make change to the system to deliver good outcome in both mainstream and specialist setting i will ensure that the house be keep fully up to date
