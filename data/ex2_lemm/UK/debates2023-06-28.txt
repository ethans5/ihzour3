we have a rule at the moment that local authority have to pass on of the fund that they receive and our return show that they pass on however as the year go on with the amount of extra money that we have put into the system we can definitely look at those figure and at what can be do some of that will be set out in our consultation before the summer 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to publish proposal for increase the on lending of uk special drawing rights via the imf for transfer the capital return to the uk by the european investment bank to the world bank and for increase the uk ’s support for the african development bank for the purpose of reduce debt burden and the cost of capital and contribute to the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change 
 i start by declare an interest as chair of the international parliamentary network on the world bank and international monetary fund which bring together parliamentarian from country to argue for the change that i will put before the government today 
 if anything this bill be overdue year ago the world come together to agree an ambitious plan to spread freedom security and justice to every corner of the planet the sustainable development goal agree in new york in september offer hope progress and a well life to billion of people month later we come together again not in new york but in paris to agree the climate change agreement that would help we guarantee that there would be a planet leave on which to make those goal a reality 
 however the truth be that such ambition be in deep trouble there be just day to go before the paris climate agreement deadline a perfect storm be now threaten the world ’s potential to deliver on the goal that we agree just year ago in fact giant now stand in the way of progress want hunger disease lose learning conflict debt and climate change they be a cascade connect set of challenge with lethal force 
 extreme poverty have rise for the time this century with people now forecast to be live on less than $ a day by globally people now wake up without enough to eat and child will need humanitarian assistance this year on current trend we will not meet our goal of end hunger by that scarcity be fuel violence about half of the world ’s extreme poor be expect to live in conflict affect area by in turn those condition be threaten our ability to make good child ’s lose learning during covid which could cost $ over the course of their life poor nation have now exhaust their reserve in fact debt in develop country be now the high it have be for year and level be rise 
 loom deadly over all of that be the change in our climate and the chaos of extreme weather across half the world and most of africa the season be simply no long predictable the sun which once bring life now bring death because it burn so ferociously the rain when they fall fall with such force that life give water flood and destroy the land it once nourish against that murderous maelstrom low and middle income country need to mobilise some $ between now and to hit their paris climate target 
 poor country do not cause climate change but the world ’s poor be somehow expect to pick up the piece we can not go on like this and as president macron say in paris last week we must not go on like this if the world fail to act if we fail to act all of we may fall prey to those who preach that the rule base order be not fit for purpose new institution outside the world bank the imf and perhaps even the united nations will come forward beyond our influence so we must change 
 that be why my bridgetown bill call on the government to lead to take the initiative and to help champion the agenda set out with such passion force and eloquence by prime minister mia mottley the whole house should salute her work she have help to galvanise the big shake up of global development finance since the world bank and imf be create in her bridgetown initiative be a pragmatic collection of idea with radical implication for the world bank ’s mission and model the resource deploy by the imf and the goal that rich country must step up to and meet 
 reform be under way and the agenda be move i be grateful for the government ’s support such as it be but our good estimate be that the bretton woods institution must at least triple the finance that they supply that be why the uk should lead and help to champion this debate internationally the bill be need because it be a matter of regret that the once proud record of our country once laud as a leader in global development be now much reduce it be a matter of regret that the prime minister find time to enjoy the company of mr murdoch in london last week and decline to join president macron in paris with other leader from around the world it be a matter of regret that the uk be not lead the debate on green development finance but lag behind 
 important step forward be take last week in paris the world bank under its brilliant new president ajay banga commit to an expand crisis toolkit replete with new type of insurance to backstop development project and crucially to a pause in debt repayment so that country can focus on what matter when crisis strike without worry about the bill kristalina georgieva the head of the imf give we some reassuring news about how we may now be on track to meet the target of share $ in special drawing right however there be still a gap in what need to be accomplish which be why the uk need to rediscover the lost art of lead and that be what this bill propose 
 we should be increase the on lending of special drawing right and follow japan ’s lead we have £ worth of new special drawing right and they be sit there gather dust in the exchange equalisation account we have say that we will share but japan say it will share if we match that target we could supply nearly £ of extra resource to the poor country i have be ask foreign secretaries and treasury secretaries for year why   we be not match the ambition of country such as japan and frankly i be yet to receive a good and coherent answer 
 secondly we should be use some of those special drawing right to support the work of the african development bank if we lend £ worth of special drawing right the adb could quadruple it in new concessional lending to country across africa 
 thirdly we should be help to build a big world bank the world bank remain the most efficient and effective way of mobilise development finance a $ increase in its capital base would unlock $ in concessional lending over the course of the decade if the uk contribute to that kind of increase our share might be about $ billion—$200 a year over year but we could step up to that challenge we will get £ back from the european investment bank i suppose some in this house would call that a brexit dividend between now and we should recycle that money into the world bank to help it radically expand lending to some of the world ’s poor country 
 nobody can be more eloquent in debate such as this than a hungry child so let i conclude with the word of a young boy lantano moriaso be a year old at the kideket primary school in rural narok county kenya i have the privilege of meet he at his school with   the hon member for erewash maggie throup and i want to thank the esmée fairbairn foundation world vision and the coalition for global prosperity for help to make that visit possible this be what lantano have to say 
 i like come to school because i have many friend who i play with and learn together my teacher always teach we how to read write and many other new thing they be good to we 
 but he also say 
 sometimes we eat once in a day because there be no food and we do not have enough water to drink despite all these challenge we still come to school to learn 
 the child of that school have the same dream as our child they want to be lawyer doctor and teacher and some so help they want to be politician yet such be the drought such be the poverty and such be the desperation that many family struggle to survive girl as young as be send to get marry and boy be send to work even young child be not in school because they be hunt for water all day if we do not step up and solve these challenge there will be not just an opportunity gap for those child but an opportunity cost for all of we that be a price we can not afford so i call on his majesty ’s government to act 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that liam byrne sarah champion sir stephen timms tony lloyd sir george howarth clive efford debbie abrahams mr virendra sharma mike amesbury and patrick grady present the bill 
 liam byrne accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday november and to be print bill 
 where water company underperform and do not meet their target a process be in place whereby basically they have to credit the money back to their customer last year £ be credit back in that respect so the regulator do have the tool to do that it have tighten up so many of its measure all of which will affect all the water company 
 for information thames water itself have not pay any dividend for the last year ofwat will rightly hold company to account when they do   not clearly demonstrate the link between dividend and performance we make that possible through the landmark environment act 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the labour market in scotland 
 i pay tribute to great scot who have sadly die in recent day winnie ewing blaze a trail for woman in politic she be admire by colleague from all scotland ’s party as of the most important politician of her generation our thought be with her friend and family particularly her child fergus and annabelle and with craig brown ’s pass on monday scottish football lose a true legend who be hold in high regard by player and fan across the country again our thought be with his love one 
 i be encourage by the resilience that the scottish labour market have show despite global issue still cause significant economic challenge the late official figure show that scottish unemployment be close to a record low at i welcome that fact 
 if we be to grow the scottish economy as well as the national it be vital that we have a skilled workforce and the right level of investment it be also important for area such as the borders between scotland and england to have the least friction in trade and labour market condition do the secretary of state agree that politician of all persuasion have a responsibility to ensure maximum opportunity on whichever side of the border to ensure the least amount of friction particularly for those look for employment 
 i agree that be exactly why this government introduce the united kingdom internal market act to protect frictionless trade across the uk on maximise opportunity on whichever side of the border it be a matter of some regret that scotland be the highest tax part of the united kingdom 
 i call the chair of the scottish affairs committee 
 the secretary of state and i represent large rural constituency with large hospitality and tourism sector will he therefore name benefit that end freedom of movement have bring to the labour market in either sector 
 the scottish national party like to blame everything on brexit but for the past year we have have record immigration into the united kingdom that be a simple fact record number since immigration figure begin 
 i have the pleasure and privilege of be elect to the scottish parliament in alongside winnie ewing she be undoubtedly an iconic figure of modern scottish politic from the hamilton by election to madame écosse and the opening of the scottish parliament i always find she to be kind and sympathetic to new member and she always have the good story may she rest in peace 
 do my right hon friend agree that the thing that will reduce confidence in the scottish labour market be the prospect of another independence referendum real or de facto 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right business do not like uncertainty and the constant harping on about independence be cause uncertainty among business the devolved administration in scotland should focus on the thing that they be set up to do education standard the health service drug death and get some ferry rather than try to create the island clearance 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the impact of cost of live increase on household in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the impact of cost of live increase on household in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the impact of cost of live increase on household in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the impact of cost of live increase on household in scotland 
 these question show the originality of thought among the opposition party the united kingdom government recognise the challenge face household due to elevated cost of living and so have take action to protect struggle family with the large support package in europe uk wide support to household to help with high bill be worth £ or £ per household on average 
 over the winter too many have have to make the decision whether to heat or eat in fact too many could not afford to do either with food inflation well in excess of and much high on specific staple item people simply can not afford to eat what advice do the minister have for household in scotland and those in sunderland who i represent who be worried about be able to provide food for their family 
 inflation be a problem affect many western economy particularly those in europe and it be right that this government continue to provide cost of live support while stick to our plan to avoid add unnecessary inflationary pressure the average household in scotland receive £ from the uk government with the poor household receive £ about £ be spend in which be more than the scottish government ’s entire annual welfare budget 
 after consecutive hike in interest rate the institute for fiscal studies have warn that more householder could face a fall in disposable income this mortgage crisis start with a disastrous tory mini budget last september and be add to the cost of living crisis will the minister please explain what the hell his party be do to clean up the mess it create 
 we do not accept that analysis we recognise that this be a worrying time for homeowner and mortgage holder but we can not ignore the fact that interest rate have rise across western economy as a result of the pandemic and the impact of the war in ukraine the government remain committed to responsible economic management to bring inflation back under control which be the only way to achieve sustainably low interest rate and mortgage rate 
 it be not just homeowner who be affect by spiral interest rate they also contribute to an average rent increase of over the scottish government be do their bit use the limited power they have they have extend the rent cap and extend the eviction freeze into march so that nobody in scotland will be throw out of their house because they be poor and of course in scotland thank to the scottish national party we be not sell off council house but build more of they what exactly be his government do to protect tenant in scotland and to prevent an increase in homelessness 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i know he recently announce that he will be stand down at the next election and while he and i clearly do not agree politically his year of service to the people of glenrothes be worthy of recognition 
 as i say previously tackle inflation be this government ’s priority it be the good way to support mortgage holder and the people who rent accommodation 
 be the minister aware of the recent yougov survey commission by feeding britain which show that in may almost in adult in scotland report that they or someone in their household have access food aid in the previous month do he agree that it be now time for the government to launch a food poverty strategy will he support the principle outline in my private member ’s bill to end food bank use by 
 this united kingdom government remain absolutely committed to support the most vulnerable in society during these difficult time that be evidence by our provide support to people who need it the most for example over £ to pensioner on benefit £ on benefit to support disabled people and people live with health condition and a furth £ on welfare benefit for working age adult and child in addition since april benefit and state pension have be uprate by this government be take the action that be most require to support the people in most need and we reject the hon gentleman ’s analysis that we be do nothing 
 under the last labour government absolute child poverty level in scotland fall from in to in but that have be all but reversed the snp government be not on track to meet their own goal of lower child poverty to less than by 2030—[interruption snp member shout but there be a reason why they do so what step be the uk government take to ensure that child poverty return to the low level last see under the last labour government 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the failure of the scottish government and snp members reaction show that they do not like be challenge they shout heckle and try to shut down any contrary argument 
 as i say this government be absolutely committed to support the most vulnerable in society we will continue to support all part of our society child householder and anyone else who need support during these cost of living pressure 
 last year £ in balancing cost be add to our energy bill that mean pay wind farm operator to turn off their turbine and at the same time pay gas operator to fire theirs up owe to grid constraint and a lack of storage however pump storage hydro scheme in scotland could create job and low bill so why be this government not fight tooth and nail to put in place contractual arrangement that would get these scheme up and run 
 in relation to the cost of living the theme of these question the energy price guarantee will save household £ for the period until july bring the total government support for energy bill to £ for a typical household since october we be also end the premium pay by more than uk household for prepayment meter bring   their charge into line with those pay by comparable customer use direct debit this government be absolutely committed to support people who face cost of living pressure 
 i know that the prime minister and the government be entirely focused on help people to deal with those pressure however the focus of the snp government seem to be elsewhere as we see last weekend when the minister announce that the next election would be entirely focus on yet another independence referendum do the minister agree that that be the wrong priority for scotland and that scotland ’s government should be work together to improve the delivery of public service and help people with the cost of living 
 my hon friend be absolutely right both of scotland ’s government the uk government and the scottish government should be focus on deliver well public service and support people with the cost of living but instead we hear the snp cheer about another independence referendum this government remain focused on deliver for the people of scotland i be just sad that the snp government in edinburgh fail to do so 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let i join the secretary of state in his early tribute to winnie ewing and craig brown both of whom pass away last week and both of whom will be sadly miss i hold craig brown personally responsible for moment of completely unbridled joy and total heartbreak 
 let i also wish the secretary of state a happy birthday a significant birthday for next week interruption whoever shout from the back benchers be not far away from his age so happy birthday to he 
 nearly month ago the secretary of state promise to arrange a meeting for david williamson a scottish terminal cancer patient but neither his department nor the secretary of state for health and social care have be able to do so i wonder whether that could be sort out as soon as possible 
 million of people across the country be face spiral mortgage rate and rent statistic release by citizens advice scotland this week show that the number of scottish mortgage holder search for advice on repossession be up by do the minister agree with the insightful advice from the prime minister that worry mortgage payer hit by a tory mortgage premium should just hold their nerve 
 i can confirm that the scotland office do write to the department for health and social care about the case of david williamson and i will undertake to ensure that we pursue that 
 as for mortgage rate the government recognise that this be a very concern time for homeowner and mortgage holder but we can not ignore the fact that interest rate have rise across western economy as a result of the pandemic and the impact of the war in ukraine of course the bank of england set the base rate which have an effect on mortgage pricing as the hon member will recall it be the labour government   who make the bank independent of government as he will also know last week the chancellor agree with mortgage lender a brand new mortgage charter which will hopefully provide some protection and reassurance for mortgage holder 
 the scotland office be say that scottish mortgage holder should just hold their nerve what the minister do not include in his list of excuse be the fact that the tories actually crash the economy which have result in some of these mortgage interest rate be it not incredible that during the bad cost of live crisis in live memory the prime minister ’s entire approach be to tell people to hold their nerve while the approach of the minister in scotland be to launch proposal for a de facto referendum and a write constitution something that he himself admit scottish voter do not want scotland have government so out of touch with the priority of the scottish people that polling show that think they be do little to help with the cost of living do the minister agree that what scot need and deserve be a uk labour government focus solely on deliver the priority of scottish voter 
 this uk government be very clear that now be not the time for another independence referendum but the labour party so often end up back snp policy after snp policy in scotland as we be approach the summer holiday perhaps   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer   should take his flip flop and see whether there be space in the snp ’s camper van 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for his kind word about winnie ewing and craig brown let i pay my own personal tribute to winnie ewing who be such an icon for our party and almost uniquely serve in parliaments our own madame écosse 
 at over food inflation in the uk be high than among our eu neighbour yet both the government and the labour party seem to be in complete denial about brexit ’s contribution to this cost of eat crisis with of the uk ’s food come from europe how will the uk government prevent a new surge in food price next winter when extra post brexit check be introduce at the border 
 as the chancellor have say food price inflation have be a problem in many part of europe in germany sweden portugal and poland food price inflation be around so this be not a uk only problem the government be do everything they can to deal with putin ’s invasion of ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic we have central focus which be bring inflation down we be ensure that be this government ’s priority 
 the london school of economics have show that a of food inflation in the uk be due to brexit with the loss of freedom of movement and european worker brexit have also cause £ of scottish fruit and veg to rot in the field threaten farm and far increase the cost even of domestic   produce as a brexiteer should the secretary of state not apologise to the scottish public include his own constituent for drive up food price and maybe explain why he still support the prove liar who be of its main architect 
 we do not accept the snp ’s analysis as i have already explain food inflation be an issue in many part of europe it be a bit rich for an snp member to bring up food price inflation and rise cost especially when leak paper this morning reveal that snp ministers in edinburgh be discuss raise council tax by up to mean that some people will end up pay £ more per year under the snp in scotland local government funding have be gutte force council to slash local service and impose large tax hike i will take no lesson from the hon member about bring price down for household in scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his department ’s policy on strengthen the union of allegation of standard of impropriety in public life 
 the united kingdom be the most successful political and economic union in the world the foundation on which all our business and citizen be able to thrive when we work collaboratively as united kingdom we be safe strong and more prosperous we be well able to draw on the institution that unite we such as the health service the armed force and our world class education system and we be well able to respond to challenge such as support family with the cost of live and lead the international response to russia ’s illegal war in ukraine 
 do the secretary of state think that the former prime minister who be fin by the police and subsequently find to have knowingly lie to the late queen this house and therefore the public strengthen or weaken the union 
 the union have never be strong and this prime minister have say that those in public life should aspire to the high standard of propriety 
 i think we can all agree about the importance of politician tell the truth in that context have my right hon friend see the video release by the scottish government in which cabinet secretary angus robertson make a range of spurious claim about devolution be under attack by the uk government if so what do he think of it 
 i do see angus robertson ’s video clip and i think i count false claim in the space of minute and second that be a false claim every second pretty impressive even by his standard as usual the nationalist be desperate to invent a grievance but the reality be that the uk government respect devolution support it and strengthen it the only people who want to destroy devolution be the one who want to rip we out of the united kingdom 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the privileges committee ’s conclusion be crystal clear that the former prime minister knowingly mislead this house and subsequently try to intimidate the very committee carry out the inquiry he set up why do the secretary of state not set an example and vote for the privileges committee ’s report 
 as i say to the medium when this question be raise in an interview last week it be simply because i feel the report be too excessive in its conclusion 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support for the energy industry in scotland 
 scotland ’s energy industry be vital to support the uk ’s energy security this government have listen to scotland ’s energy industry and we understand the need to encourage industry investment that be why we recently announce the energy security investment mechanism which will remove the energy profit levy if oil and gas price fall to normal level for a sustained period prior to march 
 it be great to hear a cheer for the secretary of state as he stand up i be sure he agree that hydrogen production will be vital to meet both the uk ’s energy need and our net target will he set out what the uk government be do to promote the development and production of hydrogen in scotland 
 low carbon hydrogen be critical to deliver energy security it present a significant growth opportunity and will help the uk to reach net we have double our ambition to gw of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by and at least half of it will come from electrolytic hydrogen draw on the scale up of uk offshore wind other renewable and of course new nuclear 
 will the discussion with the scottish government also include the problem with national grid transmission which mean national grid be pay to turn off wind turbine because it can not afford to get the electricity they generate to the south of the country 
 by law transmission network charge be a matter for ofgem which be an independent regulator it have recently produce a report on charge reform and the government be look at that report 
 whether his department have have recent discussion with the scottish government on support productive forestry planting in scotland 
 although forestry be a devolved policy we continue to work with the devolved administration to deliver a uk wide step change in tree planting and establishment 
 last year of forestry planting be much need productive forestry for our construction and manufacturing industry do my right hon friend agree that there should now be a new uk wide target that aim for of new planting to be productive allow scotland to lead the way for the rest of the uk 
 my hon friend be a champion for this industry and it be the uk government ’s ambition to increase plant across the united kingdom i know she be keen for productive forestry to be use to support the construction and manufacturing industry which be also the government ’s ambition 
 scotland as in so much else lead the way on forestry and tree planting at hectare fully quarter of all tree plant across these island can the secretary of state instruct the house on how around the cabinet table he have champion scotland ’s progress in this area or be he too cower 
 not only do i champion it i plant tree myself 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on trend in the level of child poverty in scotland 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on trend in the level of child poverty in scotland 
 this government be commit to tackle child poverty and protect the most vulnerable in society in the recent budget the chancellor announce additional support measure for household and family across scotland and indeed across all part of the united kingdom a further example of support for family be announce early today with the uk government make childcare more affordable 
 almost food parcel be give to child in scotland last year and the trussell trust ’s hunger in scotland report show that single parent make up only of the population but of those who have go hungry this be about insufficiency of income the adult rate of benefit should be restore to single parent under the age of on universal credit which would be a practical way for the uk government to support they do the minister agree 
 i recognise the work that the hon lady undertake with the all party group on food bank the government be protect the most vulnerable with a £ support package for household and we have help nearly people out of absolute poverty after housing cost since 
 my constituency be not among the poor in scotland but we already have in child there in some area in live in poverty with third of they in work family with the soar food price sky high mortgage rate and edinburgh have the high increase in annual rent in the uk family be struggle we know that our scottish    government be only interested in independence so will the minister tell i what the uk government be go to do for those family 
 the government recognise the anxiety that people feel about rise mortgage which be why the prime minister ’s priority be to halve inflation this year that be the single good way we can keep cost and interest rate down for people and we have a clear plan to deliver that the chancellor also meet mortgage lender last week and have agree a mortgage charter cover of the market we hope that that will provide reassurance to mortgage holder and other affect   by this 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i be sure the whole house will wish to join i in pay tribute to john angeli obe director of parliamentary broadcasting who be leave the house service at the end of this week during his year as director john not only oversee the expansion of live video coverage to all public proceeding but deliver the hybrid capability which enable parliament to function during lockdown and of course make history with president zelensky be beam into this chamber he have more recently bring live subtitle and british sign language to our proceeding i be sure i speak on behalf of the whole house in thank john and wish he all the good for the future hon member hear hear 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday june 
 today we will have the reading of the holocaust memorial bill for decade survivor such as the late sir ben helfgott show extraordinary courage in share their testimony so that we would never forget i hope the whole house will unite today to get this bill through and put those testimony at the heart of our democracy for generation to come 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 for year since i be elect i have be campaign to improve health facility in my community i be pleased to see significant investment in leicestershire with £ for a community diagnostic centre in hinckley and as part of a £ programme hospital improvement at the leicester royal infirmary and the glenfield hospital but i be look for a hat trick of health in hinckley i be look for a day case unit the money be already there but it be tie up in red tape i have raise this issue with the health secretary will the prime minister look to see what he can do and would he like to come to open the unit next year in hinckley 
 i be delighted that since its opening last month the hinckley cdc have already deliver more than additional test to the local community my hon friend will know that it be for the local health authority to determine how to allocate the nhs budget in their area but i have no doubt that he will continue to make the case to they for a day case unit in his community 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 mr speaker may i join your tribute to john and wish he all the good on behalf of the house i also join the prime minister in his comment about the holocaust memorial i would also like to wish muslims across the country a happy eid 
 last week the labour party lose margaret mcdonagh our female general secretary and a trailblazer in every sense of the word margaret provide guidance leadership and loyal friendship to so many in the labour movement it be not long after i start in this job that margaret be at my door and i will be forever grateful for the advice and support she give i we will all miss she terribly 
 the prime minister ’s party spend thousand of pound on advert attack plan to build new home a year at the same time his housing minister say that it be tory party policy to build new home a year so be the prime minister for build new home a year or against it 
 i remind the right hon and learn gentleman of our record since be in office additional home housing start double the number we inherit from the labour party more home meet the decent home standard housing supply up in the last year for which we have figure and also in the last year for which we have figure we see a year high in the number of time buyer that be a conservative government deliver for this country 
 it be not a difficult question can he point to a single person in housing construction or anywhere who think that he will actually hit his target of new home a year anyone 
 the record be that in the last year we have deliver almost record number of new home building in every of those year he talk about target so let we be clear i promise to put local people in control of new housing and i deliver on that policy within week of become prime minister but i be confuse by the right hon and learn gentleman because the shadow secretary of state for levelling up housing communities and local government   the hon member for wigan lisa nandy say community should have control but then he say that we should bring target back and disempower local people i want to give he some advice i do not think it be local people that be the problem it ’ the labour party ’s policy 
 presumably if he could have identify a single person who think he would hit his target he would have tell we there you have the problem minute he say he be for build new house but the   next he be campaign against they the truth be that far from deliver since he crumble to his back benchers and scrap mandatory target house building have collapse he know it they know it and every expert be tell they that why do he not just admit it he be not go to get anywhere near his target be he 
 the right hon and learn gentleman now claim that he support house building especially on the green belt but unfortunately 
 yes 
 it ’ good that he agree that he do believe that now but unfortunately for he the shadow deputy prime minister   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner the shadow minister for women   the hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds the shadow health minister   the hon member for ilford north wes streeting the shadow justice minister   the hon member for croydon north steve reed the shadow minister for defence   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey the shadow business minister   the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds the shadow minister for northern ireland   the hon member for hove peter kyle and the shadow minister for scotland   the hon member for edinburgh south ian murray   be all unite against more house building in their area i have to say to they that they do not have to worry too much because he have never actually keep a promise he have make 
 you can tell from his answer mr speaker,—his non answer and his body language that he have actually give up his failure be not just shatter the dream of those who desperately want to own their own home it be also hit those who already have a mortgage because of the government ’s economic chaos mortgage holder will be £ a year poor how can the government ever look the british people in the eye again and claim to be the party of home ownership 
 i do not think he have notice that his shadow secretary of state for levelling up housing communities and local government the hon member for wigan do not actually agree with his new policy of concrete over the green belt she have be campaign against development in her own constituency she say she want to prevent urban sprawl and 
 provide green space for local people 
 i think that be quite sensible but it be classic labour say thing here and do another thing elsewhere you simply can not trust a word they say 
 at least he be not claim they be the party of home ownership any more because we be he ’ give up the prime minister say he be on it but his definition of on it be to gently ask the bank to do the right thing his softly softly approach refuse to put mandatory measure in place risk leave a household without support how many will have to lose their home before he will stand up for the people his party have push into economic misery 
 in fact the vast majority of the mortgage market be now cover by the new mortgage charter that the chancellor have bring in that be deliver practical help for mortgage holder allow they to extend their term switch to interest only mortgage and save they hundred of pound a month so instead of scar they actually there be now practical support in place 
 it be right that he raise home ownership that be why we on the government benches introduce a mortgage guarantee scheme it be why we introduce the home and share ownership scheme to get people on to the housing ladder and crucially it be why we cut stamp duty now what we see be the high number of time buyer in year twice the number that the labour party ever manage 
 it be housing crisis what crisis with this prime minister he must be the only person in the country who think that enough house have be build in the past year whether it be those dream of get the key to their home or those already with mortgage the ambition of family across the country have be crush by his fail tory government house building at its low rate since the war because he can not stand up to his own party a tory mortgage bombshell because they crash the economy and million leave without support because he will not make lender put family rather than lecture the rest of the country on hold their nerve why do he not try to locate his 
 as always the right hon and learn gentleman have not take the time to understand the detail of what we be do so i be happy to explain it again it be right that we provide support for mortgage owner which be why we improve the generosity of the support for mortgage interest scheme it be why we have introduce the new mortgage charter which by the way go much far than the labour party ’s policy on protect mortgage holder on house building we be proud to protect the green belt and invest million more in develop brownfield site the simple truth be that that be what i say i would do and that be what we have deliver that be the difference between we i deliver on my promise the leader of the opposition just break his 
 labour run kirklees council ’s local plan be see hundred of home be build on greenfield site but the agree developer levy the section agreement which be supposedly for local infrastructure spending seem to be disappear into a black hole do the prime minister agree that agree infrastructure levy from developer should not be go into a general slush fund they should be spend on local road local school and local health service for the community impact by those development 
 my hon friend raise an excellent point that be why the government be reform the section payment system to ensure that new development be match by new infrastructure the current system see far too little of developer profit go to build new school hospital or transport infrastructure it be also too slow and plague by uncertainty and that   particularly hamper small local developer it will be replace by a new non negotiable locally determined infrastructure levy which will deliver exactly what my hon friend and other want to see investment in local community 
 i call the snp leader 
 i wish to start by pay tribute to snp legend winnie ewing and to the former manager of scotland man ’s national team craig brown who both sadly pass in recent day and i send good wish to all muslims who be celebrate eid mubarak 
 on sunday the prime minister patronise the public when he tell they that in the face of ever increase mortgage bill they simply need to hold their nerve what a nerve may i ask he the near billionaire when be the last time that he struggle to pay a bill 
 mortgage rate be rise because of inflation that be the root cause which be why it be absolutely the right policy to halve inflation and reduce it back to target that do mean that we have to make difficult decision that do mean that we have to be patient while those decision actually have an impact in the meantime as i be explain previously we be take practical step to support mortgage holder across the united kingdom particularly through the new support for mortgage interest scheme and the new mortgage charter 
 that answer confirm what we already know this prime minister be out of touch and the tory party be soon to be out of time what the public really want be change but in a week when the conservative party and indeed the labour party both refuse to accept proposal for public sector pay rise while at the same time accept the economic damage of brexit be it not the case that westminster offer the people neither real change nor real hope for the future 
 the hon gentleman just expose the complete economic illiteracy of the snp ’s position his question talk about the challenge pose to ordinary family by high interest rate cause by high inflation what do his next question do support a policy that would increase government borrowing and make the situation bad that just demonstrate completely candidly why the snp ’s approach to economic management be simply not fit for anyone in the united kingdom 
 local police station be a key part of community such as aldridge in my constituency which be why i continue to make the case to labour ’s police and crime commissioner for save and strengthen the role of aldridge police station rather than force it to close do the prime minister agree that any such closure would be reckless and that police and crime commissioner should be work with local community and local police team to provide great certainty particularly give the extra police officer this government have put into the west midland 
 i be pleased to hear about the extra police officer the government have fund in my right hon friend ’s community but i be concerned to hear about the plan closure of aldridge police station i thank she for raise such an important issue i know it be on which she be champion her constituent as she will know unfortunately that be a decision of the locally elect labour police and crime commissioner and i join she in urge they to think again 
 diolch yn fawr lefarydd the prime minister ’s solution to inflation be to push family into poverty while let corporate profit pile up economic illiteracy the international monetary fund say this week that the way to cut inflation be for company to cut their profit margin it be corporate greed that be fuel inflation not worker need for fair play can he explain to the in people in wales face hunger because they can not afford to buy decent food why they must pay his price for lower inflation 
 actually my right hon friend the chancellor meet with all the economic regulator this morning and they will be make an announcement later about their plan to ensure fairness of pricing in supply chain to ease the burden on consumer i be glad the right hon lady bring up the imf when it come to tackle inflation the imf in its word strongly endorse our plan to halve inflation and call our step decisive and responsible 
 as my right hon friend know i have be liaise closely with the department for levelling up housing and communities and with the treasury with regard to the terrible news of woking council ’s recent section notice do he agree that in this scenario the vulnerable must be protect and local councillor of all party must work together to try to put the council ’s finance back on the right track 
 i know my hon friend be a great champion for his woke resident as he know the secretary of state for levelling up have intervene in that authority and appoint commissioner to ensure that decision be take that provide the good outcome for resident include the most vulnerable and for the public purse i agree with he that local councillor should be work together with the commissioner to put the council ’s finance in order the commissioner will submit their report to the secretary of state set out progress on the council ’s path to improvement and financial sustainability and i look forward with he to see further progress 
 the prime minister have have responsibility for the uk economy now for day and he have deliver he have deliver the large national peacetime debt ever the large tax burden since the world war the high core inflation since the fast interest rate rise since and the big fall in living standard in our history will he stop lecture my constituent about hold their nerve ditch the lame excuse and admit   that he be literally the bad person to be lead this country through a cost of living crisis because he create it 
 again what do we hear from the labour party only idea that would make the situation far worse it be as simple as that the hon gentleman have sit there and support plan to borrow ten of billion of pound more that would make inflation bad he have sit there and say that we should not stand up to unaffordable union pay demand that would make the situation bad and he have sit there and support plan to not exploit our domestic source of energy imperille our energy security those be all thing that would make the situation bad for british family not just today but for year into the future this conservative government will keep do the right thing to support they 
 my constituent rely on many nearby hospital milton keynes where the government have commit to a new woman and child ’s hospital stoke mandeville which have just complete the build of a new child ’s a&e but also wycombe where infrastructure and maintenance issue in the age tower be prevent about operation from go ahead every year my local nhs trust have a plan for a new £ clinical centre at wycombe hospital will my right hon friend the prime minister work with i and buckinghamshire colleague to make that a reality 
 although as my hon friend know we be no long invite further scheme to join the new hospital programme i can tell he that new scheme will be consider through the rolling programme of capital investment in hospital infrastructure that will secure the building of new hospital beyond and it will mean investment to upgrade the nhs estate across the country future plan for that will be set out in spending review and fiscal event but in the meantime i know that he will continue to make the impassioned case for wycombe hospital and i join he in that 
 hundred of steelworker be outside parliament today and some be in the gallery to call on the prime minister to act now to back our vital steel industry before it be too late will he confirm today that he will match the ambition of the labour party and our international competitor to deliver competitive energy price invest in green steel production use uk steel in our procurement system and protect we from dirty steel import by introduce climate measure when will he get on with protect and support the industry 
 we be proud to support the steel industry and value the contribution that it make to this country that be why we put in place the energy intensive industry exemption scheme which provide hundred of million of pound of support to steel company for their energy bill we have also introduce the industrial energy transformation fund so that company can apply for capital grant to help they with the transition and be take forward plan in the treasury for carbon border adjustment mechanism to ensure   a level playing field that be also why during the pandemic i step in to support financially a steel company in wales 
 sadly despite year of lobbying the commonwealth parliamentary association international branch will leave the united kingdom as you know mr speaker that be of great concern to the house and although it be perhaps a little niche for our constituent it be important the cpa need special status but the government have not grant that by way of a short bill or an amendment to an exist bill could the prime minister at this late stage this month do something about that because otherwise the association will be go never to come back 
 the united kingdom value the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association my right hon friend the foreign secretary have make it clear that he do not want the cpa international to relocate he write to it in march to confirm that official from the foreign commonwealth and development office would work with the cpa to find a mutually acceptable solution to the status issue and i look forward to see progress

 no we be stick to the course of bring inflation down what the labour party need to understand be that that require make difficult and tough decision it require prioritise it require be able to say no when people come ask you to borrow more money those be the type of responsible decision that i and the conservative government will make because they be the right one for the country

 i welcome my hon friend ’s commitment to the important community asset in his constituency such as the historic grade ii list southport pier i be pleased that he have succeed in get the government to provide £ to undertake improvement as part of the coastal community fund and that come alongside the landmark £ town deal for southport the large town deal in the country 
 this be my opportunity to put a question to the prime minister for the resident of the city of chester   so why do the prime minister think it be acceptable for sewage to be pump into the beautiful river dee which flow through chester for the next year 
 of course it be not acceptable and that be why this government have go far than any other in tackle the issue commit to monitor of storm overflow and to an investment programme of £ to upgrade infrastructure enshrine strict target in law and introduce unlimited fine for water company but when it come to talk about those policy in this house the labour party could not even be bother to turn up and vote for they 
 later today parliament will welcome apprentice from around the uk who work in the aerospace industry and i be very much look forward to meet callum and britney who be apprentice at collins aerospace in my constituency will the prime minister join i in celebrate apprenticeship in the aerospace industry and encourage colleague to attend and meet their apprentice 
 i join my hon friend in celebrate everyone do an apprenticeship and in encourage everyone to go and meet their apprentice later today i pay tribute to callum and britney in particular my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of the aerospace industry particularly because of our new defence co operation agreement with italy and japan to build a new generation of fighter aircraft which will create thousand of new job across the country many of which will come through apprenticeship that be an example of this conservative government provide opportunity for the next generation

 i agree with the hon gentleman that child miss school be a tragedy and be incredibly damaging for educational outcome which be why during the pandemic and afterwards we invest £ to help child catch up with lose learning it be important that we continue to deliver on those plan and we will of course ensure that we work with the sector to have more child attend school more often 
 economic recovery and reconstruction will be vital to ukraine when it come to rebuild a free and sovereign nation so will my right hon friend help to galvanise the expertise of the uk ’s private sector to strengthen ukraine ’s recovery and economic prospect after this devastating war 
 time and again ukraine have show its ability to rapidly harness innovation and creativity and i know that its economic recovery will be no different my hon friend be right to highlight that private sector expertise and investment will be critical to that recovery i be pleased that over world lead company pledge to back ukraine ’s reconstruction at the successful recovery conference that the uk host the other week we be do our part as well with a $ world bank loan guarantee on top of all our other investment i think the conference show that there be enormous momentum across the world to support ukraine ’s recovery and that recovery and ambition be be lead by the united kingdom

 more 
 order we have do very well don’t spoil it now 
 my hon friend put it very well he have illustrate exactly the issue the labour party be unable to stand up to its union paymaster and back our plan to introduce minimum service and safety level in critical industry that be the type of practical action that support work family and it be action that the labour party be not strong enough to support 
 after the event in russia at the weekend it be unclear what the future hold for the wagner group but the catalogue of crime it have commit   across africa and the middle east and of course in ukraine can never be wash away despite all that the government do not yet have a permanent cabinet office official to co ordinate all the organ of government to pursue the criminal in the wagner group will the prime minister appoint and crucially will he fund the collection of evidence of wagner group war crime that have be commit across the world so that no matter what happen these criminal can be bring to justice in future 
 we have consistently condemn the wagner group and we carefully monitor its action in ukraine and the wide world that the hon gentleman have mention we have designate both the wagner group and its leader under our sanction regime and we support international mechanism that hold individual mercenary in the wagner group to account for violation of international law but i reassure the hon gentleman that we be also work very closely with our partner to counter the malign use of such proxy both by russia and more generally across the continent 
 on monday night an illegal traveller encampment be establish in bretton park on saturday the much love bretton festival be due to take place in that park this house pass legislation that give police more power to tackle illegal encampment will the prime minister make it clear from the dispatch box that he expect the police to use those power on these encampment which blight public space and public park in place such as peterborough 
 we absolutely recognise the misery that unauthorised encampment can cause to local community that be why we have deliver on our manifesto commitment to give police the power they need to tackle those people in unauthorised encampment who be cause harm of course how the police use those power be an operational matter for chief constable but we would not have legislate for they if we do not expect chief constable to use they i be tell that home office official be liaise regularly with the national police chiefs council on this exact matter 
 rise 
 final question martin docherty hughes 
 in the past couple of day yet again we have be remind that a member of the other house be appoint contrary to the recommendation of mi5 we learn from a channel film that even the monarch be ask to be involve because whitehall official be so opposed give that the person be deem a security risk to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland so i ask the prime minister do he agree with mi5 or do he agree with his predecessor that that peer should still be in the other house 
 mr speaker for obvious reason i will talk in more general term the house of lords appointments commission vet cross bench and party political life peerage nomination to the house of lords and where appropriate seek advice from government departments and agency the house of lords   appointments commission have previously undertake that be a prime minister to recommend a peerage against the commission ’s formal advice it would write publicly to the relevant parliamentary select committee 
 that complete prime minister ’s question we come now to the urgent question interruption if people could stop have conversation in the middle of the chamber that would be helpful mr slaughter 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement on the financial resilience of the water industry 
 water be what make life possible on our planet and it be essential for our health and wellbeing as well as for our economy include the production of food and clean energy the government be take significant step to ensure that the water industry be deliver the outcome that bill payer expect and deserve water company have invest £ since privatisation in in april the government publish the plan for water bring together more investment strong regulation and tough enforcement capacity for regulator in relation to those who pollute 
 ofwat and the government take the financial resilience of the water sector very seriously ofwat be the independent economic regulator for the water sector and have responsibility for its financial resilience the sector as a whole be financially resilient ofwat continue to monitor the financial position of all the key water and waste water company ofwat report annually on the sector ’s financial resilience and ofwat ’s late annual monitor financial resilience report show that the water sector be financially resilient 
 market confidence in the sector be demonstrate by new acquisition such as pennon ’s purchase of bristol water and by shareholder be willing to inject new capital ofwat have take step in recent year to strengthen the sector ’s position that include action to update the ringfencing provision in water company licence to well safeguard the interest of customer and bar water company from make payout to shareholder and remove money or asset from the business if they lose their investment grade credit rating ofwat have outline that water company must be transparent about how executive pay and dividend align to the delivery of service to customer include environmental performance since privatisation total capital investment have outstrip dividend by 
 on   march ofwat announce new power that will enable it to take enforcement action against water company that do not link dividend payment to performance for both customer and the environment in december ofwat strengthen its power on executive pay award by set out that shareholder and not customer will fund pay award where company do not demonstrate that their decision or pay award reflect overall performance we support ofwat ’s work and we urge all water company to take this opportunity to review their policy 
 the scale of government commitment to the water industry be highlight by the integrate plan for water and by our commitment to the financial resilience of the sector in deliver for customer and the environment 
 thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question but it be a concern that the secretary of state do not proactively make a statement to the   house on an issue of such importance indeed where be the secretary of state of the large water company in britain be potentially go to go to the wall and the secretary of state be miss in action 
 it be clear to anyone look on that a culture that allow vital investment in end the sewage scandal and tackle water leak to be sacrifice in favour of a goldrush for shareholder be never sustainable just last year as raw human sewage be be pump out across the country £ be pay out to shareholder now all that be warn about be come to pass leak be lead to water shortage sewage dumping pollute our river lake and sea and the only thing on the up be debt at £ the conservative party ’s cycle of privatise profit usually for multibillion pound foreign sovereign wealth fund and nationalise risk be not sustainable and neither be it a fair deal for work people 
 the news we be see be the result of the conservative party ’s fail profit above public interest experiment in which it hand over the water industry at a knock down price to private enterprise together with the entire infrastructure serve the nation that be almost unique to water for instance when rail be privatise the track be not sell off with water however the lot be hand over with few safeguard for our national interest our national security or bill payer 
 when be the minister ’s department make aware of the financial situation at thames water have her department have any reason to believe that those responsible at thames water would not be able to meet their licence condition or legal obligation if this mean a taxpayer fund bail out how much will that cost and how will it be pay for what assessment have she make of the liability of uk pension fund that be invest in thames water and in other water company consider to be at risk give where we be will she confirm her confidence in the financial regulator finally give what we see with thames water today do she have concern about any other water company or do she consider this to be an isolated case 
 in the department for environment food and rural affairs we have our individual portfolio and i be the water minister the secretary of state have full confidence in her ministers when send they to the dispatch box 
 the shadow minister raise the issue of debt for information debt to equity fall last year by in the water industry actually make it more resilient since privatisation capital investment in the water industry have be high than it be pre privatisation we need to get that out there and on the table 
 in term of thames water it be not for i to comment on the individual financial position of a water company we have an independent regulator that be do that indeed that be what the regulator ofwat be for water company be commercial entity and it be for the company and its investor to resolve any issue the government of course be confident that ofwat as the economic regulator of the water industry be work closely with any company that be face financial stress 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 sewage treatment plant be all too often overwhelmed at time of heavy rain as well as instal stormwater tank such as the new litre stormwater tank in scarborough do the minister agree that we should do more to encourage homeowner to harvest grey water which can buffer the effect of heavy rain and use that for such thing as flush the toilet 
 i thank my right hon friend for broaden the scope of the debate we be in discussion with the department for levelling up housing and communities many of these issue involve work with other department on grey water harvesting and well use the rain that do fall a farmer in devon whom i visit be collect all the water from his farm building roof to supply his animal 
 in assess as the minister have explain the resilience of the water industry what assessment be she make of the impact on uk pension fund if a major company such as thames water fail as be be widely suggest in the press 
 there be a structure and a process for work through this matter it be up to the individual water company and the regulator work with they to ensure that they be resilient that be why ofwat report annually on how resilient each water company be if that flag any issue ofwat work closely with they because we need our water company to be fully function we need to attract investment a huge sum of money have be invest since privatisation as i mention early in infrastructure to give our customer the kind of service they deserve we should also be mindful that it be not all pile on to customer we have to share the load 
 it be worth make the house realise that it be the opposition who vote against the environment act which give ofwat more power can my hon friend assure i that the water regulator ofwat will be able to clamp down on excessive cash payout and ensure that water company put their customer 
 i thank my hon friend for point that out he be absolutely right whatever the opposition say today of the measure they do not vote for in the environment act be to enable ofwat to hold water company to account where they do not demonstrate a link between dividend and performance they must have sound performance and be perform for their customer otherwise they can not pay out their dividend 
 the staggering complacency we be hear from the minister will come as no comfort to my constituent who be flood out year ago in the west london flood which be the year event in less than a decade if ofwat have be do such a good job in hold the water company to account as she be now apparently tell we why be we in this situation what exactly have ofwat be do 
 it have to be remember that privatisation occur in we have have a succession of different government during that time and it have be this   government who have accelerate clamp down on water company and open up transparency the hon lady ask what ofwat have do and i will name just a few thing since ofwat have update the licence so that if a water company lose its investment credit rating it be bar from make payout to shareholder in july it set out additional proposal to increase financial resilience include company have a strong credit rating in march it announce that it would take enforcement action against water company that do not link dividend payment to performance we have do more than any government before to ensure that we have a fully functioning strong regulator 
 on financial resilience have the minister take the opportunity to consider the hotchpotch of policy come from opposition front benchers on the subject under their prescription they would seek to take all the profit of water company to invest in capital expenditure that would undermine the financial resilience of those company that rely on private capital for investment in tackle this problem in the part of the country where labour do have responsibility wales have she notice that the sewerage overflow be almost double the rate per overflow pipe as in england 
 i thank my right hon friend for point that out i can not support more strongly what he say we have a private system and ofwat say that it be financially resilient we need investment in these company to make they function properly obviously we need to hold the company to account but we need to see enormous investment everything in the government ’s plan for water include the storm overflow discharge reduction plan be fully cost we be not pull the wool over people 's eye we be tell they clearly what this will mean and how it will deliver the water service that we need 
 thames water which be on the verge of go under provide a quarter of the population with their water supply when be the minister tell about its financial plight what be the plan if the bad come to the bad and it do go under 
 the hon member be right that thames water supply an enormous part of our population ofwat have be work closely with thames water as it do all water company and the government work with ofwat give it our strategic policy statement on what its priority will be overall the water company be consider resilient and much work be go on behind the scene with thames water to ensure that customer will not be affect if necessary there be a process in place to move we to the next stage 
 swindon resident will be concern about the future of thames water so i ask my hon friend please to keep i and colleague update on any issue relate to that underlie this issue labour ’s model will clearly never work we must understand that only the private sector will be able to invest interruption labour member bleat now but they do nothing about it when they be in government be the point not that where we have in effect a private   monopoly the regulator must be as effective as possible will my hon friend do everything possible to ensure that ofwat be work in the full interest of customer aspect of its operation do not seem to pass that test 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend thames water be a big water company that deliver on a wide scale ofwat be work very closely with the company on its plan which will be look over and submit and account will be submit in due course so that we have a resilient pathway customer include his constituent should rest assure that both their water and wastewater supply will be protect 
 this privatised industry know that at the end of the day the banker of last resort be the british taxpayer that be exactly where we be with thames water which have be take profit for the last year and not invest for the future regardless of what go on before we must have investment in what be in front of the industry but thames water have fail to plan ahead it have take money but not do the job expect of it while be in charge of such an essential public service what will the government do to protect consumer and ensure that we plan ahead for the industry 
 ofwat be the independent regulator and as the hon member will know the government direct it through the strategic policy statement it be ofwat ’s job to ensure that in the price review when the water company submit their plan they be go over the draft plan now they demonstrate that they will deliver on the government ’s target on storm overflow leakage and demand reduction it be for ofwat to ensure that company will be resilient in deliver that infrastructure there be a firm structure in place ofwat also constantly monitor company gearing debt to equity level and the government be confident that the regulator be take reasonable measure to challenge company to reduce those gearing level where appropriate 
 about a quarter of the country ’s economic output be in sector under regulator include the water industry with ofwat and in other sector with ofgem and the financial conduct authority we have see regulator not perform to the standard that the public or indeed industry would expect if we be honest we in this house and in parliament do not have the toolkit to assess regulator performance on a systemic basis year in year out will my hon friend work with ministerial colleague to see whether we can improve the regular oversight of regulator such as ofwat so that we can take a more rounded view on such issue rather than have they come through urgent question as bring by the opposition 
 i thank my hon friend for that it be essential that we have fully function regulator since the government come to power ofwat have do an enormous amount to streamline what it do improve transparency change licence and make change so that dividend be not pay if any environmental damage be be cause the government have direct that through the strategic policy statement indeed our target will ensure that the regulator enable the water company   to put the right measure in place he be right however that should never be complacent and if thing need to be improve through the regulator they should happen but i assure he that a big effort be be make 
 many of my constituent be hugely worried about report of thames water be on the brink and what that could mean for their bill thames water have be manage appallingly leak have not be deal with sewage have be continually dump and the former chief executive officer sarah bentley need to be ask to forgo her bonus all the while the government have be miss in action why be the government yet again run to catch up nothing in the minister ’s statement give confidence that they have a grip with our constituent pay the price 
 where water company underperform and do not meet their target a process be in place whereby basically they have to credit the money back to their customer last year £ be credit back in that respect so the regulator do have the tool to do that it have tighten up so many of its measure all of which will affect all the water companies.[official report   july vol c. 1mc 
 the minister will not be able to comment on thames water ’s finance in detail but can she assure my constituent who will be really worried that whatever happen their day to day service will be protect and the much need upgrade will still be deliver 
 i thank my hon friend for that he be right that customer come and thames water customer will be assure their water supply and wastewater service i be happy to meet he to discuss that 
 resident in twickenham teddington and the hamptons will be extremely worried to hear that thames water be on the brink of collapse but they be also feed up to the back tooth with this company not only do it pump sewage into our precious river thames but recently we have see sewage flood our street at time of flooding from rainfall and there be now plan to pump treat sewage into the thames at time of drought that be indicative of the company ’s underinvestment in fix leak and be strip to the bare bone while line executive pocket all the while the government have be miss in action and the regulator have fail will the minister back the liberal democrats proposal to reform water company into public good company transform their board and priority in the interest of the environment and consumer 
 i will highlight the thames super sewer it will be ready to open in the not too distant future which be a tremendous project for the people of london include many of her constituent we have a privatised system whose financial resilience as i have report have increase rather than decrease in the last year these company attract money from investor so that we can get what we need the government have cost plan the liberal democrats have no cost plan for what they suggest they might do with the water company nor plan for where the money will come from 
 it be worth point out to opposition party that of all uk coastal bathing water meet good or excellent condition in north norfolk we have lose blue flag beach which go from excellent to good but guess what there be not a single reason why they lose that flag under the environment agency ’s marking it look like it be down to not combine sewage overflow but entirely natural phenomenon could the minister help i get my blue flag back and hold the environment agency to task to ensure that it have a proper testing regime that transparently show that we have excellent bathing water quality all over north norfolk 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the issue of bathing water quality since privatisation we have virtually the good quality water come out of our tap of almost anywhere in the world we also have phenomenal result for our bathing water areas—93 be class as good or excellent he have concern about his area but i hope those beach will soon be back up to blue flag status the environment agency work closely on individual case where concern have be highlight i be happy to put he in touch with the environment agency or work with he to find out what those individual case be so that we can get those beach back up to the fantastic standard that they deserve 
 today not for the time most of my constituent have little or no water supply year ago not for the time hundred of my constituent have their home flood with raw sewage year after year thames water have fail its customer while obscenely reward its management and shareholder no will miss the asset stripper at thames water if it go under all we want be work infrastructure and good customer service at a reasonable cost be that too much to ask 
 that be what we want for all our customer that be why we have launch our plan for water to pull everything together to ensure that we deal with any pollution incident water supply issue and the future of the water industry it be why we have set our target and produce our storm sewage overflow plan and why the water company will have to spend £ on capital investment by to address that every water company include thames water have to make an action plan for each of its storm sewage overflow thames water will do that 
 when they be privatise water company have all the debt write off so they start with since then they have borrow £ much of which have be use to help pay £ in dividend the investment have be make by borrow and put it on to customer bill now the rating agency s&p have negative outlook for third of the uk water company it rat because they be over leverage and take out too much debt in an era of low interest which they now have to pay back this be not a triumph but a huge problem for the resilience of our water industry what will the minister do when water company start fall over 
 for information thames water itself have not pay any dividend for the last year ofwat will rightly hold company to account when they do   not clearly demonstrate the link between dividend and performance we make that possible through the landmark environment act.[official report   july vol c. 2mc 
 i want to bring the minister back to the figure we have just hear water company have no debt when they be privatise since then they have borrow £ and much of that have be use to help pay £ in dividend meanwhile we have an appalling sewage scandal particularly in the south east of england the fail company southern water which my constituent have no choice but to rely on be consider raise bill by £ per year by largely to pay for the investment that it should have be make in previous year do that not show that the privatisation of water be a serious mistake that need to be permanently rectify 
 privatisation have enable clean and plentiful water to come out of our tap it have unlock £ of funding to invest in the industry that be the equivalent of £ annually and be double what we have pre privatisation i be not say that there be not still a lot of scope for improvement i have stand at this dispatch box many time as have the secretary of state to say that some action of water company be completely unacceptable that be why we have introduce the storm overflow plan and our plan for water 
 as member have say funding and loan to the water company be a huge issue as that be where they have pay their dividend from on shareholder we have foreign investor take huge amount of money away from this country and we need well fund manager who be able to assess where they put their money they should be hold accountable too 
 ofwat have not be do what it be suppose to do i believe that the chief executive of ofwat apply for a job at thames water that show what the company be do and how ofwat work with they rather than scrutinise they people be look for the next job we have to stop that and stop my constituent pay more for water they need decent water in their home and in the environment around they that be what we want the government to ensure this tory policy have fail for year 
 i be not sure what the question be we want the same thing value for customer and clean and plentiful water we want to hold the water company to account we want they to invest the money need to deliver the right service that be why we have a plan for water our target and the measure in the environment act it be why the regulator ofwat have take all the action i mention to increase the transparency of water company and to ensure that money be not be pay out if there be any environmental impact or performance negativity 
 in the last year a number of my constituent on the westfield estate have have their home and garden flood with raw sewage yorkshire water accept that it be its sewage but do not accept responsibility to help with the clean up will the minister look at the legal position to ensure that water company be hold accountable in   the meantime we should put pressure on yorkshire water and other to pay for the clean up that my constituent be have to fund themselves 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have put huge pressure on the water company which now have to invest £ in infrastructure to deal with sewage issue if he want to meet i to talk about that issue i will be happy to 
 back in january i ask the water minister whether she think that the current system of regulation be fit for purpose and she say yes i ask she again do she still think that it be 
 yes 
 water company be sell with no debt when they be privatise in in fact they be give a £ green dowry by the government since then they have take on borrowing of £ divert income from customer bill to pay dividend and interest payment as a result water bill have increase by upwards of in real term do the minister honestly think that consumer hail privatisation as a success 
 ultimately the customer pay for investment in the industry but over a very long period as the hon lady will know if a company do not pay out dividend it would struggle to get access to finance to fund future investment that would limit the level of investment and have an impact on future customer company have to pay up front for a lot of that investment because they need to secure a large amount of funding to pay for it to avoid customer bill increase drastically to pay for that company have to secure the money by raise debt or equity she know how it work the regulator have to ensure that that system be fully function the water company be resilient and we have all the resilient water supply that we require 
 it have be report that the company be draw up their business plan for to and that on average they be look at a increase in bill give what we have hear today would billpayer in my constituency not think that rather than pay extra to water company they may as well just flush their money down the drain for all the good it will do to improve water quality service and investment in infrastructure 
 all those plan be be assess right now the draft plan go to ofwat where they be analyse with a fine toothed comb all the thing i have mention today will be scrutinise so that we can deliver the infrastructure that be need and have the clean and plentiful water supply we require as well as a clean and healthy environment with no undue impact on customer bill all those thing have to be take into account to deliver the water supply that the people we meet and the people we serve deserve 
 the british public should not be ask to cover the cost of failure by the water monopoly and their shareholder they have   borrow extensively to pay dividend while fail to make necessary investment in infrastructure and resilience do the minister agree that if the government be compel to take thames water into public ownership it should stay in public hand
