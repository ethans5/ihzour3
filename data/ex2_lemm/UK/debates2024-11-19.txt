i can assure the hon gentleman that the minister for the cabinet office be carefully consider this matter if the hon gentleman would like the minister for the cabinet office will write to he but he be consider it 
 we expect the infected blood compensation authority to begin make payment to people who be infect under the infected blood compensation scheme by the end of this year payment to the affected be expect to begin in follow a set of regulation 
 turn to a question raise by the hon member for perth and kinross shire about the independence of ibca it be rightly operationally independent parliament would clearly expect the government to have oversight of a scheme of this size and for there to be proper management give the amount of public money go into the scheme it be true that there be only non departmental public body that be independent of the government be ibca and the other be the national audit office it be absolutely right for ibca to have that independence 
 i commend the hon gentleman on secure this debate i speak to he before it i have always be a speaker for human right as he and the house know whenever i hear story like the he have outline so well it tell i that there be injustice the friendship between the uk and uae do not matter this be about justice and do right when somebody be discriminate against do he not agree that the inaction of the foreign commonwealth and development office’s i say that respectfully in respect of of our citizen be incredibly concerning the fact that mr cornelius have serve his sentence only to have the goalpost move do not speak of international justice but injustice i believe that our foreign office have an absolute duty to advocate for this british citizen 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point he have also be vocal in his support for british citizen who have be arbitrarily detain and on wide human right issue i commend he for his work on that agenda the fcdo point about the toolkit be really important the difficult question that we have to ask ourselves be how have we have reach the situation where of our citizen be languish in the jail of a friendly country a close ally with all the potential damage to uk uae relation that that do 
 i have huge admiration for the work of the fcdo and its staff and i know from colleague and friend around the globe how much its work be appreciate and respect on the world stage we have many fine diplomat and public servant but i have to say in all candour that it have be fail for many year in its handling of state hostage taking and arbitrary detention of british national abroad ryan cornelius include 
 in the last parliament the foreign affairs committee publish a significant report with a number of recommendation not all of which be take up it criticise the fcdo for its unnecessarily defensive culture in this area which impede scrutiny harm victim and their family and undermine public trust the report find that previous government of all stripe have fail to learn the lesson from respond to such situation and have be slow or unwilling to call out guilty country our atlantic ally the united states and canada have learn those lesson and create official role to co ordinate the response to state hostage taking and arbitrary detention in order to get their people home which be of course a priority for all of we indeed the creation of such a role be of the committee ’s recommendation to the foreign office and the foreign secretary 
 this time last year when the foreign secretary be the shadow foreign secretary he commit a labour government to create a special envoy for arbitrary detention and state hostage taking i warmly welcome the minister of state to her role i think i can still call she a new minister a few month into the new government and i know that she take these matter seriously i ask she to reflect back to her colleague and the secretary of state that we should stick to that commitment let we follow in the footstep of canada and the united states and let we not be advise out of that promise by official 
 as i conclude i return to the heart the debate with simple request to his highness sheikh mohammed as a gesture of friendship for the continue prosperity of our country and for our mutual security i hope that he will grant clemency to ryan cornelius the uae ’s national day eid al etihad be only around the corner on   december i hope that on that day of great celebration the dubai government will find the good will to extend a pardon to ryan and allow he to return home to the united kingdom and his family

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 mr speaker i associate myself with your remark about the war in ukraine i know the whole house stand with ukraine as it defend its freedom and democracy this be precisely why the prime minister ’s leadership at the g20 and in other international fora be vital in stand up not just for our national interest but for our value across the world 
 over the past decade the conservatives mismanagement have leave the nhs with few full time equivalent gps than in hundred of practice closure the loss of over community pharmacy and nhs dentistry a distant memory which be why this government take immediate action to employ more gps through the additional role reimbursement scheme through the chancellor ’s budget measure and through our year plan we will shift the focus of healthcare out of hospital and into the community 
 in my makerfield constituency wigan council and my local nhs trust be work closely together to pioneer a health system focus on prevention and deliver through neighbourhood health centre but they need help what be the secretary of state do to improve access to primary care especially data drive preventive care through neighbourhood health centre 
 i agree with my hon friend on the importance of prevention at a local level we be trialle neighbourhood health centre across the country to bring together a range of service ensure that healthcare be close to home and that patient receive the care they deserve this be part of our broad ambition to move towards a neighbourhood health service with care deliver close to home i would be delighted to meet my hon friend to hear more about what be go well in his community and what further action we need to take 
 do the secretary of state agree that access to primary care be hugely important to support accident and emergency department at hospital like the princess alexandra in harlow do he also agree that access to primary care be about not just gps but dentist finally what be the government ’s plan to support dental surgery such as the aptly name harlow dental surgery which i visit last week 
 my hon friend be right that many of the pressure on our hospital such as the princess alexandra in harlow be a result of pressure in other part of the health and social care system it be outrageous that the big reason for to year old present to hospital be tooth decay which be why we need to get nhs dentistry back on its foot along with the rest of the nhs 
 my hon friend the minister for care and i have regularly meet the british dental association since the general election to consider how the dental contract can be reform to retain dentist and rebuild nhs dental service 
 in my local area of cambridgeshire and peterborough gps be report feeling increasingly burn out with working condition become more extreme the number of patient per fully qualified gp in my area have increase by nearly since december a high increase than the national average can the secretary of state tell i what his department be do to make the situation more sustainable while improve access to primary care 
 general practice be a value part of the nhs and gps be a vital part of our nhs family in fact they be deliver more appointment than ever before and we recognise the significant pressure they face at the same time we know that patient be struggle to see their gp which be why we have invest an additional £ into the arrs to recruit more newly qualified gps this year this will take pressure off general practice and we will be announce further budget allocation in the not too distant future to set out what further support we will provide for general practice 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 last week i visit summertown health centre staff there implore i to say to the government that the issue be not just more money we welcome the £ that have be allocate for capital investment in primary care but the snarl up process at integrate care board level and get investment to the right place quickly what will the secretary of state ’s government do to ensure icb deliver that money to where it be need and fast 
 the chair of the health and social care committee be right that investment be vital but so be reform we task icb with lead the development of the new neighbourhood health service we be remove their responsibility for performance management of trust in order to free up their focus so that primary and community service have the attention that be desperately need in the come week we will be talk to the british medical association and the royal college of general practitioners about how we ensure the investment announce by the chancellor lead to improve patient care and a reform neighbourhood health service 
 goff ’s oak in my constituency of broxbourne have see a lot of development what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that gp surgery be deliver before hundred of new home be build 
 of course we need to deliver both new home and gp surgery but the previous conservative government deliver neither we have a housing crisis and an nhs crisis in this country i would have think conservative member might have show some humility and responsibility for those fact before challenge a government who have be in office for only month 
 in cornwall only of delay discharge from hospital be because of lack of social care package with the remainder involve the significant degree of support need from primary and community nhs service the royal college of nursing have point out that there have be a reduction in district nurse in the last decade so what can the government do to replace those essential role at a primary care level 
 the hon gentleman be right last weekend i be up in middlesbrough with local member where we see a great example of hospital at home deliver by the community nursing team and the community health trust we have to do a lot more in that space to ensure we provide care close to people home indeed often in the home keep they out of hospital and close to home which be well for they and well value for the taxpayer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the royal college of general practitioners have say the national insurance tax increase be expect to cost appointment we know from answer to write question that have be submit that gps hospice and care home be not exempt from the increase and will not find out until april what if any mitigation will be put in place so cutback be now be plan will the secretary of state explain how his choice to tax gps will increase gp access 
 i can reassure health and care provider that we will be set out allocation long before april next year i recognise that people need to plan ahead of the new financial year when decide allocation we take into account the range of pressure on different part of the system people have hear what i have say already about the need to shift out of hospital into primary and community service the shadow minister talk about choice conservative members seem to welcome the £ investment but oppose the mean of raise it i be afraid they can not do both if they support the investment they need to support the way in which we raise the money if they do not support the way in which we raise the money they need to spell out how they would raise it or be honest about the fact that if they be still in government they would continue to preside over a mismanage decline 
 gp describe the situation as schrödinger ’s primary care gps be see as private contractor so not exempt from the ni increase but they be exempt from the small business relief because they be deem to be public do the department of health team knowingly go along with the treasury team ’s plan to tax primary care without mitigation lead to cut or do it not understand or spot the complexity of what be go on so mitigation have to be put in place now which be it 
 i be terribly impolite i should have welcome the shadow minister to his place in response to his question 
 conservative members seem to welcome the £ investment and be happy to tell we how it should be spend but they oppose the mean of raise it they can not do all those thing they need to be honest with the country either they support the investment in the nhs or they say they would cut it which be it 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the condition of nhs hospital equipment 
 the darzi review make it absolutely clear that the nhs have be starve of capital it be year behind the private sector in its use of technology and we have few scanner per person than in comparable country that be why at the budget the chancellor announce an investment of £ for capital funding which will include investment for new artificial intelligence enable scanner which will help tackle that backlog 
 resident in somerset and in north somerset my part of the world recognise the £ that have be grant for new radiotherapy machine as announce in the budget which will fund up to machine however machine will pass their sell by date their year recommend life by the end of this year will the secretary of state and the minister agree to meet radiotherapy uk which want to highlight the huge cost benefit of have a more consistent rolling programme of machine maintenance and replacement in the nhs year plan 
 the hon lady highlight the important matter of the lifetime of some of the machine which we be finally address after the last year of not address issue that include provide support to ensure that the machine work properly official regularly meet radiotherapy uk and the department value its input if there be specific incident that the hon lady wish to highlight i be happy to respond to she 
 do the minister agree that the nhs can not continue to rely on outdated and obsolete equipment it be ridiculous that gps still use pager and hospital communicate with each other use fax machine after year of decline under the previous government will she commit to bring our nhs into the century 
 my hon friend lay bare an important issue we all know and critically staff know that we be ask they to do the most incredible job with outdated technology it be bad for staff and it be bad for patient that be why move from an analogue to a digital system be crucial i be fortunate to visit colleague at nhs england office up in leeds last week to see some of the fantastic work they be do on the app we will ensure that the nhs come into the century 
 what step he be take to improve mental health support service 
 lord darzi find that mental health waiting list have surge with more than child wait a year for their appointment that be why we will recruit more mental health worker provide access to mental health support in every school and roll out young future hub in every community i be delighted to tell my hon friend that a bill to modernise the mental health act be introduce in the other place on   november that be a promise that we make before the election a promise that we keep 
 i welcome the minister ’s comment my brother have very complex mental health need we as a family know at hand the difficulty not only of access the service and of the long waiting time but the challenge of support staff who be not constantly on a churn and the lack of community fund support service our experience be no different to that of many other family will the minister meet i to discuss how we will make mental health service more accessible in community invest more in preventive service and fund more community base provision 
 i will be pleased to meet my hon friend this government think it be unacceptable that too many people be not receive the care that they deserve and we know that wait for mental health service be far too long we be determined to change that with the measure i set out in my opening the government have also introduce nhs for mental health so that people who be in crisis or be concerned about a family member or love can now call and speak to a train mental health professional 
 facility such as leisure centre and swimming pool like the sovereign centre in eastbourne where i learn to swim be critical in support people ’s mental health locally will the minister support i in put pressure on the ministry of housing communities and local government to expand the criterion of the town fund to allow we to be able to spend it to invest in our leisure centre and sport and fitness facility for local people 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question we be a mission lead government and of course tackle health inequality be a job not just for the department of health and social care but for all government departments i will be very happy to raise the role that ministers can play in improve mental health and wellbee in my bilateral with the ministry of housing communities and local government 
 what estimate he have make of the number of new dental training place need in the east of england 
 year of conservative neglect and incompetence have leave huge swathe of the east of england as dental desert as part of our year plan we will be work with nhs england to assess the need for more dental trainee in area such as the east of england where we know that many people be struggle to find an nhs dentist i be aware of the university of east anglia ’s plan to open a dental school and i recently meet mp from the east of england include the hon gentleman to discuss that process i encourage the uea to continue with its bid for a new dental school 
 the minister well know that there be a lack of dentist in the east of england because there be no undergraduate training facility the near place be either birmingham or london he have kindly mention the university of east anglia which be ready to go with a new building under construction it have wide cross party support as he also know from the meeting that he hold recently so when will he make the announcement 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that follow up question but he will recall that when we meet i and my official make it clear to he that the uea have not yet submit its bid for a dental school in that meeting we say please go back to the uea and encourage they to submit that bid when they do we will look at it very carefully 
 many of my constituent in bedford be struggle to get an nhs dentist i be also hear from those who have try to book an appointment only to discover that they have be remove from the nhs list without any warning the government have commit to improve the dental contract in do so will they ensure that dentist can no long drop people from their book leave they without any access to care without prior notice 
 my hon friend be right we will reform the dental contract to rebuild dentistry in the long term and to increase access to nhs dental care with a shift to focus on prevention and the retention of nhs dentist we continue to meet representative from the british dental association and other representative of the sector to discuss how we can well deliver our share ambition to improve access for nhs dental patient 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of propose change to employer national insurance contribution on staffing cost for health and care provider 
 the leadership show by the chancellor have enable she and the government to fix the foundation of the public finance and fill the £ black hole leave by the previous government the decision that she take mean that she be able to provide this department with an extra £ and a real term increase in core local government spending power by about that be the right decision for the right reason in the national interest and i be take into consideration pressure on all part of health and social care before make final allocation for the year ahead 
 in north east fife we have a particular issue with access to dental surgery especially with the recent closure of a surgery in leven difficulty stem from recruitment from abroad as a result of visa change and also simply from practice go private and come out of the system obviously the nhs be devolve in scotland but do the secretary of state agree that put staffing under further strain from increase national insurance contribution will only make thing bad for dentist what in his conversation be he do to ensure that dentist get the support that they need 
 it be because the chancellor take the decision that she do in the budget that my department have receive £ to reform and improve health and social care as i say before the general election all part of the united kingdom suffer under the previous conservative government which be why i be sure that member from across scotland will welcome the extra £ this year and £ next year the big funding increase since devolution i be sure that the snp government will welcome the increase and they certainly have no excuse now for not act 
 year of neglect have leave hospice in a perilous condition they be deal with the rise in national insurance contribution pay and other cost pressure so i welcome the fact that the secretary of state be put in place measure to ensure that the funding recover will he assure i that integrate care board not only will pass on that recovery from the increase cost to hospice but will help they catch up from the tory year of neglect of the whole sector 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question i be look carefully at the pressure on hospice in fact only last friday i visit saint francis hospice which serve my constituent and people right across east london and west and south essex i see at hand the brilliant work it be do on end of life care but also the pressure it be under and i be take those pressure into account before decide allocation for the year ahead 
 i have try repeatedly through write parliamentary question to get an answer to this without success so i will try ask it face to face will the secretary of state tell the house how much his chancellor ’s change to national insurance contribution will cost the nhs 
 the hon member talk about the employer national insurance contribution as if they be a burden on the nhs it be thank to the decision take by the chancellor that we can invest £ in health and social care the conservatives welcome the investment but oppose the mean of raise it do they support the investment or not they can not duck the question they have to answer 
 the right hon member speak of duck question but it be worry that week after the budget he still do not know or will not tell the house how much it will cost the nhs of course change to national insurance contribution affect not just the nhs directly but supplier contractor charity and other nhs care provider i know you be a great supporter of your local air ambulance service mr speaker as i be of the lincs notts air ambulance which now need to raise £ extra just to fund this government ’s ill advise change to nic that £ be a lot of cake to sell car to wash and fun run to complete and that be just example of pressure place on lifesave service right across the country will the minister confirm that he will meet the chancellor explain the disastrous effect of the policy and insist that she reverse it 
 again we have not yet announce how we be allocate the budget for the year ahead but i remind the conservatives that it be thank to the choice the chancellor make in her budget that she be able to invest £ in health and social care would they cut the £ this labour government be invest in the nhs if not how would they pay for it welcome to opposition 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 hospices provide essential care for people at the most difficult point of their life and they be usually only partially fund by the nhs hospice uk say that real term funding have fall by £ since and hospice be struggle with this hike in national insurance contribution hope house child ’s hospice in north shropshire estimate that it will cost £ will the secretary of state commit to either exempting hospice from the nics increase or ensure that they be fund to cover those additional cost 
 i be grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson for her question i pay tribute to the child ’s hospice in her constituency and indeed to haven house child ’s hospice which serve my constituency 
 and derian house child ’s hospice 
 and indeed your very own local hospice mr speaker i be sure that will appear on the record i be particularly thankful for the advocacy we have receive from hospice uk and charity such as together for short life and other that be make their voice hear about the pressure on the system i say to all hospice across the country that i be take those pressure into account before decide allocation for the year ahead because i want to ensure that everyone whatever their age receive access to the timely and good quality end of life care palliative care and of course support for people with life limit condition that all of they deserve 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on staff salary in the care sector 
 i be proud that the chancellor raise the salary of hundred of thousand of care worker in the budget last month the government introduce legislation to deliver the ever fair pay agreement for adult social care while we be give care worker a pay rise the leader of the opposition be belittle their work as merely wipe bottom i gently say to the conservative party that it be well to be wipe bottom than talk out of they this be an important issue and i be deal with ministerial colleague on it 
 accord to last month ’s skills for care report most care worker be pay only a couple of penny above the national minimum wage while the sector can not recruit and retain the people it need will the minister set out the timetable for establish the fair pay agreement and adult social care negotiating body and will he give the house an assurance that the care trade union will be closely involve in its design 
 we take quick action on the employment rights bill which include the fair pay agreement within day of take office the consultation process on the negotiate body can begin only once the bill have become an act we be engage widely with stakeholder and i assure my hon friend that union will play a central role in that process but let we remember that through the national living wage we be give the lowest pay full time care worker a pay increase of £ per year 
 barrier to well staff salary in the care sector be the additional employer national insurance contribution be the minister and his colleague consider an exemption for gp practice charity and hospice from national insurance employer contribution 
 as my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care point out when we win the general election on   july we inherit public finance in their bad state since the world war through the chancellor we have take responsible action to deal with those issue my right hon friend the secretary of state have also say that we be look at the budget in the round and we will report on that in due course 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dentist 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dentist 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of access to nhs dentist 
 after year of tory neglect and incompetence nhs dentistry in england have be leave in a parlous state tooth decay be the most common reason why child age to be admit to hospital and of the country—13 people have an unmet need for dentistry rescue nhs dentistry will not happen overnight we will expand the provision of urgent dental appointment across the country and we be work with the sector to reform the dental contract in order to increase access and incentivise more nhs care 
 yesterday i hear from a disabled constituent who have spend over a year try to find an nhs dentist but without success the only solution be to come to london for emergency treatment that become a shockingly common story under the previous government as a step our integrate care board be put extra dentist into peterborough and the surround town to increase access will the minister update the house on progress and on how we will far improve access to nhs dentistry 
 i be very pleased to hear about what my hon friend ’s icb be do work with the dental sector we will deliver measure to improve access target area that need it most those measure include additional urgent appointment and reform of the dental contract the golden hello scheme which incentivise dentist to work in underserved area be under way across the country and dentist be also be offer a new patient premium to treat new patient 
 do the minister agree that it be unacceptable that more than people in fife be not register with an nhs dentist will he share any learning from this government ’s action to increase access to dentistry with his colleague in the scottish government and urge they to fulfil their responsibility so that people in my constituency can get the dental treatment that they need 
 responsibility for dental service in scotland be of course a matter for the scottish government but government across the uk work together to spread good practice and deliver on our common goal the scottish national party government have an extra £ this year and £ next year through the barnett formula i hope that they will prioritise health include dentistry and undo some of the damage that they themselves have do to dentistry in scotland 
 some of year old in weston super mare have enamel or dental decay a figure well above the national average the better health north somerset team do amazing work to promote good oral health but regular dentist check up be the oral health silver bullet will the minister explain and outline the work he be do to ensure that child in weston and worle and across the country get the dentistry service that they so desperately need 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this vital issue prevention be of course always well than cure so i be very proud of the fact that we be introduce supervise toothbrushing for to year old in the most deprived community and where there be the most unmet need we be also work to sort out the nhs contract so we can ensure that child get the care they need 
 have training locally at the university of east anglia be important for my constituent but in the short term what step be the minister take to speed up the process by which dentist get on the dental performer list so that they can work in the nhs and not just privately be he also consider bring in a provisional overseas registration scheme 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question we be look at provisional registration as i also mention to his hon friend   the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew we be very open to the idea of a dental training school at the university of east anglia we need to ensure that we push on the full spectrum of all these measure because there be a crisis in nhs dentistry and we need to get on and fix it 
 toothless in huntingdon in my constituency have write to i highlight that of patient under cambridgeshire and peterborough integrate care system no long have an nhs dentist it want dental practice to provide access to those need emergency treatment and a priority pathway for referral from hospital department such as cardiology and oncology to that extent what step be be take in huntingdonshire to improve dental access across rural cambridgeshire how be the government help the cambridgeshire and peterborough integrate care system to address those issue 
 obviously the golden hello scheme for rural area be very important we be push forward on that and i be pleased to say that hundred have express interest in it and appointment be start on that basis the hon gentleman be right about training place as i have already mention we be very open to establishment and institution come forward with   proposal for that we be live in a country where the big cause of hospital admission for to year old be have their rotten tooth remove that be a truly dickensian state of affair and it need to be fix as a priority 
 early this year i be at an orthodontist ’s practice that carry out work on behalf of the nhs it say the issue be that when people be refer to it by their general dentist it can not go on to do the orthodontic work because their tooth be in too bad a state so they be refer back to the dentist but they can not get in because of waiting list and issue when we look at reform dental contract will we look at orthodontic one too

 i welcome the secretary of state ’s plan to reform the nhs but may i caution against the idea that the answer be to fire more incompetent manager the problem be not bad management it be micromanagement from the centre that see hospital manage with more than target by nhs england make ours of the most micromanage healthcare system in the world will the secretary of state ’s plan allow manager more autonomy help they to innovate save money and improve care for patient 
 i be happy to confirm that it be my view that when there be too many target and everything be be measure nothing end up be measure we need to give more freedom and autonomy to good leader include clinical leader and manager in the nhs who be come up with some of the good productivity gain in the system that be why we have announce new support for and investment in the college of leadership for both clinical and executive leader in the nhs i would be delighted to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss those issue he be a great chair of the health and social care select committee but back in july we see a great example of how we can improve thing by sack bad manager

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the government ’s response to the jailing of pro democracy activist in hong kong 
 i thank the right hon member for her question on this important matter and i welcome she to her new role it be a real pleasure to be across the chamber from she this morning 
 i be glad to reassure the right hon lady that my colleague the minister for the indo pacific the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west have issue a statement on the verdict she make clear that china ’s imposition of the national security law in hong kong have erode the right and freedom of hongkongers she make clear that the sentencing decision be a clear demonstration of the hong kong authority ’s use of the nsl to criminalise political dissent as she say the so call nsl45 be guilty only of exercise their right as guarantee under the international covenant on civil and political right and basic law and of exercise their right to freedom of speech assembly and political participation china ’s imposition of the nsl in hong kong have erode the right and freedom of hongkongers and the uk government will always stand up for the people of hong kong 
 the jailing of pro democracy campaigner in hong kong under the draconian national security law be appalling it be a serious blow to freedom in hong kong the harsh application of this disturbing law to suppress people in hong kong can not go unanswered in government my party consistently champion for that law to be repeal and we give safe route for british national overseas in need of protection i be proud to have establish that scheme as the then home secretary we also publish report twice a year on the situation in hong kong to raise our grave concern about the erosion of freedom with the chinese authority and at the united nations 
 yesterday the prime minister meet president xi and say he want a respectful relationship where both country try to avoid surprise he even confirm that he have call in the application for the new chinese embassy but less than hour later the sino british declaration have be trample on yet again with the sentencing of pro democracy campaigner where do that leave the government ’s reset with beijing do the prime minister actually secure any commitment on hong kong yesterday will the prime minister now be hold further conversation with president xi to convey his concern about this appalling jail why do the minister for the indo pacific this morning not call in her statement for the repeal of the national security law 
 the official no read out of the prime minister ’s meeting with president xi fail to mention jimmy lai ’s case we understand the prime minister do raise concern but that be not enough do he call for jimmy   lai to be release and for an end to his politically motivated trial a yes or no answer be need because there be an important distinction between the 
 the uk have an historic and moral commitment to the people of hong kong we must stand up for their right under the international covenant on civil and political right and basic law the government must provide the mettle need to handle the relationship with china to stand up for the freedom and democracy of hong kong and to raise their game 
 the government absolutely agree about the historic relationship between the uk and hong kong and the current incredibly strong and important relationship in opposition my party rightly support the measure for british national overseas we have be crystal clear in our view on yesterday ’s sentencing i repeat that it be a clear demonstration of the hong kong authority ’s use of the nsl to criminalise political dissent 
 respectfully i have to say to the right hon lady that when she seek to lecture the new government on our approach to china she should be aware of what we see over the past year a wild oscillation in policy towards china that go from the golden era period right through finally to a complete lack of engagement that be out of step with our partner include the us france and germany which be have those conversation the new government have be determine to have those conversation 
 the right hon lady refer to the prime minister ’s meeting where he make very clear his concern about human right issue he do raise jimmy lai ’s case that be very clear from the footage of that meeting if she have not see it i respectfully encourage she to look at it we will continue to raise human right issue as part of our consistent approach to china 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 the verdict and sentence of the be like the national security law itself and the treatment of jimmy lai clear violation of the sino british joint declaration on hong kong follow the meeting between president xi and the prime minister will my right hon friend please share with the house what step the government plan to take to ensure that the joint declaration be adhere to 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for the work that she be undertake on this matter through her leadership of the select committee 
 the uk government have be very clear about these issue the right hon lady rightly mention the case of the british national jimmy lai whose trial will resume tomorrow and whose case be a priority for the uk government the foreign secretary raise it during his meeting with china ’s foreign minister wang yi at the summit of the association of southeast asian nations on   july and as i have say the prime minister also raise it during his engagement a few day ago we will continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivate prosecution and release jimmy lai immediately and we will continue to press   for consular access and indeed exert pressure in relation to the other human right issue that be of such concern to everyone in the house 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we be deeply concerned by the sentencing of the nsl45 beijing ’s assault on fundamental liberty in hong kong liberty that it be oblige to preserve under the joint declaration continue we have a moral duty to stand with hongkongers not least jimmy lai i meet his son sebastian last week his father have be hold for in solitary confinement for more than year despite a serious health condition do the minister understand that meet chinese ministers as the foreign secretary and the prime minister have in the last month without set out any consequence give china the green light to continue we see under the conservatives that this passive approach yield no result so do the minister agree that there should be no further ministerial meeting until these human right abuse be address and specifically do she agree that there should be no visit by the chancellor to beijing until jimmy lai be release 
 the foreign secretary have also meet the family of jimmy lai and like all of we on this side of the house be deeply concerned about his situation jimmy lai be of course year old and there be deep concern about his welfare the uk be absolutely clear about the fact that he must be release immediately i have to say however that i do not agree in any way with the hon gentleman ’s characterisation of the current uk government ’s approach during the latter year of the previous government we see what be arguably a passive approach and a lack of engagement with no meeting and visit and that be not the right approach to take it follow the golden era when there be a very different approach an approach some would say that be not clear eyed the current government be instead be consistent we be engage where it be necessary to challenge as well as engage where it be necessary to compete and indeed to co operate that be the right approach when it come to these matter of human right as well as our relationship with china more broadly 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on hong kong i thank ministers for their effort and recognise the effort of the prime minister however after nearly year in solitary confinement for jimmy lai and with a trial begin in a court that we know will only ever find he guilty at what point do the delicate diplomacy have to give way to something more like a demand for his freedom 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his recognition of that engagement as i mention a few moment ago the uk government be deeply concerned about jimmy lai ’s situation but we have be crystal clear and that include the clarity provide by the prime minister which in respect of this issue as well as other be very much in evidence during his meeting at the g20 
 i have sit watch both government on this and i do not think that any government have the right to accuse the party that be formerly in power and talk about what it get wrong because that government get it all wrong and this be get it all wrong as well 
 the key point be this the minister have refer to all those who have be incarcerate but particularly to jimmy lai who be in solitary confinement yesterday when the prime minister rightly start to raise the issue of jimmy lai and human right all the journalist be clear out of the room straightaway because the chinese government do not want they to hear what he be say just before that meeting president xi say that china would brook no interference when it come to democracy and human right and that be of his red line i put this question simply to the minister do she not think that without some kind of sanction china will go on and on america have sanction many senior official in hong kong for these abuse and we have sanction none do she not think it be time for we to say we will sanction someone if you do not stop 
 i believe it be appropriate to make relative judgment so that we can assess the right way forward for the uk ’s relationship with china that be why the uk government be conduct an audit of our relationship with china so that we can have a consistent approach we believe that be incredibly important so i be afraid that i respectfully do not agree with the right hon gentleman i have a ringside seat for some of the action of the previous government during the golden era and for what be suggest then around trade protection we need to move forward with a more clear eyed approach and the uk government could not have be clear on these matter of human right include the prime minister himself as the right hon gentleman just acknowledge on sanction he will understand of course that i will not speculate on future designation as to do so could reduce their impact but i can reassure he that the fcdo continue to keep potential sanction designation under close review 
 over hong kong family have settle in read over the past few year include in my constituency and i have stand alongside hong kong activist in peaceful demonstration here in the uk the onerous sentencing of pro democracy activist in hong kong will give people a broad reason to fear transnational repression and continue harassment here in the uk can the minister assure we that she will work to upkeep not only the bno visa programme and the path to citizenship but the civil liberty of hongkongers here in the uk who may be at risk of transnational repression 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue i have read her fascinating book which cover human right in china and she be clearly an expert on these matter as well as have constituency experience the uk government ’s view be that any form of harassment be unacceptable and that political freedom must be retain include in the uk and above all for bno we will continue to ensure that that be the case 
 in the hong kong police issue arrest warrant for overseas activist under the national security law what be minister do to challenge the extraterritorial reach of the national security law 
 we be very clear as be the previous government at the time of the passage of that law we believe it be incredibly important that people in hong kong and beyond be able to exercise political right and indeed to participate politically all that the group of individual who have just be sentence be do be exercise their right to political participation we will resolutely defend that right include in the uk and elsewhere 
 i look forward to the minister ’s report on the audit of the relationship with china and of the continuum of action from sanction onwards that the government be look at in the meantime may i ask the minister to raise with the chinese government the case of carol ng man yee who be a colleague of mine in unite and a labour party member she be involve in organise for unite in the dispute with british airways over the year and she become president of the hong kong confederation of trade unions she stand in the primary and lose but then take no further action she be sentence to year and month may i ask the government to raise her case and particularly the need for she to have visit from her family and her trade union rep so that we can impress upon the chinese government that in addition to our lobbying for her release we need to ensure that there be humanitarian treatment of such prisoner 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his support for the government ’s ongoing audit of our relationship with china and for the information that he have provide about of the individual who have be sentence in china i be aware that an australian citizen be among those who have be sentence but i be not aware of the information provide by my right hon friend about his colleague who have be sentence for her work in the uk it be very helpful to be aware of that and i would be grateful if he send i more information about this matter 
 today i bring together parliamentarian from country and the eu to call for the chinese communist party to immediately release jimmy lai it be extraordinary for the prime minister to meet xi jinping in the same week that jimmy ’s sham trial resume yet the prime minister use just word in support of jimmy ’s cause in his meeting with xi and no he do not call for jimmy ’s release he just mention his poor health what we learn be that the government have call in plan for a new chinese communist party mega embassy as a favour to xi and at his request why 
 i be sure that the hon lady with her considerable experience will be well aware of the fact that the prime minister be at the g20 leader summit which every member of the g20 attend i be sure that she will be aware of how these meeting work on the embassy to which she refer it be standard for application to be call in if they affect other government   call in the application should not be take as any indication of our view on the merit of the scheme as this case will be determine by ministers in the ministry of housing communities and local government it would not be appropriate for i to comment far 
 i be pleased to sign the letter from parliamentarian of country that   the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns   just mention and i thank the minister for confirm that a meeting take place with sebastien and the foreign secretary can the minister outline how we will work with other country in a concerted co ordinated effort as we have hear many of they have individual in arbitrary detention in hong kong how can we co ordinate across those country to get the release of activist such as jimmy lai 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise the need for co ordination obviously there have be co ordination among parliamentarian which have be very positive to see and the uk government will continue to co operate with other on these issue we have also work with other country government on case involve dual national 
 i thank   the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns   for organise a powerful letter and i be glad to be able to put my name on it give the concession that be give to china by the prime minister and the particular responsibility that we have to hong kong what do the prime minister get out of the meeting can the minister tell we the read out from the prime minister and when will she publish her audit follow the question from   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith will the audit include the option of sanction 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question the read out can be easily access i will not read out all of it but i will underline the fact that it make it very clear that the prime minister say that he want to engage honestly and frankly on those area where we have different perspective include hong kong human right and russia ’s war in ukraine that be take directly from the read out of the meeting as i say there be also footage of it which the hon gentleman can easily access on sanction i refer he to my previous response 
 so long as we be limited to say how cross we all be about our different perspective and the minister keep sanction under review china will take not a blind bit of notice will it 
 the right hon gentleman will be aware i hope that go into detail about sanction in advance be extremely problematic for the entire sanction system it would reduce its effectiveness which be why government of all complexion do not comment on future designation 
 this be a bad day for human right but for the hongkongers live in my constituency it be a frightening day beyond the broad reassurance that the minister have already   give what specific action will the government take   to protect hongkongers live in the uk from state surveillance 
 i recognise the concern that will be cause by this matter as articulate by my hon friend   the member for earley and woodley yuan yang the uk government be absolutely resolute in our determination to ensure that bno be able to live their life freely and without prejudice or fear in our country we remain absolutely committed to uphold their human right and we will continue to do so if there be specific instance of concern i would be grateful if the hon gentleman inform i of they 
 my constituent and friend sir henry keswick who die early this month be for many year the chairman of jardine matheson he be a great believer in the opportunity for good relation between this country and china there be an awful inevitability in the fact that the day after the prime minister meet the chinese president and declare a new era of positive relation the sino british declaration be comprehensively breach do the pragmatic relationship that the prime minister think he can have with china include get assurance that the national security law will not jeopardise the interest and welfare of british business and employee work in hong kong
