the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to ensure that new rail infrastructure meet the need of community in the east of england 
 mr speaker may i start by thank you very much for bring we all together at the carol concert yesterday as you always do i trust that this next hour will also be in keep with the season of good will 
 we be deliver record rail investment in the east of england include upgrade the midland main line a new station at cambridge south improvement at ely and horley junction to increase passenger and freight capacity and a new railway connect eastern town and city to oxford which will deliver transformational growth across the region 
 wixam new town in my constituency be build in the perfect location for rail connectivity but over a decade after move into their home resident be still wait for a start date to be confirm let alone for a station to open will the minister work with local stakeholder and network rail to get sign off for that line and ensure that my resident can finally enjoy the rail connectivity that they be promise 
 i be happy to give that commitment to work with the resident indeed i recently speak to the mayor of bedford on that exact point we be work at pace to get the station deliver there be also fund requirement that involve the local region which have be agree to previously and we be keen to make progress 
 my hon friend have refer to the horley junction and ely junction development which come as very welcome news in october the horley junction development in particular be a very small project it would be excellent to get a starting date agree for next year with the business case   sort out recognise how that could improve resilience not only for passenger but for freight and the port of felixstowe 
 my right hon friend have be an absolute champion for that project as have other hon friend present we be keen to make progress the secretary of state and i be very keen to see the project bring in which be possible only because of the prime minister ’s decision on network north in october we be look to make rapid progress on it and i have hear my right hon friend ’s call and will work to that speed 
 what step he be take to improve rail service 
 the government be commit to reform the railway and ensure that they be customer focus and commercially lead with the creation of great british railways to bring together infrastructure operation and oversight of whole industry finance in the interim the department continue to hold the rail industry to account to deliver the punctual and reliable service that passenger and taxpayer deserve 
 in november last year service on the west of england line out of london terminate at axminster because of a land slip near honiton the same line have be close for day this month and passenger at feniton be unable to travel to exeter or london will the minister ease the delay and cancellation for passenger in honiton by dualle the track from chard junction to axminster and add a pass loop 
 with the prime minister ’s network north commitment £ worth of transport project will be go ahead in other part i be happy to look at the project to which the hon gentleman refer i should also mention that i be aware that there have be problem on the western and wales route particularly those come out of paddington the chief executive of network rail be also well aware of those problem and be take action to ensure that we remedy the situation 
 so many family in pembrokeshire have son and daughter work away or study all over the country who will want to get home this christmas with such poor rail service into wales what assurance have the minister have from company such as great western railway that they will stop put on carriage train when they should be run carriage that they will have a full roster of driver available in the day ahead so that we can have a full complement of service run and that service will not be cut short in place such as swansea and carmarthen leave my constituent strand late at night 
 my right hon friend make a very good point with christmas eve and new year ’s eve fall on sundays this year the team at gwr have to approach the department because driver be request   additional payment for drive train on those sundays as sunday be still not part of a work day week on the railway we have deliver on that commitment but the fundamental reform point remain we need aslef and other trade union to ensure that we have a modern railway that work day a week i can give he an assurance that everything be be do but a lot more could be do if we could reform with the union co operation 
 what role do the northern transport acceleration council have in network north 
 be straight transparent and open i will write to the hon member and give he that detail rather than attempt to make it up at christmas time 
 until fairly recently northern train provide a saturdays only service between sheffield and cleethorpes via brigg that have now change to train a day day a week allow people only an hour and a half to enjoy the shopping in grimsby or the excellent resort of cleethorpes could my hon friend look into this matter and contact i after speak with northern train 
 yes i will do so we have discuss that service before and be look at a timetable alteration for the future i will ensure that be look at with my hon friend ’s point very much in mind 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the transport committee with which the minister be fairly familiar hear evidence last week that thank to the cancellation of hs2 phase to manchester and the inability of high speed rolling stock to tilt on the remain west coast main line track journey time   to and from glasgow could actually increase by up to minute even with the £ birmingham   to london branch line complete do the minister think that passenger in scotland will see that as yet another union connectivity dividend 
 no i do not agree in fact when that matter come up at the public accounts committee the official who work on hs2 be able to explain that where train tilt they can do so at certain speed on the west coast main line however that do not actually require a tilting train any train can go at that speed provide the speed be on the train hs2 train will also have fast acceleration so i dispute the hon member ’s point 
 some train on the west coast main line would be more helpful i think 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 mr speaker before respond give that these be the last transport question of the year may i put on record my gratitude to the staff of the house and also to those across the transport sector who will be work tirelessly across the christmas period to ensure that family can get together and good can keep move 
 as part of the prime minister ’s network north plan the government be provide a record funding increase of £ for local highway maintenance over the next decade which will enable local highway authority to resurface road up and down the country 
 pothole be a scourge everywhere so i be not only very grateful for the additional government funding but very impressed by the responsiveness and the quality of work by dudley council ’s highway department will the secretary of state agree to visit dudley and would he support tight contracting framework by local authority so that utility company and other be make to pay for all the consequence of their substandard work 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend include for tell we about the good work that his local authority be do to improve the quality of local road utility company already have legal duty to ensure that their work and reinstatement be to require standard early this year we introduce a new performance base street work regime to crack down on the bad perform company leave behind poor road surface repair that can lead to more pothole those with high failure rate be now inspect more often and be charge for it so company be incentivise to carry out good quality reinstatement time and to repair exist defect 
 as a civil engineer i be always excited to hear about more money be spend on the highway but be the secretary of state aware of the pothole pro this be a machine develop by staffordshire base jcb that can allegedly repair a pothole in as little as minute should that sort of technology be roll out across the country so that we do not just spend more money but spend it more effectively 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of tool to deliver increase productivity so that we get more for what we spend i be lucky enough to visit jcb myself and see the pothole pro in action as well as the innovative work it be do as a fantastic world leader in innovation on some of its hydrogen engine for its mobile off road machinery i be sure that local council will look carefully at the pothole pro and other technology that can help we make the good use of that record investment in road improvement 
 the secretary of state will know that we all want good road but we also want safe road can i draw his attention to the dreadful road accident kill young people recently be he aware that over the last year from be of the safe place in the world in term   of road safety and death on the road we be steadily become very bad indeed will he do something about that if he can 
 i of course share the hon gentleman ’s concern about the death of anyone on the road but particularly of young people i do not recognise the characterisation he have set out our road safety record remain of the good in the world interruption well it do the department spend a great deal of resource on campaign to get people to drive more safely and we do that when we be engineer and deliver new road safety be of the very important thing that we think about as we design and roll out new road infrastructure 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of electrify the furness line 
 northern be develop a final business case for a new fleet that will bring new train to my hon friend ’s route and include option for greener technology such as battery we be also work with the great british railways transition team to assess option to decarbonise the whole network 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will be delighted to know that for once i be go to ask not about the quality of service on the furness line but rather about capacity the government recently announce through the network north deal the electrification of the energy coast line that will take tonne of freight off that line every year and be hugely welcome through the ssn aukus programme and the dreadnought programme and the doubling of the size of the shipyard in barrow a similar amount of freight will be need go the other way will the minister meet i and the wide team barrow board to discuss the merit of electrify the furness line 
 as my hon friend know my official be active member of team barrow alongside the department for levelling up housing and communities and local partner recognise the national significance of the submarine programme work be ongoing look at improvement to the a590 and at option for the rail industry to improve the local rail network i would be delighted to meet my hon friend to discuss that work 
 when he plan to publish further information on the uk sustainable aviation fuel mandate 
 after year in parliament this be my maiden voyage at the dispatch box interruption indeed it be christmas come early and it be a gift that the question i be ask come from   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 the uk sustainable aviation fuel mandate be on track to start on   january with preparatory work   on secondary legislation progress well we recognise    that final decision on the parameter of the mandate must be take in a timely way to provide certainty for investment decision and we will publish those as soon as possible 
 i welcome the minister to his place and wish he well in his endeavour it be always a pleasure to see some of the intake elevate to the front bench so very well do i thank he for his answer as the issue of sustainable aviation fuel be important for my constituent to ensure that we do not overshoot climate target on the road to jet or net will the government consider introduce the saf mandate under a greenhouse gas intensity scheme that be quite a technical question but i know it be that the minister be well up to answer 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question i more normally get ask concern about whether we be go to undershoot the target rather than overshoot it but it be a valid question it be important for we that we be introduce the saf mandate and we must give certainty to the industry so that investment come in we have fund different company to set up saf plant or do development but we be look at all the different option and nothing be off the table we will consider all the different proposal and publish our response to the consultation as soon as possible 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the government ’s plan to have sustainable aviation fuel plant under construction by look doom we be fall behind competitor who have a head start on saf infrastructure and with hydrogen likely to be the dominant fuel source for aviation beyond saf we also need hydrogen infrastructure grangemouth currently supply scottish airport with fuel and have the right feedstock and infrastructure to turn waste and renewable electricity into jet fuel what be the government do to save grangemouth as part of a just transition to net and when will we see plan for a contract for difference type scheme for saf 
 as i outline in my previous answer with saf we be generate a whole new industry it be happen across the world i speak at the international civil aviation organisation conference in dubai and to aviation ministers from around the world and all be try to promote this industry we be probably more advanced here than anywhere else in the country and as i mention we be fund different scheme to get the industry go i will meet saf producer in the next couple of day and we want information from they about what be need what be need be certainty and there be benefit from across the country in both scotland and england there be huge economic benefit from this and it could create many thousand of job 
 what step he plan to take to improve traffic flow in town and city 
 what step he be take to support motorist 
 this government recognise that most journey in this country be make by car and that be why we be provide comprehensive support for motorist through our plan for driver which include a package of measure to improve traffic flow and also through the £ investment in road resurfacing that historic investment in road condition will benefit all road user as we have set out in early answer 
 despite the secretary of state and the prime minister say that the war against the motorist be over be he aware that many labour local authority have not get the message with unwanted low traffic neighbourhood in place unjustified mph speed limit be propose and traffic light phase deliberately to delay traffic flow cause add pollution will he consider give advice to local authority that they should do all they can to improve traffic flow and not disrupt they because of some misguided dogma against the motorist 
 my right hon friend be right we be pro driver but also pro- public transport and pro active travel and those thing be about give people well choice and make sure that council do not deliver anti driver traffic management measure the network management duty require local authority to manage their road as efficiently as possible for the benefit of all road user include driver which some of they forget from time to time we have also announce new funding totalling £ specifically for improvement to traffic light to keep local road move include deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimise traffic flow to get car move 
 the plan for driver clearly show that this government be on the side of britain ’s motorist but there be missing link which be rural road when a rural road be close by a utility company or other the diversion be not just a quick minute but often half an hour or minute buckinghamshire council tell i that the current fine system be just too low and the utility company shrug it off can my right hon friend take real action to ensure that council can properly fine utility company when they disrupt rural community 
 my hon friend make a good point that i be well aware of represent a rural constituency myself some of the benefit of investment in infrastructure such as broadband do bring with they traffic disruption of the thing we have put in place as i mention in an early answer be the change to make sure that good utility company will have much less inspection and much less cost involve in delivery those utility company that leave behind a mess and therefore cause that disruption over and over again will face more inspection and more cost incentivise they to do a well job for his and my constituent 
 i welcome my constituency neighbour   the hon member for south cambridgeshire anthony browne   to his place on the front bench for the past year part of the guide   busway in cambridge have be close due to a complex legal wrangle with the health and safety executive it have mean that bus be snarl up and motorist and bus user have have thousand and thousand of hour of waste time will the minister meet i to try to find a way to resolve this issue speedily and get cambridge move 
 i be not familiar with the specific situation that the hon gentleman raise about a dispute with the health and safety executive i will of course make sure that the relevant minister meet he to deal with this issue i have to say that my previous experience of cambridge city council be that it be tend to implement policy such as its congestion charge scheme which it have now have to drop because it be so unpopular it be not focus on get traffic move but be against the interest of road user i be glad that he welcome that change 
 leeds be of the most congested city in the country mainly because it be the large city in europe without a rail base public transport system why do the government have such contempt for the citizen of leed when will we see a decent public transport system in our city 
 that be an extraordinary question give that the government have in the network north announcement that the prime minister make put aside £ for a mass transit system in leeds so that leed no long remain of the large city in europe without i have to say that that investment in leeds to benefit his constituent be possible only because of the choice that this government make to cancel the phase of hs2 and to spend the money on that mass transit system in leeds i be surprised that the hon gentleman do not welcome that significant investment for his constituent 
 what estimate he have make of the net cost to the public purse of land purchase and plan for sale in connection with hs2 phase 
 what estimate he have make of the net cost to the public purse of land purchase and plan for sale in connection with hs2 phase 
 as of october a total of £ have be spend acquire land and property asset on phase that include all property asset type such as plot of land farmland farm commercial property and domestic property any land and property asset that be no long require will be sell and a programme be be develop to do that 
 datum from the high speed rail group suggest that the government ’s fire sale of land on the former birmingham to manchester stretch of hs2 will cost taxpayer a staggering £ but they be not content with waste taxpayer money and deny we the high speed rail in the north that we   deserve denton and reddish be not even set to benefit from local rail improvement that would not be hard i have train a week serve denton and reddish south station why 
 i be glad the hon gentleman mention that report because it be completely wrong for a start it state that £ have be spend on land and property which be wrong it be a different figure 
 what be it then 
 i just state exactly what it be if the hon lady have listen to my answer we have publish exactly how much have be spend on phase 2a it be £ and on phase 2b it be £ property and land will be sell only when it be right to do so ensure good value for the taxpayer and the community where the property be sell 
 it be my understanding that hs2 train be design for new track rather than the current victorian era infrastructure surely that incompatibility will result in hs2 train run slow and in few train per hour for my constituent can the minister explain how decrease capacity across the network slow train and reduce service will be well for my constituent 
 again that be not the case at all hs2 train will be build to run across the network that they will travel on i make the point previously that on the part of the west coast main line where tilting train go fast hs2 train will also be able to go at that fast speed as a result the journey time to manchester will come down from hour and minute to hour and minute lead to a fast service for all   mr speaker 
 marvellous 
 as the minister will know i very much welcome the decision on phase of hs2 however there be still an impact on many land and property owner in staffordshire we hear in the transport committee that it could take up to year to get land back to those owner will my hon friend look into this urgently to ensure that those property owner particularly farmer who need to know when they can sow their crop get that land back as soon as possible 
 in the word of take that i ask my hon friend for a little patience it will take time to develop a programme to ensure that we deliver value for money for the taxpayer and do not disrupt local property market we will engage with the affected community throughout the process where land can be rent back out and therefore put to use farming be a good example that be happen right now and we will ensure that that happen even more so now that we have certainty about hs2 
 i call the shadow minister 
 between july and september ministers admit that ten of million of pound of taxpayer money have be spend on hs2 land at the same time that the prime minister be plan to cancel the project now ministers plan to flog that same land at a huge loss even the party   that crash the economy be still able to find unique way to fleece the taxpayer will the minister explain what safeguard he will put in place to protect the land and taxpayer money from this ill judge and costly fire sale 
 despite what i say about this be the season of good will quite frankly that be complete and utter nonsense as i have state there will be a very careful analysis of the property that will be release the crichel down rule require test to be meet and only once they be will we return the property to the original owner at its market value this will be do properly we have deliver certainty we have say that the route will not go ahead what i be sure everyone along the line of the route would like to know be whether hs2 would go ahead under the labour transport team or whether it would not because of the labour treasury team give they some certainty 
 if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the uk emission trading scheme on domestic ferry service 
 the uk ets authority will publish a consultation on the implementation of the uk ets in we welcome any evidence in response to the consultation we will publish a full analysis of the policy ’s impact in the government ’s response to the consultation the department have not yet conduct a full assessment of the implication for domestic ferry 
 i be grateful to the minister for that answer he may be aware that there be many in the shipping industry who be concerned that include lifeline ferry service such as those that serve my constituency in the emission trading scheme could hinder rather than help the process of decarbonisation the eu have already recognise that by give its lifeline ferry service a derogation until will the shipping minister i know it be not this minister ’s responsibility engage with operator in scotland and elsewhere to ensure that we be not hit by the law of unintended consequence 
 i very much welcome that question the right hon member for orkney and shetland be a doughty champion for ferry in those island and i know how important ferry service be for resident there we have be very careful across our transport decarbonisation plan not to damage industry or sector we have give many billion of pound in support for the whole range of different transport sector and domestic ferry be very much a part of that i be very happy to engage with the sector and to meet he to ensure that the ferry can carry on transport passenger throughout orkney shetland and elsewhere in the british isles 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker i smile because i be welcome the minister to his place perhaps half a dozen ministers since i stand at the dispatch box but the good of luck to he in the time ahead laughter 
 decarbonise maritime will require unprecedented investment in uk technology with visionary policy and regulatory framework that limit ship emission and mandate the use of clean fuel when will the government follow the advice issue by the transport committee in june and streamline the muddle of recommendation it set for itself in maritime speak of which we be promise a refreshed maritime in by of the secretary of state ’s many predecessor there be a handful of day leave where be it 
 i thank the hon gentleman for what i be go to call his warm word it be christmas a time to forgive and forget the clean maritime plan be be refresh and we will publish it as soon as possible we be take in and analyse a very wide range of evidence from a wide range of different people the government be commit to the whole maritime plan and we be invest over £ in the uk shore programme to help fund research and development to make shipping decarbonise 
 what step he be take to increase transport connectivity between city in the north of england 
 aside from the £ investment in network north my hon friend will be aware that the single big connectivity project in his community be the northumberland line a groundbreaking railway line that will connect blyth and the surround city to newcastle 
 i be delighted consultation have now take place regard a relief road for blyth which be badly need as a result of the propose plan which could see the closure of an exist road and the reroute of resident along a new road many resident of cramlington could see their journey time increase keep the exist road open would address that as well as save money will my hon friend agree to look at that again and see whether it could be achieve 
 i be very happy to meet my hon friend and northumberland county council post the consultation 
 year ago david higgins the then chair of hs2 say that connectivity between sheffield and manchester be bad than between any other major city in europe since then sheffield ’s connection with manchester airport have be scrap we have a review of a tunnel under the pennines that tunnel get short and short until it finally disappear altogether can the minister   say in what way if any because i do not think there   have be any transport link between sheffield and manchester have improve while this government have be in power 
 as the hon gentleman know a substantial amount of electrification be take place he will also be aware of the city regional sustainable settlement which will provide significant investment in the north 
 what step he have take to support rail manufacturing at alstom in derby 
 margaret beckett be not here will the secretary of state answer the question as though she be so that i can call the shadow minister 
 my official and i have hold regular meeting with senior management at alstom we have also convene under my direction a cross whitehall group to advise on way to support continued production at derby and on how good to support the worker who could lose their job this must be a commercial decision for alstom but the government have be work with the company to explore every option to enable it to continue manufacture at its derby site and local members in derby include the fantastic colleague sit beside i my hon friend   the member for derby north amanda solloway have be raise these issue with i regularly effectively represent their constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 year ago the government hail the deal to manufacture hs2 train in britain as put the country 
 firmly at the forefront of the high speed rail revolution 
 today the job of the skilled people who work in that industry and build those train in derby and newton aycliffe   be at risk there be just day leave to find a solution will the secretary of state specifically meet hitachi and alstom as a matter of urgency do he accept that if ministers fail to act in the come day the final legacy of this shambolic government will be thousand of skilled job lose and hs2 train build abroad 
 i be slightly surprised by the hon gentleman he write to my hon friend the rail minister on   november ask a series of i be afraid quite ill inform question i send he a comprehensive reply on   november which i note he have not choose to publicise he try to pretend that our decision on hs2 have something to do with this i make it quite clear that alstom ’s contract with hitachi their joint venture to design build and maintain hs2 train be for phase only phase of hs2 be continue that position be reiterate by alstom group ’s chief executive in his commentary on its recent result i have meet both alstom and hitachi regularly since the decision on network north i be afraid that alstom ’s problem predate our decision on hs2 and the hon gentleman ’s attempt to play party politic on this incredibly serious matter on which the government be work very hard on a cross party basis with the company and the trade union be beneath he 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of government proposal to reduce net migration on the transport sector workforce 
 i regularly engage with cabinet colleague on government policy include migration and my department work closely with organisation across the transport industry to understand the sector ’s concern about the transport labour market 
 the driver shortage in the uk be far from over and accord to sector insider a tipping point be loom figure from the office for national statistics show that there be few delivery and courier driver in the uk in than in the previous year and more than half the uk ’s hgv driver be due to retire in the next decade what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that this tick time bomb do not blow up in our face as happen during the period follow brexit surely migration be part of the solution 
 it be disappointing that the snp ’s response to any tightness in the labour market be to want to import people from abroad my colleague the secretary of state for work and pensions along with the fantastic official in that department and our jobcentre network be ensure that we provide skill training for those who be already in the united kingdom so that we can deal with the skill shortage as we do so effectively in the case of hgv driver when during and follow the pandemic we work rapidly to get more of they into the industry 
 what recent discussion he have have with airport operator on the introduction of new security scanner by june 
 the secretary of state have visit many airport to discuss the upgrading of airport security and have see the new security equipment in operation i know that my predecessor engage regularly with airport representative to seek reassurance on timescale for the next generation security checkpoint most recently i meet heathrow ’s chief executive for discussion i can reassure the house that i will continue this good work and will shortly meet representative of the aviation sector to discuss the matter far there be many visit already in the diary indeed i will be meet the airport operators association straight after this session my department 
 order i think we have get the gist 
 i be grateful to the minister for his answer and i welcome he to his new role 
 this new technology will greatly improve passenger experience at airport security for example it will obviate the need for those little plastic bag we all love put    our liquid into airport be worried about potential delay if the passenger scanner be introduce in go for every passenger as people will need to get use to the new technology may i urge the minister to discuss with the airport operator the phase introduction of the new scanner to remove the possibility of delay 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his question which he ask when i give evidence to the committee yesterday i say he would have to wait until today for my answer 
 this new technology will bring huge benefit for passenger as my hon friend say i think we will all be delighted to see the end of put our little bottle into those little plastic bag and it will improve safety the screening of passenger with these security scanner be already be phase in the government have long be clear with airport about the requirement for next generation security checkpoint and the deadline for implementation have already be delay several time partly because of covid and other factor airport be consult on the june deadline and many have successfully trialle the scanner they be already phase they in and june be the end deadline my message to the airport be that they should start implement they now they should not wait for the deadline i will discuss it with the airport operators association in our meeting immediately after question 
 what step his department plan to take follow cop28 to support transport decarbonisation 
 our transport decarbonisation plan be probably the most advanced of any country in the world and we continue to implement it just yesterday king charles approve the emission vehicle mandate which require of new vehicle to have emission by petrol and diesel car van and truck weigh up to tonne will be ban by we have introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate under which of aviation fuel should be sustainable by similarly we be push ahead in all the different sector 
 i welcome the minister to his place this financial year active travel spending be £ per head in england and £ per head in scotland a difference between scottish and uk government priority decarbonisation need transformational investment in active travel which particularly support accessibility and it simply be not happen for folk in england will he undertake to begin the long process of finally get england on the road to match scotland ’s ambition 
 i thank the hon member for that question we be actually spend more money on active travel than any other government in history as she say active travel be an important part of decarbonisation and the route to net her figure do not take into account the regional spending within   england which should be add to the total i would be happy to write to she with the actual figure for spending in the uk 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state tell the transport committee that electric car be cheap to run than their petrol and diesel counterpart he also know that sale of new electric car fall by last month 
 the minister have just mention the zev mandate and i remind he that it be pass only because labour mp vote for it he also know that it address manufacturer not consumer supply not demand how do the government plan to reassure driver that buy electric mean cheap motoring how will he undo the damage that the society of motor manufacturers and traders say be do to consumer confidence by his prime minister ’s comment on the end of the sale of new petrol and diesel car 
 my key focus in my decarbonisation of transport role be to ensure a smooth and successful roll out of electric vehicle the hon member quote month ’s figure but overall sale of electric vehicle be up this year compare with last year indeed a great share of electric vehicle be be sell in the uk than in any of the major country in the eu more than in germany france italy spain and poland it really be a record to be proud of he be right that this be about supply and demand we have stipulate in the zev mandate that of sale should be electric by but we also need to ensure that there be enough charge point for they we have spend nearly £ support electric vehicle and we have a whole range of different scheme to deliver that 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of trend in the level of motor cost on driver 
 nationally we have substantially reduce fuel duty locally i hope that the hon member will welcome the £ investment with his local council into the a34 which will help his local resident 
 labour have reveal that the government ’s delay to the phase out date for the sale of petrol and diesel car to be set to cost driver £ in high fuel cost on top of that petrol price have already soar and car insurance cost have go up by an eye water in just a year where be the government ’s plan to tackle the rip off price face driver 
 i suggest that the hon member read at speed the plan for driver and go back into history and remember gordon brown ’s fuel duty escalator perhaps his constituent do not remember the increase that be introduce by the labour government but my constituent definitely do 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as i say early these be the last transport oral question before christmas and we be back driver with an easy christmas getaway from next tuesday national highways be lift over mile of roadwork which mean that over of motorway and major a road will be roadwork free until   january we be also get on with the job of resurface britain ’s road thank to the record £ uplift in funding early this month highway authority receive the tranche of that investment which will mean smooth safe journey and save driver hundred of pound in costly vehicle repair local authority also have new reporting requirement so taxpayer will know how that money be be spend 
 the prime minister make the right long term decision to redirect money from hs2 towards the local journey that matter most ensure that more people in more place will see benefit more quickly that be what the british people want it be what the country need and it be what we be deliver 
 will my right hon friend say when the strategic objective behind network north will be announce and publish can he confirm that any project announce so far be consistent with those objective and whether any of the hs2 funding will come to london and the south east 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question as i set out the objective of the decision be to ensure that that £ of transport spending which we be reinveste in transport project will benefit more people in more place across the country more quickly we be invest £ pound of saving from hs2 outside the north and midland which will benefit his constituent as well that include additional funding for london 
 order come on boy you ’re go to have to help i i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i wish you mr speaker and the whole house a very merry christmas why have the government waste £ on technology to retrofit bus that do not work 
 the hon lady will know that we have do a great deal of work to make sure that bus be compliant with the emission rule there be some technical issue be work through at the moment but i be not in a position to announce any decision yet we will announce to the house in due course when that work be complete 
 bus service be disappear at record level yet the secretary of state ’s department have waste almost £ on retrofit technology that do not work because it be never test outside a lab even for this government this be a shocking display of   incompetence and waste will he now work with those city leave with useless technology and ensure that the next round of emission funding be target there so that they can get on with the job of clean up our air and clean up his mess 
 once again the hon lady simply do not recognise the significant investment that we have make in bus service we have announce a significant amount of extra money for protect bus route we have roll out funding to deliver the £ bus fare cap and we have announce the money to deliver emission bus and deliver the full we say we would deliver there have be a huge amount of investment in bus service because we know it be the most popular form of public transport and we will always back it 
 my right hon friend ’s department have ensure that many bus passenger can benefit from the £ cap on fare but sadly red rose bus in my constituency be not offer it because the company say it be not compulsory will my right hon friend help i persuade all bus company to do the right thing for aylesbury ’s resident include by meet boss of the company that refuse 
 i be disappointed to hear that news from aylesbury i would be delighted to meet my hon friend and to invite the bus company in to explain why it be not take up the government ’s generous offer 
 early this year the uk government pledge to fund a bridge repair in the constituency of the hon member for moray douglas ross the newburgh train station campaign be work to re establish a train station that will provide a vital transport link assume that strategic funding be not just available to member of the conservative party who can i speak to in order to get that station re establish 
 on her point we be work with the local authority to progress that scheme which be announce early on her specific point i will arrange for the relevant minister to meet she so that she can put forward the case for that scheme and we will look at whether it be possible to do anything to help she 
 i know the minister understand that open access rail can provide well cheap more varied and more resilient service for passenger in the next few week or month how much rail network capacity do he expect to make available for open access service from currently unused track slot potentially from unused slot free up by timetable improvement and from service currently provide by the operator of last resort 
 i thank my hon friend for join i and other in the industry to discuss open access rail on   october i have today write to the office of rail and road and the chief executive of network rail ask they to review the unused access right and agree a timeline so that we can get decision make more promptly i hope to then give he more information 
 the prime minister announce the electrification of the rail line to hull in october at the conservative party conference so will the minister tell i what the start date for that work will be 
 as part of the engagement exercise which the prime minister promise i have meet leader from across the north last week it be a pleasure to meet those from the region around hull to discuss their preferred route they make the point that the route should be prioritise because electrification have be talk about before and i think that be a very good idea 
 i emphasise to the government the point make by my neighbour my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey about press ahead with the ely junction and haughley junction scheme network rail have do much of the preparatory work and be poise to get on with it as quickly as possible 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that scheme again i know it be an important issue for colleague in the east of england and i be delighted that we be able to make progress as a result of the decision on network north i have discuss it with network rail and the next step involve the development of the full business case network rail have what it need to make progress and i know my hon friend will be wish it every speed 
 over the past year yet more people have be kill or seriously injure on our road and the uk ’s record on that have plateaue while we have accident investigation organisation for air maritime and rail we do not have for road the government promise to set up a road safety investigation branch last year when will that become a reality 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise the important issue of road safety i notice that the statistic she set out be inconsistent with those set out by her hon friend   the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman she recognise that our road safety record be not go backwards as he suggest when there be a fatality road accident be investigate by the relevant authority and that remain the position we learn lesson from accident so that when we build new road infrastructure it have safety at its heart 
 will my hon friend update the house on the progress of the potential return of the direct rail link from king ’s cross to grimsby and cleethorpes 
 my hon friend follow my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh   and my hon friend   the member for cleethorpes martin vickers   in raise that matter at transport question they be without doubt the strong lobbyist when it come to train timetabling change she will have see the test train that run in june my right hon friend the secretary of state say at the last transport question that we hope to make an announcement shortly it be something that we be work on 
 of the emission bus promise in the national bus strategy only have be fund outside london and half of those have go to overseas manufacturer what be the government do to help uk manufacturer develop competitive emission bus capable of long distance journey 
 i be delighted to meet and engage with many of the different manufacturer from the uk only week ago i look forward to discuss the matter with they in more detail 
 what conversation be the minister have with southern and thameslink about increase rail capacity and run long service from carshalton and wallington address the dangerous gap at hackbridge station and instal step free access at carshalton beeches station 
 i have meet my hon friend and i appreciate the work that he do campaign for the station in his constituency i have regular conversation with people from govia thameslink railway and i know that they have recently increase capacity on some busy service through carshalton and hackbridge on hackbridge station i offer to meet he with a team from network rail to see whether we can address the matter that he mention 
 such be the excitement in wales in when conservative ministers announce that they would be build the mile western rail link to heathrow to open in that minister rhodri morgan describe it as of the most important announcement in the last year but it be yet another broken promise after more than a decade when do the transport secretary expect the spade to be dig into the ground to build the no.1 infrastructure priority of the thames valley region 
 when this proposal be moot it be to be a 50:50 split with heathrow airport and the new runway but matter change after the pandemic we be determined to see private sector involvement in the railway continue if there be a private sector proposal we be very happy to support it but these scheme must not come at the expense of taxpayer 
 the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for hexham guy opperman   see for himself on sunday night the scourge of pedicab in the west end with the pedicabs london bill have reach report stage in the lords can he update the house on when we can expect it to be present in this place 
 early in the new year 
 train per hour stop on the durham coastline usually with carriage this severely limit access to economic opportunity in sunderland newcastle and middlesbrough recently northern rail confirm a new hourly service but my constituent will only be able to wave at it as it go by because the plan be that it will not stop at the station   at seaham and horden can the rail minister please use his influence with northern to see whether he can get those train to stop 
 i be sure that everyone wave at the hon gentleman great man that he be it be great to meet he when he come to the department we talk about durham coastal service and timetable change today transport for the north be discuss timetable change so i hope that that proposal go through and that i can therefore give durham coastal service the improvement that he ask for 
 may i encourage my right hon friend to cut the money give to the west of england combined authority as it spend it extraordinarily badly on vanity scheme for the mayor on cut bus service for my constituent and on pillory motorist with this dreadful scheme which be hat in saltford for a bus lane on the a4 
 my right hon friend make a very good point about regional mayors which be that we have devolve power and resource to they but they be ultimately accountable to their constituent i hope very much that if they be punish the motorist the motorist will punish they back at the appropriate time at the ballot box 
 now that the blight of hs2 have be lift from north west leicestershire can the minister update the house on when work will commence on reopen the ivanhoe line which will offer rail access for the time in many decade not only to my constituent but to our neighbour in south derbyshire 
 the prime minister ’s network north announcement give that commitment on the ivanhoe line down to leicester we be fully commit to that i know that i be due to be meet the hon member on another matter so i will give he more of an update then 
 like many i welcome what be go on with network north particularly the announcement of ferryhill station when it come to the final assessment and decision we need to ensure that the right question be ask as the green book say the right question be what be the socioeconomic benefit to the town and village around the station not to the gdp of the uk may i ask for that assurance please 
 that be another commitment that the prime minister make in the network north announcement my hon friend have campaign for ferryhill station for so long and i thank he for bring it forward the business case will look at the socioeconomic condition that he mention and i be confident that we will be able to get spade in the ground for his station very shortly 
 lner be go to consult again on alter the timetable to increase the frequency of train from edinburgh and newcastle to london but that inherently mean a reduction in service to west yorkshire manchester and merseyside that be   very sad and it be bad for the northern economy this be not a timetable issue it be a capacity issue on the east coast main line can we have some investment in the east coast main line north of york to remedy those problem 
 as thing stand we be unable to operate that service because the trans pennine route upgrade which be deliver the billion of pound worth of investment to enhance the route that the hon member ask for be currently be construct that will provide the bandwidth as i mention today we hope to get a decision from transport for the north that will improve service and add an extra service north to south then with the multi pound investment in the trans pennine route upgrade we will get east west service improvement as well 
 in hyndburn and haslingden we be hop to have a very happy new year as we hope to hear the announcement that both rishton station and church and oswaldtwistle station have be successful in the government ’s access for all scheme can any indication be give of when we might hear the announcement and will the government look favourably on they 
 it be worth note that of all rail journey now take place from step free station with station make step free under access for all we have in the list for the next batch and my hon friend will be pleased to know that her be in that long list we will decide shortly which one to take forward next year 
 will the ministerial team stop brief against hydrogen combustion engine the fact be that hydrogen be on its way in truck and jcb cummin in my constituency be prepare for year interruption when will the secretary of state stop 
 order hang on a minute do not take advantage barry because i will not call you again otherwise

 i commend the work of my disabled young constituent nathaniel yates from reddish who have assess every    single railway station in greater manchester too many of they be not step free we have the money for reddish north but when can we get the money for levenshulme 
 i commend that work as well in fact the great british railways transition team have do a station accessibility study auditing every of our station that report be due out shortly i hope that the team can work with the hon member ’s constituency to come up with some good datum and improve access for all 
 the key element of scarborough ’s successful town bid be the station gateway project but get permission from network rail to knock a new entrance into the back of the station be prove slow and bureaucratic can the secretary of state gently lean on network rail a bit please 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for that question i be sure that network rail will have hear that i will take it away raise it with network rail and get back to he to let he know whether we can make that go fast 
 the late of many improvement to gloucester station since include vital work on the station underpass and forecourt however contractor cost have rise since the original station improvement fund award will the rail minister agree to meet i and great western railways to resolve that potential issue 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and neighbour for that question i be very familiar with the investment and work that be currently be undertake at gloucester station as it be the that i use on a regular basis when get the train to london the rail minister will be delighted to meet with he to see whether there be more that we can do to take those matter forward 
 inevitably concern about overcrowding will come up this afternoon at a chiltern railways drop in at marylebone with buckinghamshire mp so can the rail minister assure i that the government be do everything possible to push chiltern to improve 
 i can assure my hon friend that the department be work closely with chiltern as it look to get more rolling stock to replace some of its age diesel stock there be capacity issue as he note because more people be use the railway which be a great success but we will work with the operator to ensure that it get the roll stock it need 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the foreign commonwealth and development office if he will make a statement on the urgent threat pose to guyana by venezuela and the government ’s response to it 
 mr speaker you of all people know the importance of the commonwealth—[interruption sorry late night 
 we dare not ask where 
 i will not ask where either mr speaker but it be good to see my hon friend here right now 
 we be deeply concerned about the recent step take by venezuela with respect to the essequibo region in guyana i know that will be a key concern to the shadow foreign secretary and members across the house and we share those concern we believe venezuela ’s action be clearly unjustified and should cease we be clear that the border be settle in through international arbitration the foreign secretary have make that clear in a recent meeting and call with president ali of guyana 
 the uk country in the region and the international community have be swift to respond i have be in close contact with partner in the region to urge de escalation and early this week the minister of state for development and africa my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell attend an emergency meeting of the commonwealth ministerial group on guyana which issue a clear statement reject the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of guyana 
 brazil and other country in the region have express their deep concern at the situation and warn against unilateral action that threaten the peace and stability of the region the un security council meet in closed session last friday at guyana ’s request to discuss the situation we note that a meeting will take place later today between president maduro and president ali under the auspex of the community of latin american and caribbean states celac and hope that that will reaffirm the importance of a peaceful resolution to this important matter 
 we will continue to work with ally and partner in the region and through international body such as   the un security council the commonwealth and the organisation of american states to ensure that the territorial integrity of guyana be respect i plan to visit guyana in the come day to far show our support for the guyanese people on this vital issue it be imperative that regional partner and friend across the house in the region and around the world continue to press the maduro regime to respect guyana ’s integrity and to avoid escalation 
 i will try again mr speaker 
 i be delighted to hear that the minister be go to guyana which be an important part of the family of the commonwealth i be also deeply pleased that the   president be meet today in st vincent to try to hammer out the situation it must be of worry to this government and to this house that a commonwealth country be be set upon by a fail state because it want to grab land to do oil exploration and take oil that be not an acceptable position to anybody in this house 
 the other problem be that the brazilians be move troop to their border to ensure its integrity and i be also tell that american military adviser be go to guyana to help with the situation the guyanese have armed force of the venezuelans have i urge this government to stand solidly behind guyana not just as a commonwealth country but as a country in south america i remember that the last time there be an issue in south america in it do not end well and we stand for the oppressed i urge this government not just to send the minister to visit but to make sure that there be tangible help for the people of guyana to encourage they to stand up for their right 
 the government completely agree that the current situation be not acceptable we be deeply concerned by the unilateral move by venezuela over this region our position be absolutely clear and have not change the border be settle in through international arbitration venezuela must desist from its action it have deliberately and unacceptably escalate the situation and the people of guyana deserve to be free from the threat to their country 
 we work closely with our friend in the region my hon friend mention brazil of course we have be in conversation with brazil which have take a robust stance i know that my opposition counterpart with responsibility for latin american affair feel the same way we be across the house completely opposed to this sort of action we want peace and stability in latin america to continue for decade to come 
 we come to the shadow foreign secretary 
 i be grateful to   the hon member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   for secure the question on this important matter 
 the action of venezuela over the past few week have be provocative and dangerous president maduro have show a determination to stoke historical grievance attack recognise international border and seek aggressive confrontation instead of good neighbourly relation all that sound worryingly familiar because it be the playbook of president putin we have challenge it in ukraine and we must do the same in guyana we often talk in abstract term about the importance of a rule base international order but this be its essence that dispute be settle peacefully through proper legal and diplomatic process not through threat or intimidation that settle and recognise border be not subject to change through threat or force and that the big can not bully the small we must be resolute in stand up to those with imperialist ambition 
 i welcome that there will be talk between the leader of guyana and venezuela in st vincent i put on record my thank to brazil for its leadership on this matter include the deployment of troop along its border those talk should be a mechanism to reduce the tension   bring about by venezuela ’s action not a discussion about settle border or a reward for threat the essequibo border be settle more than year ago in have the minister speak directly to brazilian or american counterpart or to key regional body such as caricom the caribbean community and the organisation of american states about respond to maduro ’s action 
 guyana be a diverse beautiful and proud country with close tie of history friendship and family with the uk as the child of parent who come from guyana as part of the windrush generation i be live proof of our shared history for my relative and for all the people of guyana this be a deeply troubling time i be grateful that the minister have indicate that he will go to guyana shortly and that the uk ’s support for guyana ’s sovereignty be unwavere what specific action be the government take to ensure that if the threat be follow through guyana ’s sovereignty be protect 
 it be good to see strong cross party support on this vital issue i certainly recognise the right hon gentleman ’s interest in this matter from his personal perspective and from a geopolitical perspective he be absolutely right this be from the playbook of putin and other dictator around the world and it need to be call out and stop we be grateful for the work that ralph gonsalves the prime minister of st vincent and the grenadines be do to facilitate those conversation they need to be about de escalation the border be a settled issue as far as we be concern 
 the right hon gentleman ask what action we be take i can assure he that there have be multiple conversation the foreign secretary be absolutely concerned about this i have hold conversation with interlocutor in brazil colombia ecuador and many other place i be in argentina for the inauguration at the weekend and i meet many interlocutor there who all share the concern we will work with caricom the oas the un and of course the commonwealth which be vital to call this out and take whatever step be require 
 i call the father of the house 
 i be glad to follow the opposition foreign and commonwealth affair spokesman in remind the house and the minister that when the united states persuade the united kingdom to go to international arbitration the determination in be to leave that region as part of what be now guyana which become independent in the dispute with suriname be settle some time ago by agreement this should be as well and venezuela should go back to solve its own problem and exploit its own hydrocarbon if it choose to do so as it move towards a more eco friendly economy and preferably a well kind of politic as well 
 the father of the house make a very important point this be a settled matter and venezuela need to sort out its own issue there have be step take by partner in the region to try to help open the door to maduro and he have respond in this way it be unacceptable 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 i thank   the hon member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   for secure this urgent question it be indeed ironic that the day after the excitement of cop here we be discuss the potential annexation of country by its large and more powerful neighbour because of the discovery of a huge oilfield contain barrel of light crude it matter not that the border issue remain controversial for venezuela because it have to respect international law 
 i be pleased that the international court of justice have warn maduro not to take any action that could alter the status quo but can the minister tell i what discussion the uk government have have with representative of the icj have discussion be have directly with the venezuelans on behalf of the uk government to what extent do he share my concern that our previously weak response to state use dubious referendum follow by the use of military force to annex part of a neighbouring country as russia do   to crimea in have embolden people like maduro to believe that should he take military action the consequence for he would be extremely limited 
 again it be good to see support for guyana across the house whether this be because of venezuela ’s aspiration about oil or some other matter whatever that might be its action be completely unjustified as the hon member indicate we need to call it out the border issue be settle we support guyana in its effort to resolve this matter in whichever way it want to through the icj but it need to be do peacefully 
 the hon gentleman also make an important point about russia these action be opportunistic there be huge issue geopolitically and dictator or other heads of government should not seek to exploit these moment when there be far big issue at stake elsewhere in the world so we need to call it out as i say early we be keep this under very close scrutiny and will take whatever action we think be appropriate along with our regional partner 
 i thank the minister for his response to the urgent question and my hon friend   the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   for secure it i also thank the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy for his response i do not often find myself in agreement with he but on this i could not fault he on a single word both have raise the key strategic role that brazil play in the region we be about to sign a defence partnership agreement with brazil in the not too distant future so it play a key strategic role what far can the minister do particularly when he visit guyana to have enhance conversation with brazil to see what role it can play in make sure that we keep peace in the region 
 that be a very good question from my hon friend he know more about brazil than most people in the house and i respect he for that knowledge and for the point he have make of course we be work closely with brazil it have express its concern and warn against unilateral action it have say that   there be no way that venezuela ’s military force would be able to access guyana through brazil and we will continue to work with it very closely as he say we have a strong relationship not just defence wise but as we look to its g20 presidency and its hosting of cop30 
 what we be see be a shameful and cynical move by venezuela ’s president maduro to threaten and bully a small neighbour we in the uk must make it clear that we can not allow such threaten behaviour to continue so what step be the minister taking along with international ally to affirm the uk ’s unwavering support for guyana ’s sovereignty 
 as i say in my statement we have work with the commonwealth ministerial group to call out this action in joint harmony with our other relevant commonwealth partner we continue to work with other international body to call it out and obviously we will be in a position to form a view along with other in this house later today after the meeting that be take place in st vincent and the grenadines 
 i thank the minister for confirm that the uk government be stand with guyana against venezuelan aggression sham referendum and the threat of annexation can the minister confirm whether he have have discussion with the commonwealth secretary general about this situation to establish how the whole of the commonwealth family can support guyana at this worrying time 
 that be an excellent question i can confirm to the house that i have have conversation with baroness scotland as secretary general she have take a very strong lead she have issue statement and call the emergency session of the council of ministers which as i say my right hon friend the minister for development and africa attend we will continue to work with the commonwealth which be a vitally important organisation in this context 
 do the minister agree that whenever a country ’s border be threaten they must be secure or it risk undermine that country ’s sovereignty social cohesion and national identity 
 i could not agree more that be absolutely vital particularly in this case latin america have be a region of peace for many many year and it need to stay that way 
 it be great to see the house speak with voice in support of our commonwealth friend and partner guyana the minister be right these border be settle in they be the border that be transfer to the independent guyana in and they be the border that be internationally recognise as the minister also know president maduro have say that he will immediately issue licence for gas oil and mineral exploitation in direct contravention as we hear from   the hon member for argyll and bute brendan o’hara of the icj ruling what more be the united kingdom do to take this case up on the international stage with guyana to make sure that icj ruling be adhere to 
 we have already highlight the work we be do with the commonwealth we have talk about the international engagement and obviously the situation be also discuss by the un security council last friday we be take it at every single level and it help if in this place we condemn with voice the action that have be take by venezuela that will be note in each of those forum so i commend the hon member for his very important word 
 i thank the minister very much for his response and i be pleased to know that he will be in guyana shortly his presence will send a message guyana have an army of some and a population of venezuela have an army of plus tank and aircraft so it be very much the aggressor and the strong of the country when it come to the potential annexation of a democratic country by somebody who many of we feel be a demagogue part of the axis of evil that be north korea iran and russia and now we can add venezuela to that list it be very important that we take a stand as a country as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland could we not send a royal navy ship to guyana that be the sort of strong action we need to see 
 it be good to get the last word from the hon gentleman that be often his role we be work hard through diplomatic channel to urge partner in the region to use bilateral contact and regional group to advise and mediate in order to de escalate the situation i also bring to the house ’s attention the fact that hms trent be head towards the region to support action against narcotic trafficking

 not only do the prime minister promise to stop the boat this year which he have not do he also promise to get his emergency legislation through in record time yet there be no sign of the come committee stage in what the leader of the house have announce today some emergency it be no surprise however because the prime minister be too weak to push it through yet again the conservatives be tear themselves apart with star chamber the family and so on but they be not star in a mafia saga they be suppose to be run the country but they be not fit to govern while real family struggle to heat their home put food on the table and afford christmas this lot be just play at politic can the leader of the house even confirm that the committee stage will come in january in all their desperate attempt to persuade their colleague this week report have emerge of enticement of government funding to constituency in exchange for vote and not for the time can she put on record that this be absolutely not the case 
 the prime minister ’s emergency reshuffle have leave   we with no disability minister give the women   and equalities committee ’s damn report on the government ’s disability strategy just last week can the leader of the house confirm that someone will be appoint to this position before christmas 
 it have now be a full month since we have have a statement from the foreign commonwealth and development office despite major global conflict that be unacceptable—[interruption hon member be say that there be today but that be thank to mr speaker grant yet another urgent question to bring ministers to this place the leader of the house and i be both appear before the procedure committee on monday so i will not raise the issue of the foreign secretary come here now last time i raise the lack of accountability she assure i that the government would regularly update the house and that the foreign secretary be forward lean will she ensure that we get a proper update on the unfold situation in israel and gaza before the house rise and regularly thereafter so that minister do not need to be drag here via urgent question 
 today also look like take out the trash day with a large number of write ministerial statement on important matter will the leader of house ensure that there be proper scrutiny of those issue with no sense that the government be duck accountability to this place 
 finally would the leader of the house like to take this opportunity to apologise to year old liam walker for the disdain and tone deaf response that the prime minister give to his plight yesterday the prime minister ’s sneer angry response make he look small and disregarding of liam ’s plight liam ’s family do the right thing yet through no fault of their own they be homeless their story be the story of thousand of other family this christmas will the leader of the house do what the prime minister fail to do and show some empathy and humility and apologise for how her government have fail work family who be face destitution and homelessness this winter 
 may i also take the opportunity to wish everyone a wonderful christmas and a happy new year especially all the staff who work on and off the estate to help we do our job and keep we safe and all those who will be work over the festive period to serve our nation and their community have be a hard year the british people have face many challenge and i be proud of their stoicism and grit in get through it thank to they and their effort the economy be turn a corner and inflation be come down despite the challenge we have stand by our ally in particular ukraine we have take care of each other and we have crown our new monarch i wish everyone a peaceful and restorative christmas with good wish and hope for the new year 
 let i start with the hon lady ’s final point about young liam i deeply regret her choose to paint conservative members as uncaring and non empathetic she know that be not the case indeed i pay tribute to of our colleague who i think be in the telegraph this morning who make heroic effort to prevent harm from be do to a young man who be homeless on london ’s street 
 i can give the hon lady that assurance on infected blood and i be expect the house to be update on that important matter by the minister for the cabinet office she be right that the minister with responsibility for disability be important and i be sure that that reshuffle announcement will be make imminently i also remind the house that every department have a disability lead in place i echo the hon lady ’s thank to all commission member for the work do on risk base exclusion i think mr speaker have write to members today and we will of course bring a motion to the house early in the new year i will also ensure that member be keep up to date with the ongoing and tragic situation in gaza over the festive period i know as i hope do all member that fcdo consular service be there hour a day for any hon member who have constituent who need assistance 
 the hon lady raise the issue of our further legislation to stop the boat i always find it amusing that labour member be keen to see this legislation bring forward so that they can stop it they say that they have change but they have not and i be afraid their action speak   louder than word they talk tough on border but they have vote every time against our measure to strengthen they they talk about equality while not pay woman a fair wage they talk about a charter for worker while side with striker and eco zealot who prevent they from get to work they talk of fiscal responsibility but would borrow a furth £ more they talk of opportunity but would tax education and halve apprenticeship the hon lady have talk empathetically on the cost of living yet be very happy to clobber hard work people who can least afford it with high taxis the ultra low emission zone and low tax allowance they talk of hope but they would bring despair as many in wales be now have to endure i put on record my thank to mark drakeford for his service but i remind people of labour ’s record in wales 
 it be a good job that the nativity do not take place in labour run wales mary and joseph would have be clobber for an overnight stay levy she would have have poor maternity service the shepherd would not have be able to take the time off to bear witness due to cut in the rural affair budget and the wise man would have arrive post epiphany due to the blanket mph speed limit and the poor condition of the road network do not fall for what labour say look at what it do when in power not all man who wear red and promise free gift be to be trust further business will be announce in the usual way
