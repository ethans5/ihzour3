i be sorry but i be not go to take any intervention as i need to make progress 
 the court must speak to of the doctor and can hear from anybody else they deem necessary if there be any evidence of coercion the court will not approve the request and if evidence emerge subsequently the court order could be revoke it be also important to note that the person can change their mind at any time with period of reflection build in have consult at the high level in the judiciary and the medical profession i know that they can and will fulfil those safeguard responsibility and that they have the expertise to do so 
 let we be clear as my hon friend   the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna   say early this be not brand new territory for doctor doctor work in partnership with other clinician be already require to manage complexity in end of life decision making i follow the request of the british medical association that doctor should be under no obligation whatsoever to participate but if they do participate they will receive appropriate training and support doctor should be able to use their professional judgment when and if a conversation take place take their cue from the patient as they do for many other issue i welcome that patient centre approach many doctor feel the change in the law would safeguard clinician and patient by make everything explicit 
 when it come to the detail of what assist dying would look like we have the benefit of draw on the experience of jurisdiction around the world i could talk extensively about the international experience of assist dying the health and social care committee report do a brilliant job of that and this bill have look at good practice as well as model which i and many other would not be comfortable with our have here in england and wales 
 reflect on their experience clinician in australia say 
 through deep and meaningful conversation between doctor patient and their loved one we can dispel fear reduce suffering bring death and die out of the shadow and so allow patient and their family a well quality of life and quality of death 
 as australian member of parliament say 
 we have bring behind close door practice into the open and give die people meaningful transparent choice crucially none of the fear that be put forward as reason not to change the law have be realise the status quo be break and assist die work 
 evidence from around the world show that the option of have an assist death actually lift the fear that terminally ill people have and that many never actually use it but be able to make the good of the time they have leave due to the comfort and reassurance that it provide 
 people talk about a slippery slope but the health and social care committee find that not jurisdiction that have pass law on the basis of terminal illness have expand its scope interruption that be absolutely true as the court here and in europe have repeatedly make clear parliament be sovereign this bill could not be make any broad through any judicial process 
 speak of process with reference to the bill have listen to what i know be genuine concern of members about ensure that we get this legislation right i commit to the house that if the bill pass reading today which i sincerely hope it do i be minded to move a motion that give the bill committee the power to take oral and write evidence in order to ensure that a thorough approach continue to be take that be not normal procedure for a private member ’s bill but i think that that be the right thing to do i also reassure colleague that the bill committee will meet over a number of week mean that there be ample time for full consideration of the detail of the bill include amendment the committee will be representative of the view and make up of the house let i be clear that will mean there will be representative of different party with a range of view on the committee 
 as the leader of the house say at the dispatch box just yesterday and have say several time the government will of course work with i to ensure that the bill be workable and operable that will quite rightly take time and i have include in the bill a commencement period of up to year this be not go to happen overnight that timeframe can be explore in committee as it be more important to get this right than to do it quickly 
 in conclusion for the reason i have set out i be very clear that the law need to change to give terminally ill people choice at the end of life and to protect their love one from fear of prosecution there will be some of we here today who be lucky enough not to have personal experience of this issue but sadly we know that any of we could end up in this heartbreaking situation we be all live long which be brilliant and i have campaign inside and outside parliament for a great focus on prevention and early intervention of illness and disease to keep we fit and healthy for as long as possible but any of we or our loved one could be unfortunate or unlucky enough to receive a terminal diagnosis i struggle to see how it be fair or just to deny anyone the autonomy dignity and personal choice of take control of their final week and the right to choose do not take away the right not to choose   give the choice of an assist death to those who want it would of course not stop anyone who be terminally ill from choose not to make that choice 
 whatever happen today i be incredibly proud of the work that my fantastic team and the many campaigner have do on this hugely significant emotional and sensitive subject we need to be clear a vote to take this bill forward today be not a vote to implement the law tomorrow it be a vote to continue the debate it be a vote to subject the bill to line by line scrutiny in committee on report and on reading then of course the bill will go to the lords for what i have no doubt will be far robust debate and scrutiny this will be a thorough process focus on of the most significant issue of our time an issue that people across the country clearly want we to address none more so than the many family who be face the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo today be the beginning not the end of that process but the debate can continue only if colleague join i in the aye lobby today i wholeheartedly encourage they to do so and i commend the bill to the house 
 on a point of order mr speaker i seek your guidance on correct the record i say in my speech that i have consult with the high level of the judiciary and the medical profession i have receive correspondence from the judicial office and wish to clarify my early comment although i have speak to lawyer and judge i should not have imply that the serve judiciary have in some way indicate their agreement with the bill they have not the serve judiciary have be very clear that they have make no public comment about the bill way or the other i apologise if i imply anything to the contrary

 object 
 bill to be read a time on   friday january 
 my hon friend briefly mention coercion and the well hold fear of many of we in the house about the risk of coercion particularly for vulnerable people what do he make of the fact that in washington state where the relevant law be restrict to terminally ill people like this bill last year of those who go through with an assist death do so because they fear be a burden to family friend or care giver in oregon the proportion last year be 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 before i begin proceeding i would like to say a few word to help manage expectation about business today more than member have indicate that they wish to speak in the debate it be not customary to impose a speech limit on private member bills but i hope that after the member in charge of the bill and the speaker after that member will restrict themselves to about minute in the instance that include take intervention the chair will review the guidance as the debate progress i may need to ask for short speech to enable more member to contribute i should make it clear that the chair retain the right to impose a formal speech limit but i would rather colleague help each other 
 at about pm i will call front benchers to make their comment and then we will move to end the debate i have get to manage expectation not everyone will get in i will try to get in as many people as possible this be of the most important debate that the house have have so it be about be considerate and respectful of each other let we listen to each other this be the time for the house to show itself at its good 
 the reasoned amendment in the name of dr ben spencer have not be select i call kim leadbeater to move the reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 thank you mr speaker and thank you to everyone who be attend this hugely significant debate it be a privilege to open the debate on the terminally ill adult end of life bill a piece of legislation that would give die people under stringent criterion choice autonomy and dignity at the end of their life i welcome the debate on this hugely important issue 
 let i say to colleague across the house particularly new colleague that i know this be not easy it certainly have not be easy for i but if any of we want an easy life i be afraid we be in the wrong place it be our job to address complex issue and make difficult decision i know that for many people this be a very difficult decision but our job be also to address the issue that matter to people after nearly a decade since the subject be debate on the floor of the house many would say that the debate be long overdue 
 for my part i have try incredibly hard to ensure that the tone of the debate have be and continue to be robust of course but most importantly respectful and compassionate i be pleased that for the most part that have be the case i can be confident that that same tone of respect and compassion will be adopt by colleague today whatever view they hold that be particularly important as we have people in the public gallery who have a strong personal interest in this issue they hold a range of view some of they have lose love one in difficult and traumatic circumstance and other be themselves terminally ill 
 i want to pay a huge and heartfelt tribute to those family and to every single person who have contact i about this issue and in many case share their own very personal story of loss and death i know from my own personal experience of grief that tell your story over and over again take energy courage and strength i be incredibly grateful to they all it be their voice and their story that have inspire i 
 such story be difficult to hear but it be vital that they be hear as they be at the heart of the debate they show that the law be fail people where that be the case we have a duty to do what be right to fix it those here today or watch at home be deal with the real consequence of the failing of the current system i will start by recount just a few of their story 
 warwick be married to his wife ann for nearly year she have terminal peritoneal cancer which mean that she could not breathe properly she spend day gasp and choke remain awake throughout despite be give the maximum dose of sedative she eventually die of suffocation she have beg warwick to end her life but as he stand over she with a pillow he could not do what she ask as he do not want that to be her final memory of he ann have excellent palliative care but it simply could not ease her suffering 
 tim fall in love at sight when he meet his wife louise he propose after just day but louise get cancer twice and at the end the morphine simply could not control her pain in desperation she manage to smash a small glass bottle and try to take her own life not realise that her toddler daughter have get into bed with she tim find she he say 
 you get to a point where you stop pray for a miracle and start pray for mercy 
 former police officer james wave be mum off as she embark on her final trip to dignita she have terminal vasculitis james desperately want to accompany his mum and hold her hand during her final moment but he know because of his job as a police officer that it be just not possible indeed she insist that he must not go with she so she go alone no to hold her hand and no proper goodbye or funeral those be just a few example of the heartbreaking reality and human suffering that far too many people experience as a result of the status quo the public know this 
 i have always be keen to ensure that my politic stay rooted in the world beyond westminster it be clear that public opinion be very much in favour of a change in the law polling show consistently that around of people would like to see the legalisation of assist die for terminally ill mentally competent adult these finding be significant but it may not be that   surprising that most people believe as i do that we should all have the right to make the choice and decision we want about our own body let we be clear we be not talk about a choice between life or death we be talk about give die people a choice of how to die 
 let we examine what that choice currently look like i do not have a legal background but i have always be drive by a strong sense of injustice if i see a problem i will do everything i can to try to solve it indeed in this job we all do that every week and every day whether here in parliament or in our constituency when former director of public prosecution include the prime minister former president of the supreme court and many lawyer all agree that the law need to change surely we have a duty to do something about it 
 intentionally help another person to end their life be currently illegal under the suicide act and carry a maximum prison sentence of year this include family and friend help someone who be terminally ill to die both in the uk and overseas exist guidance do not stop people from be investigate by the police add fear guilt and further trauma to grieve family the law be not clear and it do not protect individual family or medical professional that drive people to very desperate measure 
 what about coercion senior king ’s counsel have say 
 there be currently no establish system for identify abuse or coercion in advance of a person ’s death or for help vulnerable people to make end of life decision 
 i have be a nurse for more than a quarter of a century and in that time i have work mostly in intensive care as a specialist i have work with compassionate and skilled well train clinician who have be teach to spot coercion it be fundamental to our practice do my hon friend agree that it be wrong to suggest that clinician can not spot coercion in these case 
 my hon friend make a very important point i thank he for it and for his year of service as a nurse i have speak to many medical professional about this issue and they say that this be part of their job they be very skilled and they work closely with patient particularly die patient to assess their need and to have those difficult and delicate conversation as the kc say at the moment we check for coercion in case where people have take their own life when someone be dead the bill would make coercion a criminal offence with a sentence of up to year 
 surely by put a legal framework around this difficult situation we will provide an extra level of safeguarding psychotherapist who be terminally ill herself say to i recently that coercion happen when thing be hide away the bill would bring thing out into the open surely that must be safe for everyone let we look at what the absence of a robust legal framework look like 
 i thank the hon lady for give the house the time to debate the bill this morning she reference coercion and i understand her point about the medic but medic will not be   able to see or hear everything at all time people will not be put beyond challenge because subsequent to the death if a relative claim coercion of another relative investigation will remain i be entirely unclear how without peradventure clinician can claim that there have be no coercion at any point 
 the hon gentleman have make the point for i within a robust system we will check for coercion but we do not have any of that now at the moment the person will be definitely be dead we have to look at the status quo put in layer of safeguard and check for coercion must be well than the system that we have now 
 colleague be right to raise question around coercion i host a phone in on lbc where people ring in and say i feel like i have to end my life because i recognise how difficult it be for my family to see i suffer the limit in the bill however be that someone must have only month to live accord to doctor and a judge which i genuinely believe massively reduce the risk of coercion be we really say that people be so desperate to bump off their family that if they be tell that they have month to live they would escalate the process and do it soon 
 the hon lady make an excellent point she be absolutely right the very strict criterion in the bill add extra layer of safeguarding which again we just do not have at the moment 
 i have the deep respect for my hon friend but thing that concern i be societal or systemic coercion at the moment elderly people in our society pay thousand of pound a month to be in a care home what reassurance can my hon friend give that an elderly person in a care home who have be give month to live would not think to themselves i ’m a burden i have be give month to live if i end my life now i can save my family between £ and £ that really concern i 
 as i have say at the moment we have no idea whether that person would take action because we be not have those conversation by get medical professional and a high court judge involve we would be put this out in the open evidence from other jurisdiction show clearly that coercion tend to happen the other way what tend to happen be that family try to prevent the person from make the choice of an assisted death 
 rise 
 i will take more intervention 
 be it not the case that the conversation that patient will have with doctor will bring out whether they have be coerce or be suffer intolerably the criterion be about suffer not whether somebody worry that they be a burden 
 i agree absolutely those conversation which be not take place at the moment be very important i will make some progress 
 there have rightly be a lot of discussion about palliative care in recent week and i be convinced that a significant amount of that discussion would not have take place without the introduction of the bill it be a long overdue conversation and i be very pleased to see it happen 
 i have meet with the association for palliative medicine hospice uk sue ryder and marie curie and last week i be delighted to attend the inaugural meeting of the all party parliamentary group for hospice i also attend the fantastic kirkwood hospice which serve my constituency of spen valley i pay tribute to the dedicated staff and volunteer across the country in the palliative care sector who do some of the most vital work in society we must do more to support they and i look forward to work with the government and colleague across the house in that important endeavour that be why i have include in the bill a requirement for the secretary of state to report to the house on the availability quality and distribution of palliative care 
 of course assist dying be not a substitute for palliative care it be not an either or we have some of the good palliative care in the world in this country and when it can meet the need of terminally ill people it be to none however when it can not surely the choice of an assist death should be component of a holistic approach to end of life care 
 the comprehensive report by the health and social care committee publish early this year find no indication of palliative care deteriorate in quality or provision in place where assist dying have be introduce 
 ever mindful of what the hon lady have say about the criterion i remind she that belgium start off with a simple project like the she refer to but it deteriorate and expand to include sufferer of dementia and under-18s child what guarantee do we have that this legislation will not end up with a situation like that in belgium in which case anything go be that what the hon lady want i do not want that do she 
 i thank the hon member for his intervention but let we be very very clear huge amount of research have be do by the health and social care committee and indeed by myself and other the model be propose here be nothing like what happen in belgium it be nothing like what happen in canada there be strict stringent criterion and if the house choose to pass the bill those criterion can not be change 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for give way and congratulate she on the measured way in which she have conduct this debate over the last few week whatever side of the house and whatever side of the debate i would like to recognise that it be not always the case but be it not the case that the bill cross a new and irreversible medical red line for doctor and nurse be it not the case that in other bills we have see in this house over the year the safeguard invariably become obsolete over time and so the safeguard in this bill however well mean should be see as temporary safeguard and not immutable safeguard 
 absolutely not i respectfully disagree with the right hon gentleman in country where a bill of this nature have be implement the safeguard have be in place and the boundary have never change i will come on to talk about that 
 rise 
 i will take more intervention and then i must make some progress 
 i thank the hon lady for give way i have a great deal of sympathy for the argument she be make however we have see time and again excessive judicial activism take the word in this house and expand their meaning into place we have not foresee what reassurance can she give that the word in her bill will be respect by the judiciary and that we will not find ourselves in a decade ’s time in a totally different place that this house do not intend 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention the court have repeatedly put this issue back to parliament this be not their domain this be the legislation there be strict criterion 
 come back to palliative care in situation where pain simply can not be manage the result be death that be so horrific that the person themselves can spend hour and in some case day in unimaginable pain as they die i want to bring the debate back to the issue that we be try to solve for their love one no matter how many joyful and happy memory they have they also have the trauma that come from watch someone you love die in unbearable agony and fear that memory stay with they forever 
 rebecca ’s mum fiona develop metastatic brain cancer at the age of she have very good palliative care but her pain could not be manage and she die beg and scream for assistance to end her suffering her family and the medical team treat she cry beside her bedside as it take she day to die 
 lucy ’s husband tom be a music teacher with a young son he have bile duct cancer which obstruct his bowel result in an agonising death tom vomit faecal matter for hour before he ultimately inhale the faece and die he be vomit so violently that he could not be sedate and be conscious throughout lucy plead with the doctor to help the doctor treat he say there be nothing he could do his family say that the look of horror on his face as he die will never leave they lucy now have post traumatic stress disorder which be quite common for family who lose love one in such harrowing circumstance 
 i thank my hon friend for the powerful and move story she be tell a constituent of mine watch her mum suffer from pancreatic cancer unable to keep any food down she basically starve to death do my hon friend agree that that be no way to see a love die do she also agree that we do not come into this place to shy away from difficult choice but to listen to our constituent and make well law for everyone 
 i thank my hon friend for her intervention and i be so sorry to hear that story from her constituency we all have story from all our   constituency and she be absolutely right that we be here to make difficult decision on her example there i have be astonish by the number of people who have be in touch with i to tell i about the terminally ill love one who have starve themselves to death out of desperation something that take far long than we may imagine and be just horrific for everyone involve that be currently legal and doctor be require to assist the patient through this agonising process how can we allow that but not a compassionate and humane assist death 
 i join   the right hon member for the wrekin mark pritchard   in commend my hon friend for the way she have make sure that this binary debate have not be a polarising i start the debate where she be now but i have move to oppose the bill by the story i have hear of disabled people who have have do not resuscitate put on their medical record without their permission or who have be stop by stranger in the street and be tell you would be well off dead i know she will say that we be vote on the specific of her bill but we be also vote on a principle do she agree that there should be a precautionary approach and do she honestly believe the legislative process give we the time to be sure that we be make the right decision 
 i thank my hon friend for his intervention and i will come on to some of those point later in my speech let we be very clear the title of the bill refer to terminally ill adult not disabled people or elderly people as another hon member refer to the criterion be very clear 
 i come back to the status quo which be the problem we be try to address if people want to avoid the trauma of some of the harrowing circumstance i have describe they can have an assist death just not in this country if they have £ or £ they can make the trip to switzerland or elsewhere but because of the current legal position it be often a deeply distressing and very lonely experience shroud in secrecy with people feel like criminal as the fear of prosecution hang over they 
 ilana ’s husband crispin have late stage motor neurone disease he be paralyse and ilana be a wheelchair user but at his request she take he on a traumatic and difficult journey to switzerland she describe the intense stress and anxiety she feel due to the total secrecy of their plan and we can only imagine what the journey home be like on her own with an empty seat beside she 
 there be also those terminally ill people who take matter into their own hand gareth ’s father norman serve in the welsh guards he be a strong man but his final year be full of pain and discomfort he have prostate cancer which he live with for year he be give good initial hormone therapy and chemo but the cancer spread everywhere and the pain could not be ease day when it all become too much he go into his garden with the gun he own and shoot himself gareth ’s sister rush to his house and find he gareth say his father just want the pain to stop 
 then there be peter from mirfield in my own constituency who stop i in a car park a couple of week ago to tell i the harrowing story of his beloved wife who be diagnose with metastatic cancer age the treatment be ineffective and her symptom be unbearable she take an overdose of her medication and peter find she and take she to hospital she recover and he bring her home but the follow day she make another attempt to take her own life in a way that be too awful to describe peter find she dead and he spend the next hour be question by the police 
 it be estimate that more than terminally ill people take their own life every year often patient will store up medication josh a year old from huddersfield go to coach his local kid rugby team saturday and come back to tell his mum all about it he find she dead lisa who be terminally ill have store up her medication and take her own life 
 our former colleague paul blomfield the previous mp for sheffield central have campaign tirelessly on this issue since his dad harry take his own life in alone in his garage after be diagnose with inoperable lung cancer language matter harry be not suicidal he love life but he have watch too many of his friend have linger degrade death and he do not want that for himself but like the other he could not tell paul and his family of his plan as they would have be complicit and could have face prosecution how many precious day and week do harry miss out on as a result of have to take action while he be still physically able to do so hear these story be not easy but it be important 
 what i have be strike by in recent week as i have listen to member from across the house be the clear agreement that the current situation be neither sustainable nor dignified almost everyone in this house agree that the status quo be unacceptable in term of dignity palliative care and end of life give that do my hon friend agree that today ’s debate be about how we depart from the unacceptable situation that we currently face be today ’s vote not the stage of an important discussion about we improve the end of life for hundred and hundred of people across this country 
 i wholeheartedly agree i be set out what we be deal with now this can not be right and surely we have a duty to do something about it 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be go to make some progress if that be okay 
 some of the most important voice in this debate be of course those of people currently live with a terminal illness have a terminal diagnosis be perhaps of those situation where it be very hard if not impossible to know how we would feel i have meet many terminally ill people over recent week and every of they be in my thought today 
 sophie who be here today be diagnose with stage secondary breast cancer which have spread to her lung liver and pelvis she be allergic to opioid so she know that her pain be very unlikely to be able to be manage   she have a year old daughter all she ask be to have the choice to say goodbye to her daughter at a time of her choosing in circumstance that she can have some control over and for her daughter to be able to remember she as the vibrant positive woman she be 
 nathaniel who also join we today have stage incurable bowel cancer which be now in his liver and brain like many of we nat say that he do not know whether he would choose an assisted death or not but he simply can not understand why anyone would want to deny he the choice he say 
 i wish to live as fully as i can and for as long as possible but when the time come 
 nat also want 
 the right to die with dignity and compassion 
 another very emotional lady come up to i at a recent interfaith event she and her husband thank i for put the bill forward she say kim i be a proud christian and i be guide by my faith but i also have terminal cancer and i want the right to choose a compassionate death 
 there have be much discussion about the view of people who hold religious belief i fully respect those belief and do not intend to say much more about this other than that i know there be a range of view within faith community indeed some of the most powerful conversation that i have have have be with people of faith include in my own constituency people of different religion have say that although they would not choose an assisted death for themselves or their family who be they to stop someone else who may want to make that choice 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will make some progress if i may i hope that i have set out the problem that clearly exist now allow i to set out how the bill can address that problem and most importantly do so safely and effectively 
 if the bill be to become law it would contain the most robust and strong set of safeguard and protection in the world very strict eligibility criterion and multiple layer of check and safeguard be embed in the bill none of which as we have see exist at the moment i make a conscious decision to name it the terminally ill adult end of life bill rather than anything else that title can never be change and ensure that only adult who be die would ever come within its scope as such the bill be not about people choose between life and death it be about give die people with month or less to live autonomy about how they die and the choice to shorten their death 
 the bill do not apply to people with mental health condition it do not apply to the elderly it do not apply to people with chronic health condition and it do not apply to disabled people unless of course they have a terminal illness in which case they would and should be entitle to the same right as anyone else 
 group of people who be not often talk about be the learning disable clause 9(3)(b say that if an assess doctor have any doubt as to the capacity of the person they may refer   they for a further psychiatric assessment if the bill be vote through today will the hon member engage in a debate about whether that language should be strengthen from may to must and whether the training and experience require of the assessor should be strengthen as well 
 the hon lady make an excellent point and highlight a community who we must consider in light of the bill i would absolutely be open to that conversation in committee it be a very valid point 
 there be different view within the disabled community as professor of disability research sir tom shakespeare say that it be unacceptable that people with disability continue to face social stigma and inequality but that it would be a mistake to conclude that we should oppose legalise assist die for terminally ill people until those wide problem be fix he say that it be paternalistic and wrong to imply that inequality will be resolve by reduce choice and that a clear transparent legal framework for end of life choice be well for everyone he be right there be of course still work to do in the fight for equality for people with disability but once again it be not an either or i will campaign alongside many other in this place for those right but i will also campaign for the right of terminally ill people because their right be as important as anybody else ’s right 
 i have huge respect for the hon lady for the way that she have conduct this debate over the last few week my concern be that she have focus today on the individual and the individual choice but we be here to legislate for society as a whole in legislating what we be say if we pass the bill be that it be okay to take that choice—[interruption]—and there will be some people who have month of their life to go who will then feel ought i to do this be this something that i now should do that bring into play a whole set of considerations—“is it well for my family be it financially well for my family?”—in way that at the moment be out of scope rather than simply focus on the individual suffering which we all recognise be acute we must broaden the debate to the impact that the legislation will have on society as a whole 
 i thank my hon friend for his intervention i suggest that the bill will give society a much well approach towards end of life we be already hear conversation about die and death which i do not think we have hear enough in this country we have to take a holistic view indeed that be what happen in other country and other jurisdiction have those deep and meaningful conversation about death and dying be really important my hon friend ’s comment bring i on nicely to the protection and safeguard in the bill 
 a decade ago i vote against a similar bill because i feel that perhaps it be not perfect and there be more thing that i need to know my hon friend be right that we have not talk about death for the year since or consider any legislation the truth be that if we vote against her bill today it will be the end of the conversation once again for another decade 
 my hon friend be absolutely right how many people will go through the situation i have describe if it be another year before we address this matter 
 rise 
 i be not go to take any more intervention i be afraid because i be conscious that lot of hon member want to speak i know mr speaker be conscious of that as well 
 under the bill any terminally ill person who want to be consider for an assist death would have to undertake a thorough and robust process involve doctor and a high court judge no other jurisdiction in the world have those layer of safeguarding the person request assistance must have mental capacity and a settle wish at every stage that mean they must repeatedly demonstrate that they understand the information relevant to their decision the ability to retain that information and to use or weigh that information as part of the process of make the decision we know that capacity can fluctuate which be why it be assess at every step of the process 
 on that point will my hon friend give way 
 i be sorry but i be not go to take any intervention as i need to make progress 
 the court must speak to of the doctor and can hear from anybody else they deem necessary if there be any evidence of coercion the court will not approve the request and if evidence emerge subsequently the court order could be revoke it be also important to note that the person can change their mind at any time with period of reflection build in have consult at the high level in the judiciary and the medical profession i know that they can and will fulfil those safeguard responsibility and that they have the expertise to do so.[official report   november vol c. correction 
 let we be clear as my hon friend   the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna   say early this be not brand new territory for doctor doctor work in partnership with other clinician be already require to manage complexity in end of life decision making i follow the request of the british medical association that doctor should be under no obligation whatsoever to participate but if they do participate they will receive appropriate training and support doctor should be able to use their professional judgment when and if a conversation take place take their cue from the patient as they do for many other issue i welcome that patient centre approach many doctor feel the change in the law would safeguard clinician and patient by make everything explicit

 speak of process with reference to the bill have listen to what i know be genuine concern of members about ensure that we get this legislation right i commit to the house that if the bill pass reading today which i sincerely hope it do i be minded to move a motion that give the bill committee the power to take oral and write evidence in order to ensure that a thorough approach continue to be take that be not normal procedure for a private member ’s bill but i think that that be the right thing to do i also reassure colleague that the bill committee will meet over a number of week mean that there be ample time for full consideration of the detail of the bill include amendment the committee will be representative of the view and make up of the house let i be clear that will mean there will be representative of different party with a range of view on the committee 
 as the leader of the house say at the dispatch box just yesterday and have say several time the government will of course work with i to ensure that the bill be workable and operable that will quite rightly take time and i have include in the bill a commencement period of up to year this be not go to happen overnight that timeframe can be explore in committee as it be more important to get this right than to do it quickly 
 in conclusion for the reason i have set out i be very clear that the law need to change to give terminally ill people choice at the end of life and to protect their love one from fear of prosecution there will be some of we here today who be lucky enough not to have personal experience of this issue but sadly we know that any of we could end up in this heartbreaking situation we be all live long which be brilliant and i have campaign inside and outside parliament for a great focus on prevention and early intervention of illness and disease to keep we fit and healthy for as long as possible but any of we or our loved one could be unfortunate or unlucky enough to receive a terminal diagnosis i struggle to see how it be fair or just to deny anyone the autonomy dignity and personal choice of take control of their final week and the right to choose do not take away the right not to choose   give the choice of an assist death to those who want it would of course not stop anyone who be terminally ill from choose not to make that choice 
 whatever happen today i be incredibly proud of the work that my fantastic team and the many campaigner have do on this hugely significant emotional and sensitive subject we need to be clear a vote to take this bill forward today be not a vote to implement the law tomorrow it be a vote to continue the debate it be a vote to subject the bill to line by line scrutiny in committee on report and on reading then of course the bill will go to the lords for what i have no doubt will be far robust debate and scrutiny this will be a thorough process focus on of the most significant issue of our time an issue that people across the country clearly want we to address none more so than the many family who be face the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo today be the beginning not the end of that process but the debate can continue only if colleague join i in the aye lobby today i wholeheartedly encourage they to do so and i commend the bill to the house 
 i think you indicate that i could speak for a little long than minute mr speaker 
 yes 
 thank you very much i do not want to have too much grumbling at the minute moment i will take my minute with time for intervention 
 i start by pay tribute to   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   for her very powerful speech and the way in which she have lead this campaign with great respect sensitivity and to use a contested word dignity she and i know each other before we be mp when we both work in the charity sector i like and admire she greatly and i know that we have more in common than might appear today 
 all of we in this house have this in common we all share a deep concern about the experience of people die or fear death pain and suffering i bear heavily on my conscience the people whose life will be prolong beyond their wish if i get my way and this bill be defeat today i will not disregard those people or minimise their anxiety we will hear those voice in today ’s debate we have hear many of they already speak through hon member in what i know will be very move speech 
 if i vote for this bill i would have on my conscience many more people whose voice we can not hear the people who would be vulnerable as a consequence of the huge change that this bill would introduce in our society and in the nhs my view be that if we get our break palliative care system right and our wonderful hospice properly fund we can do so much more for all the people who we will hear about today use modern pain relief and therapy to help everybody die with a minimum of suffering when the time come we will not be able to do that if we introduce this new option instead we will expose many more people to harm 
 i will go through the bill in a moment but i will say a word about process in response to the point make by the hon member for spen valley this bill be   simply too big for the time that it have be give and i implore hon member not to hide behind the fiction that it can be amend substantially in committee and in its later stage the remain stage of a private member ’s bill be for minor tweak not the kind of wholesale restructuring that we would need if we be ever to make this bill safe member who vote for the bill today must be prepared to see it become law largely unamended i suggest that if they have any doubt the only responsible choice be to vote no and let the advocate of assist dying bring back a well bill at another time 
 i deeply appreciate the respectful way in which the hon gentleman be make his point but i stand before he not sure of how any colleague in this chamber can not have doubt whichever way they be vote today it feel like there be necessary harm that we be all force to weigh up if the hon gentleman be so certain that doubt should push people way i be deeply intrigue to hear why that be when it be very clear that many people will continue to suffer unnecessarily if we reject this bill 
 i recognise that there be very many doubt on each side and i fully respect the argument that have be make by the hon member for spen valley of course this be a finely balanced debate but the point about process be that this bill be too flawed there be too much to do to it to address in committee by all mean let we have this debate but let we have that before a bill of this magnitude be bring forward the consideration of the bill should be much more comprehensive 
 contrary to what the medium be say today ’s decision be not about bring this bill into law it be about allow it to go to the next stage people may have misgiving but the hon gentleman be make the assumption that the bill can not be correct or amend in order to make it palatable to people who have doubt we all have doubt but surely today ’s vote be simply to let it go to the next stage the final decision on reading be the critical in decide whether the bill go into law 
 i think i have make the point that this bill be too comprehensive and there be too much in it to address through the process of a private member ’s bill if the hon gentleman have serious concern about aspect of the bill that he would not be prepared to see come into law he should not be support it today 
 let i explain the concern about the bill that i think be too comprehensive to be deal with in committee i recognise how hard the hon member for spen valley have work to try to ensure that it be safe but i do not believe it be for the follow reason let we start at the beginning the process start with a conversation between a patient and a medical practitioner not necessarily a doctor just a medic of some sort unspecified at this stage if the patient tell their ordinary family doctor that they want an assisted death the doctor be oblige to either explain how it work or pass they on to someone who will do it which be probably what will happen by the way the likelihood be that we would see a new branch of medicine spring up like the medic i meet in canada 
 will the hon member give way 
 i will in a moment 
 these medic i meet in canada be specialist in assist death and personally kill hundred of patient a year in their special clinic interruption if hon member have difficulty with the language then i wonder what they be do here this be what we be talk about i meet doctor for whom this be their profession and their job and they be proud to do it 
 will the hon member give way 
 i will give way to the other hon gentleman 
 i want to be very clear that medical practitioner be a synonym for doctor not nurse pharmacist dentist or any other practitioner to be a doctor be to be a practitioner of medicine we need to be very clear on this there be lot of law and regulation on this and i believe that what the hon member say be incorrect 
 what the bill actually say be that a doctor mean 
 a register medical practitioner who have such training qualification and experience as the secretary of state may specify by regulation 
 obviously they be some sort of regulated medic i recognise that but they be not necessarily a doctor we will find out i recognise that they will have professional qualification but it be not clear what those be go to be because it be not in the bill 
 i commend the hon gentleman for the way in which he be engage in this discussion in the same spirit as   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater we often hear that of the safeguard associate with the bill be that medical practitioner would be involve and that a diagnosis of a terminal illness with month or less to live would be require do the hon gentleman accept that medicine be not an exact science it be the science of uncertainty blend with the art of probability there be no exactitude in this no court will guess medical opinion it will simply look at process 
 i entirely agree with the right hon gentleman he be absolutely right i be afraid that the definition of terminal illness be in a sense the essential flaw in the bill but i will come on to that 
 go back to the conversation that the patient have with the medical practitioner the crucial point be that the conversation do not need to be start by the patient accord to the bill it could be start by the medic any medic perhaps in hospital who could make the suggestion of an assist death to a patient who have never raise the issue themselves whose family have never suggest it and whose own doctor do not think it be the right thing to do and so the idea be plant 
 then for whatever reason and by the way there be no need ever to give a reason the patient say that they want to proceed with an assisted death they sign a declaration or rather somebody else can sign it for   they it could be any professional someone they do not know maybe a new medical practitioner a total stranger can do all the paperwork on their behalf that be what the clause about the proxy entail then these medical practitioner make their assessment 
 i urge the hon member to check the wording of the bill because if somebody sign as a proxy they have to have know the individual for year and would simply be sign to say that they agree with the patient who wish to go forward with assisted dying 
 i do not have time to check the bill now but from my memory it refer to someone who have know the patient for year or someone of good standing in the community which could be some sort of professional who be not know to they at all someone can quickly check the bill but my understanding be that it could be a total stranger to they 
 be the matter not very clear clause 15(5 state 
 in this section proxy mean 
 a a person who have know the person make the declaration personally for at least year or 
 b a person who be of good standing in the community 
 so there be no protection such as that which be pretend by the supporter of the bill 
 i be grateful for that intervention 
 the assessment have to determine whether the patient be terminally ill whether they have mental capacity to make the decision and then whether they have be coerce or pressure into the decision in many way the whole issue turn on the question of whether someone be terminally ill i be afraid that it be a term of great elasticity almost to the point of meaninglessness it be well know as   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   say early that it be impossible for doctor to predict with any accuracy that somebody will die within month it be a purely subjective judgment make in this case by a doctor whose job will be approve assist death they simply have to determine not whether it be reasonably certain that death will occur but that it can be reasonably expect in other word that it be possible 
 the thrust of the bill as i understand it be to ease suffering and pain in a patient who have a diagnosis and will die of the condition that have be diagnose but that right could only be exercise within a month period and the pain and discomfort could last a lot long than that have my hon friend hear because i have not what the importance of month be why not or what would stop people challenge it on the ground that the dam have be breach the month be entirely arbitrary and it could and indeed should be extend by negative resolution in a statutory instrument 
 my hon friend make the right point and i be afraid to say that be absolutely the case the month cut off be completely arbitrary and impossible to determine it be a line in the sand and of course it could be challenge as so much of the bill could be challenge on human right ground every of the    safeguard that have be introduce by the hon member for spen valley would in fact be a barrier and a discrimination against the new human right that have be award to group but should of course be award to all if the point be concede in this way 
 early this week colleague and i meet eminent doctor who be former president of the association for palliative medicine and they raise serious concern about the bill include that the doctor or medical practitioner who make the assessment need never have meet the person they be assess or be involve in their care at all what do the hon gentleman make of that 
 the hon lady make a very important point i will not get into the question of public opinion and the polling because it be so contested but there be clear evidence that the doctor who work with the dying the palliative care professional be oppose to a change in the law by a great majority they see the damage that it would do to the palliative care profession and service and they see the danger for vulnerable patient 
 i appreciate that the hon gentleman talk to we as a medical professional and we need to listen to his view but be it not true that any medical assessment be an approximation something that can not be say for certain for this decision too we can not be certain but that be life we can not make legislation that be good because at some point we have to make a decision on balance whether something have merit or not for that reason we should vote for the bill 
 i be grateful to the hon lady especially for promote i to the status of doctor i be actually a charity worker and political hack by background it be good of she to credit i with those skill perhaps i should set myself up as a medical practitioner she be right that medic and indeed judge have to make difficult judgment all the time i think it would be very dangerous and inappropriate to give they the power to do so in this case 
 the whole question of the month cut off be very important i acknowledge all the point that have be make but there be another problem with the definition of terminal illness almost anybody with a serious illness or disability could fit the definition i recognise that these be not the case that the hon member for spen valley have in mind of course they be not but that be the problem with the bill all that someone need to do to qualify for an assisted death for the definition of terminal illness be refuse treatment such as insulin if the person be diabetic in the case of eat disorder a topic on which i have work with   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse a person just need to refuse food the evidence from jurisdiction around the world and our own jurisprudence show that that would be enough to qualify someone for an assisted death 
 do the hon gentleman accept that every day in the nhs patient refuse treatment and indeed food and that there be currently legal oversight in respect of coercion and other such matter would the bill not strengthen protection in those area 
 i be perplex by that argument the suggestion that there may be coercion of course there will be and abuse and all sort of injustice that take place in the current system do not strike i as an argument for regulate and license assist suicide if we have concern about practice in the nhs let we deal with that let we not license suicide and by the way evidence from around the world show that that increase suicide in the general population suicide be contagious for instance oregon be often point to as an example the incidence of suicide outside assist suicide law have rise by a there since it be legalised there would be enormous contagious effect be we to regulate and license it in this way 
 the hon gentleman be make an excellent case for the bill to be pass today what he be actually say be that there be specific that require debate analysis and discussion in great detail in committee that be the whole point of it if it be not deal with properly in committee it will not pass reading he be suggest that because he do not like those specific we can not discuss the bill in any detail 
 i be sure that the hon member for spen valley be delighted to have the support of the hon gentleman i refer he to the point that i be make this be an inappropriate process 
 my hon friend be make a superb speech as i expect he to do on the issue of process i say this to   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice my constituency neighbour as he will know i have introduce some very serious bills include the that become the investigatory powers act it be precede by independent report and pre legislative cross party scrutiny by both houses which happen before the committee stage the point be that that process should take place before reading not after 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend i will now run through the process before take any more intervention 
 as i have explain pretty much anybody with a serious illness or disability could work out how to qualify for an assist death under the bill member may think that far fetched but it be what happen everywhere that assist suicide be legal include in oregon 
 on a point of order mr speaker the hon gentleman be use incorrect language it be not suicide that be offensive i ask he please to correct his language 
 that be not a point of order 
 i be sorry if offence be give but the fact be that the value of have a bill in black and white be see what the law really be what the bill would do be amend the suicide act it would allow people to assist with a suicide for the time i respect the hon lady ’s concern but i be afraid we do need to use the proper language here 
 the bill ’s scope be very broad member who think that assist suicide for people with anorexia or other condition that would not be regard as terminal could not happen here should consider the young people in the uk today who be give a diagnosis of terminal anorexia and put on a palliative care pathway essentially assign to death of course these be extreme case 
 rise 
 i be not go to give way again 
 there be a great many of these case i be afraid and i mention they to show how wide open the bill be interruption 
 order may i ask   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse   to keep a little calm she have intervene twice already and plenty of other member who also need to be hear 
 i think particularly of disabled people many of whom require constant treatment to stay alive all immediately and by definition will be eligible under the term of the bill for a state sponsor death i refer member to the equality and human rights commission which have make the point that the line between disability and terminal illness be very blurred that be why the bill ’s title be in fact so dangerous 
 rise 
 i will make a little progress 
 the question that medical practitioner have to answer be about mental capacity and here again be a great vagueness how do they judge if someone be in their right mind when they be ask for help to kill themselves the bill say that the definition of capacity be base on the mental capacity act but that act be deliberately expansive it explicitly assume capacity in the patient so have acute depression be no bar to be judge to have capacity under the act be suicidal be no bar under the act so the capacity test be no bar at all 
 finally there be the question of coercion be the patient ask for an assist death because of pressure from someone else there be glare problem here the be that the process do not even attempt to answer the question properly there be no investigation no requirement for medic to interview friend and family and no need for a psychiatrist or family doctor to be consult the medic just need to satisfy themselves who know how?—that to the good of their knowledge the person have not be pressure 
 the problem with the coercion test be that it focus on only type of coercion the less likely type the big danger be not other people pressure someone to do this it be that they pressure themselves hon member have make this point the bill have nothing to say on that internal pressure be absolutely fine if you feel worthless or a burden to other if the nhs will not offer you the treatment you need if the local authority will not make the adjustment you need to your home if you have to wait too long for a hospital appointment or if you want to die because you think the system have fail you that be absolutely fine 
 rise 
 i will get to the end of my speech 
 that be the medical stage and i will jump straight to the judicial stage the medical practitioner sign it off and then the judge have to confirm all the same test of course many eminent judge have make the point that it will overwhelm the family court if the test be apply properly but it will not be apply properly because the bill assume that judge will fulfil a new inquisitorial role and actually look into case as investigator which be entirely unknown in english common law but the bill will not require any actual investigation 
 there be no requirement for a judge even to meet the applicant they simply have to have a phone call or maybe it will be an email from of the medic that be it that be the inquiry on that basis the judge must decide whether it be more likely than not that there have be external pressure after the judge approve it they be require to approve it unless they can find evidence of external coercion we go to the final act as the bill say where a junior colleague as a medical practitioner oversee your death by pill or lethal injection 
 and here be the last thing that the bill do or do not do there be no requirement at any stage of the process at either the medical or the judicial stage for anyone to tell the patient ’s next of kin their wide family or even their gp that the nhs and the judicial system be work in secret to bring about the death of their love maybe their father or their daughter i say again that these be not the case that the bill be design for but they be directly in scope and it be go to take more than a tweak in committee to get they out 
 be this what be mean by have choice at the end of life let we talk about choice i be often accuse of want to impose my view on other that point be make early people say if you do not approve of assist death do not have but do not deprive i of the choice in fact the evidence be that with this new option and the comparative loss of investment and innovation in palliative care real choice will narrow there be a broad point to make about choice which be that no man or woman be an island just as every person ’s death even a good death diminish we all so we will all be involve and affect if we make this change 
 the bill will not just create a new option for a few and leave everyone else unaffected it will impose this new reality on every person towards the end of their life on everyone who could be think to be near death and on their family the option of assist suicide the obligation to have a conversation around the bedside or whisper in the corridor be it time it will change life and death for everyone 
 i be very aware of the terrible plight of the people who be beg we for this new law i think we can do well for they than they fear but we also need to think in real human term about what the effect will be on the choice of other people and i do not mean the people who be use to get their way i be talk about the people who lack agency the people who know what it be to be exclude from power and to have decision make for they by bigwig in distant office who speak a language they do not understand the sort of people   who the hon member for spen valley and i both know from our previous charity work and who we all know from our constituency work they be not the people who write to we campaign for a change in the law but the people who come to our surgery with their life in tatter or who the police or social worker tell we about the people with complex need what be the safeguard for they 
 let i tell the house we be the safeguard this place this parliament you and i we be the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm yet we stand on the brink of abandon that role the rubicon be a very small stream but on the other side lie a very different world a bad world with a very different idea of human value the idea that our individual worth lie in our utility valuable only for so long as we be useful not a burden not a cost not make a mess let we not be the parliament that authorise that idea 
 i mention at the start of my speech the voice of those we can not hear the frail and elderly and the disabled as we be surround by such a cloud of witness let we do well than this bill let today be not a vote for despair but the start of a proper debate about die well in which we have a well idea than a state suicide service let we have a debate in which we remember that we have intrinsic value that real choice and autonomy mean have access to the good care possible and the full control over what happen to we while we live and that true dignity consist in be care for to the end 
 rise 
 order i remind the house that we want to aim for speech of up to minute i call the mother of the house 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater   on bring forward this bill which have be the occasion of a very important national conversation i recall to the house the fact that in parliament vote to abolish the death penalty for murder public opinion be actually against that change but mps believe on a point of principle that the state should not be involve in take a life it be a good principle in and it remain a good principle today 
 i be not against legalise assist die in any circumstance but i have many reservation about this bill in particular i do not believe that the safeguard be sufficient they be suppose to be the strong in the world because of the involvement of a high court judge but the divisional court have say that 
 the intervention of a court would simply interpose an expensive and time consume forensic procedure 
 sir james munby the former president of the family division of the high court say recently 
 only those who believe implicitly in judicial omniscience and infallibility and i do not can possibly have any confidence in the efficacy of what be propose 
 be the judge suppose to guess doctor will the judge make a decision on the basis of paperwork or will there be a hearing in open court where will be   the capacity in the criminal justice system to deal with all this far from be a genuine safeguard the involvement of a judge could just be a rubber stamp 
 more than third of care proceeding involve the most vulnerable child in our society can not be complete within month do my right hon friend agree that there be a real concern that the safeguard be not deliverable or risk be the rubber stamp that i know my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater   do not want it to be 
 i entirely agree with my hon friend 
 robust safeguard for the sick and dying be vital to protect they from predatory relative to protect they from the state and above all to protect they from themselves there will be those who say to themselves that they do not want to be a burden i can imagine myself say that in particular circumstance other will worry about asset they have hop to leave for their grandchild be erode by the cost of care there will even be a handful who will think they should not be take up a hospital bed 
 my right hon friend make her case powerfully can i ask she to comment on the current situation whereby people ask themselves the question she just ask today what safeguard be there for those people what inquiry be make before those people pass away often have take the most drastic and horrific action to do so 
 but if the house pass this legislation the issue that i have raise will become foremost in people ’s mind even more so 
 we be tell that there be no evidence of coercion in jurisdiction where assisted suicide be possible but people do not generally write letter to sick relative urge they to consider assist suicide and then put those letter on file coercion in the family context can be about not what you say but what you do not say the long meaningful pause 
 as a medical professional who be surround by even more senior medical professional i know we can all miss thing when there be tangible in front of we the shadow on x ray and the marker on blood test as professional we miss thing that can be see what security will we have that we can pick up thing that we can not see like coercion 
 that be the point coercion be something that there will be no material evidence of and that we can not see 
 people keep say that the bill can not be amend but of course any future government could bring in new clause we can see what have happen in canada which introduce assist die in for adult with terminal illness in it be extend to people with no terminal illness and the disabled in march anyone with a serious mental health problem will also be eligible the house should remember that no single organisation represent the disabled support the bill 
 my daughter maria live her life with severe disability and health condition since her birth we be tell many time that she might have only month to live she live for year crucially maria be non verbal i be fill with dread and fear about what might happen to people like maria who be non verbal and do not have that capacity if they be not love and care for and do not have somebody speak out for they 
 i have hear so many story like that the arbitrary cut off of month do not necessarily meet with the reality of sick people 
 the case of maria and other should give we all pause do the right hon lady agree with third of the cabinet apparently support this measure in principle that we should reject the bill today but that we should as a house commit not to go another year ignore this topic but to come forward in a consider way ensure it be look at properly and do everything possible to have a system that be more robust more caring and ensure good outcome for people like maria 
 order let i also say that we must try to keep to the time limit 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman as i say right at the beginning i be not against assist die in any circumstance if the bill pass we will have the nhs as a funded suicide service but palliative care will be fund only at at well the former member for dunfermline east gordon brown have say recently 
 we need to show we can do well at assist living before decide whether to legislate on way to die 
 i represent very many vulnerable people in marginalised community i can not vote for a bill when i have doubt about whether they will be protect we can come back have a commission and craft a well bill but i will not be vote for the bill today 
 i want to make brief point i have completely change by mind on this subject since i enter the house during the last century because i have sit in my advice surgery with tear pour down my face listen to constituent who have set out so clearly speak with such emotion about how their mother brother father or child have die in great pain and great indignity 
 i strongly support the bill and i congratulate   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   on the excellent way in which she have present it i believe that we should give our constituent our fellow citizen this choice i want this choice for my constituent i want it for those whom i love and i want it perhaps day for myself 
 will the right hon gentleman give way 
 i will not i be afraid the current law force people to plan their death in secret their body be find by their love one often they die in the   most horrific circumstance they have no chance to say goodbye to their loved one it be devastating for their family the former health secretary commission the office for national statistics to try to find out how many people who commit suicide every year be die people the figure be between and 
 secondly in our democracy the commons must make this decision only we elect by our constituent have the legitimacy to do this it be not the dpp the crown prosecution service the police doctor or even unelecte members of the house of lords this house of commons must make this decision let we be clear that all of we on both side of the debate strongly support an increase in the quality and extent of palliative care for i the debate be about extend choice in very narrow and heavily regulate circumstance under the bill as the hon lady so clearly set out the choice not to be force to end your life in pain and indignity no element in the bill talk about intolerable suffering many believe that the bill be too narrowly draw i stand by the hon lady ’s drafting we should remember that in oregon there have be no serious attempt to change or amend the law 
 i have the privilege of speak to an nhs consultant last year the day before she head to dignita she say i love my country but i object very strongly to my country force i to make this choice and to have to travel unaccompanied to a foreign country to die the status quo be cruel and dangerous people catch up in these circumstance have no transparency there be no regulation safeguard or oversight the bill contain a whole series of safeguard that be not present at the moment 
 thirdly we be decide today on a principle if the bill be vote down on reading that will be the end of the matter for many year and we will do that in the knowledge that scotland the isle of man jersey and many other country be likely to bring in legislation like this there be people in jurisdiction who have secure this ability to choose there will be numerous safeguard there will not be a slippery slope unless this parliament agree to there be if we agree to a reading today it be in my judgment inconceivable that the government front bench will not ensure we have the proper time to scrutinise the bill 
 this bill go with the grain of our constituent view about accord to the most recent polling there be an opportunity and a chance as the hon member for spen valley have set out to consider in detail these matter ahead of reading as draft the bill seem to i a very modest and control proposal let we not forget this oregon show we that few people take these step once they know they have this choice as a back up 
 i end with something i have never forget some year ago i be listen in a debate to a young man who have recently lose his father he have visit his father and see he in great pain and indignity he have see he day before he die in the end his father put a bag over his head and use his dressing gown cord to hang himself that young man say to all of we if you be ever in this position let ’s hope that god will help you because they certainly will n’t today this house have the opportunity to ensure that they will 
 it be a pleasure to follow the excellent speech of   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell in preparation for today i have have a number of discussion with my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater and i want to put on record that the measured way she have deal with the proceeding have be excellent i do not know whether she have ever have moment of doubt whether this be the right thing to pick as a private member ’s bill but she have be an absolute credit to this house in the way she have deal with these matter so far 
 in in the last chamber debate on this subject i wound up for the opposition front bench but my interest in it go back much far like all member of this house i have have hundred of email from constituent on both side of the argument many ask i to oppose the bill those email come from people of faith and i wholly and entirely respect what they say but they be the people also to say that this be an individual decision for every individual member of the house to make 
 as i have be at the bottom of the list of speaker to be call for so many year i have great sympathy for those who find themselves there today so i will try to keep my remark to narrow point the legal context of the bill there be a false dichotomy that the law as it stand be fit for purpose that we go into the unknown with the bill before we and that we should somehow keep the safety of the status quo i think that could not be more wrong there be no safeguard in the current law the only sanction against coercion be ex post facto we be leave it to individual director of public prosecution to make decision in individual case after the event 
 dpp take that job extremely seriously as anyone know who have hear sir max hill the last dpp to speak on the subject they have at the instigation of the court set out guideline i think we know that it be an excellent director of public prosecutions who set out the guideline on this case they have do everything they can but it be not their responsibility it be our responsibility and the court up to and include the supreme court have make that clear 
 we assign in this bill a role to the high court as part of the process but we be the final decision taker that have be make clear not only by domestic but by international court the european court of human rights have say in every case in which such matter have come before it that the margin of appreciation should be put into effect and therefore it should not interfere with the law as we decide it we can not dodge our responsibility and i know that we do not want to do that we have a duty to put in place the good law we can and that be not the law as it stand 
 there be choice for people who want to end their own life they can go to dignita alone if they can afford to do that they can attempt and perhaps succeed in suicide they risk fail if they succeed they will have a lonely death they may as other have point out simply have to resort to refuse treatment or food the option be that they can embroil their relative or friend at the risk of their be investigate or prosecute they also risk end their life too soon 
 on safeguard i do not follow the view of opponent of the bill at some time they seem to say that they be too complex too expensive and that there be not enough resource if we want to resource the bill we can i do not think that those be the strong argument 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i really do not want to because of the time i be sorry interruption should i i will give way once 
 my hon friend talk a little about safeguard i invite he and the house to reflect on the covid pandemic when a lot of safeguard around a lot of thing be relax i worry that if we be to see another pandemic on the scale that we see in people might feel that they be do something patriotic by get out of the way and free up a bed for a young person i invite he to reflect on that 
 in practice a terminally ill person will need to formally consider their decision at least time under the provision in the bill this be a starting point a number of member have make that point i believe the bill have already have more scrutiny than most public bills we consider but we have up to month before we to consider it far 
 all the practical and legal consideration point towards the bill it may well be amend to change the safeguard or the way it operate but we have the opportunity to do that in the end for i that be not the decision the decision be about thing it be about human dignity and it be about agency i would like to think that even at the end of life no especially at the end of life when someone have their faculty but may be at their weak ebb they can still exercise that agency and still make decision for themselves they can have the long life they can and they can end that life in the way that be most beneficial to they their love one and their family that be simply not happen and by vote against the bill today member ignore those fact 
 when i be a child my parent shield i from death century of art literature and religion teach i that death be something noble or even slightly romantic when i become an adult i learn pretty quickly that that be not the case for far too many it be anything but and certainly not noble the deathbed for far too many be a place of misery torture and degradation a reign of blood and vomit and tear i see no compassion and beauty in that only profound human suffering in year of campaign on this issue i have spend many many hour with die and bereaved people which have time and again reinforce my view 
 i be a co sponsor of the bill and i be the co chair of the all party parliamentary group for choice at the end of life i could give a speech to promote the bill but my hon friend and i do call she a friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater   have do that remarkably well in my speech i want to address some of the common issue that have be raise and that will no doubt be raise during the debate with which i struggle 
 we will no doubt hear an awful lot about the overseas experience i be married to a canadian and i can tell the house that they love their child just as much as we do the idea that the canadians australians new zealanders spanish and austrians care little for their relative or indeed for the wide society in which they live be frankly offensive we should not pretend that somehow we be special or different they have think as profoundly on these issue as we have over the past year we can learn from they and design a system for our own sensibility and culture as they have do they all have different law on abortion some of which we would not pass in this house but that do not mean we should not have abortion law here we be a year old democracy and we should be able to design legislation that deal with this issue for ourselves 
 the issue that have be raise with which i have struggle regard the impact on the nhs and on judge people be already die they be already in the national health service and entitle to care even if we think there will be an impact be people seriously tell i that my death my agony be too much for the nhs to have time for or too much hassle it be even claim that such matter would overload the judge that i should drown in my own faecal vomit because it be too much hassle for the judge to deal with we send thing from this house to the nhs and to judge all the time be anyone suggest that we should not create the new offence of spiking which have come through this week because judge be overwork of course not they will cope as they have do with all sort of thing that we have send from this house over the year and we should not countenance the idea that some logistical problem will get in the way of our give a good death to our fellow citizen 
 i also want to address directly those member who be consider vote against the bill to ensure that they be clear in their mind that a vote against the bill be not a passive act there be state of be on offer today i have to break some news to member whatever happen to the bill today people with a terminal illness will still take their life if the bill fall today we will be consign those people to take their life in brutal violent way as they be at the moment and will see increase number of our fellow citizen make the trip to switzerland if they can afford it we know that between and people a year be kill themselves in violent way shoot themselves throw themselves in front of train take overdose in lonely horrible circumstance as i say many be go to switzerland but more than that be lie in hospital i guarantee that there will be somebody over the river in st thomas hospital now who be refuse treatment and starve themselves to death because they can not face what be in front of they 
 do the right hon gentleman agree that we have a choice today we have come here to debate assist dying but we could have come here to build cross party consensus on how finally once and for all to fix palliative care in this country we could have come to look at a funding consensus as that do need to be cross party i agree   with his point that vote no be also a choice but what follow from that should be a cross party consensus on how we fix palliative care 
 i agree with the hon gentleman and what a surprise it be that the conversation about palliative care have start we be not have that conversation before this bill come forward the evidence from the health and care committee publish only in february this year show that palliative care and assist die go hand in hand 
 rise 
 i will not give way 
 improvement also go hand in hand medic from across the world tell we that the thing be complementary in australia i discuss this issue with a palliative care doctor who be against the introduction of assist dying when they be contemplate it she now find it an invaluable tool and she embrace it as something that her patient want and need my concern be that if the bill be turn down as it be in the conversation about palliative care will wither as it have do for the past year 
 i want to share a story that have particularly affect i mark crampton be a former police chief inspector who be suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease his copd become too much for he so he inform his family that he be go to take his own life he take his oxygen tank and mask and late night go out and sit on a railway embankment he want a death that be instant and quick and that he could rely on he wait until in the morning heartbreakingly he have work out when the last train be go so he would minimise disruption to the public and then take his life in lonely circumstance in the middle of the night by not pass the bill we would deny to mark supervision conversation access to doctor period of reflection advice even if he have be through all that and decide it be still too much the bill would give he a much well end than he actually achieve member should be clear as i say that whatever happen to the bill terminal people will still take their life 
 i have to say to   the hon member for brent west barry gardiner who say that hundred of people die in agony every year be a price worth pay for the good of society that i find that an appalling prospect a society that look away from these people like those in the public gallery who be live in terrible fear of what will face they or who have watch their family die in fear and say that that be okay for the good of the whole be a terrible terrible prospect we have a duty to assist they as other country around the world have do and to find a way to make they comfortable in the end 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i will not 
 finally i want to talk briefly about right we hear a lot about right in this debate quite rightly we hear about the right and fear of the disabled community who be specifically exclude from the bill we hear a lot   about the right and fear of the elderly who be also specifically exclude from the bill we be even hear about the right of doctor who be allow to conscientiously object to participate in this process if they wish when be we go to have the conversation about the right of the dying where do we put they in the ranking of right as they face their end when do we grant they the autonomy and choice for which so many of they have campaign over the year surely as they come towards the end of their life their right have to be at the forefront of our mind the last good gift we can give they be control over the disease that be destroy they
