 my hon friend raise an important point and i know she have secure a debate in the house this week to far explore these issue she will be aware that there have be a increase in the number of midwifery programme place starter since year ago that be alongside the £ add to the maternity budget since and the key increase in midwifery place in the long term workforce plan.[official report   november vol c. 2mc 
 it be obviously welcome to train and recruit as many staff as possible but part of the problem be actually retain the staff we be increasingly see among the reason give for leave particularly by nurse their work life balance what be the secretary of state do to address that 
 just yesterday i meet leader of the nhs staff council who represent trade union under agenda for change as part of our ongoing discussion on the agreement we will reach with they which include work together on retention and how we address some of the challenge the workforce face 
 may i congratulate the secretary of state on be ahead of track to hire more nurse this parliament as we commit to in the manifesto however can i push he by ask he where he be up to on ensure that enough staff be train to do clinical trial as set out in the excellent o’shaughnessy review and can he give we an update of where implementation of that review be up to 
 i very much welcome my right hon friend signal that we be ahead of the manifesto commitment not just in nurse be recruit but in key additional role in primary care where the target be and actually have now be recruit he be right about the importance of clinical research the o’shaughnessy review speed that up and reduce the cost it well leverage the taxpayer pound in investment from the private sector and standardise contract across nhs trust to bring the time down we be also look at innovation in area such as the nhs app to well empower patient to take part in clinical research trial that ensure they be at the front of the queue in get the late medicine which be exactly where we want the nhs to be 
 the secretary of state do not mention the increase plan in the number of physician associate the norfolk and waveney integrate care system have post 
 got abdominal pain that be not go away a physician associate base in your gp practice can help they be highly skilled at diagnose condition 
 after the tragic case of emily chesterton who be misdiagnose after see a physician associate twice at a gp practice and no gp at any point when will the lesson be learn that the nhs workforce can not be safely expand by this route of associate with only year medical training 
 all clinical role need to have the right regulation around they and we need to ensure that patient safety be to the fore the hon lady give a very good illustration of how the labour party talk about reform but not when it come to the reform of new role have new role in the nhs and have a ladder of opportunity for people to come into the nhs physician associate be people with master degree these people be highly skilled of course we need to get the regulation right however the labour party talk about reform but when it come to stand up to the trade union it be not willing to do so which be why when there be an innovation such as physician associate it want to block it 
 what step he be take to help prevent suicide 
 what step he be take to help prevent suicide 
 last month we publish a cross government year suicide prevention strategy it set out our pledge to reduce england ’s suicide rate within and a half year with over measure aim at save life and provide early intervention for those at high risk of suicide include new mum and middle aged man 
 like many other i drop into the campaign event for life develop by jacobs and support by r;pple and i be impress by its effort to interfere with the online risk of suicide centric website the minister may be aware that my wife be a long term volunteer with darlington and district   samaritans which have raise with i the save life can n’t wait campaign it ask the government to review local funding for suicide safe community which be due to end could i ask the minister to support the life campaign and to push for the renewal of local funding to support suicide safe community 
 i thank my hon friend for his hard work in this area and for his mental health campaigning overall and also his wife and all who selflessly give their time to volunteer with the invaluable mental health charity we fully recognise that and that be why when we launch the suicide prevention strategy we also launch our £ suicide prevention grant fund 
 on my hon friend ’s point about wide funding beyond that be subject to a future spending review but our commitment and record in deliver record investment of £ in mental health service just in this financial year which be more funding than in should give he confidence that this conservative government deliver on mental health service 
 be the minister able to provide an update on the suicide prevention grant and particularly on when the money be expect to reach the successful organisation 
 we have have a huge response to the opening of the grant with over application from voluntary group and organisation we be assess those bid and hope to make an announcement before the end of the year 
 campaign such as dad walk and just mums walking have work incredibly hard to raise awareness of suicide prevention have the minister have time to meet with either of those campaign yet 
 i have meet with dad walk i have not meet the mum group but be very happy to do so because of their intervention and campaigning we be able to successfully put their campaign about improve mental health awareness in the school curriculum into our suicide prevention strategy it be a cross government strategy and the department for education have very much take their point on board 
 over people languish on mental health waiting list black people time more likely to be detain under the mental health act and over people with learn disability detain in hospital all while the government be drag their foot on mental health and suicide prevention you will be interested to know mr speaker that we have cross party support to tackle these burn injustice through the draft mental health bill yet since the joint committee on the draft mental health bill publish our report in january we have hear nothing from the government so will the minister today commit to include reform of the mental health act in the king ’s speech 
 i be go to pay tribute to the hon lady for her work on mental health campaigning and she will know we have do a huge amount the suicide prevention strategy be a cross government piece   of work which make sure suicide be everyone ’s business not just that of health and social care whether by support family bereave by suicide or roll out mental health support scheme in school it be this government who be deliver on mental health service 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the house of commons library say there have be no statistically significant change in the rate of suicide in england since suicide remain the big killer of man under in the uk why have it take so long for the government to bring forward a strategy and why do they continue to drag their foot over reform to the mental health act can the minister give the house a firm timetable today 
 the hon lady be not quite right in her statistic just before covid we have see a reduction compare with decade ago in suicide level in england she might be interested to know that in labour run wales suicide rate be high than in england and its suicide prevention strategy expire last year mental health have be demote on the shadow front bench too as we see from the resignation of   the hon member for tooting dr allin khan   when the role of shadow mental health minister be remove from the opposition front bench 
 what step his department be take to remediate hospital building with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete 
 we be determined to address the safety issue cause by raac we be prioritise the worst affect hospital and have a fund of just under £ cover the year programme of replacement 
 can the secretary of state tell the house how many of the hospital where raac be an issue also have issue with asbestos be present what assessment have his department make of the impact should asbestos spore be release in a raac collapse 
 the hon member raise an interesting point about asbestos because much of the nhs estate date from a time when asbestos be widely use of course asbestos be consider safe if it be undisturbed it be a similar issue with raac 
 on raac we be follow the guidance from the institution of structural engineers and monitor it the advice be not that all raac need to be replace the point be that it need to be monitor where there be deterioration we have a fund of just under £ to tackle that the asbestos be be monitor as be the raac we have be monitor this since and have a year national programme back up with £ to address issue as and when they arise 
 the resident of stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke would like i to place their thank on the record to the secretary of state for have ensure that the haywood   walk in centre which have raac present have just receive £ for a new build out patient building which will do a lot to improve the care of resident locally as spade be already in the ground will the secretary of state commit to come to visit so that we can show off this fantastic progress 
 it be always a pleasure to visit my hon friend ’s constituency he highlight a good illustration of how the national programme be work back with that £ of funding we be closely monitor the estate and where raac mitigation be require that work be take place he bring a good example of that to the house ’s attention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 not only be the hospital building crumble after year of neglect create huge capacity challenge it seem that those still stand do not have enough bed as we hear from the times this morning the number of 
 hospital bed have fall by almost since minister promise before winter 
 it feel pretty much like winter to i be that just another broken promise 
 we have get more than £ of investment in an additional permanent bed go into the nhs estate as part of our urgent and emergency care recovery programme more widely the government be commit to the big ever investment in the nhs estate back with more than £ the big of any government of course we will not take lecture from labour which bequeath the nhs the consequence of expensive private finance initiative deal that many trust be still pay for to this day 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on trend in the level of recruitment in the health and social care sector 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on trend in the level of recruitment in the health and social care sector 
 rise 
 you can respond sit down if you wish 
 it be fine thank you mr speaker 
 since brexit we have more than more doctor and more nurse work in the nhs in england and more full time equivalent staff in adult social care our point base immigration system mean that we can recruit the talent we need from all over the world for our health and social care system include from the european union 
 if everything be as rosy as the minister say why do a spokesperson for the nuffield trust say last year that 
 great cost more paperwork and uncertainty over visa because of brexit have be among the big barrier to recruit and keep eu and efta doctor 
 can not she admit that brexit be exacerbate difficulty with recruit appropriate staff for the nhs across the whole of the uk scotland do not vote for brexit why be we have to pay the price 
 i suggest it be really time that the hon gentleman stop blame brexit he should in fact look to his snp colleague in holyrood and ensure that they make scotland ’s nhs a well place to work if he have listen to my answer he would have hear i say that since brexit we have recruit more than more doctor to the nhs in england in fact we be do so well that we recently recruit a doctor from the snp benches laughter 
 very droll i congratulate the minister on that 
 if not the nuffield trust perhaps bma scotland ’s chair dr iain kennedy will be good enough he recently say that the recruitment and retention of senior medical staff across the nhs in scotland remain a huge challenge with the health immigration surcharge cost increase announce by this government potentially far deter foreign worker from join the nhs give the recently announce nhs long term workforce plan what step be the minister take to ensure that scotland have the immigration we need for future recruitment and retention for our health service 
 we have the health and social care visa which support our health and social care service to recruit doctor nurse and other professional as well as social care staff help to boost those number the hon gentleman refer to the important nhs workforce long term plan which will increase the home grow staff in our health service that will give we more doctor more nurse and more allied health professional in our nhs over the next year 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it have be report that the home secretary plan to tighten the rule for those arrive on a health and care worker visa to block most from bring dependent with they yet another in a long list of her vendetta against child come to these isle what recent assessment have the secretary of state make of how that will impact international recruitment and capacity in our already struggle health and care service 
 i work closely with colleague in the home office to ensure that the health and care visa achieve the objective set out we be see real success in social care the recent skills for care workforce report show that we have more care worker in england we be do well on recruitment to social care 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of emergency department opt out testing for hiv 
 provisional nhs datum show that opt out testing have find around case of hiv during its year in total it have find more than case of blood bear disease include hepatitis b and c. 
 i welcome the minister ’s news on those figure he will have see the impact of opt out testing detect more people treat they early and save the nhs money however if we be to meet our target on no new infection we can not delay a further roll out of opt out testing will he commit the resource need to expand it in time for world aids day on   december 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for all his work on this important issue we will assess all the evidence and reply before the end of the year opt out testing be not the only thing we be do to drive down hiv transmission we have have a rise in the number of people get pre exposure prophylaxis and we have increase the number of people test with free testing kit hand out this year we be do everything we can to meet that visionary goal to stop hiv transmission in this country 
 i thank the minister for his answer to the question from   the hon member for darlington peter gibson it be clear that today hiv be not the death sentence that it once be because of the progress of medication and healthcare in prolong life and improve quality of life in northern ireland we be proactive as the minister will know on prep and young people we be do progressive thing through the department of health social services and public safety in the northern ireland assembly have the minister have the opportunity to discuss with the northern ireland assembly and the health department how we can work well together i always say we be well together in every case 
 the hon gentleman be completely correct he have be a fantastic champion on this issue the uk be lead the world on this issue hit the un ’s goal drive down transmission and reduce stigma people increasingly realise that as well as suppress the virus the treatment make it impossible to transmit transform the life of people with hiv 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the level of access to gps in rural community 
 we have increase funding for general practice by about a in real term since we have increase the workforce by about since alone with extra doctor and extra clinician go into general practice with the hard work of gps that have enable about more appointment than before the pandemic in rural area   we be go far with thing such as the target in house recruitment scheme and the element of the funding formula that favour rural area 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that answer but i have repeatedly raise with ministers the specific case of an innovative model from long crendon parish council to use land secure through plan gain to replace long crendon surgery which close during the pandemic there be an agreement for unity health to provide primary care service there but no money to physically build my right hon friend the secretary of state have advise consistently that the money be seek from the integrate care board but after prolong talk it have say that there be no money will the minister look at this innovative model again it be a great way of build rural gp provision in the future with a mind to his department make it happen 
 i will absolutely look closely at that specific case my hon friend have put a huge amount of work into long crendon as he know we be already change the national planning policy framework to enable more developer contribution to flow into such innovative project we have more gp practice than   we do in but we continue to look at way to   go far 
 what step he be take to help prevent cardiovascular disease 
 we be make the most significant public health intervention in a generation by create a smoke free generation to put that in context every cigarette a day increase the risk of stroke by we be also roll out free blood pressure check to people over in community pharmacy which will help to detect much early thousand more people live with high blood pressure 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer many commercial infant and toddler food be ultra process which set alarm bell ring as ultra process food be strongly associate with cardiovascular disease and of to year old be overweight or obese i strongly believe that parent be be mislead by company that put health claim on ultra process infant food when in fact the food be anything but healthy it be high in fat salt and sugar what step be the government take to address the disingenuous and grossly misleading marketing and labelling of commercial infant and toddler food and drink 
 as my hon friend know there be no agree definition for ultra high process food as a general principle i do not think we should be tax and ban thing smoking be an outlier we have to empower the patient and recognise the pressure from the cost of living we be also roll out anti obesity drug to give patient access to the most innovative drug as part of our wide response to the challenge   of obesity 
 what be the secretary of state ’s view of the worrying trend of increase cardiac relate death in the uk and around the world since which correlate closely with the roll out of the experimental mrna vaccine 
 it be always important to follow the science that be why at the g20 health ministers agree to look at the various research be do in multiple country particularly on long covid but also on the lesson from that period to ensure that research from that period be share internationally so we can learn good practice from other country as well as within the nhs 
 how many and what proportion of nhs radiotherapy linear accelerator linac machine will reach the end of their recommend lifespan in 
 the government and nhs england be commit to ensure cancer patient can receive high quality radiotherapy treatment between and £ be invest which enable the replacement or upgrade of around radiotherapy machine responsibility for investment in radiotherapy machine have sit with local system since april i look forward to meet the hon gentleman and the all party group for radiotherapy on this matter soon 
 i be very grateful to the minister for his reply and in particular for the offer of the meeting come soon radiotherapy uk say that for we to even meet average international standard we must commission additional new linear accelerator will he make the commitment to do that and in do so ensure that rural and remote community do not lose out by place some of those machine in new satellite centre such as the westmorland general hospital 
 the hon gentleman be hugely passionate on this subject as i say integrate care board be responsible for meet the health need of their individual population and that include capital allocation the spending review set aside £ in capital funding and since over £ have be invest in radiotherapy equipment but of course i want to see more investment in this important technology and the necessary upgrade across england i very much look forward to our meeting where we can discuss that far 
 what recent progress nhs england have make on implement its paediatric cancer strategy for london 
 follow professor sir mike richards ’s review it be now a national requirement for all paediatric cancer service to be co locate with a child ’s intensive care unit the current principal treatment centre for south london and the south east do not meet those   requirement nhs england have launch a reconfiguration process to identify a new location which include a public consultation the future centre will achieve world class outcome for child with cancer i would be very happy to meet member whose constituent may be affect to discuss that far 
 i be grateful to the minister for that offer because that would have be part of my question 
 then you do not need to ask it 
 but in true style mr speaker i be hop for bite at the cherry laughter 
 in my recent discussion with the management of st george ’s hospital concern about the consultation be that the specialist paediatric cancer surgical unit base at st george ’s may be lose if the current proposal go through that would potentially affect real outcome for a number of child will the minister have a look at that and explain to i whether he be concerned about the current scoring by the nhs 
 i thank my hon friend for his supplementary question while i can not pre empt the outcome of the consultation which close on   december i can assure he that there will be no sudden change in the way patient receive their care any move will of course be carefully plan with the full involvement of current team and clear information will be provide for parent and family nhs england will help as many experienced staff as possible to move to the future centre and i can reassure my hon friend that that centre will build on all the strength of the exist service and provide the good quality of care for patient 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of integrate care system 
 integrate care system and the organisation within they be make real progress in understand the health need of their population set out their plan develop the infrastructure need for collaboration and bring health and social care organisation together to serve the need of their community 
 nhs cheshire and merseyside integrate care board have instruct all nhs provider to make cut of in their service its instruction be not be discuss with member of the public members of parliament or indeed anyone and it be clear there be no mandate for this action give that the government have make great play of the nhs have more fund than ever before i be at a loss to understand why the cut be necessary so will the minister intervene to ensure that they do not happen on her watch 
 nhs england determine the funding receive by integrate care system that follow a formula which take into account the need of local population demographic deprivation and so on and ics be then able to direct resource as they be well   need across those population part of their value and part of the intention in set they up along with the organisation within they lie in that ability to understand the health need of local population and direct resource accordingly 
 integrate care system bring partner organisation together to improve health tackle inequality and enhance value for money detailed datum such as that produce by nhs digital be critical to their work but we learn this week that a&e wait time in wales have be under report for the last year do the minister agree that without accurate datum the labour government in cardiff be scupper the attempt of nhs wales to deliver well health outcome throughout wales 
 my hon friend have make a good point about the importance of transparency and accurate datum as she say just this week we learn that labour run nhs wales have be under report its a&e waiting time accord to the royal college of emergency medicine about patient be miss from the datum while we be work hard to improve service in the nhs in england the labour run nhs in wales be merely fudge the figure 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the whole purpose of integrate care system be to join up social care and nhs service in a well way we know for example that fracture liaison service keep people out of hospital but only of english nhs trust have they and despite the commitment give by the under secretary of state for health and social care the hon member for lewes maria caulfield to provide more nothing have happen and lord evans have walk back from her commitment i realise that i be push at an open door in direct this question to a minister whose leg be strap up but when will the government finally deliver for the back well bone campaign to help old people to survive and thrive 
 as the hon member have mention i have a broken ankle and i be take my responsibility as minister with oversight of urgent and emergency care very seriously in make use of several of those service as for my oversight of integrate care system what i be see be that they be make a very good job of enable the integration of service for instance we be see real success in the growth of virtual ward or hospital at home”—which bring together acute and community service to look after people in their home and help they to be discharge early the nhs have achieve its target of have hospital at home place ready for this winter 
 what step he be take to improve access to primary care service 
 what step he be take to improve access to primary care service 
 our primary care recovery plan support gp practice in address the am rush for appointment cut bureaucracy for gps and expand community pharmacy service we have recruit over additional primary care staff and have over more doctor work in general practice compare with before the pandemic 
 people be find it nigh on impossible to see their gp when they need to labour have pledge to guarantee face to face appointment when people want they by train more nhs gps but as my constituent point out to i under the tories a tier healthcare system be emerge where some be force to pay to be see quick while those that can not afford it be leave behind in agony why have the conservatives break their promise make in to deliver more gps and when will this gp crisis finally be resolve 
 there be a tier approach within the uk between what be go on with the nhs in wales and what be go on in england we have more appointment more staff over more doctor and over additional role and more tech with £ invest in deliver the digital telephony and the online booking system so that we can get patient to the right level of care with an appointment as part of our commitment to more appointment in primary care 
 in my constituency of aylesbury we have some absolutely fantastic gps and some brilliant service be deliver thank in part to many of the policy that have be introduce under this government i thank my right hon friend for continue with that however there be still challenge for constituent to get through to their gp surgery to make an appointment in the place he have just mention digital telephony could he update the house on the progress that be be make on roll out this technology to health centre to end the incredibly frustrating wait that people have sometimes be on hold on the phone for hour at a time 
 through that £ we have adoption from gp practice that want to take part in receive those fund and put digital telephony in place if they have not already do so this include call back which allow people to know where they be in the queue and link to online booking which allow we to maximise the additional role that we have put into primary care so that people can see the specialist that they need in my hon friend ’s own integrate care board appointment for july increase from last july to this july so more patient be be see more appointment be take place and more tech investment be go into the practice in his area 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 to listen to the secretary of state you would think it be all go so well so let i give he a reality check in tamworth last year only a of patient say it be easy to get through to their doctor on the phone in gp appointment be not conduct face to face and few than half of patient be offer a choice of   appointment the government be not listen to the people of tamworth perhaps the secretary of state would like to explain to the people of tamworth why after year of conservative government this be the case and well still adopt labour ’s plan to cut red tape incentivise continuity of care and bring back the family doctor 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman raise gps in tamworth the gp lead for the doctors association say that his plan for general practice fill they with despair and his proposal for gp nationalisation be mock by the nuffield trust of the respected think tank the reality be that this government be invest in more tech in primary care have recruit additional role into primary care and have over more doctor work in primary care than before the pandemic those be the fact his plan have be mock by respected think tank because he talk a good game on reform but we know that he will never stand up to the trade union 
 what step his department be take to provide a new health centre in thornbury 
 i be aware of the project to provide a new health centre in thornbury and of course my hon friend ’s tireless work to champion it my official be work closely with colleague in nhs england and the integrated care board to help progress the scheme i understand that he meet lord markham early today to discuss imminent funding for the development of the business case and we will be in touch in the come day 
 i be grateful to ministers for take the time to meet i this morning to discuss the £ bid for a new health centre in thornbury which be a grow town that desperately need this new facility the health centre will provide more gp appointment more mental health support and crucially more out patient service can the minister update i on the timescale for the announcement on funding for thornbury health centre so we can get this crucial facility open as quickly as possible 
 my hon friend make a powerful case and i know how passionate and determine he be to deliver the new thornbury health centre i can assure he that my official will continue to work closely with he with the integrate care board and with the nhs to progress the scheme we will be in contact in the come day follow the meeting he have early today with lord markham 
 what recent step his department have take to increase the availability of nhs dentistry service 
 we be make nhs work more attractive to dentist we have start to reform the contract and create more uda band we have introduce the minimum uda value to help sustain   practice where value be low and we be allow dentist to deliver of their uda we be also reform the rule to empower both clinician and commissioner for example by enable therapist to start deliver medicine such as anaesthetic we be rebase contract value where they be underperform and we be grow the workforce with a record commitment to grow the number of dentist in training by 40%—a commitment never make by the opposition 
 uda rate the sum pay to nhs dentist for each unit of dental work undertake have long be deem insufficient be base on figure from there be huge difference in rate between practice with some receive less than the nhs charge patient for the service a recent uplift be base on the government estimate of a rise in cost a figure that local dentist tell i be more like to compound the loss that nhs dentist be already make what step be my hon friend take to reform the uda system and to stop the flow of dentist leave the nhs 
 that be exactly why we have start to reform the uda system as well as the introduction of the ever minimum uda rate which will help constituency such as my hon friend ’s we have change the rule nationally so that commissioner can take udas away from dentist who be underperform and give they to those who want to do more nhs work as a result nearly a quarter more nhs dentistry be be do than a year ago 
 what step he be take to increase access to nhs dentistry service in the south west 
 in addition to the step we be take to drive up nhs dentistry everywhere we be go far in the south west with nhse commission additional urgent appointment there be several extra appointment every week 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer it be not sustainable for the people of west dorset who have need dental care for some time when there be a £ national underspend in the dental care budget the nhs and local dentist tell i that the incompatibility often relate to the national dental care contract which be up for review when do the minister expect a solution to be find to this contract difficulty will he meet i and the nhs dorset icb to discuss the matter in detail to find a solution 
 absolutely i be keen to continue the conversation with my hon friend these issue be exactly why this summer we legislate to allow rebasing and to end the inflexibility he describe we be also in the process of ringfence local dental budget because we do not want to see underspend we want to see that money go to nhs dentistry 
 what step he be take to improve wait time for cancer treatment 
 what step he be take to improve wait time for cancer treatment 
 improve cancer treatment waiting time be a top priority for this government and it be a key focus of our elective recovery plan back by an additional £ in revenue funding across the spending review period in august cancer treatment activity for treatment stand at of pre pandemic level on a per working day basis and the day backlog have fall since its peak in the pandemic 
 pancreatic cancer be the deadly type of common cancer kill more than half of those diagnose in england within month i know the pain of lose close friend and family to pancreatic cancer and how important it be that people be diagnose and treat quickly under this government we have see nhs waiting list go up not down what be the minister do to ensure that people with pancreatic cancer be see diagnose and treat quickly 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and of course i recognise the importance of early diagnosis and treatment cancer check be up by a quarter on pre pandemic level and in august more than of patient start their cancer treatment within a month of a decision to treat we have open additional community diagnostic centre and an additional surgical hub but i accept of course that there be much more that we need to do 
 the minister have again be refer to pre pandemic level minister have a tendency to blame covid for increase waiting time include in respect of cancer i presume they be aware that the number of cancer patient not get care on time rise in every year since the conservatives come to power before the pandemic how can the government defend that dreadful record 
 we be continue to support nhs england in increase cancer treatment capacity as i say i recognise the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of cancer nhs england have instruct integrate care board to increase and prioritise the diagnostic and treatment capacity for cancer as of the middle of this year we have additional surgical hub that be currently operational and additional community diagnostic centre which have deliver more than additional test since july but we know and recognise that we need to do more 
 member will know from my entry in the register of members financial interests that i be an nhs consultant and a member of the british medical association i congratulate the minister on the work he be do to reduce waiting list but bma strike have lead to the loss of more than appointment   have delay the reporting of scan include scan for cancer and have disrupt people ’s chronic long term condition treatment what be he do to ensure that there be no further strike what talk be he have on minimum service level to expand the provision if further strike do take place 
 i thank my hon friend for her question which be well direct at the bma however she be right to suggest that we be take action on minimum service level legislation we recognise that industrial action mean that service be under increase pressure with appointment and treatment be cancel because of the strike the nhs be take action prioritise urgent and cancer care and will of course continue to do so it will do its good to maintain appointment and elective procedure wherever possible but she be right to say that these strike and the action of the bma be have a devastating impact on patient 
 my constituent elaine lynch be diagnose with stage lung cancer in september the drug she need enhertu be available free on the nhs to treat breast cancer but not lung cancer so it be cost my constituent £ a month to get the treatment without which she will die the public petition on this matter have receive more than signature so it be very much in the public interest as the company daiichi sankyo do not offer the drug on compassionate ground will the minister meet i to see how we can make this drug available for elaine as soon as possible because this be literally a matter of life or death 
 i have huge sympathy and empathy with the case that my hon friend raise the national institute for health and care excellence be rightly independent and strict and robust process be in place on drug repurposing and clinical trial nevertheless i would of course be happy to meet he to see what can be do 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i welcome opposition front bench members to their new role as there have be change since we last meet since then we have launch a new £ fund to speed up the adoption of tech across the nhs even when local pilot prove their effectiveness it often take too long for those innovation to be roll out nationally this fund can change that give integrate care system across england the chance to invest in tech that be prove to improve care for instance in detect cancer soon these investment will be make this financial year get patient care fast we be also make more than more medical school place available for university from next september accelerate a commitment that we make in the nhs long term workforce plan and deliver more doctor to area that need they most 
 this government be listen to patient voice too particularly on the importance of biological sex in healthcare that be why follow a consultation later   this year we will amend the nhs constitution to make sure that we respect the privacy dignity and safety of all patient the prime minister have also unveil plan to introduce a new law to prevent child who turn this year from ever legally be sell cigarette create the smokefree generation last week my department launch an expedite consultation to crack down on youth vaping 
 i thank the secretary of state for his statement particularly what he say about tech on dental provision i recently meet with dr khan of westbury park dental practice in my constituency to discuss access to nhs dentistry which be become more difficult for many of my constituent i welcome the plan we have to increase the number of dentist and i reiterate my support for a dental school at keele university but those plan will take time in the short term there be a huge backlog of overseas clinician wait to take the registration exam so that they can practise here what step be the secretary of state take to expedite this 
 he be right that we be take both long term and short term action a key part of the long term workforce plan be to boost the number of dentist be train in the more immediate term early this year we make legislative change that give the general dental council the flexibility to improve the way professional be register give more flexibility in term of the skill mix and for example triple the number of people sit part this year so that more overseas professional can be recognise and qualified to practise in the uk 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in mid bedfordshire last year children—[interruption i do not know why government member be laugh perhaps they should listen as it be not our party that have let down the people of mid bedfordshire last year child in mid bedfordshire have tooth remove due to tooth decay some patient be force into a&e for the same reason and people across the region can not get access to an nhs dentist instead of laugh the government might like to adopt labour ’s plan to provide extra dentistry appointment every year 
 since we have have more dentist a quarter more appointment and as we have just touch on increase flexibility in regulation and boost overseas recruitment it be strike that area of the country that the shadow secretary of state do not want to talk about be wales which have a record of what a labour government will deliver indeed the leader of the opposition say that he want wales to be the blueprint for what the nhs would be in england there this week we have see a fiddling of the figure on health even without that fiddling we know people be twice as likely to be on a waiting list in wales as in england 
 order of we have get to sit down and it be not go to be i i let you have a good crack at the beginning secretary of state your opening statement take quite a long time which i do not mind i do not mind your have a go about wales but i be certainly   not go to open up a debate between the government and opposition front benches topical question be for back benchers and about short question with short answer i want it to be keep that way so please understand that there must be too many by election because member be get carry away 
 it be not just mid bedfordshire across the country the no.1 reason child aged to be admit to hospital be tooth decay give that will the secretary of state at least adopt the modest measure that labour have propose to introduce national supervise tooth brushing for small child low cost high impact to keep their tooth clean and keep child out of hospital 
 we be reform the nhs workforce more fundamentally look at how we expand the role that dental hygienist and dental therapist can perform we be look at how we can boost training which be why we have make the commitment for more dentist in the long term workforce plan back by £ how do that help it increase the number of dentist be train and we have a quarter more activity compare with last year 
 can the minister confirm that the £ capital investment to transform the shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust acute hospital be on track through the nhs approval process with its outline business case to enable a full business case to be conclude in the come month so that construction can commence during this financial year 
 my right hon friend have long champion this cause i hope it be good news that i be able to confirm that enable work have recently be approve for the shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust hospital transformation programme and be expect to commence this financial year i can also confirm that funding have be provide for the development of the full business case and be expect to be submit in the come month 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 new research by unicef uk have make clear how badly the cost of living crisis have hit the mental health of family with young child rise price and service gutte by austerity have leave of parent feel overwhelmed anxious unsupported and lonely all or most of the time what representation have the secretary of state make to his cabinet colleague ahead of the upcoming autumn statement to support family and to improve health outcome 
 that show just how divorced the snp line of questioning be from the reality of funding the funding for mental health be £ more this year than it be year ago we be fund mental health crisis cafés and we have a programme of mental health support team be roll out in our school all of which be subject to barnett consequential on which the scottish government receive money this government   be commit to invest in mental health that be what we be do the question for the scottish government be why they be not get the same result that we be 
 most supermarket practise place base and price promotion mainly on ultra process food food that play a key part in feed the obesity crisis how can the government well ensure that supermarket promote affordable unprocessed and sustainable food not food high in fat sugar and salt and importantly how can we ensure that supermarket comply with the regulation 
 we have already bring in restriction on the place that unhealthy food can be sell to stop pester power that be on top of other measure that we be take on obesity such as the sugar tax calorie labelling the extra money for school sport and the extra facility for young people it be a serious issue and on which we be take urgent action 
 i be go to ask a question about the shocking statistic of people on the waiting list at norfolk and norwich university hospital but so poor be the secretary of state ’s response to the question of my hon friend   the member for ilford north wes streeting   about the dental desert that i will tell he a quick story ukrainian refugee who come to my constituency be travel back to war tear ukraine to have their tooth see to because there be a well dental service there than in norfolk and norwich what do he have to say to that 
 as i have say we have more dentist now than when we come to power there be also a quarter more dental activity this year compare with last year i understand why the hon gentleman do not want to talk about the investment that we be make on the elective programme in norfolk because it include fund for new hospital in norfolk through our new hospital programme and significant funding into diagnostic capacity with a number of diagnostic centre be open in norfolk which he do not want to mention 
 my local hospital north tees be tired date and well beyond its life expectancy with operate theatre too small to meet modern requirement so i be hugely disappoint that my nhs trust fail even to apply for government funding that could have build a new state of the art surgical hub on the site will my hon friend work with i to ensure that the people of stockton get the healthcare facility that they need 
 we will always work with my hon friend and the trust on capital improvement where need but i be pleased to note that the trust have be allocate significant investment from national programme in recent year which my hon friend fight hard for include £ from our community diagnostic centre programme which will provide vital testing to local resident close to home and £ from our a&e upgrade programme we will of course continue   to work closely with colleague in the nhs and the local trust to continue deliver for the people of stockton 
 year on from the francis report the national guardian ’s office for freedom to speak up report that last year there be case where whistleblower be not listen to and experience detriment if we add that to complaint with reach the parliamentary and health service ombudsman we can see that the complaint system across the nhs be defensive and dangerous will the secretary of state review the nhs complaint system and embe a listen and learn culture and early intervention 
 i discuss this with henrietta hughes the patient safety champion just yesterday as part of the sprint that we have commission in the department in response to martha ’s rule we be do considerable work with nhse colleague on how we well respond to the concern of patient whether it be through the work on martha ’s rule or the complaint process and a significant amount of work be ongoing as part of that 
 the secretary of state have see for himself the dilapidated steam generator at kettering general hospital the new £ net energy plant design to replace they face challenge from rise cost and new design requirement will he ensure that the final business case approval process for this new power plant be complete as soon as possible so that spade can hit the ground on time in spring 
 yes i will i pay tribute to my hon friend for the way he have champion this issue i have visit the hospital i have see it for myself as he will be aware the full business case be receive by the department this morning while the cost have increase it be still within the wide funding envelope for the scheme on that site and i will do everything i can to expedite the process as he ask 
 in recent month there be a concerted campaign from the public to prevent the closure of park view medical centre in liverpool which be subsequently close by the merseyside and cheshire integrate care board not long after the conclusion of the campaign during which member of the public be turn up to board meeting the icb announce that of its meeting would now be hold exclusively in private i for do not believe that that be a coincidence what would the secretary of state ’s advice be to merseyside and cheshire icb on transparency and accountability and be it not time we look at strengthen the guidance 
 the hon lady raise an important point i be not aware of that decision by the local icb as a principle i think we can agree across the house that great transparency on such meeting be important so i will follow up on that the government be make significant investment into merseyside both alder hey children ’s hospital and the royal liverpool university hospital have be rebuild at significant cost as part of this government ’s commitment to invest in the nhs estate in that area 
 will the secretary of state join i in thank the outgoing chief executive of the south western ambulance service will warrender he come to join the service in the middle of covid during very difficult time and do a lot of work to help and that come after his year of public service in the royal navy 
 i be happy to join my hon friend indeed i be sure the whole house be happy to pay tribute to the exemplary public service mr warrender have provide both in the royal navy and with the ambulance trust and to wish he a very happy retirement 
 immunocompromise patient be face their winter without adequate protection from covid despite a new study show that they now comprise approximately of all covid hospitalisation intensive care unit admission and death in the last few day some hospital have be give guidance to their staff that they should not even test for covid unless they be work on specific ward after and a half year what be the government go to do to put an end to this appalling situation where some of the most clinically vulnerable patient be scared of access the healthcare they need for fear it could literally be a death sentence 
 during the pandemic as the hon lady know the government prioritise the clinically extremely vulnerable and significant investment go in there we follow the guidance from the uk health security agency about the right level of infection control more widely we need to look at what medicine be    effective if it relate to immunosuppressant there be a big debate in summer about that issue and we keep the science under active review 
 i thank ministers for their early helpful reply about nhs dentistry but i be afraid the situation in weston super mare remain extremely worrying local resident regularly say there be not a single local dentist accept new adult nhs patient and many practice have actively reduce nhs work since the pandemic i have push both nhs england and the local integrate care board but all we have so far be powerpoint presentation rather than bookable appointment what hope can the secretary of state offer to westonians who have pay their taxis but be not get any nhs dentistry in exchange 
 my hon friend be right the amount of nhs dentistry be deliver in his icb have go up in the last year but we want to go far the nhs have recently commission additional child ’s orthodontic capacity within his icb but through the action we be go to take we will go far 
 i call judith cummins with the final question 
 have fracture liaison service coverage in england would prevent an estimate fracture include hip fracture over year will the minister finally commit to fls coverage across england 
 in the interest of brevity i will actively look at that issue and write to the hon lady about it 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make a statement on the core school budget allocation 
 as the government confirm in a write ministerial statement yesterday the department for education have correct an error in the notional allocation of the school national funding formula for those allocation be originally publish and notify to the house on   july however the department have subsequently uncover an error make by official during the initial calculation of the national funding formula specifically there be an error processing forecast pupil number which mean that the overall cost of the core school budget for would be great than allocate the department therefore issue new national funding formula allocation on   october   to rectify that error as quickly as possible 
 the permanent secretary have apologise for the error in write to both the chair of the education committee and the secretary of state the secretary of state have instruct the permanent secretary to conduct a formal review of the quality assurance process surround the calculation and quality assurance of the nff with external and independent scrutiny peter wyman cbe the chair of the institute of charted accountants in england and wales will lead the review improvement have already be identify to ensure that similar mistake be not make 
 i would like to reassure the house that the error do not affect the overall level of school funding which remain at £ for the government continue to deliver in full the core school budget which include funding for mainstream school and for high need as i say it will remain at £ in its high ever level in real term and of course in cash term that be a percentage increase of compare with the current year of through the school national funding formula average funding be £ per primary school pupil and £ per secondary school pupil in up from £ and £ respectively in 
 school have not yet receive their funding so the correction of this error do not mean adjust any funding that school have already receive likewise the error will not impact on the publication of a dedicated school grant in december or on when school will receive their final allocation for the high need national funding formula allocation which fund provision for child with complex special educational need and disability be also unaffected by the error as be other funding stream outside the nff include the teacher pay additional grant announce in the summer 
 i also clarify that the recalculation of the nff for do not affect the affordability of the teacher pay award there have be no change to the funding that be promise as part of the pay settlement in july and which the union agree mean that the pay award be properly fund the government recognise that the   correction of the nff error will be difficult for local authority and frustrating for some school leader which be why the department have rectify the error as quickly as possible 
 order the minister have take nearly minute i hope that he be come to the end of his remark 
 this be my final sentence mr speaker 
 the department be work closely with school stakeholder include union to communicate this change and support school and local authority 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker since the house return from the summer recess minister have be force to come here twice to explain how this government leave school building in such a parlous state that many be now at risk of collapse and now to explain that the conservatives be take £ out of school budget allocation for next year it be shambolic it be chaotic and our child deserve a lot well i be glad that minister have listen to labour ’s call for an independent investigation but what be the timeline for this review how will the review be report to the house and how will member have a chance to scrutinise its finding 
 we need to know much more too we need to know why when the mistake be identify in september it be not until after the conservative party conference in october that headteacher be finally notify what support will school now receive to ensure that child ’s education do not suffer as a result of conservative incompetence rather than blame official will the secretary of state wherever she be today finally take some responsibility 
 we all know that mistake happen but this be not a off this be part of a much big pattern of conservative mismanagement right across the department and right across government for long year and it be our child who be pay the price it be conservative mismanagement that bring we the raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete crisis in our school that keep child at home as ministers fail to resolve industrial action for month on end and that be now see record number of teacher leave the profession attainment gap widen and standard fall it will fall to the next labour government to reset the relationship between government family and school to show once again that it be labour that be the party of high and rise standard in our school 
 the hon lady refer to raac we take the only decision that any responsible government would take when the evidence change on raac in school building that surveyor have previously assess as not in a critical condition and we discover it be not safe for pupil to stay in those school there be school so far confirm with raac which we have publish detail of and we be take urgent action to make sure that no child or member of staff in our school building will be at risk from this reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete which by the way have be around through successive administration both labour and conservative since the 1950 and 1960 
 the hon lady refer to £ be take out of the school budget no money have be take out of the school budget it be £ next year and it will remain at £ what would be irresponsible would be to increase funding for school by solely as a result of an error by official that be not how government spending system work it have to go through the proper value for money procedure and that be how we always conduct our allocation of taxpayer money 
 the hon lady talk about standard in school we be rise in the international table we be in the world for the reading ability of year old accord to the recent progress in international reading literacy study or pirls of pupil of that age we be rise in timss the trend in mathematics and science study and we be rise in pisa the programme for international student assessment that be in direct contrast with what happen under the last labour government when we be fall in those pisa table 
 we come to the chair of the select committee 
 i be grateful for the apology and the letter that the select committee receive on this issue which we have publish today clearly it be deeply unfortunate that this error take place it be a result of a complex and very difficult to understand funding system that provide school with a lack of transparency as to how their funding work in the long run 
 we be elect on a manifesto to deliver a fair national funding formula there be plan in place to legislate for the direct funding of school while i welcome my right hon friend ’s confirmation that this do not in any way affect the high need block or take money out of the overall school budget can he update the house on plan to deliver that direct funding formula which along with multi year funding settlement the select committee and the sector have be call for over many year 
 yes it be unfortunate for which official and ministers have apologise it be frustrating particularly for local authority that have to conduct their calculation it be an error base on the coding of the pupil number 
 my hon friend mention move to the direct funding formula that be the intention of the government and the late edition of the national funding formula and high need technical briefing do say that we want ultimately to get to direct funding many local authority be move their local funding formula ever close to the approach take in the national funding formula 
 i see a tweet to the minister early this morning say that man ’s error be another man ’s total cock up i do not know whether that be technical language mr speaker the fact of the matter be that he be the long serve minister in any department in any government for many year and on his watch we have see the demoralisation of the education sector in our country with good people leave it be the gibb factor why do he not resign and talk to people 
 if i may say so mr speaker that be an extraordinary outburst today we have the high number of teacher in the profession some which be by the way more than when we come to office in in labour run wales we be not see that rise in the number of teacher 
 naturally this error be very disappointing but i welcome that the department have rectify it speedily what step be my right hon friend take to work with school stakeholder to communicate the change and to support school and local authority 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right it be unfortunate as a minister when official gather outside my office to tell i great news about an error that have be make my instinct be always to find out what the error be and rectify it as quickly as possible that take about week compare with the normal week to calculate the nff and we then publish the figure as rapidly as possible that be the approach that the department and i have take 
 early this year the sutton trust report that half of school leader say that they have already be force to cut back on trip and outing that include cultural trip to concert and play which often have a profound effect on young people who would not otherwise be able to attend those event the average secondary school be now be tell that it will have around £ less to spend than be announce in july whatever the minister say those school will have plan on the basis of that money i be concerned that even few young people will now be able to access the benefit of cultural trip what be the minister do to make sure that young people in state fund school still have access to cultural experience that enrich their education 
 the figure publish in july be indicative figure they be use by local authority once the october census come out with the pupil number they then apply their local formula to those figure that be the allocation that school use for their budgeting and that happen around december 
 over the period between and school funding have increase by so there have be a very significant increase i agree with the hon member about the importance of cultural activity in school which be why we have a cultural education plan that be be work on at the moment 
 reason why this minister have be in his post so long be that successive prime ministers have judge he to be rather good at his job for the benefit of the house can he confirm that the civil servant who discover the mistake make it know to ministers at the possible opportunity and that ministers make it know to the public at the possible opportunity do that not reflect credit on our parliamentary democratic system 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his kind comment he be absolutely right as soon as we know about the error i want to make sure that we be do everything we could to rectify it and find a solution to the problem that official and the department   have cause that be my approach and that be why we recalculate the whole of the national funding formula notional allocation as soon as we could and publish that detail on   october 
 for far too long the department for education have be plague by a litany of failure that have have a devastating impact on child their parent and teacher we have have the mutant algorithm and the raac roof we have a crisis in our send system and now we have a bit of good old fashioned incompetence do the minister agree that it be high time that the secretary of state offer an apology to the british public for all this or do he think that in her word we should thank she for do a flip good job 
 the last flippant comment be not necessary these be all serious issue issue such as raac have be around in our school system since the 1950 and 1960 when we discover new fact and new evidence we take swift action there will always be almost no notice when we have evidence we can not just sit on it until a more convenient time to announce it we have to announce it straightaway every school with confirm raac have a caseworker allocate to make sure that we be keep child safe and keep they in face to face education so far we have identify school with raac and in the vast majority of those all but school all the child be still in face to face education 
 in term of special educational need we publish a green paper and an implementation plan to improve the experience of parent and child with special educational need in our school system 
 i thank my right hon friend for the update clearly when formula such as this be be use it be important that they be test to see the result before those be issue to the school and other people be involve will he confirm that the position be that even after this error have be correct all school in this country will have enough money to fund the teacher pay award agree by the government 
 my hon friend be right i have to say that my experience of this particular team in the department be that they be of the good team i have deal with this be an error make by official they have own up to it and we have correct it it do not affect school funding at all and it relate to the next financial year it certainly do not affect this financial year and the funding of the pay award incidentally it be the high pay award for year the pay award for teacher be fully fund with an extra teacher pay grant of £ this year and £ next year it be totally unaffected by this error 
 cambridgeshire school be some of the lowest fund in england and they will now receive £ less than they expect the minister will know that local authority official    and school will now have to spend time recalculate their budget what will he do to compensate they for the time they be spend on that 
 the situation be unfortunate for local authority which will have be spend time calculate their school budget on a local authority basis that be why we want to get the recalculation of the figure do as soon as possible and out to local authority cambridgeshire be fund in the way it be because we base funding on the level of deprivation in our community we have target a great proportion of the school national funding formula towards deprive pupil than ever before in total about £ or of the formula will be allocate accord to deprivation factor in if an area have few child from disadvantaged background than other area that will of course be reflect in its overall ranking for local authority funding 
 last week i visit meadgate primary school which be of the many good and outstanding school in my constituency i be sure the minister will recall precisely how many good and outstanding school there be today compare with year ago meadgate primary school be part of an academy trust of school and across the school this situation could account for a £ difference between what they have calculate they might expect and what they will receive 
 that be obviously concern but also concern be the number of child now come in who would have have an education health and care plan do when they be at pre school but do not get because of the pandemic and now face delay give that high need funding have double will the minister raise this backlog in assessment with the child ’s minister my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston to try to make sure that our primary school be get the support they need today for those child with send 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend for the great work that she do as child ’s minister in the department for education she be right that the proportion of school judge good or outstanding have increase in it be and today that figure be we be not happy with that our focus be on the remain every local school in our country should be a good or outstanding school 
 my right hon friend make an important point about education health and care plan she be right that the funding of the high need budget have increase considerably over the past few year and i will raise the issue of the backlog in ehcp with my hon friend the child ’s minister i should say that we be build significant number of new free special school so that there be more place available for child with severe special educational need 
 we know that a child grow up in an area of deprivation be on average likely to do less well through our school system i take the point that the minister make about extra funding for deprivation but will he accept from i that we know that money make a difference when will this government get a grip on the problem of deprivation 
 deprivation and disadvantaged child have be the core drive force of all our reform since we be spend record amount of money on school funding—£59.6 be the high ever in cash term in real term and in real term per pupil before the pandemic we have close the attainment gap between disadvantaged child and other child by in primary school and by in secondary school that have be undo by the pandemic but we be determined to close that gap again all the reform that lead to that closure be still in place and we be confident particularly with the £ of recovery funding and the tutoring programme that we will close that gap once again 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s answer today and i thank he for his leadership and his ownership of this issue which be not his fault he have approach it in exactly the right manner as my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis   say i welcome that we be continue to deliver the core school budget in full not just for mainstream school but for high need will my right hon friend the minister set out what the percentage increase for those area will be in compare with this year 
 on the increase in funding last year and this year funding be increase by £ in and by £ in when we combine that with the £ increase we have between and that be a increase in cash term over that period 
 i write to the secretary of state at the beginning of august ask for a meeting to discuss a series of special educational need fund issue in harrow the minister will be aware that special educational need be of the many pressure on school budget across the country they certainly be a significant issue in harrow can he explain specifically how much school in harrow will now not receive compare with what they have expect to receive will he encourage the secretary of state to respond to my letter and to do so with generosity 
 i say to the hon member that no funding be be reduce in harrow all area will be receive significant increase in school funding the error be about the allocation figure the notional figure for and those have be correct on special educational need we have increase special educational need fund significantly over the past several year because of the pressure that local authority be face with increase number of ehcp we be take a number of measure to help address that and i will of course ensure that the hon member have his meeting in the department as soon as possible 
 this be yet another error and case of incompetence under this government the average primary school be expect to be more than £ bad off next academic year and the average secondary school £ bad off than   under the july publication how will the government help headteacher in slough and across the country deal with the extra stress and pressure on account of this error especially when they have to make difficult decision on staffing and additional support for those pupil who need it 
 the actual allocation to school happen in december each year in the normal way so this situation will not affect the figure that local authority have inform school they will be receive those be base on the october census of pupil number and the application of the local formula   we then fund the local authority on the basis of the national funding the record funding of £ equate to an average of £ per primary school pupil and £ per secondary school pupil.[official report   october vol c. 3mc 
 the minister ’s argument in a nutshell be you do not have the money so you ’ve not lose it but the point be that local authority receive the notional funding allocation and be begin to plan base on that figure give by the government in place such as stockport tameside and manchester the figure that be go to be withdraw from those area be not insubstantial i politely say to the minister that his argument be incoherent i will grade he d minus and his math be appalling i will grade he u. can i suggest he go into detention and fix this matter because school in tameside stockport and manchester desperately need that cash 
 the funding allocate for local authority be ringfence this be an allocation and calculation issue it be not that they have receive the money and we correct it as soon as the error be make any labour members in the same position would have react in precisely the same way that i have 
 this blunder be go to cost school in york dear we be already in the bottom in the country for school funding and in the bottom for high need i have a meeting with parent on friday night and of they be in tear and on their knee about the sen funding the formula be just not work in area where there be low funding will the minister bring forward the fair funding formula to ensure that child in my constituency with send have fair funding allocate to they 
 i understand the hon lady ’s point and i share the concern of parent with child with special educational need and disability we do want to make sure that local authority be properly fund for child with those special need which be why we have increase funding for high need very significantly over the past few year over £ be now allocate to local authority for those child if we look at the national funding formula we see that of the formula—£4.4 be on the basis of deprivation factor and be allocate on the basis of additional need these be very significant sum both in the national funding formula for mainstream school and the extra money we be give to local authority for high need 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to amend the scotland act to grant legislative competence for employment matter to the scottish parliament 
 at the outset i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a member of the snp trade union group and in relation to my own membership of unite 
 as this parliament begin to draw to a close many of we be leave wonder why the much vaunted employment bill never materialise after all we be promise that brexit now support enthusiastically by the tories and labour would not lead to a diminution of worker right but would instead be an opportunity to enhance employment protection despite countless fire and rehire incidence many of which have be reference by my hon friend   the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands ever more maternity discrimination and an assault on trade union right by a tory government act like thatcher on steroid the very opposite have happen 
 the fact be that employment right under this british government be under attack far from deal with workplace discrimination on issue such as the menopause we have a government actively and increasingly hinder the right of worker with their strikes minimum service levels act it be a piece of legislation that even the international labour organisation have express concern about as the world of work continue to evolve and we seek to build back well from the pandemic brexit britain be now on a steep decline when it come to employment protection however this be an issue that extend far beyond the immediate right available to worker because it be fundamentally a matter of equality the way in which we value worker in our legislative framework set the expectation of what we should expect workplace culture to emulate and legislation must help build the foundation of a fair and equal labour market 
 let we take for example some evidence publish in july by the charity pregnant then screw of parent survey it be find that of woman lose their job through redundancy sack or feeling force to leave due to a flexible working request be deny the charity estimate that if scale up this would mean that over pregnant woman or mother could be sack or make redundant every year under represent group continue to face significant inequality in the workplace and i and many of my colleague have stand here time and again call for the enshrinement of flexible working as a day right as well as mandatory gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting 
 give the power these be just some of the example of workplace injustice that the scottish government would seek to remedy however it be an inescapable truth that westminster ’s crackdown on worker right not to mention the assault on union have see the uk ’s global rating on worker right fall indeed the uk have drop in the international trade union confederation ’s annual report on worker right from a   rating of which be for country where ituc consider there to be regular violation of right to which be for those where it say there be systemic violation sadly that put the british government on a par with the like of qatar and oman the latter be an absolute monarchy where criticism of the government be illegal if that be the message the government want to send out as brexit britain it be certainly a bold move but ituc ’s recent report be damn it say 
 in the united kingdom union busting attempt to introduce legislation curtail the right to strike and protest and violation of collective bargaining agreement have become systematic and lead to the country ’s rating drop from to 
 perhaps it be no wonder that the devolution of employment law be back by some of the big trade union in these island include the scottish trades union congress and the tuc itself only recently the trades union congress pass a motion call for the repeal of current anti union legislation and the devolution of employment law to scotland roz foyer the outstanding stuc general secretary be on record as say 
 it ’ clear especially to any incoming uk labour government that the voice of worker across the country now support the scottish parliament have full autonomy over labour and employment right 
 that pose a question for our colleague on the labour benches why not scotland in his rush to out union jack even the secretary of state for scotland   the hon member for edinburgh south ian murray   have say no nay never no further devolution today ’s vote be also a test for   the new hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks it pose a question for he when the division bell re shortly whose side be he on be he on the side of the scottish trades union congress or the side of his westminster boss in camden 
 on block the devolution of employment law   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner   have come in for criticism from michael sharpe a former general secretary of scottish labour who have say that rule out the devolution of employment law be a huge blow and 
 a slap in the face to the trade union who have campaign for this for many year 
 since take over the rein as labour leader the leader of the opposition have move ever more to the right distance himself from trade union and ironically decide to go on strike from attend picket line himself we have even have the spectre of shadow ministers be sack simply for have the temerity to support worker on a picket line 
 the blunt reality be that scotland be already miss out on europe ’s enhancement of worker right thank to a brexit we do not vote for and do not support post pandemic we could have be take opportunity to empower trade union increase statutory sick pay ban fire and rehire and do so much more for worker but it appear once more that the labour party and the conservatives have land in the exact same space 
 it be clear to we that a westminster government of whatever colour do not have worker right as a priority it be only by give scotland power over employment law that the scottish government can entrench worker right in law and build a fair work society for all our citizen we can and we must do so much well for our   worker and our trade union if westminster be not up to the job holyrood will take this on and work people will be well off as a result it be for that reason and with the support of our trade union colleague that i commend this motion to the house
