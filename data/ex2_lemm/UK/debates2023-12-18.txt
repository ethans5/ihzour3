 as a conservative mp from a working class background i believe fundamentally in aspiration hard work and fairness do my hon friend agree that the benefit system must be a safety net for those in genuine need and that those people who can work should work 
 i thank my hon friend because he speak perfectly for those of we across the conservative family work be positive a force for good and the system should be fair to the taxpayer and the claimant with check and balance it be right that on average those in work be some £ well off per year universal credit be introduce and far roll out because it be a welfare system that make work pay 
 skill be clearly key to support the long term unemployed to find work buckinghamshire council be launch a series of skill bootcamp target at the long term unemployed for example bootcamp will provide construction skill include a construction skill certification scheme card plus support to reach self employment and wraparound support on how to set up a company will my hon friend congratulate buckinghamshire council on that initiative and say what more she can do to ensure that those who need to upgrade their skill base be able to do so 
 i be delighted to congratulate not only buckinghamshire council but my hon friend on the fantastic work he do in his constituency upskille jobseeker particularly in area such as construction where we need more domestic worker be vital the department for work and pensions continue to support individual into employment through back to work programme such as the restart scheme which provide tailor training programme and sector base work academy programme similar to those mention by my hon friend it offer training work placement and guarantee job interview and i be committed to explore what more can be do 
 early today i meet everyone ’s environment and we talk about how we can ensure that people with disability benefit from some of the new green job and training that be come on board i know that the minister ’s predecessor as minister for employment sit on the green job delivery group so will she say what involvement she have have with that group to date 
 i have already have a meeting of the inter ministerial group on green job and i have meet many of those from across the disability sector when i be a minister in the department for environment food and rural affairs i sit on the inter ministerial group for green job and for disability access it be vital that we use everybody ’s talent because work be a force for good someone ’s disability should not stop their talent shin and i will not let it do so 
 here ’ somebody who will shine i call jim shannon 
 thank you very much mr speaker i thank the minister for that response many of the long term unemployed have disability some of they can not work but some wish to work and they need flexible hour because they do not know the time and day that they will not be able to work and will be off what can be do to help those who have disability get into work so long as their health can dictate when 
 we have a whole suite in the back to work plan and the investment of £ so that we can work with individual people to tailor plan for they it be vital that if for example someone ’s health condition restrict when they can travel on public transport we work with they to ensure that they can travel after rush hour they might need a taxi or some other tailor support that can be do and it will be do 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the employment rate forecast in the office for budget responsibility ’s economic and fiscal outlook publish in november 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the employment rate forecast in the office for budget responsibility ’s economic and fiscal outlook publish in november 
 the government be commit to increase employment payroll employment be at a near record high of which be up on the pre pandemic level the office for budget responsibility forecast that our back to work plan will see more people in work over the forecast period 
 the obr reveal at the time of the autumn statement that after more than year of this conservative government more people will be on health and disability benefit by far from it be a back to work budget the secretary of state know that that be not anything like the truth and that the tories be fail the employment market in this country 
 i can not agree with that in fact i point the hon gentleman to the figure of which be the number of people few the obr forecast will be on those very long term sickness and disability benefit because of the reform that this government be bring in 
 last week the office for national statistics publish figure show that of people of work age in bradford be claim out of work benefit which be the high rate in the leeds city region do the secretary of state believe that the government ’ back to work plan be work for people in my constituency of bradford south 
 the back to work plan have billion of pound worth of investment behind it include the £ announce by the chancellor in the spring budget such thing as extend restart bring forward mandatory placement after month to ensure that people get into work and double universal support be important measure that will see increase number in work 
 i call the shadow minister 
 all we hear from the secretary of state on employment be smoke and mirror but thankfully the obr have publish the number we have just hear what he believe be happen with employment because of his policy but when the obr look at his policy do its forecast show the employment rate compare with today to be go up or down in 
 i have already share the figure with the house which be that payroll employment be at a near historic high and unemployment be at a near historic low as the hon lady will know we have never have a labour government leave office with unemployment lower at the end of their term than when they start youth unemployment go up under the labour party whereas under this conservative government it have reduce by 
 you can always tell the conservatives be struggle to answer the question mr speaker because they go back to those same old thing about what happen under the last labour government after year they have nothing to be proud of if what the secretary of state say be true we might expect that after a little time some of his policy would work but be it not true that it be not just next year that the obr forecast the employment rate to be down but the year after that too 
 we will continue to bear down on the level of unemployment as the hon lady know economic inactivity have reduce and we have few people in economic inactivity than at the peak during the pandemic we have a plan be it not the reality that the opposition have no plan and no idea as to how to get those number down we do and it be work 
 what step his department be take to reduce level of fraud and error in the welfare system 
 in fraud and error fall by we be invest £ in addition to that which we have already put forward to prevent £ of fraud and error by 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer and welcome the measure the government be take on the new power to search through bank account to look for fraudulent transaction can he confirm that the government will seek to use they only where fraud be suspect and will not as some people have suggest search every state pensioner ’s bank account to look for something that almost certainly will not be there 
 i thank my hon friend for what be a very important question because there have be a great deal of scaremongere about what exactly these power be about i can make it categorically clear from the dispatch box that these power be there to make sure that in instance where there be a clear signal of fraud or error my department be able to take action in the absence of that it will not 
 the cost of living payment be a vital mean of support during the cost of living crisis but my constituent have lose out through no fault of her own because of the well know issue whereby of her work payday fall within the assessment period use to assess eligibility will the government review the eligibility process for the cost of live payment to ensure that no else miss out 
 this be a long stand issue that crop up every few year it be not something on which the government intend to take specific action we trust people to manage their finance such that they can cope with the occasional eventuality where there be an additional year within any calendar year 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of insecure employment on people in poverty 
 this government have make it clear that we believe that work be the good route out of poverty it be important for different type of work to exist as each individual worker ’s circumstance be personal to they and dwp have an in work progression offer to support low pay claimant to progress into well pay and more secure employment 
 do the minister agree that the difference between insecure or exploitative work and go plural with a portfolio of well pay freelance or part time role depend on how valuable someone ’s skill be minister be rightly offer fresh opportunity for jobseeker to improve their skill but in a post pandemic world that be very different from what go before what plan do she have to revisit and update the recommendation of the taylor review to protect people whose skill have not yet be upgrade 
 i thank my hon friend for make that point as someone who be self employ for not far off year i understand where he be come from our work coach at jobcentre plus office engage with claimant to support access to skill provision they get a comprehensive range of support which include apprenticeship skill bootcamp vocational and basic training skill and career advice so that they can work in a way that suit they less than of worker on hour contract want more hour it be more about caring or other flexibility but i be happy to look at the point he have raise in the chamber today.[official report   december vol c. 10mc 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last week uber come to parliament to brief mp on partnership it have set up to support its driver include its recognition agreement with the gmb trade union all uber private hire driver be now auto enrol into a pension but legal uncertainty mean that that be not the case for uber ’s competitor be it not high time for the government to bring forward their employment bill which be promise after the taylor review to provide a level playing field for employer and to tackle these problem of insecurity in the gig economy 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his question in fact i have an uber t shirt from my time as employment minister which the company give i when it bring in the pension i applaud the work that uber have do to support its workforce the right hon gentleman make an important point which be actually for another department but i will take those message away 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty 
 in we be spend around £ through the welfare system on people of work age and child evidence show the importance of work in reduce the risk of child poverty with over vacancy across the uk our focus be on support parent into and to progress within work our recent autumn statement announcement which include the back to work plan increase benefit and increase the national living wage be all part of our clear approach to ensure that everybody get the right support to progress and thrive 
 i hear what the minister say but a recent report from unicef show that of oecd and eu country the uk come last in term of improvement in child poverty between and as a result in child in my constituency of stretford and urmston be grow up in poverty what more can the minister do to address this truly appalling situation 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that report i have look at it and it be important that we react to it i point to our record of action when it come to further support for household with low income we have hear in the chamber indeed the secretary of state mention this about raise local housing allowance back to the percentile which will benefit low income household by on average £ a year in when that be add to the national living wage the uprating of benefit and the availability of work we be determined that those family will progress 
 accord to end child poverty of child in lewisham east be in poverty in while lewisham food bank have see a increase compare to that come after year of this conservative government to make matter bad the report cut to the national household support fund mean that more than £ for household across lewisham have be take away be the minister really serious about show the leadership need to stop family in my constituency from fall into destitution 
 i be really serious about support our young people in fact in lewisham the household support fund which be my domain have allocate an additional £ to support the hon lady ’s constituent there be local hub for debt management and engagement with the local authority and warm welcome hub i say to anybody struggle in her constituency to look at the benefit calculator and indeed help for household on gov.uk 
 figure from the trussell trust show that in the month between april and september food bank in the north east provide a record emergency food parcel for child with the need have double over the past year the majority of family who turn to food bank do so because their income whether from social security or from wage be too low to afford the basic essential will the minister explain why the current design of universal credit be fail these family 
 as we have hear from the secretary of state few child be in absolute poverty and we thank our food bank for the work they do in support our community we do take this seriously we have add food security question to the family resource survey and we will absolutely look at that i would point to the hon member ’s constituency have be allocate an additional £ in the last household support fund for exactly those family 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on friday pupil at shaftesbury junior school in my constituency give i the lovely christmas earring that i be wear which they make themselves use computer aid design i be so proud of all their achievement especially when more than a of leicester ’s child be grow up in poverty with all the challenge that bring as my hon friend have say figure from unicef show that under this government the uk have have the big increase in child poverty out of the world ’s wealthy country my question be simple what be the minister go to do about it 
 the hon lady will have hear about our work on the lha i be extremely proud of the difference that it will make to family in her constituency and mine with almost job vacancy across the uk our firm believe be that support all family to progress and do well be the right thing to do that come with the full uprating that we have do this year on working age benefit and support the lha the hon lady make the point that it have be a difficult time and the household support fund and the cost of living payment which start again on   february will assist 
 the minister be completely out of touch with the reality face family in britain today people face severe hardship this year include child quite frankly that be a shameful figure that have almost treble since this government abolish labour ’s child poverty act million of parent be now worried about how they will feed clothe or keep their child warm this christmas let along how they will buy they present when will the minister   change course follow labour ’s lead and deliver a cross government child poverty strategy that give every child the start in life that they deserve 
 we will absolutely not follow labour ’s lead let we look at their record people might be worried ahead of christmas cost of living payment the household support fund the benefit calculator and help for household be all out there i want the people watch now to know that support be there progression will vary depend on circumstance we have a tailored approach we have district progression lead to help exactly those family that the hon lady talk about 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the action that we take to lift child out of poverty say an awful lot about our value in scotland we have lift child out of poverty with measure such as the game change scottish child payment here in london we have a westminster government support by the labour party wed to a child policy that push child into poverty what do the minister think it say about westminster ’s value on child poverty that they be wed to a child policy with a rape clause 
 adult in workless household be time more likely to be in poverty than those in working household that be why our focus be on work the scotland act give the scottish parliament the power that have be invoke include on the child payment and that be very pleasing for we the act transfer those power for carer and disability benefit worth £ the hon gentleman and his government can make the decision that suit their community that be the right approach 
 what step his department be take to help pensioner with the cost of living 
 what step his department be take to help pensioner with the cost of living 
 more than pensioner household will receive a £ payment this winter to top up their winter fuel allowance payment the pensioner currently in receipt of pension credit may also receive cost of living payment total up to £ in 
 in southport we have a significant number of pensioner who have lose their partner now face the add challenge of manage increase living cost alone can the minister kindly elaborate on what specific initiative or support mechanism be in place to assist people in those financially difficult circumstance to ensure that they get the support they deserve 
 anyone who suffer a bereavement at any time will potentially be in severe financial difficulty i direct my hon friend to the funeral expense payment which be part of the social fund i would also point to the wide measure that we have take such as apply the triple lock there will be an increase in the state pension next year we will also include cost of live payment in the winter fuel payment of £ or £ depend on the age of the recipient 
 despite the welcome fall in inflation my constituent deborah garrard speak for herself and many pensioner who be concerned about a winter of high fuel price will my hon friend outline what further measure the department be consider to help reduce pensioner financial burden 
 i know that mrs garrard will not be the only old resident in the country concern about energy price this winter i just mention the increase cost of live payment that we be add to the winter fuel payment in addition we have increase the warm home discount to up to £ and there be a whole suite of cold weather payment that can be make in the event of day of sustained cold weather we have a wide range of measure to help support people when face with cold weather and high energy cost 
 what step his department be take to help ensure that people be financially incentivise to work 
 universal credit be specifically design to make work pay with strong financial incentive such as the earning taper and work allowance work family can also get support with up to of their childcare cost the maximum amount have be increase by up to £ for child and £ for or more child additionally the rise in the national living wage from april mean that some worker will be £ well off on average as well as benefit from national insurance cut 
 i thank the minister for her answer and welcome she back to the front bench basildon jobcentre recently host health and social care recruitment event which result in the filling of vacancy help to reduce local unemployment do the minister agree that work be the good route out of poverty and that it be this government who be help more people into work and align vacancy with employee 
 i would just like to take a minute to thank basildon jobcentre and indeed all jobcentre for the work they do from chorley to the west country and back to the east targeted recruitment fair be a great way to work with specific sector that have shortage include health and social care construction manufacturing and hospitality my hon friend be right that get more people into work be a top priority for the department and across government we know that it be good for wellbee both personally and financially and those in work be on average £ well off a year 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential implication for his policy of unicef ’s report entitle child poverty in the midst of wealth 
 the overall number of child in absolute poverty after housing cost remain stable between and the late statistic show that in there be few child in absolute poverty after housing cost than in the government continue to provide comprehensive support to help people find progress in and thrive in work recognise that that have to be sustainable in tackle poverty 
 a couple of week ago when i ask the prime minister why of child in stockton north live in poverty he claim that child poverty be down but even if we rely on his and his government ’s unique measuring tool child poverty be still up considerably across every part of the north east under his watch accord to the joseph rowntree foundation british child have suffer destitution in the past year when will the prime minister and his ministers stop pretend that they care and make way for a labour government who will sort out the mess that sham the tories 
 the government be determined to ensure that all child wherever they come from have the good start in life we be commit to support family and help they into work the full uprating this year and last be the signal 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of people experience destitution 
 the government be of course fully commit to protect the most vulnerable which be why we roll out £ in cost of live payment across the period from to it be why as the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for mid sussex mims davies have repeatedly stress we increase the rate for the lha housing support and why benefit increase by the full 
 it be absolutely heartbreaking that in the world ’s rich country we now have people live in destitution we know that disabled people be more likely to live in poverty yet this winter disabled people will not be get any additional help with the cost of live after the separate disability cost of live payment be quietly drop the cost of live for disabled people be still go up so will the secretary of state commit to reinstate the payment and at a level that meet the extra living cost face by disabled people 
 i be not sure precisely which disability payment the hon gentleman be refer to but certainly the cost of live disability payment have be pay this year in addition to the increase in the national living wage tax cut and national insurance tax cut all of which help people particularly those on low pay that be why under this government the level of absolutely poverty have fall by since with few child in poverty 
 whether he have make an assessment of the role of flexible work arrangement in support people to take up employment 
 flexible working can play an important role in support people to start stay in and succeed in work and for business to grow i have already see at hand example of good employer offer tailor role or change hour to support worker particularly parent who have caring responsibility flexibility have make a difference and drive success for all 
 as the minister mention the hospital industry especially in coastal constituency such as mine be suffer disproportionately from high vacancy level exacerbate by covid and the shift in work pattern what more can the government do to encourage smart working and job sharing for example student and young people could work some of the later and weekend hour the less social hour share with parent with family responsibility who could work more regular hour during the daytime 
 the uk hospitality industry do a fantastic job particularly at this time of the year when it be help we to enjoy the festive season i be provide help and collaboration by deliver pilot scheme across the industry in particular we be develop a more standardised approach to training which include a proposal to award a hospitality skill passport we need to do all we can with worker to build confidence and the right skill i be interested by my hon friend ’s idea of help employer to refocus where the need be and i shall be happy to work with he because hospitality offer a great career and transferable skill 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the pensions regulator on the adequacy of the administration of define benefit pension scheme 
 i be fortunate in have already be able to meet representative of the pensions regulator twice since my appointment to discuss the full gamut of their responsibility 
 member of the bp pension scheme a define benefit scheme have see the value of their pension fall by in real term as a consequence of their senior management ’s refusal to upgrade they in   line with the cost of living although the pension fund itself have a £ surplus do the minister agree that if the rule allow company such as bp to deal from the bottom of the deck when it come to their own pensioner these be rule that need to be change 
 that be certainly something i need to look into when people raise the issue of specific pension scheme i be always conscious of just how many thousand of scheme member be potentially watch so i do not wish to speak off the cuff and raise hope that i may not be able to fulfil however i shall be happy to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss the circumstance in great detail and see what can be do 
 i call rob roberts he be otherwise engage i call virginia crosbie 
 what step his department be take to encourage people who be economically inactive owe to long term sickness and disability to return to work 
 the government have a range of initiative to help disabled people and people with health condition to start stay in and succeed in work we build on that in the autumn statement by expand universal support launch workwell pilot reform the fit note and establish an expert group on occupational health 
 do the minister agree that the disability confident job fair that i be host in holyhead with my brilliant anglesey dwp team be an opportunity for excellent local business such as hafan y môr and llechwedd meats and organisation such as môn communities forward and the menter môn enterprise hub to help people with disability back into work and will she lobby the secretary of state to visit ynys môn in february to open the disability job fair 
 i do not want to commit the secretary of state but i have a feeling that he will be in ynys môn in february i thank my hon friend for the huge amount of work that she do in respect of local jobcentre and for her work with those employer i meet she just last week to discuss her focus on young people her local jobs for local people campaign be a great example of her tireless work for the future of the community in ynys môn so iechyd da 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i begin by welcome my new team to the front bench join the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for mid sussex mims davies and lord younger in the other place be the new minister for employment my hon friend   the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill and the under secretary of state for work   and pensions my hon friend   the member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard i know that they will make a great contribution to the department let i also thank those who have depart my right hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott   and my hon friend the members for corby tom pursglove and for hexham guy opperman who have important other duty in government 
 this have be a year of considerable achievement for my department we have already hear about the cost of living payment the support for the most vulnerable the increase in working age benefit the increase in respect of the triple lock for pensioner welfare reform near record level of payroll employment and almost historically low level of unemployment and rise real wage 
 i welcome the government ’s decision to boost childcare payment for parent on universal credit by almost which the work and pensions committee push for i have ask the department to review childcare rule for parent in training and education but can my right hon friend outline the other way in which the government be support low income family in stroud 
 my hon friend be be too modest in lay all the progress at the door of the select committee because it be she in particular who push for those reform to childcare within universal credit and i believe that she be quite rightly name check by the chancellor in his budget statement we of course have the back to work plan the extension of restart the doubling of universal support the greatest ever increase in the national living wage and the reduction in employee national insurance all of which be there to drive further employment 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 during the recent covid inquiry the former health secretary   the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock say that statutory sick pay be far too low and that if he have a magic wand he would fix it give that the secretary of state have the magic wand as the minister responsible for this when be he go to fix it 
 i be certainly not go to start make policy up on the hoof at the dispatch box this afternoon or promise more money for statutory sickness pay that would require discussion across government but i note the point that the hon gentleman have make 
 i welcome this government ’ back to work plan and the emphasis on work be the most effective way out of poverty what support can be make available for people in high unemployment area to travel or relocate to area of low unemployment such as banff and buchan which have high number of vacancy particularly in the seafood processing sector 
 i thank my hon friend and note his relentless support for the seafood industry more broadly and the processing industry   in particular i understand that the former minister for employment my hon friend   the member for hexham guy opperman visit scotland early this year to look at that industry work coach offer tailor employment support to all jobseeker and the flexible support fund be available at the discretion of jobcentre to purchase good and service include travel to support claimant to move from area to another in order to take up job opportunity i know that my hon friend be work hard in his local area to find solution and i be always happy to discuss idea with he 
 many people take the decision to pay for pension top up in and but in numerous instance this have not lead to any increase in their state pension nor have they receive any explanation or a refund have the department make an assessment of the average delay in people receive their pension top up 
 the advice to anyone seek to top up their pension or buy extra national insurance credit would be to ring the future pension centre in advance of make any payment to determine whether they would actually enhance their pension by make they it be always good for people to check before they make those payment to make sure that they will improve their pension 
 minister be rightly put a great deal of money and focus behind back to work programme across the country what progress have they make towards transparently publish the outcome so that we can see which programme perform well or bad in different part of the country and why 
 the dwp regularly publish statistic on its employment programme and the late statistical release of the restart programme be publish on   december the back to work plan announce further measure to tackle long term unemployment such as mandatory placement for those who complete restart without secure a job the policy detail include the reporting be yet to be work through 
 it be vital that local authority such as gateshead and voluntary community organisation know as soon as possible whether the household support fund will be extend beyond march can the secretary of state confirm when they will finally get a definitive answer on this 
 as the hon lady will know these be matter for the treasury and specifically for the chancellor of the exchequer he and i have conversation on these matter and other announcement will be make in due course but of course the household support fund will be in place until the end of march

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs what step he be take to support jimmy lai during his trial and if he will call for his immediate and unconditional release 
 the foreign secretary have call on the hong kong authority to end their prosecution of jimmy lai and release he he also urge the chinese authority to repeal the national security law and end the prosecution of all individual charge under it the foreign secretary and i welcome the opportunity to meet mr lai ’s son sebastien again last week and to listen to his concern as the trial approach 
 as the foreign secretary have make clear mr lai ’s prosecution be politically motivated he have face multiple charge to discredit and silence he as an outspoken journalist and publisher he have be target in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association the foreign secretary raise mr lai ’s prosecution with foreign minister wang yi on   december as his predecessor do in beijing on   august we will continue to press for mr lai ’s release with the hong kong and chinese authority 
 diplomat from our consulate general attend court today as a visible sign of the uk ’s support and they will continue to do so we will continue to press for consular access to mr lai which the hong kong prison authority have repeatedly refuse china consider anyone of chinese heritage bear in china to be a chinese national it do not recognise other nationality and therefore consider mr lai to be exclusively chinese 
 more broadly we have make it clear that the national security law have damage hong kong and its way of life right and freedom have be significantly erode and arrest under the law have silence opposition voice it be a clear breach of the sino british joint declaration the legally bind un register treaty that china willingly enter into its continued existence and use be a demonstration of china break its international commitment we will continue to stand up for the people of hong kong to call out violation of their right and freedom and to hold china to its international obligation 
 i thank my right hon friend for her response 
 jimmy lai be and have always be a full british citizen and he have never hold a chinese passport and therefore he should have be publicly recognise by the government some time ago however i welcome the change in rhetoric by the foreign secretary who say today that 
 jimmy lai be a british citizen 
 and call on the chinese government to release he i be pleased that there seem to have be a shift in policy notwithstanding that i and hon friend have raise the issue of his citizenship with the foreign office to no avail until now 
 at the heart of the issue lie the sino british agreement i recall that at the time of its signing the ambassador in beijing percy cradock say of china ’s leader that they may be thuggish dictator but that they be man of their word and could be 
 trust to do what they promise 
 how history always show we wrong we can not trust thuggish dictator and they have trash the sino british agreement without so much as a by your leave instead we now have political persecution destruction of press freedom force confession and the targeting of foreign national as a matter of course the national security law be the key because it have be strip away their right and particularly those of jimmy lai who face a lifetime in prison 
 a new axis of totalitarian state have form include china north korea russia iran and syria we must be on our toe and realise that their target be democracy itself give that will the government reconsider their word in the integrated review and reinstate the idea that china be a systemic threat not just to we but to the very value that we seek 
 i must tell the government that an individual already know to i and some other be be use in the persecution of jimmy lai we know that he have be torture to give evidence so clearly his evidence can not be rely on in the light of that will the government give a commitment today that if and when uk or other citizen be target through the evidence at jimmy lai ’s trial concrete action will be take to protect they and that we will do so by work with our ally include the us japan and other in europe this be a very serious issue and it may yet erupt 
 will the government now sanction john lee and other responsible for hong kong ’s national security law after all the us have sanction people and we have sanction none be the uk government consider how to allow hong kong asylum application to switch to british national overseas application to save all the heartache as we approach christmas mr speaker this brave and devoted christian will 
 order i be sorry but the right hon gentleman be way way over time i be sure that other hon member will bring in the other point 
 i think we all agree with my right hon friend that the breaching of the sino british joint declaration be a great tragedy as the foreign secretary set out the national security law which we be call on the hong kong authority to repeal be breach so many of those value that we understand that china be willing to maintain with hong kong after 
 my right hon friend mention the integrated review refresh in which the prime minister set out very clearly our perspective which be that we consider china to be an epoch define challenge it then set out in great detail a number of area of concern around china and economic coercive activity we continue to work closely with the g7 and other partner around the world to tackle that and to work together to try to persuade china to reverse some of those policy 
 importantly i say this a lot at the dispatch box as the sanction minister i listen very closely as do all of we here and our official in the foreign office on all   issue relate to potential future sanction we continue to look at those under the global human right sanction regulation in this arena but we do not speculate about future sanction designation because of course that could reduce their impact 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the ongoing detention of jimmy lai a british citizen be a stark symbol of the decline of hong kong ’s freedom and china ’s flagrant disregard for the legally binding sino british agreement which promise a high degree of autonomy for hongkongers for year jimmy lai ’s trial be a further chapter in the erosion of the liberty promise then to the people of hong kong 
 my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary and i have meet jimmy ’s son sebastien regularly and make unequivocally clear labour ’s position that jimmy must be release immediately and that the national security law under which he be be charge be abhorrent i welcome the intervention by the new foreign secretary as mr lai ’s trial begin today but there must be sustain interest by the government in a way that have be sorely lack until now 
 we can not sit idly by while british citizen experience a politically motivate trial and the authority attempt to stifle freedom of expression i urge the minister to give a firm commitment right here that the foreign secretary ’s intervention will not be a off and that the government will follow labour ’s lead in sustained consistent and full throate support for mr lai and his legal counsel and in put the freedom promise to the people of hong kong at the top of her agenda 
 as the minister both for the indo pacific region china and hong kong be in my purview and for sanction the issue of jimmy lai and other hold in this way be very much at the top of my agenda they always have be and always will remain so 
 i have meet sebastien lai on a number of occasion this year and have work closely with he and his team to understand the situation and to look at the support that we can provide the frustration be that we be not able to provide consular access because we be not allow to visit he in prison the foreign secretary set out yesterday that he have call for jimmy lai ’s release and we will continue to sustain that throughout the trial at the moment we expect the trial to last some day so we expect to see it wrap up in the summer we will be work very closely with like minded partner us canadian australian new zealand european and swiss representative be also in court today to make it clear that we all have view which be that this be a trial from which jimmy lai need to be release 
 i be interested in the question of mr lai ’s nationality status if he be a full british citizen will my right hon friend confirm whether hong kong have unilaterally withdraw consular right for foreign mission to visit their citizen in prison or be that specifically the case for those imprison under the national security law whichever it be could she confirm that the foreign office have do everything   possible to ensure that the hong kong government realise that those right of access for our citizen should not be violate lightly 
 my hon friend be right that consular access should in an ideal world be provide to all those who find themselves in prison whatever the country the frustrating fact be that it be up to a country not specifically china whether it consider dual nationality acceptable obviously we will consider such a dual national british they will have a british passport we have absolutely do everything and we continue to ask for consular access for jimmy lai i be able to help he get a new passport early in the year because his old have run out we work with the home office to ensure that we be very comfortable and certain that he be indeed a british citizen but as i set out the hong kong authority consider a hong kong national bear in mainland china to be a chinese citizen hence their view on dual nationality and the impossibility of our authority visit he in prison at the moment 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for secure this urgent question and lord alton baroness kennedy and   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   for their continue and unwavering support for jimmy lai who as a uk national be entitle to expect much more support from the government than he have thus far receive 
 a year old pro democracy campaigner in ail health have be imprison for more than day on trump up charge yet it be only yesterday that his government finally call for he to be release i hope that i have misunderstood the minister but be we to believe that the uk ’s influence be so diminish that we can not get access to mr lai in prison will she detail what practical support be be give to he now that his show trial have start and will she give a cast iron guarantee that in the event that beijing get the verdict that it be look for the government will proactively come to this house to make a statement on what action they intend to take rather than have it drag out of they through another urgent question 
 i will not reiterate my previous answer on the subject of consular access and the challenge that we face in be able to support jimmy lai in that way i reiterate the hon member ’s point that many colleague across the house have be ardent champion and supporter of jimmy lai and indeed of his family as they seek to ensure that his case be understand across the world we will continue to call for jimmy lai ’s release the national security law need to be repeal those be message that we will continue to highlight with the authority at every possible opportunity 
 can i thank you personally mr speaker for grant today ’s urgent question the pantomime trial of jimmy lai be just the tip of a huge iceberg of the chinese communist party ’s industrial scale abuse of human right and indifference to the international rule of law today parliaments around the world be express their solidarity   with jimmy lai and the oppressed freedom love people of hong kong but there must be consequence it be no good just monitor human right sanction across the globe my right hon friend have have year to name some of the legal and other official of the chinese government who be undermine and abuse human right as we speak when will we see action and what be she do to address the concern about the continual erosion of the judicial process in hong kong and the involvement there of british judge we need action not constant warm word 
 we continue to use sanction tool across the piece at every opportunity where the evidence come to we and we can use it bear in mind that as we always say i be sorry that it be frustrating for colleague we will never discuss potential future sanction designation because it could reduce their impact we will always listen to and look closely at the evidence bring to we and indeed at the work that our team across the world do to try to bring to bear our sanction regime against the human right violation that we be see 
 sadly as we predict the people of hong kong have see their freedom systematically erode since the national security law be introduce in pro democracy activist such as jimmy lai have be detain public library have be empty of book see as promote so call bad ideology and the recent patriot only local election see opposition candidate ban from stand can the minister please explain how the uk government plan to uphold their commitment to human right and freedom for all hongkongers 
 the hon lady be right it have be tragic to see the disintegration of all those freedom which when both country sign up to the sino british joint declaration we consider that china would stand by of course when we see the national security law come in we respond very quickly and decisively in particular with the new immigration path for british national overseas passport holder so that we could provide that security for those who feel under most stress we also suspend the extradition treaty with hong kong indefinitely to provide protection for those people and we have extend our arm embargo on mainland china to cover hong kong this be a tragic situation and we will continue to call for change and for the hong kong authority to reverse the national security law and restore those freedom that be part of hong kong ’s extraordinary opportunity for economic success as well as other thing 
 give everything that be happen in china include this pitiful show trial be it not now time that the government of this country develop a proper coherent cross government strategy for deal with china since they be patently lack at the moment 
 as we set out in the integrated review refresh publish in march china ’s challenge to both economic and global security be that we consider to be right at the heart of the challenge we face we continue to work closely with official and in concert with g7 and other partner around the world to tackle some of those challenge 
 the minister will be aware i hope that timothy owen kc who be part of jimmy lai ’s defence team be currently in hong kong but because of the failure to give he a visa to deal with jimmy lai ’s case be not able to appear for jimmy lai will she make representation to the local authority as a matter of urgency say that surely the right to appoint counsel of ’s own choosing be a fundamental in any fair legal system and that we would expect that opportunity to be give to mr lai 
 the interpretation by china ’s standing committee of the national people ’s congress of the national security law at the end of last year state that the chief executive would have to certify whether an act or issue involve national security include the question of overseas lawyer participation otherwise its statement be that the chief executive lead national security committee should make the decision so attempt to challenge that have sadly fail and the high court have note that hong kong court have no jurisdiction over it but we have call on the chief executive to respect those right and freedom in hong kong and to uphold the rule of law as we all understand it 
 how many time must a totalitarian communist state behave like a totalitarian communist state before the government will recognise it as a totalitarian communist state 
 i do not quite know how to follow such an articulately put question my right hon friend highlight of the many challenge for those of we who believe in uphold and want to allow other country around the world to uphold those value and freedom freedom of speech freedom of choice and freedom of association and we will continue to work with ally and partner to highlight and to sanction where we can and where we have the tool to do so those who continue to breach those freedom 
 i pay tribute to jimmy lai ’s uk base legal team however they have be subject to incredible level of cyber harassment and other form of harassment and interference while work on his legal case what be the minister do with other departments to ensure that lawyer and journalist involve in promote and advocate for freedom and democracy around the world be protect from such unacceptable level of transnational repression 
 the hon lady be absolutely right there have be shocking attempt to dissuade make fearful and stop jimmy lai ’s legal team here in the uk get on with their job of defend his case and raise the issue that we have set out today we work closely with the home office as do his lawyer to support it and other part of government to provide those team with the technical support that they need we will continue to do that it be perhaps a question to pick up and discuss in more detail with the minister for security my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat i can ask he whether he will discuss it with the hon lady should she so wish 
 day ago on   december jimmy have his birthday it be not rude to say that he be not a young man this house   could send a message to the rest of the world through an early day motion an early day motion be table on   december   by   the hon member for strangford jim shannon and more member need to sign it i will not give the honour to people outside this chamber who decry early day motion although in fact there be not that many of they if we want to send a message there be a methodology although it be not the only i know that lot of colleague do not like sign early day motion but on this occasion perhaps they should 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the tool that we have at our disposal here in the mother of parliaments which allow for freedom of speech and expression be incredibly important as a minister who spend a lot of her time on the other side of the world in country large and small i be very conscious that the messaging from this parliament be hear loud and clear in every other country we perhaps forget just how important our voice be in stand up for the value that we believe in 
 mr lai ’s detention be a shocking symbol of the erosion not just of human right but of freedom of expression in hong kong give everything that we be see unfold what step be the minister take to ensure that we be supportive of what remain of a free press in hong kong 
 jimmy lai have be an extraordinary champion of free speech which he choose to continue despite the change landscape in hong kong we continue to support people across the piece many of whom have come to the uk for sanctuary to be able to be able to speak out and use our freedom of press to share their concern and highlight the abuse they be see 
 i join the call for jimmy lai ’s release he be a devout catholic and his faith motivate his courageous campaigning for democracy in hong kong after the sustain dismantle in hong kong of freedom of expression of association of the press of judicial independence and other do the minister share my concern that the threat to freedom of religion or belief in hong kong be now very real if she do not will she please read sell out my soul the impending threats to freedom of religion or belief in hong kong the new report by hong kong watch 
 my hon friend continue in her role to be an extraordinary champion for freedom of religion or belief and i absolutely agree with she we continue of course to monitor freedom of religion or belief in hong kong through our regular monthly report to parliament and through interaction with local faith leader the late report publish on   september note that 
 religious practice be generally not restrict 
 with a variety of 
 religious practice coexist across the territory 
 she be absolutely right the strength that jimmy lai seek and find through his faith be extraordinary and it will help he in this very difficult time 
 i congratulate   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   on secure the urgent question jimmy lai have many supporter in the uk include brit and those from hong kong but many of they have experience intimidation and harassment here in the uk from the chinese communist party those from hong kong face certain persecution arrest and detention if they be force to return activist have recently be tell by the uk government that they be not at risk and have have their asylum claim reject can the minister explain uk government policy on whether hong kong campaigner should qualify for asylum in the uk 
 as i set out early we bring forward the british national overseas route for hong kong resident to come to the uk so far approximately application have be process and have be grant the point the hon gentleman mention be that i be aware the home office be look into there have be a change in relation to age in the processing and there be an issue there that i know it be look at now i will ask the home office to update he once it have finish its review 
 a regime such as this have to be judge not on its word but on its deed in its systematic demolition of the rule of law and now of the independence of the legal profession itself which be such a lively part of an economically successful and prosperous hong kong china be demonstrate its real intention what more can the government do not only to take direct action by way of sanction against the individual concern but to make the strong point that the basic law be not an historical document but a living instrument and that we expect it to be adhere to 
 my right hon and learn friend highlight an issue with which he be very familiar he practise the law and indeed he be absolutely right the judiciary the legal profession and those who be servant of it assure the safety and the right outcome of case and we will continue to challenge the hong kong authority on the failure of the national security law and call for it to be repeal 
 the rule of law and how it be uphold across the world be absolutely essential to our global security and peace and mr lai ’s case show how fragile they be so what more can the government do to reassert the importance of our all abide by the rule of law 
 the hon lady be absolutely right and much of the work that our diplomatic team across the world do be in country where the rule of law be not necessarily adhere to but where there be abuse human right violation and so on we continue to highlight and challenge those work alongside international partner to persuade those leadership to change their way and to understand both the merit of a well deliver legal system and the value that add to the credibility of the political leadership of their nation it be something we do week in week out sadly there be   many country across the world where these challenge continue but it be right at the heart of the diplomatic service ’s work 
 the use of international lawyer have be a long stand practice in hong kong and we have fail mr lai will the minister advise exactly what step will be take and when to secure or attempt to secure international legal representation of the british citizen mr lai 
 as i set out in answer to an early question jimmy lai obviously want to have his own choice of legal representation he have a fantastic team of lawyer here in the uk support he the challenge for those represent he at the trial be that we continue to highlight as i set out early the frustration in the way this system work mean that he do not have the international lawyer of his choose with he however we will continue to highlight those failing and as so many colleague have highlight what we consider the right use of the legal system and such independent representation should be 
 every reasonable democrat will be happy to support the plea of   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   on behalf of mr lai however there be a whiff of hypocrisy in the air in former ambassador craig murray be imprison on the fabricated conceit of jigsaw identification and julian assange have be hold in belmarsh prison    for or more day will the government lead by example and desist from harass journalist craig murray and other and free julian assange now 
 rise 
 order i be not quite sure that that meet what we be expect so i call jim shannon 
 while i be thankful that the foreign secretary publicly acknowledge the case of jimmy lai at the united nations in february and reportedly raise the case with chinese official during his visit to beijing the fact be that a british citizen remain behind bar may i gently remind right hon and hon member of early day motion to which they might want to add their name and ask that the foreign secretary with the voice of the entire british government include our prime minister and this house call for the immediate and unconditional release of jimmy lai who have spend day behind bar will the minister do that today and follow it through tomorrow with the appropriate channel 
 the hon gentleman be the most incredible champion for so many whose life and whose family life continue to be blight by challenge to freedom of religion or belief he be always willing to stand up for they as a minister i do not think i be allow to sign edm but should you wish to change that rule mr speaker i would be extremely happy to sign this i think that all member of the house who be able to sign it should do so 
 i can not sign edm either even the girl guide but i be sure that other member will wish to do so let we move on 
 i welcome the defence secretary to the dispatch box 
 thank you for that warm welcome mr speaker with permission i would like to share detail of the treaty that i sign with my japanese and italian counterpart last thursday 
 a year ago the prime ministers of the uk japan and italy agree to work together on a joint programme to develop a new generation of military combat aircraft supersonic and arm with an array of revolutionary new capability our global combat air programme or gcap for short will deliver vital military capability strengthen and sustain our combat air sector and set the standard for future combat air above all it will bolster our collective security the fact be that we be live in a much more dangerous and contested world our sky and international airspace be increasingly contest not least from threat pose by russia and china all treaty country be already make significant investment in combat air to pursue these lofty ambition during recent year the ministry of defence alone have invest £ in uk combat air technology with a furth £ from industry to shape the capability and develop the necessary skill pipeline to deliver this state of the art aircraft for the future 
 today i be pleased to announce as an early christmas present to the house a major milestone in that programme on   thursday december   in tokyo alongside my italian defence minister colleague guido crosetto and my japanese colleague minister minoru kihara i sign the gcap treaty it establish the legal basis for the formation of a new gcap international governmental organisation as everyone seem fond of acronym the gigo or as guido crosetto tell i the jigo”—is now form it be with great pleasure that i now confirm that the headquarters of the gigo will be in the uk 
 the gigo will be responsible for deliver vital military innovation strengthen our trinational industrial capacity and get the most punch out of our pound euro and yen while locate in the uk it will however be a partnership of equal which be why the chief executive of the new gcap agency will be from japan and the chief executive officer of the joint venture will be from italy 
 it be worth spend a brief moment reiterate why gcap be so strategically important it will immeasurably enhance our freedom of action ensure that the raf have the global reach and cut edge capability it need to conduct operation and exercise for decade to come it will deepen our collaboration with partner in the euro atlantic at a time of increase instability and it will also ensure that we remain a key player in the indo pacific theatre which will only grow in geopolitical influence and importance over decade to come indeed our new treaty already build upon our exist defence relationship with japan complement the recently sign reciprocal access agreement which facilitate mutually beneficial defence co operation and i be able to speak about that in japan last week 
 like aukus today ’s treaty be a truly multi decade endeavour with like minded partner who share our view of the international environment the agreement arrive year after we deploy our magnificent royal navy carrier strike group in and it be year away from a plan carrier strike group deployment in which will include japan collectively the signal we be send both to our ally and to our adversary be clear the uk be deeply committed to indo pacific security and euro atlantic security as well as global security in increasingly uncertain and deadly time we will do everything in our power to preserve an open and stable international order 
 we should never forget however that gcap be more than just an engine of security it be also an engine of prosperity with key combat air hub in the north west and south west of england and in edinburgh gcap will help accelerate economic growth across the country there be already around people work on the future combat air programme in the uk with almost organisation on contract across the country include many sme and academic institution the gigo headquarters alone will support hundred of job here in the uk it will attract substantial inward investment in research and development provide opportunity for our next generation of highly skilled engineer and technician not to mention the prospect of thousand more high value job right across the supply chain of our nation 
 more than that it be a programme of such size and sophistication it be a programme that will innovate on such an extraordinary scale use artificial intelligence digital twinning open architecture and robotic engineering that i believe it will inspire a whole new generation to get into engineering aerospace and defence today we be glimpse the future and it come after month of intensive work to get this together with japan and italy establish the concept of a gcap aircraft and the joint structure to launch the development phase in 
 year on from the landmark deal that prime ministers put together our gcap partnership be soar to new height get here have be the product of immense effort and long sleepless night from colleague in all country i pay tribute to their tireless effort because today we fire up the thruster to turbo boost our nation towards a revolutionary air capability that capability will day surpass an early pantheon of legend in the sky from the spitfire to the tornado and from the typhoon to the f-35 it be a capability that will initiate a step change in the industrial co operation between our nation and will usher in a new era of combat air power give all it will do for our country i have no doubt that when it come to formally lay the treaty for ratification before this parliament it will meet with the approval of colleague on both side of the house the treaty have be publish on gov.uk today and i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the defence secretary for his statement this afternoon and for early sight of it 
 we welcome the treaty that he sign on behalf of the uk last week with japan and italy and we warmly welcome the decision to locate the gcap government   headquarters in london the treaty be the late in the plan step for develop our tri nation generation fighter and weaponry ukraine have show we that some of our strong ally be in east asia and the pacific and we share with they concern about china ’s grow military power and assertiveness in the region we want to see peace stability and deterrence strengthen in the indo pacific gcap be like aukus a strategic uk commitment to contribute to that i know it be welcome in washington and canberra just like aukus 
 most importantly develop a generation fighter will ensure that we can continue to safeguard our uk sky and those of our nato ally for decade to come it will inspire innovation strengthen uk industry and keep britain at the cutting edge of defence technology the defence secretary be right to report that to the house 
 defence industrial collaboration underpin by treaty be unusual it be a multi decade undertaking for this nation as the secretary of state say it should command support across the house and ministers should report on it openly and regularly may i ask he what scope the treaty allow to work with other ally both at a secondary level and as primary partner do article ensure that the export problem with the typhoon will not be encounter with gcap when will he lay the treaty before parliament for ratification 
 this month the national audit office report on the mod ’s equipment plan it expose a £ black hole in britain ’s defence plan and show that ministers have lose control of the defence budget in june the defence command paper reaffirm that the uk would spend £ on this project out to will the secretary of state confirm what funding have be make available for gcap in the defence budget for and in response to a write question the then procurement minister   the right hon and learn member for cheltenham alex chalk tell i back in march 
 we will determine the cost sharing arrangement ahead of the next phase 
 have that now be do ahead of the treaty signing 
 meanwhile the infrastructure and projects authority this year downgrade the gcap programme to red which rat 
 successful delivery to be unachievable there be major issue which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable 
 what be the major issue that lead to the ipa downgrade what action be the secretary of state now take to lift the red rating 
 the secretary of state say this afternoon that the joint development phase will launch in his press statement on the treaty signing say this combat aircraft be 
 due to take to the sky in 
 keep the programme on time as well as in budget will be critical so by what date do he expect the design to be lock down the national work share to be settle the manufacture agreement to be in place and the flight trial to begin 
 sign the treaty be the easy part britain and its ally must now do the hard work to get this new generation fighter aircraft in the air and on time 
 may i start by warmly welcome the right hon gentleman ’s welcoming of this treaty signing and the overall programme as i say member on both   side of the house agree that the defence of the realm come in an ever more dangerous world it be important to have the facility that a generation fighter aircraft would bring 
 the right hon gentleman mention that the hq be come to london but i want to put it on record that it be come to the uk we have not decide a location for it yet i think there be plus potential location so i would not want to assume that it will be base in london we be not as london centric on everything as he may be 
 the right hon gentleman ask about example of work internationally previously it be worth point out that the typhoon be italian british german and spanish and it have be a very successful programme we be use to work with partner include italy which be involve in this programme 
 the right hon gentleman ask about article export issue i think his question be bear out of a specific concern about german export licence which we believe be resolvable time will tell on a wide basis we recognise that such an aircraft can only be truly successful if the market be great than the uk italy and japan 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the broad equipment plan and he mention the £ programme there be a number of caveat of course we have see huge inflation but at the other end we have also see a big expansion of the amount of money that be go into our year equipment programme that number which be a snapshot in time be take before the refresh and take into account programme that will and will not happen so it be not quite as black and white as he present 
 the right hon gentleman ask about cost sharing on the programme that be part of what the process of discussion both on the treaty and on the new gigo organisation will ascertain that be because the industrial capacity and capability of each of the country be important as be the intellectual property that will be bring forward that be part of what that organisation be currently establish it can not be prejudge simply because we be likely to have great industrial capacity in certain area relative to other country the amount of project ownership will therefore fall on these factor how much money go in the intellectual property and the industrial capacity 
 the right hon gentleman ask about rag red amber green rating if i remember rightly i will correct the record if i be wrong of the reason for the red rating be about lay a treaty for the project that be of the reason why we be lay the treaty for the project and we will carry on systematically work through any other factor that could be slow up the programme or cause the rating to be low 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the timing for the treaty i be pleased that there seem to be strong cross party consensus on this as he will know pass such treaty in this house be not a particularly complex matter the treaty will be lay before the house and it will be a question for the business manager in other country in italy and particularly in the diet in japan there be a rather more complicated process so the time limiter be likely to be more on their side than on ours they will be look to lay the treaty at their end in the spring and that be more likely to be the issue 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the timing overall it be a compressed timetable with a specific requirement for it to be in service for which come from the japanese side because of its aircraft replacement programme japan press the target which we be fully sign up to and there be a large number of milestone along the way include a uk demonstrator aircraft which will be very much soon i hope that that information be helpful i be happy to write to he with any further detail and to take further question 
 in welcome this project for a long term future aircraft may i ask the secretary of state whether he agree that the threat picture that will face it will in large measure depend on the outcome of the conflict between ukraine and russia can he say anything to the house about the effort that he and fellow nato member be make to ensure that ukraine have some current aircraft with which to defend itself so as to improve the prospect that will face we when this future aircraft come into being
