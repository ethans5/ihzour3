the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to reduce waiting time for nhs treatment 
 happy st george ’s day mr speaker 
 cut waiting list be of the prime minister ’s top priority we be spend more than £ on additional elective activity and investing in additional capacity include community diagnostic centre such centre be in the hon gentleman ’s constituency since september overall waiting list have fall by almost the big month fall in over year outside of the pandemic 
 nhs waiting list have rise threefold since the tories come to power and the prime minister ’s pledge to cut waiting list be in tatter rather than take responsibility the tories blame nhs staff who be try to get well pay and now they have open up a new round of medium attack on the sick and the disabled why do not the government instead go after the tax dodger as labour plan to do to raise fund and help resolve the crisis in our nhs 
 once again the hon gentleman do not condemn the strike i would gently say that while we be get waiting list down in england welsh labour have the long hospital wait in great britain put patient at risk because it do not have a plan to clear the backlog in december the welsh labour government have the high number of patient in great britain wait over year for treatment it be an outrage yet that be the blueprint for what the labour party say it will implement here in england 
 i see increase number of woman come to my constituency surgery about chronic urinary tract infection not for themselves but for their daughter unfortunately there seem to be no treatment pathway for chronic utis among girl do my right hon friend have any thought about that and would he agree to meet i to discuss the issue far 
 i would be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the issue 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 happy st george ’s day mr speaker 
 westminster be awash with rumour that the prime minister will call a july general election presumably to avoid give his rwanda gimmick the time to fail i have a very simple question for the minister will he repeat the pledge that the prime minister make last year and promise that nhs waiting list will be low at the time of the general election than when the prime minister come to office 
 the prime minister have be very clear that get waiting list down be of his top priority but he have also be clear that performance have be disappointing reason be that procedure have have to be reschedule because of industrial action i would gently ask the shadow secretary of state whether he condemn those strike 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of oversight mechanism for the general medical council 
 the general medical council have be constitute by parliament to ensure that decision about individual doctor be independent of both the profession and the government of the day the professional standards authority oversee the work of all united kingdom professional regulator and report to parliament on their operational performance parliament continue to set and oversee the principle and scope of the regulator power 
 good governance mean ensure transparency and concern of my constituent be whether gmc decision can be appeal will the minister reassure i that we can have well transparency in the gmc on the decision that it make 
 the gmc and other professional regulator have a statutory duty to investigate any concern about the fitness to practice of of their registrant and to take appropriate action to protect the public when that be need the regulator be oversee by the professional standards authority for health and social care which have the power to appeal case where in its view a sanction impose by a regulator be insufficient to protect the public 
 the gmc have principle of decision making and consent how will the minister ensure that gps can fulfil their obligation when time constraint on appointment mean that they do not have time to listen to every complaint people have to book a double appointment to talk about more than issue what further support can the government give gps to enable they to fulfil their gmc order standard of care 
 as the hon gentleman know the government have commit to deliver more gp appointment and to make it easy throughout the country to see a doctor in england in december we deliver gp appointment compare with in december an increase of appointment each month we need to continue to work with programme such as pharmacy and we be take other step to reduce the pressure on gps so that they have more time to spend with their patient 
 what recent progress she have make on retain gps 
 general practitioner be a rock they be the underpinning force of primary care i want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to they for all they do for the health of the nation my right hon friend be right to raise the issue of gp retention during covid and since gps have be exhaust and the return to primary care provision have be difficult the government be do a lot such as improve digital telephony and reduce the administrative workload i be about to launch a future of general practice taskforce to look at what more we can do to provide more support to this critical part of our primary care 
 chelmsford be a grow city and it be very good that compare with pre covid time we have more clinician in our gp surgery but we need more surgery as well new surgery be be build i have be tell that the limit that local district valuer impose on nhs lease cost make it increasingly difficult for developer to deliver new surgery building not only in chelmsford but in other part of the country will my right hon friend meet i and other affect mp to see whether we can resolve that issue and help grow area where there be more house to deliver the new surgery that we need 
 of course i would be delighted to meet my right hon friend to discuss that issue which several colleague across the house have raise with i she will appreciate that the district valuer services be crucial in ensure value for taxpayer ’s money from the rent that be charge for gp practice nevertheless the department be work hard to support well primary care facility i understand the point and would be happy to meet she 
 there be few fully qualified gps in somerset now than there be in december so it be no surprise that my constituent in wincanton feel that they can never access how will the minister support general practice to enable it to continue to provide the vital service that our community deserve 
 it be fantastic that hard work gps have deliver more appointment a year than in that be a credit to their effort the government have undertake a wide range of approach to try to reduce the administrative burden we be focus on try to deal with some of the issue that   gps have raise with i about the primary and secondary care interface so that they do not have to write all the fit note and liaise with consultant we have also spend more than £ on digital telephony importantly the additional role reimbursement scheme have add more than more professional staff from physio to pharmacist to those in gp practice to try to support patient access 
 i call the shadow minister 
 at the last general election the government promise to deliver more gps by but there be still few gps than in part of the problem be that morale have plummet in the past decade mean that experience family doctor and newly qualified gps be hang up their stethoscope what do the minister say after scrap gp retention scheme last month will she come clean today about another broken manifesto promise 
 the hon lady be choose number out of the air she will be aware that there be almost more gps now than in and very importantly the long term workforce plan be schedule to introduce new training place by in we have the great number ever of new trainee gps that be great news for gp practice as they be crucial to primary care 
 what step she be take to ensure adequate funding for hospital repair 
 may i wish you a happy st. george ’s day mr speaker i also wish   the hon member for bristol south karin smyth   a speedy recovery i hope to see she across the dispatch box soon 
 the government have invest significant sum to maintain and modernise nhs building include £ for integrated care board this financial year this be on top of the expect £ for the new hospital programme we have invest a furth £ for over hospital upgrade across england include in mid and south essex 
 i thank the secretary of state very much for the government ’s commitment to deliver the £ in capital funding for south essex hospital and for her recent visit to southend hospital where she see in our emergency village how much £ can do in the hand of southend hospital ’s inspirational nhs staff however our aged building do also need urgent maintenance so what can she also do to deliver the £ in maintenance funding also need for southend hospital 
 i thank my hon friend and also wish she the very good of luck as she be due to abseil down the hospital next month for its radiotherapy appeal i very much hope she land safely and do not trouble southend hospital i be delighted to visit the hospital at her invitation early this month and i be very much impressed by the immediate improvement that the £ funding have mean in the dowsett   ward and for discharge and treatment time through accident and emergency this be part of our plan both through the urgent and emergency care plan and through our recovery plan for elective and the new hospital programme to rebuild hospital and provide that investment so that clinician can use it to treat their local patient 
 last month i meet the chief executive of stepping hill hospital in stockport she inform i that the primary out patient building which provide of out patient capacity be recently condemn while funding have be secure to build additional ward they will not be ready for at least month cause huge disruption in the interim year of underinvestment have leave stepping hill hospital quite literally crumble will the government provide urgent capital investment for stepping hill so that my constituent and our brilliant nhs staff can have the facility they need 
 i very much hope that the hon gentleman have already speak to his integrate care board because he will know that responsibility for local investment decision rightly rest at local level i can say that as a government we have very much invest in hospital upgrade include £ go to integrate care board this financial year i hear the timetable he cite but i encourage he to go to his integrate care board to ask what more it be do 
 what step she be take to tackle medicine shortage for type diabetes 
 it be vital that people have access to the medicine they need the department have be work with the supplier of medicine use in the treatment of type diabete to seek commitment from they to address the issue expedite delivery and boost supply as a result the position be now much improve compare with a few month ago with new patient now able to receive these critical medicine we continue to work with industry to address remain issue as quickly as possible 
 we know that obesity in this country be cost the nhs about £ a year and it be a major contributory factor to type diabetes which be preventable in a lot of case by have a healthy lifestyle what more can we do encourage people to eat healthily and therefore save cost in the nhs 
 the hon member raise a very important point obesity be link to many health condition include type diabetes we be deliver an ambitious programme of work to create a healthy environment to support people in achieve and maintain a healthy weight this include restrict the placement of less healthy product in shop and online calorie labelling on food sell in restaurant and a tax on the sugary drink industry which have remove the equivalent of tonne of sugar from soft drink 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 a recent nuffield trust report show that medicine shortage be a new normal in the uk the minister might claim that this be a global issue but as the report highlight shortage be be make bad by brexit for example the creation of a requirement for custom check at the border and leave the european medicines agency have disrupt the previously smooth supply of medicine what urgent action will the minister take to help to tackle the disastrous effect of brexit on uk medicine supply 
 the snp as usual be a broken record we all know that diabete medicine shortage be a global issue affect country not just across the whole of the european union but across the whole world medicine supply chain be highly regulated complex and global issue can occur for multiple reason include manufacture difficulty regulatory non compliance surge in demand availability of raw material sudden spike in demand and issue relate to the distribution of the product but once again as always the grievance culture of the snp be blame everything on brexit 
 what step she be take to increase level of nurse recruitment and retention in gp practice 
 we hugely appreciate the work that general practice nurse do i know that the hon lady be a nurse in her previous life and i absolutely pay tribute to she for her service she will be aware that last year the government provide additional funding for the general practice contract to uplift pay by in line with the pay review body ’s recommendation we be very much aware of the need to try to ensure that general practice nurse feel appreciated and be keen to be retain in gp practice which be of the reason i have launch a taskforce on the future of general practice as she will know it be for gp practice themselves to determine the pay uplift for their nurse i be look closely at that because we know that sometimes the pay rise provide by the government be not pass on 
 we have all see image of people queue around the block for an appointment at their gp surgery and in my local integrate care board there have be a decline in general practice nurse since june it currently take month to train nurse wish to move into general practice will the minister tell i and my constituent in erdington kingstanding and castle vale what she be do to ensure that the retention of experienced nurse and the training of new nurse do not add to the pressure that gps be already face 
 the hon lady raise an important point the long term workforce plan commit to increase the number of general practice nurse by more than by in her area the number of doctor in general practice in the nhs birmingham and solihull icb increase by full time equivalent between and but the number of nurse   decrease slightly by full time equivalent however over the same period direct patient care staff increase by full time equivalent i think that demonstrate to the hon lady that the actual resource in gp practice be increase with specialism such as physiotherapy and pharmacy as well as nurse prescriber to provide patient more access to good healthcare 
 what step she be take to support the recruitment and retention of community and district nurse 
 as the hon member may know in september we meet our commitment to deliver more nurse work in the nhs compare with september as of january there be over full time equivalent community nurse work in nhs trust and other core organisation across england which be over more than a year ago however we want to go far which be why the nhs long term workforce plan set an ambition to increase training place for district nurse by to nearly it also commit to improve retention in the nhs 
 in scotland the vacancy rate for register nursing post in the community be and for register district nurse it be 6.6%—in england the situation be actually bad in most part however these post be fundamental not just to care in community and to our community themselves but to address bed block it be obviously for the scottish government to address term and condition of employment but their overall funding package be dictate by the block grant and barnett consequential be it not time that the department stand up for the nhs when there be money for weapon abroad why can we not provide care at home we be tell during the referendum that we would be well together and that the nhs would be protect instead it be be undermine 
 we hear from opposition members who love nothing more than to crow and criticise as their health system decline around they despite record funding from the uk government scotland have sadly some of the bad health outcome in the western world early this year when the uk government step in to offer support the snp health minister reject the offer i reiterate that if the scottish government need help to reduce their waiting list we stand ready to provide such support 
 what step she be take to tackle health inequality 
 we be commit to level up health narrow the gap in healthy life expectancy by and increase healthy life expectancy by year by that align with our mission to reform our health and care system to be fast simple and fairer 
 in january professor sir michael marmot publish health inequalities live cut short which confirm that between and drive by political choice people in of area in england live short life than they should the inequality be amplify by covid these life cut short be match by short life in good health do the secretary of state believe in evidence base health if so do she accept the overwhelming evidence that current level of ill health reflect year of escalating poverty service that have be run into the ground include the nhs and the government ’s failure to do what they promise in level up 
 no i do not and i would point to the legislation that the government bring forward last week which be the large and most significant public health reform that we can make to help the hon member ’s constituent and those in other part of the country who face inequality we know that smoking rate be disproportionately high in poor community which be of the many reason why we introduce such landmark legislation it be just a shame that the labour party feel that they have to whip their member to get they to vote for it 
 will the secretary of state support breast cancer now ’s campaign to improve the uptake of breast cancer screening especially among woman in minority ethnic community because that be a good way to tackle health inequality 
 i completely agree far on ethnicity and inequality i have not only prioritise woman ’s health as secretary of state but announce £ of research into maternity disparity for woman of colour give the worrying statistic associate with that i have also respond to call from brave constituent put forward by hon member on both side of the house for further research into lobular breast cancer because although it be responsible for of diagnosis we do not have the research or evidence to help woman who be affect by it 
 the reality be that someone live in the inner city in the bradford district be likely to live year less than those live in the more affluent part of the region that have not just happen it be a result of year of underinvestment in and cut to not only our nhs but our community service will the secretary of state just admit that the government frankly could not care less about people from place such as bradford because otherwise they would have accept my levelling up bid which would have address this injustice at its core 
 i be so glad that the hon gentleman have mention level up because presumably he will know from his bid that the levelling up mission be mutually reinforce conservative members take the approach that in order to help people with their health—[interruption the hon gentleman be shout at i i think that this answer would be important to his constituent 
 levelling up be not just about health it be about the impact of education housing and other matter in our environment which be why in the forthcoming major   condition strategy we will tie together the condition that have the most impact on a healthy life we will draw together a cross government strategy to help people who be live with those condition to live long but also healthy life 
 the health secretary will know about the health inequality across the east of england include in maldon district which will only be make bad if the nhs ’s plan to close st peter ’s hospital in maldon proceed do she agree that the levelling up funding that have be make available to maldon district council should be prioritise to facilitate investment in new localise health service so that those inequality can be tackle 
 my right hon friend make an important point the purpose of the levelling up fund be to help local area to address what they need locally rather than respond to diktat from central london i encourage she to work closely as i know she will with local agency the council and other make those important decision so that their levelling up announcement include health as an integral part of her mission to improve the life of her constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 back in the real world the record of the last labour government be that we increase life expectancy by year under this government it have stall for the time in a century with people in blackpool for example expect to live and a half year less than the national average be the secretary of state proud of this shocking record or will people have to wait to elect chris webb in blackpool south and a labour government at westminster to finally turn the tide on health inequality 
 as someone who be proud to have go to school in blackpool i do not need a lecture from the hon gentleman about what labour have do to the town centre or about the important work that conservative in lancashire be do to help community such as blackpool on labour ’s record i gently point out as i try to do at every oral that the record of the labour run nhs in wales be lamentable people be almost twice as likely to be wait for treatment in the labour run nhs in wales that be not a record of which to be proud 
 what step she be take to improve bowel care for people with spinal injury 
 the hon member raise an important issue it be vital that people with spinal injury receive care in the most appropriate environment to support their care and rehabilitation the nhs have develop a range of guidance on the subject include nhs england ’s excellent incontinence care guidance in addition guideline from the national institute for health and care excellence set out the care that patient with spinal injury should receive include through a neurological bowel management programme 
 there be a clear need for a national policy on bowel care in nhs setting for people with spinal injury i have listen to patient who have be leave feel abandon and trap in a hospital bed without the basic dignity of be able to use the toilet all because of a lack of training for nurse in provide the necessary support will the minister meet i and representative of the spinal injuries association to discuss how we can make the situation well and ensure that nobody be deny this basic level of care 
 i pay tribute to the hon lady for the work that she and the all party parliamentary group on spinal cord injury have do on the issue i would be more than happy to meet they 
 what step her department be take to improve accident and emergency waiting time in east lancashire 
 just over a year ago we set out a plan to improve urgent and emergency care the plan be work at east lancashire hospitals nhs trust of a&e patient in march be see within hour that be percentage point well than last year the big year on year improvement outside the pandemic since we know that there be more to do that be why we be work with the nhs on year of the urgent and emergency care recovery plan 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response and grateful to she for agree to meet i and other local mp to discuss the emergency care situation in east lancashire could i ask she to go step far perhaps she and even the secretary of state could visit burnley general teaching hospital in my constituency meet the trust and see what more we can do there partly to reverse the disastrous decision of the last labour government to close the a&e there 
 i commend my hon friend and other east lancashire colleague for their campaigning on this matter i look forward to the meeting we be go to have to discuss the performance of his local a&e and i thank he very much for the invitation to visit 
 i share an integrate care board with   the hon member for burnley antony higginbotham   in lancashire and south cumbria do the minister agree that reason why there be such problem with a&e waiting time be the congestion in our hospital overall because of the number of people who be healthy and fit to leave hospital but can not have a health and care plan when they return home some of all bed in the morecambe bay hospital be occupy by people who be fit to leave but have no care package what plan do the minister have to address the social care crisis in cumbria that will include increase the amount of affordable housing so that people can afford to live in the   area pay carer more and have more intelligent visa rule 
 the hon gentleman make the point that the performance of a&e depend on the flow of patient through hospital and our ability to discharge they that be why as part of our work on urgent and emergency care we have invest in support hospital to discharge patient and have be support social care we have see an increase number of discharge across the country over the last year which have enable hospital to treat more people and support the improved performance in a&e that i mention we continue to work on that and of course we be support social care with up to £ extra funding over year 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of mental health support for nhs staff 
 every day nhs staff do an extraordinary job for their patient and it be vital that the nhs support they in maintain their mental health the long term workforce plan commit the nhs to support staff health and wellbeing and ask integrate care system to develop plan to support they i be pleased that nhs england be review mental health service for all staff to ensure that all staff in the nhs have the support that they need 
 fight to save a die child ’s life tell family that their love will not make it through the night and work desperately in substandard condition it will come as little shock to hear that all that take a toll last year mental health sick day be take across the nhs instead of receive support our nhs hero have a tory government who treat they with disdain and kick they to the kerb will the minister commit to fund the nhs practitioner health service beyond the next month or will the government just try to shut it down again 
 as an nhs community responder who serve on the frontline during the pandemic who have to see people say goodbye to their love one for the last time before be admit to hospital and who have deal with cardiac arrest i know the mental toll that work for or volunteer with the nhs can take on our workforce and therefore we do give a very high priority to the subject the nhs people plan set out a range of action to build a more modern compassionate and inclusive culture and include a much strong focus on the availability of quality health and wellbeing support it be right that we keep service under review so i will not make a commitment today to continue to fund something that we have agree to fund for another year while those service be review 
 what step she be take to improve healthcare for woman 
 we be focus on deliver our woman ’s health priority for recent success    include new woman ’s health hub opening across the country with £ of investment the investment of nearly £ over year in improve maternity safety on top of the extra £ already be invest each year the success of the hormone replacement therapy prepayment certificate and research into the important issue of maternity disparity which i have already mention 
 house of commons library figure reveal that in woman with suspect breast cancer be wait more than week to see a specialist the waiting list for gynaecological treatment have rise by in a year which mean that there be now almost woman wait which be up by a over year labour have pledge to tackle that backlog so that more woman be see fast how much pain misery or bad do woman have to endure before this government start prioritise their health 
 as the hon lady will know she see the statistic publish very recently we be in fact treat more people at early stage of their cancer i want to take on her point about gynaecological wait because that be important we be spend more than £ in this spending review period on additional elective activity and invest in additional capacity include community diagnostic centre and surgical hub many of which provide gynaecological test and procedure she may have miss it but the late publish management information for march show that the long wait for gynaecology service have reduce by nearly since their peak in september of course there be more to do but we be make progress i thank all the doctor and team who be involve in that important work 
 i call the shadow minister 
 today we have see alarming figure point to the systematic de prioritisation of woman ’s health with woman in england wait for gynaecological treatment woman wait more than a year and under third of eligible woman screen for breast cancer in the last year will the secretary of state come clean and admit that under this government woman ’s health have become an afterthought 
 that be absolute nonsense as i say i have prioritise woman ’s health i be pretty sure that i invite the hon lady to the woman ’s health summit early this year 
 indicate assent 
 she be very graciously say that i do the point be that i want woman to receive the sort of care that we would all hope and expect they to have i have prioritise that precisely because there be condition include gynaecological condition that have historically not receive the attention they deserve as our woman ’s health ambassador dame lesley regan say the nhs be create by man for man i be the health secretary who be sort that out 
 what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care 
 what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care 
 what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care 
 we be enormously grateful for the work of gps in deliver more appointment nationally than in our primary care recovery plan enhance gp access by expand community pharmacy service nationwide some of community pharmacy have sign up to the pharmacy offer with over consultation claim in the month 
 across bedfordshire we suffer from patient to gp ratio that be well in excess of the national average high housing growth be simply not match by gp capacity at wixams we have be able to break through year of deadlock by put stakeholder together but issue still remain across the county from shefford to stondon heartbreaking story be commonplace the issue be not icb specific it affect people right across the country what more can we do to ensure that area with high housing growth have the gp capacity that resident deserve 
 the hon gentleman raise a really important point he may be aware that the bedfordshire luton and milton keynes icb receive £ for its operational capital budget in with over £ for this spending review period that operational capital be core funding provide to icb for deliver primary care among other thing in addition he will be aware that icb be able to provide input to planning permission to ensure that primary care be deliver where there be new housing development i have work with other hon member across the house to tackle this issue and i be very happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 when i speak to my constituent in brislington they tell i they have to wait an inordinate time to get through on the phone to their gps at the brooklea health centre and wait over week for appointment constituent in fishponds have be tell that it be over an hour ’s wait for prescription medication at the local pharmacy and we all know the situation with dentist the other thing my constituent be wait for be a general election do the minister agree that that be the only way we will sort out these problem in the nhs 
 i certainly do not agree if labour be in government we would see significantly bad outcome covid be a once in-100 year pandemic and we have pull out all the stop to recover from that it be a huge tribute to all those work in primary care that they have do so well in the hon lady ’s icb bristol north north somerset and south gloucestershire   of all appointment be deliver on the same day they be book in february this year and be deliver within week of booking with of they face to face these be extremely positive number for the appointment deliver in february what be really important be that the number of patient care staff have increase by full time equivalent since 
 i have listen to the minister ’s comment but the number of patient per gp in the bedfordshire luton and milton keynes area be nearly high than the national average will the minister explain why her government think it be a good idea to cut the proportion of doctor be train as gps from around in to around in 
 the hon lady be simply wrong she will be aware that in fact our long term workforce plan be intend to raise the number of training place for gps to by in we have over new gps apply to take training place an absolute record there be much more to do and i be work with gps on a future for gp practice taskforce to make sure that we do everything we can include hire the additional professional now work in gp practice in order to relieve the pressure on gps and deliver much well patient access 
 last week a constituent contact i to say that her tooth crumble during pregnancy and she be unable to get a dentist appointment another constituent who be in agony desperately plead for help to find a dentist my own son clifford have be wait year for a tooth extraction and i have receive hundred of email about similar issue it be simply not good enough what plan do the government have to sort this out once and for all and what advice do the minister have for my constituent 
 my hon friend raise an incredibly important point we know that because all dentist be lock down during covid the recovery in access to nhs care have not be as fast as we would like that be why we announce our dentistry recovery plan include a new patient premium which since it be launch on   march have already see hundred of thousand of new nhs patient who have not see a dentist in year some dentist will receive golden hello to encourage they to work in underserved area we also have our new smile for life prevention programme which will ensure that baby receive an early dental check for their milk tooth in family hub and that pregnant mum receive well dental care and advice we be now try to work with dentist to look at reform of the unit of dental activity contract but follow the meeting of the group yesterday it seem that dentist feel that all the parameter be in place what we now need to do be ensure that the incentive be there and that we see thing change rapidly 
 my gps be work extraordinarily hard to increase access in the face of ever increase public demand i be alarm by the labour party ’s talk about scrap the gp partnership   model as i find in the stroud district that gp practice be some of the most efficient part of our nhs service they need support the removal of bureaucracy and the opening up of fund pot rather than dismantle will my right hon friend explain how access to primary care would not be help by remove the partnership model and what be the government do to help icb create more flexible partnership fund pot 
 my hon friend make a fantastic point and i say again that gps absolutely underpin our primary care we all absolutely rely on they and our measure to create additional role in gp practice will provide they with the additional capacity they need so that they can serve their patient well that be good for patient good for primary care and incredibly good value for the taxpayer it be ludicrous that labour be propose to undermine the gp partnership model that would be a disaster for primary care 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 we know that people in work lead happy healthier life however over not fit for work fit note be issue last year most be repeat fit note issue without any advice so we be miss a golden opportunity to give million of people the support they need to remain in work that be why we be launch a reform of the fit note process to create a new system in which fit note conversation focus on what people can do not what they can not do as part of this the government will consider shift the responsibility for issue fit note away from gps to reduce the pressure they face and to free up million of appointment i thank everyone who have deliver this vital work and i very much look forward to hear the result of the call for evidence in due course so that we can reform our welfare system for the sake of our constituent and our gps 
 accord to the association of british healthtech industries it take on average year for lifesaving and life enhance technology to be adopt in the nhs what step be my right hon friend take to speed up the adoption of new technology so that the nhs can save more life and improve patient outcome 
 i dispute the year figure as it can vary across innovation the figure be contest but my hon friend raise an important point we have a plan to prioritise the acceleration of patient access thereby ensure safe effective and innovative medical technology for patient and the nhs our ambition be back by funding and we be reform the medical technology regulatory framework introduce the innovative device access pathway pilot and launch framework to increase the availability of innovative product for the sake of patient across england and the united kingdom 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the health secretary have promise that the government will provide an   extra dental appointment this year but the dentistry minister   the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom say the figure have 
 a high likelihood of not be reliable 
 which of they be wrong 
 i be delighted to be able to tell the hon gentleman that we have model down the ambition so the figure we initially provide be high than appointment that be because we be focus on deliver the dental recovery plan rather than overpromise 
 the hon gentleman find it easy to call our child short and fat but he shy away from welfare reform call it shameless and irresponsible he say he be ready to stand up to middle class lefty but labour have never put patient by condemn the union that strike he make glossy promise about reform the nhs in england yet labour have fail completely 
 order i gently say that we need to get a lot of back benchers in and i be sure both side want to do that 
 the last labour government deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history which be a record that the right hon lady ’s government can not begin to touch 
 back to dentistry the chief dental officer say the announcement be nowhere near enough the british dental association say 
 this recovery plan be not worthy of the title 
 it also say that the recovery plan will not stop the exodus of dentist and will not meet the government ’s target who should the public trust and why should they trust the health secretary to deliver when her own adviser her own minister and crucially dentist all say that she be brush the truth under the carpet 
 again let we bring ourselves back up to date i know the labour party like look back to the last time it find favour with the british public but wales be the up to date record of today labour ’s lamentable record of run the nhs in wales speak for itself if the hon gentleman be so set on reform why on earth be he not help his labour colleague in wales to do exactly as he be promise it be because they be empty promise and because the hon gentleman and i be afraid the labour party will step back from reform rather than grapple with the issue as we be do with our recovery plan

 as my right hon friend have already hear from my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel the mid and south essex icb have publish proposal to close st peter ’s hospital in maldon and to relocate   medical service elsewhere despite the huge growth take place in the town i have to say to the secretary of state that my constituent have little confidence in the consultation will she therefore look closely at the outcome and if necessary intervene to ensure that my constituent be still able to access vital health service within the town 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise that matter i understand that a consultation be conduct locally and that more than local people and staff respond their feedback will be analyse by an independent research agency which will produce a report for the mid and south essex icb and a meeting be due to take place in public in july i will of course continue to take an interest in this matter 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the recent announcement on fit note reform be just the late in a long string of attack on the most vulnerable people in society sick and disabled people be be vilify when as the joseph rowntree foundation point out almost third of those live in destitution live with a chronic health condition or a disability the uk government be continue their track record in failing and make life more difficult for disabled people do the secretary of state understand how much more difficult these change will make people ’s life 
 these reform be be bring forward because of a simply unsustainable rise in the number of people be give fit note so that they can not re enter the world of work we want to support people into work not only because we believe that it be the good way to help they to recover but because it help we to fund the nhs it be fund by people who work and pay their taxis again i draw the hon lady ’s attention to matter a little close to home sadly scotland ’s record on health be very difficult to read and it include the bad level of drug death in europe i encourage she to concentrate on how the snp be run health service in its local area 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the british psychological society have commend the benefit of government support for staff mental health and wellbee hub and be keen to see that support continue will the minister therefore give an update on the support be provide and the progress be make on the vital issue of staff mental health and wellbeing 
 that be an important point we know how vital it be to support everyone who be work so hard in our nhs to support patient nhs england be review mental health service for all staff who need they to ensure that they can access the support they need it be work collaboratively with region and integrate care system to agree the good approach to do that 
 there be an increase incidence of bowel cancer among young patient such as my constituent emily who receive a late diagnosis after many month of   attend her gp with iron deficiency anaemia young patient often report that bowel cancer be dismiss as a possibility by their gp because of their age and that symptom such as iron deficiency anaemia be not take seriously enough and be not include currently on the list of common symptom on the nhs website what be the secretary of state do to ensure that nhs guideline and practice be fit for purpose for young patient who far too often receive a late diagnosis of bowel cancer 
 the hon lady make an important point as part of the nhs long term plan we have an ambition to diagnose of all stageable cancer at stage or by that mean that we need to make significant improvement on the hard to detect cancer such as bowel cancer we be work across system to deliver those improvement not only with well screening programme but by improve patient pathway however i be more than happy to meet she if she want to have a further conversation specifically about bowel cancer

 the main issue raise by resident at the community coffee morning at the compton centre in leeds yesterday be the difficulty in get access to dentist the secretary of state struggle to give any credible answer on this question today be she aware of the dentist for all campaign in   and will she back it its demand be to provide access to an nhs dentist for everyone to restore funding for dental service and recruit more nhs dentist and to change the contract because they be simply not fit for purpose do the secretary of state agree with that and if not why not 
 we switch on our fully fund dental recovery plan in case the hon gentleman be not listen carefully early on   march nearly more practice in england be accept new adult patient than at the end of january and even more will do so under the dental recovery plan we have plan to bring in new dental van to help our most isolated community we be also bring in the smile4life programme for child because prevention must be a critical part of our dental recovery plan

 i thank my hon friend for raise that matter which show the cynicism with which the tobacco and vaping industry be approach these landmark public health reform on vape we have commit to consult on the power that we be adopt in the bill precisely because we want to ensure that the regulation when they come to the fore address the reality of the market and the cynicism of the company behind it and help to ensure that our child do not continue be ply with these horrible item to get they hooked on nicotine 
 i be disappointed to see the chair of my local hospital trust and the east midland labour mayoral candidate use my hospital as a political campaign prop by invite the shadow health and social care secretary and the leader of the opposition to canvass patient and staff can the minister please explain to i how we can rein in this type of gutter politic and prevent my local hospital be use for labour ’s dog whistle politic 
 this be a very serious matter which i have raise with the chief executive of nhs england and ask she to raise with the regional director and nottinghamshire integrate care board we have do so because we believe that it might be a breach of the nolan principle

 i thank the hon lady for raise this and i very much send our good wish to her constituent the hon lady raise a really important point the symptom that woman can experience be often very different for condition relate not just to cancer but to heart attack for example part of my prioritisation of woman ’s health be to get that message out to clinician so that as this case demonstrate so tragically they be able to make the good and most prompt diagnosis for all woman 
 what be the secretary of state do to ensure that the uk health security agency have the budget and the capability it need the recent expansion of bird flu among mammal in the united states be a salutary lesson thankfully there be no sign yet of human to human transmission but it remind we of the incredible value and importance of be vigilant in this space and have the good possible technology ready to respond as soon as possible 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question and of course for his integral role not just during the pandemic but in set up the ukhsa he will understand that i and other be keep this under very close review and the chief medical officer be brief i as and when need

 for over a decade the camberwell dialysis unit have provide high quality nhs care to patient in south london so my constituent be shock to hear that these service be to be outsource to diaverum a multinational for profit health corporation which have already have of its clinic rat inadequate and put into special measure do the minister accept that privatise the nhs bit by bit   have disastrous implication for care and will he listen to patient in my constituency and commit to maintain our nhs dialysis provision 
 that sum up the usual contradiction on privatisation between labour front benchers and back benchers any service change should be base on clear evidence that they will deliver well patient outcome in lambeth patient who receive dialysis at the new site in brixton will receive care in a significantly improve environment with brand new facility in a great example of an innovative public private partnership nhs england have establish the renal service transformation programme to reduce unwarranted variation in the quality of access to renal care 
 will my hon friend join i in recognise the good work that the essex partnership university nhs foundation trust have be do to improve mental health outcome include the creation of a pioneer urgent mental health care centre provide urgent help when it be need be that a model that could be roll out across the country to improve access to mental health for all

 i would be delighted to join my hon friend and i thank he again for a really positive visit to his local hospital that be a great example of a local mp work in his local area for his constituent and what be more deliver for they 
 as a practical measure to improve radiotherapy waiting time will the minister agree to further work on the radiotherapy dataset to include the collection of datum on delay at each stage of the radiotherapy pathway and by tumour type so that we can well understand pinch point in service 
 we be work to improve radiotherapy service across the nhs and i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that in more detail 
 west hertfordshire hospital trust be at the front of the queue for the new hospital programme we have the land planning permission build design political and staff support and enable work be under way but like many other trust around the country the hospital trust be be ask to submit business case after business case will the secretary of state clarify whether those delay be down to bureaucracy and the new hospital programme or be they deliberate delay tactic by a government who do not want to release fund to hospital before the general election 
 normally a secretary of state would appear at the dispatch box after a question like that and say i refer the hon member to the answer i give early on this occasion i will refer she to the question from my hon friend   the member for watford dean russell he have just set out the business case for watford general which be great news and i hope she will join he and i in welcome that new hospital when it be open 
 urgent question to ask the minister for the cabinet office to make a statement on the evidence uncover of experiment on child and the contaminate blood scandal and update the house on the action that the government be take on the interim report from sir brian langstaff 
 let i start by state that the story report in the recent bbc news article and indeed the sunday times report by caroline wheeler demonstrate the unimaginable suffering of all those impact by this dreadful scandal as the house will know in the government establish an independent public statutory inquiry chair by sir brian langstaff to give those impact and their family the answer that they deserve 
 since it be establish the inquiry have take evidence from a range of source and the testimony be indicative of the bravery of every individual who have come forward the infected blood inquiry ’s final report be due to be publish within a month on   may and we expect the inquiry ’s finding to cover a set of extremely challenging issue it would not be right for the government to pre empt the finding of this long prepared and carefully consider report but the government have commit to update parliament through an oral statement on next step within sit day follow   may it be our intention to make that statement as soon as possible the day stipulation be a deadline and certainly not a target 
 in january this year i appoint an expert group to provide technical advice to the cabinet office in respond to the infected blood inquiry ’s recommendation on compensation that work be well under way and will build on the recommendation of the infected blood inquiry to inform the government ’s substantive response to the inquiry ’s recommendation on compensation the government understand the need to move quickly to provide compensation to victim of infected blood most recently we table amendment just last wednesday to the victims and prisoners bill to impose a duty on the government to establish an infected blood compensation scheme it also establish a new arm ’s length body name the infected blood compensation authority to deliver the compensation scheme it will operate on a uk wide basis to ensure parity and consistency that demonstrate our absolute commitment to deliver long overdue justice to victim of infected blood 
 we understand that for many there be an urgent need for compensation as the house will know in october the government pay more than £ in interim compensation to help to ease the short term need of those infect the government amendment also include a statutory duty to make interim payment of £ to the estate of the deceased infected people who be register with exist or former support scheme where previous interim payment have not already be make to infect individual or their bereaved partner that be an important step forward to   get substantial compensation into the hand of family and victim of infected blood should that government amendment be support in the other place it will return to this house for debate in the usual process of commons consideration of lords amendment 
 we know that more than people have already die in the bad treatment disaster in the history of the nhs another have die since the public inquiry start in with people die on average every week people have die since sir brian make his final recommendation on pay compensation in april he say that 
 wrong be do at individual collective and systemic level 
 he also say that in all conscience he could not wait until his final report be publish to tell the government to start pay compensation 
 last week hugh pym of the bbc produce shocking evidence about child even baby be experiment on in the 1970 and 1980 without their parent consent these disturbing revelation raise serious criminal and ethical issue for the nhs and the medical profession there be possible breach of the nuremberg code alongside that the sunday times and caroline wheeler in particular launch a campaign at the weekend for compensation to be pay now to those infect and affect by the contaminated blood scandal so far more than mp have back the campaign and party be represent include leader 
 last week the government finally lay those amendment to the victims and prisoners bill in the other place after this house force the government to act in december last year this weekend ministers confirm that even when sir brian produce his final report on   may the government may not respond until as late as   july meanwhile there have be no announcement on compensation funding or on any compensation scheme despite the government have accept the moral case for compensation 
 what action be the government take follow last week ’s bbc story on the experiment on child when will sir brian ’s recommendation on compensation be implement in full on what date will payment be make to those infected and affected why have the interim payment not be make as sir brian recommend last april how will those infect and affect be involve in the whole scheme why be minister reject the month timeframe for set up a compensation body that this house agree to in december last year and sir brian ’s recommendation that it should be judge lead 
 on all side of the house members know that when people be die justice delay be justice deny the time to act be now 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question and initial comment nobody in this house have do more than she to advance the interest of the infected and affected community as i have say consistently since i take office on   november i recognise her frustration and be do everything i can to address they last week i meet she and other chairs across party as i do just before the easter recess and i will continue to update she as regularly as i can 
 the right hon lady draw attention to commentary from hugh pym and other journalist about speculation and allegation which i believe sir brian langstaff ’s   report when it be publish on   may should give substantive airing to draw on the evidence collect it would be reasonable for the government to wait for that authoritative statement on what information and evidence they have gather before we respond but that do not mean that since i take office i have be do anything other than move forward everything i can on compensation as quickly as possible 
 the right hon lady be quite right to say that over death have occur since include last year i recognise that the challenge of urgently secure interim payment in term of the mechanic of how it be do be not a concern of the infected and affected community she quite reasonably stand up and urge speed on that and i be do what i can the statutory duty to make an interim payment of £ to the estate of the deceased infected people be the time that we have put in legislation a duty to pay compensation before the ad hoc scheme which over the past or year have never admit culpability i have also put into legislation with the consent of both houses the need to set up the arm ’s length body and make it as operational as soon as possible 
 as i discuss with the right hon lady last week my concern be to get that arm ’s length body up and run as quickly as possible and there be a legal obligation to do so when royal assent be gain there be no statutory deadline but there be a responsibility to do that i recognise the concern around a judge lead body indeed sir brian langstaff ’s report suggest that a judge lead body would be desirable i do not rule that out but at this stage it seem reasonable not to confine it in legislation in case another candidate become available clearly however gain the confidence of the affected and infected community be absolutely integral to this process work as i say i be do everything i can to bring forward the government ’s substantive response on the wide issue of compensation as near as i can to the   may and i will update the house as often as i can indeed i have make time available tomorrow for an open surgery for any mp who want to bring case to i 
 i call the father of the house 
 may i follow the tribute to the great dame the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for what she have be do 
 i have be actively involve in this in way or another for year we all know that the justification for have the langstaff inquiry have be the information that have now come out in public which be conceal or not know over the decade we also know that this be different from most of the discussion in the pearson report on whether there should be compensation when thing go wrong in medical treatment this report be likely to show how since the war people have not pay enough attention to the warning give by those in the field with the update of caroline wheeler ’s book and the bbc programme we now know that as well as the haemophilia trial publish in the 1970 the 1980s trial show massive defect by the standard of those day let alone by up to date standard 
 i join the right hon lady in ask the minister when it will be possible for people to register their name background and circumstance for compensation do   we have to wait until a month ’s time for that to happen and how will it be deal with obviously as the cabinet office minister he follow his predecessor in carry this responsibility but how far will the department of health and social care be involve and will other departments be involve 
 my hon friend make wise observation i do not mean not to pay tribute to he in a similar way his commitment to this cause probably over my lifetime be extraordinary 
 in respect of the £ payment announce through the government amendment table last wednesday we will be work with the exist support scheme to expedite they as quickly as possible for the estate of the decease infected on the substantive response on the wide complete compensation through last week ’s intervention and building on the amendment of   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson we have establish the delivery vehicle for compensation 
 on the challenge that we be somehow delay compensation which be reasonably make i think that what i have say to the house this afternoon make it clear that we be commit in legislation to deliver that compensation but that the term of how we   do so and how we respond to translate those recommendation into reality be ongoing work that i will seek to address substantively as soon as possible by   may 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   on secure an urgent question on this vital issue nobody could fail to be move by the scale of the horror and injustice of this scandal the late revelation about apparent experiment on child to which the urgent question relate be truly appalling and show yet again how badly the victim have be let down i pay tribute to all those who have campaign so hard on the issue 
 as part of deliver the justice that be so long overdue the government must now deliver on the compensation scheme time be of the essence every week that pass without further government action matter those who be infect with contaminate blood be die at a rate of every day minister have repeatedly accept the moral case for compensation but victim understandably have little faith and want to see firm action that be why labour be very disturbed to hear that the government have table an amendment to undo the cross party change to the victims and prisoners bill pass by this house in december last year the change that the government want would have the effect of remove a clear commitment to deliver on the compensation scheme within month of the bill ’s passing yet another miss opportunity yet another delay 
 i would be grateful if the minister answer the following question will the government now consider accept the cross party consensus of establish a clear month limit for the setting up of the scheme can the minister confirm when victim can expect to receive final compensation payment follow the publication of sir brian langstaff ’s review 
 i thank the hon lady for her question respectfully the amendment table by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north be dependent on royal assent i have try to make it effective by put an obligation on the set up as soon as royal assent be grant which will speed it up i be work on operational matter around how such a body would work 
 the hon lady ask i as everyone do about the government ’s substantive response on compensation more broadly as i have indicate i appoint the expert group in january to examine some of the issue in the recommendation such as the need for redress for those live with chronic hepatitis b when that chronic infection definition do not exist i have be seek professional advice on the operationalisation of the recommendation the conclusion of those deliberation and the quantification and discernment of compensation will be a matter for the government when the final report have be publish 
 like other i have case that have be wait decade for a resolution and which be pursue by my predecessor when will those affect be able to start apply for compensation 
 i refer my hon friend to my reply a few moment ago about the £ payment to the estate of deceased infected person the ultimate compensation will depend on what be arrange through conversation across whitehall as soon as possible after   may we be make good progress and i want to bring that forward as quickly as i can after   may give the will of the house and the letter sign by so many mp it be pretty clear that it be on the government to deliver and that be what i be seek to do as quickly as i can 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 i pay tribute to   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who have do so much and to journalist such as caroline wheeler of the sunday times and all those who have campaign for decade despite their own very deep trauma they include jan smith the mother of colin of the young victim who be infect at only month old and who die aged only she say in the sunday times at the weekend 
 when we find out little colin be go to be treat by a world renowne haematologist we be over the moon professor bloom be like a god to we and we do not question he we think our son be be give the good possible treatment but we will feel forever guilty that we have in fact hand our son over to his killer 
 these parent should not be burden with this guilt an estimated child be infect in a massive breach of trust and medical ethic it be every parent ’s bad nightmare what do the minister say to the parent of child who be use as guinea pig in an utterly despicable practice that be make bad by the lack of redress for those family when will all those infected and affect receive the compensation they be due and an apology from this government 
 i can reassure the hon lady that i be do everything i can to bring that forward as quickly as possible i recognise that the distress be widespread   and be feel by individual and family across the united kingdom i be work across the devolved administration to ensure that there be a uk wide arm ’s length body my official be work with prominent charity organisation and support group i be reach out to they to share progress reassure the community that i have hear their concern and seek their view in advance of   may i be do that out of deep respect for the suffering that they have experience on the substantive matter the hon lady ask i about i refer she to my reply a few moment ago 
 when i be health secretary i commit the government to ensure that the compensation recommend by sir brian be pay and make the moral case that the uk government must address this wrong the story from caroline wheeler and hugh pym have make that moral case strong still can i push the minister to move as fast as possible but hold in his mind the critical nature of get the response right as well i commend his official who have work so hard on this matter for so long i entirely understand the need for urgency but he must get it right at the same time he be a diligent and deeply honourable man and i hope he will hold that in his heart as he address the issue in the week to come 
 i thank my right hon friend for his remark and for what he have do on this matter he be right i feel responsibility both to get the substantive announcement agree as quickly as possible and to ensure clear communication with the infected and affected community so that they have clear expectation of what will happen follow that announcement from all i have read and all that my official have brief i on i recognise that this be likely to be of the big scandal in the nhs that this country have see i respect sir brian langstaff and his extensive work over several year i wait respectfully for his final report on the wide issue on   may 
 my constituent contact i again yesterday his father and uncle be all infect with contaminate blood and all but of the uncle have now die he say to i 
 i have to grow up in care due to my father be too ill to look after i we have be fight for many many year for justice 
 he think that the government be drag their foot on compensate victim he be right be n’t he 
 all i can do be account for what i have do since   november i can not really comment on the several decade previous to that as the hon lady will know we have have a series of ad hoc scheme but the government ’ accept culpability for what happen many year ago and the subsequent failure to respond will need to be address fully after   may the government ’s amendment in the house of lords be the time that we will have put in legislation a duty to pay compensation that be the start of a more comprehensive response that i be work on to secure collective agreement across government and i want to bring that forward as quickly as i be able to do so 
 the langstaff recommendation for interim payment be because of the need for speed because people be so ill how many people do the government believe to be still live who   be infect in this scandal how many of they apply for the interim payment what proportion of those who apply have receive the payment if my right hon friend do not have the figure with he today will he undertake to write to i and place a copy of the letter in the house of commons library 
 my right hon friend customarily ask precise and penetrate question i do not want to quote the few figure that i think i know so i will write he a consider reply which i will make available far too many people have suffer and far too many have die we need to put this right as quickly as possible 
 i congratulate   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   on her work to date when i engage with my constituent it be clear that not only have they lose love one to a preventable and painful death but the stigma that those love one live with during their life be part of the issue member across the house rightly want answer about the interim payment because those family have receive no compensation and no apology to date if the minister can not give a date that people can expect payment can he at least give some clarity on how they will be able   to apply 
 i agree entirely with the hon lady with respect to the stigma can not fail to be move by the account of people in the 1980 when they contract hiv the stigma in society be very different from where we be today that have cause damage to relationship to life and obviously to health many people ’s case have be terminal 
 the statutory duty to make interim payment of £ to the estate of deceased infected people will be carry out through the exist scheme we be work with those scheme to work out how good to do that that be different from recommendation in that the government take the view that we do not want to overwhelm the will of the estate rather than divide it up among family member which could be problematic and would cause delay while i can not give an authoritative date now urgent work be ongoing to give clarity on the process for those people to register and to receive those payment 
 the infected blood scandal be of the big stain on the history of the nhs i be pleased to hear that we be get interim payment out as quickly as possible but the minister have talk about give payment to deceased people ’s estate rather than name individual could he outline his reasoning we want to make sure that compensation go to the correct people quickly 
 my hon friend make a very good point of the challenge be that some cohort of people be not register but have be part of a scheme that do not now exist how do we well expedite the process across that affected community those be the sort of practical issue that i be work through with official so that we can reach the good possible solution when we give our comprehensive response in due course 
 cheap than chimpanzee be how former pupil of treloar ’s school describe themselves when they give evidence to the inquiry my constituent lee moorey be of the pupil of that school and have describe to i how he feel that he be experiment on all those year ago we have set up the brian langstaff inquiry what more can the government possibly want to know than what that inquiry be go to uncover and why be they delay compensation will the minister confirm that nothing have be prevent the government from pay compensation since the date that brian langstaff publish his interim report last april 
 there be a challenge in translate recommendation into number and into the reality of a transmission mechanism as well as in the quantification and agreement across whitehall the work on the part be under way that be why we have engage the expert to work out how to quantify the payment that will be due across different head of loss quite reasonably those number be not in the report it would not be for sir brian langstaff to put number on every single individual but that work be under way we be now work to agree the substantive response as soon as we can after the final report be publish 
 this week i will be use the mechanism of this house to do something that in year as an mp i have never before feel the need to do present a petition at the top of that petition will be the name of my constituent andrew evans of the child who be infect with hepatitis and hiv by a miracle he survive to set up and help run the tainted blood campaign like many of my affected and infected constituent he feel that this process have already go on for too long so i be very grateful to   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   for secure this urgent question 
 i be also grateful to my right hon friend the minister for the update he have give particularly about support for the estate of the deceased however i urge he to continue to meet group such as tainted blood and make sure that the communication on this issue be as clear and open as possible so that those group be engage and can support their member as the process move forward and to do so as fast as possible 
 i thank my hon friend both for what he have say today and for his engagement privately in recent week i agree with everything he have say and i have hear his challenge to be clear about communication to prominent charity organisation and support group letter be send by my official yesterday evening to set up those meeting i have talk to cross party representative of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood seek input on the name of group i be try to respect their confidence while also meet as many representative group as possible and to do that well before   may 
 this be surely the bad health scandal that we have see with government after government kick the can down the road we need to accept that there be a need for change include a change in speed and urgency the   continue delay and prevarication i regret to say that it feel like we have see some more of that today exacerbate the suffering we know that people be die every week the minister must know that the delay on this issue be indefensible and he must know its impact do he appreciate why such a large number of member be push for action now and do he understand that that be what we need he to deliver 
 yes i do understand that i deeply respect the view of colleague who have make strong representation on this matter and i be do everything i can to move it forward as urgently as i can i will not repeat myself regard the thing i have say with respect to step take last week or the spirit in which i be engage and the reason why i be do it but i agree with the hon lady that speed be absolutely of the essence 
 there have be a lot of speculation in article in recent day and most prominently in caroline wheeler ’s book about the wide issue what go wrong and why these thing happen those matter will need to be address but through the lens of sir brian langstaff ’s report which will be publish finally on   may 
 i commend my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   not just for secure this urgent question but for all the work that she and other in this place have do on this important matter 
 sir brian langstaff make his final recommendation on compensation early a whole year ago and recommend that the compensatory body make payment by last december he do so because he be worried about the effect of a delay on the affected and infect we have miss all of those deadline be this what sir brian ’s bad fear look like 
 i sincerely hope not what i have say with respect to the interim payment be a response to the dialogue i have have with member across both chambers of the house work with earl howe in the other place i have be pretty clear that in i be do everything i can to put preparation in place for give a legal entity the obligation to pay compensation and to minimise delay in advance of the final determination of the government ’s response so that that response can be operationalise as soon as the decision be finally make 
 every time we have these urgent question we get a well intentione minister give a helpful but frustrating update about what be happen this minister be of the most well intentione and today ’s statement have be of the most helpful but what we want to hear as the house have say clearly today be a clear timeline for when application for compensation can be make and when those payment will be make he have come really close to tell we that today can i encourage he to get over the line tell we when it be go to happen and satisfy all of we who be stand here on behalf of our constituent 
 the hon gentleman make a very fair and reasonable point i would wish to say more than i be say today but we have not quite get to that point i be do everything i can to get there 
 on the hon gentleman ’s specific point about the mechanic of engagement with community i be very seized of the need to have a clear narrative for each different cohort so that we can be crystal clear when those decision be make i recognise how frustrating this be obviously agree quantify and make provision for those thing be a collective process across government and i be do everything i can use my experience from several year in the treasury it be helpful that the chancellor of the exchequer be health secretary when the public inquiry be set up and i be work with colleague across whitehall to deliver this as quickly as i can 
 of the most upsetting aspect of this whole tragedy be the thought of those pupil at treloar school be experiment on like lab rat as of the pupil say they include brother michael and bill payne and i meet their widow cath and margaret over the easter recess in bristol i accept that the minister be try to give detailed answer and that there be complexity but what it really come down to be the deep deep wrong that be do to those little boy at treloar ’s and compensation and apology be owe to those people can i ask what the minister be do to communicate as clearly and effectively as possible with the family of those affect so that they feel they be not be swamp by bureaucracy and that answer be close at hand 
 i have reach out to prominent charity organisation and support group to share the progress that have be make i have to respect the fact that we need to do that through the parliamentary process last wednesday and to seek their view but not to replicate the considerable trauma that they go through give evidence in an incredibly painful fashion through sir brian langstaff ’s inquiry i be meet those charity organisation and support group i obviously can not meet every single individual but i be try to use those meeting to inform the response of the government and to make representation to my colleague about what need to be do so that we can land this in the most effective place as soon as we can from   may 
 do the minister recognise that many people feel that the state with all its delay in deliver justice to the victim of this scandal and their family have utterly fail to recognise adequately the egregious harm that have be inflict and continue to be inflict on those impact leave ten of thousand of victim and their family in great suffering as they continue to wait for compensation 
 yes i recognise that all delay be painful and frustrating and cause distress that be why i be do everything i can to move this forward as quickly as i can i be sorry that that be repetitious but it be the truth i think i have update the house meaningfully today on the legislation i know what we need to do which be to get to   may   and as soon as possible come up with a comprehensive response on behalf of all   those who have lose their life and the family who have be ruin by this absolute scandal that have happen over year 
 may i also give my thank to my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   for secure this urgent question it give i the opportunity to raise the case of my constituent mark fox who contract hepatitis c from infected blood when he be give a transfusion he be just year of age at the time he be give contaminate factor viii for his haemophilia he be unaware of his hepatitis c diagnosis until he be when he be in care he have be live with the health consequence of this scandal for over   year he lose his job and we have mention the stigma i say with all due respect to the minister because i know he be do his good that interim payment will offer a way of bring relief to some of the survivor mark have ask i to ask the minister how many more year he will have to wait before he receive either an interim payment or full and fair compensation for the suffering that he have endure 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his heartfelt representation on behalf of his constituent mark fox and i be sincerely sorry for what he have experience i be do everything i can to bring as much clarity as possible but i can not give the hon gentleman a definitive timetable today i be work towards i hope give a definitive timetable at the point of or very soon after the publication of this final report i will do everything i can to bring clarity to all group involve
