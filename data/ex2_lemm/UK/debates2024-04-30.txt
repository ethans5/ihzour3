the deputy foreign secretary be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the blue belt programme on ocean health 
 the blue belt programme support the protection and sustainable management of sq km of ocean around britain ’s overseas territory 
 the blue belt programme directly fund by the foreign commonwealth and development office be a fantastic way not only to help with climate change but to improve our environment of the big threat to ocean be plastic so will the government consider strengthen the un global plastic treaty in the upcoming negotiation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be interesting to note that of plastic pollution in the pacific and indian ocean come from just river and therefore an international treaty really matter the point he make be a good and it be at the centre of negotiation which the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for taunton deane rebecca pow be talk about last week in ottawa 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the deputy foreign secretary will be aware that over of the uk ’s biodiversity be within the overseas territory i be privileged last summer to visit st helena in the atlantic ocean where i be amazed by the natural biodiversity both on the island and in the sea around it what more help be the british government give to the overseas territory government to ensure that their biodiversity can be enhance and maintain 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman have have a chance to visit st helena as have i in the past it be of the most remarkable place on earth on the issue of clean up the ocean and plastic i can tell he that the uk be a found member of the high ambition coalition to end plastic pollution which be a group of country whose central aim be to stop   plastic flow into the environment by the overseas territory be not supplier of plastic but they be receiver of a lot of it and that be why this be so important 
 the recent environmental audit committee report on the arctic and the current on the antarctic both of which i chair have call attention to the excellent blue belt programme and how very important it be in the arctic and the southern ocean of our recommendation be that the programme would work properly only if all the minister responsible for the arctic in different department get together on a reasonably regular basis to discuss it can the deputy foreign secretary please advise on whether that committee have meet or what plan he have to call the meeting 
 my hon friend make an important point and i be advise that the meeting be i think today 
 many of my constituent have write to i concerned that the uk be delay its ratification of the global ocean treaty which could limit human activity in what would be know as sanctuary area in order to protect valuable marine life have a minister make an assessment of how that could work with the blue belt programme to ensure that our overseas territory have the high possible protection for their water and their biodiversity 
 the hon lady make a good point the government be extremely well join up on that i make the point early about the defra minister work closely with the foreign office on these matter so i think she can reassure her constituent that that matter be very much in hand 
 what recent step he have take through the un security council to support progress towards a sustainable peace in the middle east 
 the uk play a lead role in secure the passage of security council resolution and which set out the urgent demand for expand humanitarian access 
 the way to a sustainable peace as my right hon friend say be through humanitarian access could he please confirm what the uk government be do to ensure the full funding of unrwa again and what they will do to stop the hamas terrorist group affect the supply of aid to palestinian citizen 
 my hon friend be right about the importance of aid get in and unrwa be a critical organisation in achieve that he will know that we have have a chance to look at the colonna report and i speak about this matter with the un secretary general yesterday when i be in new york we be wait for the report of the office of internal oversight services which we expect to hear about soon and we will then   reach our conclusion on the good way of get aid into gaza my hon friend may rest assure that we be do everything we can to ensure that aid get in 
 next sunday will mark day since the international court of justice warn of a genocide in gaza yet the israeli military continue to ignore the legally bind order of the world ’s high court continue to bomb gaza indiscriminately and continue to block vital humanitarian aid all while the uk stand by and let the right wing netanyahu cabinet blatantly undermine the court ’s legitimacy 
 can the minister explain to i just what blatantly disregard international court and openly violate un ceasefire resolution mean for the rule base order he claim to uphold because to i my constituent the palestinians and countless persecute group across the world frankly these rule be now not worth the paper they be write on 
 what the hon gentleman say the way he reflect on what the icj say be not accurate the icj call for hostage release for more aid into gaza and for israel not to commit act that violate the right of palestinians the government agree with those point 
 will the deputy foreign secretary take the message back to his boss that the insertion of british troop on the ground in gaza will simply play into the hand of those who wish to divert attention far away from the existential conflict between russia and ukraine do he share my sadness that there be not a single mention of ukraine in any of the question on today ’s order paper 
 my right hon friend will know that the government be absolutely committed to do everything we can to help ukraine he will have see the prime minister ’s announcement last week on the increase in defence spending and where that announcement be make 
 i very much hope that my right hon friend will not draw any conclusion from today ’s order paper but note specifically this government ’s drive ambition to ensure that ukraine be successful in beat back the russians 
 the creation of a sustainable peace in the middle east will require the establishment of a palestinian state within the border the deputy foreign secretary will know that prime minister netanyahu be now implacably oppose to the creation of such a state so what will the uk do to oblige israel to comply with the international peace process do he think a sustainable peace be possible so long as mr netanyahu remain in power 
 many voice be hear within israel but the hon gentleman will recognise that the predominant view of the region of the united nations and of the regional power the great power and the british government be that a state solution be require with both palestine and israel live behind secure border in peace and safety 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 more than palestinians be dead more than israeli hostage be still unaccounted for and gaza be face famine the war must end now with an immediate ceasefire that need both side to agree it be hamas not israel who reject the last internationally broker ceasefire deal now a new offer be on the table and hamas now have the power to stop the fighting do the minister agree that hamas should accept this deal and avert a catastrophic continuation of this war 
 yes the right hon gentleman make a very good point and although these negotiation be fluid at the moment he be right to say that hamas should accept the deal that have be put on the table 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the minister know that secure a sustainable peace will require a massive aid and rebuild programme in which unrwa will have and must have a crucial part to play indeed he have previously acknowledge that unrwa have a vital role to play in provide aid and service in gaza why then have assure this house that he will come to a decision on the future of unrwa ’s funding when he receive catherine colonna ’s interim report have he sit on that report for day and say absolutely nothing about restore funding he now seem to be set we up for even further delay it be simply not good enough will he now tell we when this government will make a decision on unrwa ’s funding 
 we have be very clear that we be wait for not but report as i say i discuss this matter yesterday with the un secretary general we know very well as the hon gentleman do that the asset unrwa have in term of logistic vehicle warehouse and so forth be essential for the supply of humanitarian relief within gaza we be consider the matter carefully he will also know that britain be not currently in deficit in its funding we be fully fund at this point for unrwa it have also receive additional resource include private resource as well as new government come in to support it we will consider carefully both those report in full and then make a decision and i will come back to the house to inform it when that decision be reach 
 if he will make an assessment of the implication for his policy of the open doors report entitle world watch list 
 the report provide a sobering account of the extreme difficulty face by many christians around the world note that more than christians face persecution each year as my hon friend know freedom of religion or belief be a priority for the uk and we will continue to recognise and seek to address issue of persecution of christians globally 
 i thank the minister for her answer it be great to see my hon friend   the member for eastleigh paul holmes   on the front bench 
 the world watch list lay bare the significant persecution that christians face across the world and the increase pressure on church in china during recent ministerial visit what representation be make on this issue to the chinese government alongside highlight other aspect of their dreadful human right record 
 my hon friend have always be a staunch advocate not only for the church but for all faith group in his constituency it be unacceptable that christians be persecute simply for practise their religion he highlight china in particular and we remain deeply concerned about the persecution there of christians muslims buddhists and falun gong practitioner he know that i be sanction by china for raise the issue of the persecution of the uyghur muslims the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend   the member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan who be the asia minister visit china last week where she make clear our concern about its human right violation 
 i thank the minister for that answer open doors produce the world watch list report and we be deeply indebted to it for what it do pakistan continue to cause concern for i and many other there be muslims sikhs hindus and christians who can not have the freedom of human right and be persecute across all of pakistan how can we exert great influence to effect change in pakistan and make it well for people when it come to worship their god as they so wish to do 
 the hon gentleman be already apply a lot of pressure through his chairmanship of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief which take forward a bill just last week my co minister lord ahmad meet pakistan ’s foreign minister ishaq dar in march to discuss the issue that the hon gentleman have raise and the former foreign secretary have raise the issue of the persecution of religious community include recent attack against the christian community in the punjab those conversation will continue and the fact that we have commit to continue the role of the freedom of religion or belief envoy will provide we with the authority to do that 
 what diplomatic step he be take to strengthen international co operation on tackle illegal migration 
 what diplomatic step he be take to strengthen international co operation on tackle illegal migration 
 what diplomatic step he be take to strengthen international co operation on tackle illegal migration 
 tackle irregular migration be a priority for foreign office engagement across our overseas network through international forum include at the g7 and european political community and bilaterally 
 give the success of the agreement with albania which have considerably reduce the number of illegal immigrant cross by small boat do the minister believe that more of these agreement be necessary alongside our rwanda policy 
 yes my hon friend make a good point he will have see that on   april   we sign an agreement with vietnam to tackle irregular migration and reduce channel crossing casualty the number of vietnamese people come across the channel have be of the fast rise group in recent month 
 recently the irish tánaiste state that he believe the increase in irregular migration to the republic of ireland be a direct result of the deterrent effect of our rwanda policy the irish government have since make move to try to remove those illegal migrant back to the uk what conversation have my right hon friend have with eu counterpart and home office colleague about ensure there be no return policy with the eu unless a reciprocal agreement be make 
 my hon friend make a very good point what be sauce for the goose be also sauce for the gander the movement of asylum seeker from the uk to the southern irish republic would suggest that the rwanda agreement be already have the deterrent effect we be seek 
 i have be say for some time in this place and many other place that a combined effort between french and english force would be very useful on the ground in france to stop the boat from even get to the beach in the place we have the technology and we can destroy the boat i do not see why we do not do that my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh   and i wish to visit calais to meet the mayor to discuss that idea will my right hon friend join we 
 that be an unbelievably tempting invitation from my hon friend recently we have see a increase in french troop on the ground and a reduction in the number of migrant come across compare with last year so french troop on the ground be deliver what be require at least in part 
 the irish republic ’s government and their justice minister indicate that they believe that up to or more of those who be illegally in the republic of ireland be come across the land border but that appear to have be a purely subjective figure have the minister be able to establish the veracity or otherwise of such an exceptionally high figure which the justice minister have claim to be the case 
 we have not because as the hon gentleman will understand that be a southern irish government responsibility no doubt the southern irish government will be press on this matter and will deliver an answer in due course 
 on hand the minister say he want to improve international co operation on tackle illegal migration but on the other hand he say the government be not willing to come to an agreement with the government of ireland or any other european country on return of asylum seeker 
 i do not say anything of the sort mr speaker we be work together in numerous international fora include the global refugee forum the g7 the un general assembly and the european political community summit to tackle this matter upstream work upstream and work with other be critical to resolve this deeply disturbing problem 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 the only way to stop boat at sea and illegal migration be through structured co operation with our neighbour and internationally i welcome the signing on   february   of the agreement between the uk and eu ’s frontex border protection service but be it properly fund and what mechanism be in place to review that funding as it evolve surely the minister must agree with i that the good way to tackle illegal migration be to fund safe and legal route properly what progress be he make on a comprehensive deal to that end with our eu friend include ireland 
 we need to tackle this issue as i think the hon gentleman be imply on a series of different front we be work upstream as the deal with vietnam demonstrate our prime minister have substantially repair the relationship with france the calais group have meet the uk france custom partnership we work closely with frontex there be far more official now in britain deal with these case as the prime minister have make clear once this matter have be resolve he be go to look at bring in safe and legal route from elsewhere 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help get more aid into gaza 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the humanitarian crisis in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 we have treble our aid commitment in the past year and we be do all we can to get more aid to gaza by land air and sea 
 the colonna review be give no evidence to back up claim by the israeli government that unrwa staff be involve in the   october   attack other country have already restore funding to the aid agency so it can continue its work feed   ten of thousand of people who be starve in gaza include innocent baby who be die without milk will the minister commit to refunding today or will he continue to risk uk complicity in use famine as a weapon of war 
 i have set out the process by which we will judge how and when to restore funding to unrwa but the situation have improve in recent week the hon member will have see that fuel for bakery have be restore we be press for the activation of the water pipeline and over the past week we have be average more than truck each day progress have be make but there need to be a lot more progress and britain will continue to press for it 
 when putin invade ukraine the people of blyth cramlington and seaton valley come together and generously give what they could spare with help from local company such as moody logistics and storage in cramlington we be able to ensure that aid reach those who have lose their home and their belonging what plan do my right hon friend ’s department have in place to get aid from the uk to gaza 
 i pay tribute to the good people of blyth cramlington and seaton valley for their generosity and to my hon friend for help to channel that goodwill so constructively his constituent will want to support reputable non governmental organisation and charity work to support humanitarian relief in gaza 
 israel have force more than palestinians to flee to rafah claim it to be a safe zone yet for month the israeli military have be bomb palestinians there relentlessly and accord to the un kill mostly woman and child now it be plan a ground invasion that will lead to carnage do the minister agree that president biden could stop this with phone call and will he press he to do so 
 president biden have be very heavily engage in this matter as the hon member know both the american and british government have press israel not to launch an all out assault on rafah for the reason that she set out the shadow foreign secretary rightly say that he hop that hamas will accept the current deal on the table and i agree with he 
 an israel ground invasion in rafah be probable within day lead to displace palestinians with no safe place to shelter child in gaza have be starve at the fast rate that the world have ever see and member across the house include myself have come here time and again ask for something to be do in term of deliver aid and push for a ceasefire time and again the minister say that we be try try try but clearly try be not work what will the government do to move the dial and stop child die 
 the hon member will have see the   april   maritime announcement and she will know that britain be ramp up the delivery of aid by land sea and air she will i hope be aware that we have a naval ship stand by with £ of aid and logistic equipment there have also be air drop already    from the royal air force an be expect today therefore the british government be do everything they possibly can to move the dial as she request 
 as the minister will know it be not only government and ngos support palestinians across israel the west bank and gaza but a lot of charity i have be contact by such charity abcd which operate a centre for disabled palestinian child in the nur shams refugee camp it tell i that its centre have be raid and destroy not once but several time by the israeli army not by settler what more can the government do to protect the facility and personnel of british charity operate in the palestinian territory 
 my right hon friend will know that we do everything that we can in that respect but if he be able to give i some specific detail about that particular charity and what have befall it i will look into it 
 the prime minister have identify get aid in and get hostage out as key priority for the uk government israel be facilitate aid get into gaza by air land and sea with truck enter the area in a single day we be see real progress on aid when will we see progress on hostage too 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right we need to see breathing space so that we can get the hostage out and more aid in in spite of what she say the aid that be get in at the moment be not sufficient that be precisely the policy of the british government and we will continue to pursue it with all vigour 
 i call the shadow minister 
 give that the colonna report make clear that donor should have confidence in unrwa and that australia france germany sweden canada japan and denmark have all restore funding and with gaza face famine i ask the deputy foreign secretary again when will the government do what labour have call for and restore full funding to unrwa 
 as i have set out we be look at all those report and we will make a decision in our own time britain be not fall short in that respect because we be currently fully fund on all the early commitment we make we will look at the office of internal oversight services report and the unrwa reaction to it we be aware of non traditional donor and private donation come in and unrwa be fully fund until the end of may when we reach our conclusion i will be sure to inform the house of it 
 if the government will revoke strategic export licence to israel 
 as require by the uk ’s robust arm export control regime the foreign secretary have review the most recent advice about the situation in gaza and israel ’s   conduct of its military campaign the british position on export licence be unchanged but we will keep that position under review 
 give that the very purpose of the uk ’s arm export licence criterion be to apply a precautionary principle to arm sale to prevent they from fuel future atrocity and give the extensive evidence of potential war crime and violation of international humanitarian law by israel in gaza surely it be clear that the uk export licensing system be not work do the minister agree with i and the countless midlothian constituent who have be in touch with i that the government should now suspend the transfer of arm to israel in order to prevent future atrocity and do he agree that uk government policy allow for that decision to be make at the discretion of ministers outside the fail export licensing system 
 our position on the arm embargo be consistent with most of our like minded partner who have not take any decision to suspend exist arm export licence to israel it would be an odd decision for we to take when we have use our own military weaponry to defend israel from the attack by iran 
 export be link to law of course and the white house say yesterday that the international criminal court do not have jurisdiction over israel because rather like the usa it be not a signatory to the statute of rome which set up the court more than year ago the then british prime minister write an open letter say that the uk do not accept that the icc have jurisdiction again because of the statute of rome and the absence of sovereignty over the situation in the region can the deputy foreign secretary confirm that that be still the position of his majesty ’s government 
 i can tell my right hon and learn friend that we do not think that the icc have that jurisdiction as be set out in the letter to which he refer but it be a matter for the icc ultimately to reach a determination on that 
 what step his department be take to support the welfare of staff in the british embassy in port au prince 
 the safety of our staff be paramount and a decision be take in november to move the last uk base staff member in haiti to the neighbour dominican republic the security situation since have not allow we to consider return permanently we have country base staff member in haiti ’s capital who we be in constant contact with they be work from home and there be no specific threat to they base on they work for the uk 
 when haiti ’s transitional council be swear in last week the location of the ceremony have to be change owe to gunfire erupt from nearby criminal gang outpost a stark reminder that   haiti be a country far from political legitimacy what step be the government take to assist the transitional council in order to ensure that a new president be democratically elect in and that we do not see they target with violence in the meantime 
 we be work closely with international partner include the united states canada and very importantly caricom the caribbean 
 community and of course we be also work incredibly hard to ensure that we provide every support we can for the multinational security support mission the foreign secretary have already pledge fund for our support for that important mission 
 i welcome the uk ’s £ commitment towards the deployment of the multinational security support mission in haiti will my hon friend tell the house a little more about how that mission be be deploy and can he expand on the discussion that he have have with our friend in the dominican republic about their security on the border with haiti 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question about the dominican republic i be there at the end of march and meet president abinader we talk about the situation and the importance of the mss clearly the kenyans will need to decide how they move forward but as have be say the put in place of the transitional presidential council be an important moment 
 i call the shadow minister 
 half of haiti ’s population be starve violence be rife dead body lie forget on the street for too long this crisis have be ignore as the minister know that grave situation risk also destabilise the wide caribbean region include our overseas territory with the turks and caicos island less than mile away can the minister confirm the uk ’s donation to the un fund the government miss that out of their statement and lie out what other diplomatic support the government be offer to address the crisis 
 most importantly beyond the other thing that i have mention we be work closely with the un security council which be a vital forum here and we continue to work with like minded country to help with the establishment of the mss the hon lady rightly highlight the importance of humanitarian support we be of the major donor to the un central emergency response fund and there have be an authorisation of disbursement of $ to support those affect 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of iran ’s role in the conflict in gaza 
 iran ’s support for proscribe group operate in gaza such as hamas and palestinian islamic jihad compromise our effort towards a sustainable ceasefire in gaza 
 iran continue to operate in violation of the joint comprehensive plan of action its nuclear programme be way beyond anything need for purely peaceful process however it do not end there iran be threaten journalist on uk street and its proxy in hamas hezbollah and the houthis continue to inflict tragedy on the region what be my right hon friend ’s assessment of whether the jcpoa be still fit for purpose 
 my hon friend make a good point alongside international partner we be prepared to use all option available to tackle the difficulty that he describe include trigger the un snapback and end the jcpoa if necessary 
 as probably the only member who have actually live and work in gaza i must say that i have be heartbroken over the past month by what i be hear from friend and colleague there about the almost total destruction of the healthcare system and the impact of widespread starvation on their patient with the uk have defunde the united nations relief and works agency still supply arm to israel and often defend netanyahu ’s policy be the minister not anxious that the uk government be undermine international law itself 
 no the hon lady will have see how in respect of un security council resolution and britain ’s diplomacy work to move people into a common position we be very clear about the importance of get aid into gaza and get the hostage out and all british policy be bent without fear or favour towards achieve that 
 if the government will make an assessment of the potential impact of a military offensive in rafah on the humanitarian situation in that area 
 we be deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in rafah we need an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostage out then progress towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire 
 the foreign secretary be fortunate to have such an able deputy which make it all the more difficult to understand the inherent complacency in that answer we be hour away from a bloodbath that will make falluja pale into insignificance it will be the bad bloodbath see in the world since the world war some people most of they woman and child be hour away from a full scale invasion the minister keep say that we be go to press israel what be the government go to do about it if it happen 
 the hon gentleman and i enter this house on the same day nearly year ago and it be no surprise to see he back in his place it have to be say that throughout that time his view have be remarkably consistent give the number of civilian shelter in rafah it be not easy to see how such an offensive could be compliant with international   humanitarian law in the current circumstance and on his overall point i hope he will recognise that the british government be do everything we can to prevent the circumstance he have describe 
 sustainable calm be the late buzzword but the fighting simply have to stop in the past day palestinian president abbas have say that in order for there to be sustainable calm or a ceasefire the united states must give a warning to israel what warning have the uk government give to israel when it come to a possible ground invasion in rafah 
 i refer my hon friend to the comment i make early he will know that the british and american government have be work in lockstep to prevent the situation he have describe 
 what recent discussion he have have with his polish counterpart on international parental child abduction 
 i recognise the distress cause to all those affect by international parental child abduction particularly the child the primary global mechanism for deal with international child abduction case be the hague child abduction convention due to the persistent campaigning of my right hon friend the foreign office have raise this matter with the polish government include the foreign secretary raise it with his counterpart 
 the minister be fully sight on what be frankly of the most tragic and appalling case that of my constituent mr tom toolan whose polish ex partner defy a family court order and take their daughter rhian to poland this case have be go on for too long for many many year i thank the department for the engagement it have be have the minister will also know that there be hundred of other case of child be abduct that be specific to poland with the change in the polish government at the end of last year what further plan do the minister and the government have to give real support to my constituent his life be be destroy by this and it can not go on it be not sustainable any more and he have be let down by polish court order again and again 
 my right hon friend ’s persistent campaigning have make sure that the case of tom toolan have be raise regularly with our polish counterpart the government have raise it many time include on   april   with the minister of justice the foreign office remain committed to use every appropriate opportunity to raise issue surround the enforcement of court order under the hague convention as well as individual case with the polish government as my right hon friend will know now that i have take over this brief i be absolutely committed to ensure that we be return child to the parent they have be allocate to by court 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the humanitarian situation in sudan 
 this year the uk will nearly double its support for people in sudan with £ in aid that be nearly double the amount we set out at the beginning of last year but in the past quarter we have augment that figure as well 
 i thank the minister for that answer the sudanese city of el fasher be the western region of darfur ’s humanitarian hub but the us ambassador to the un have say that el fasher 
 be on the precipice of a large scale massacre 
 what be the minister do to avert this impending crisis 
 the hon member raise the position of el fasher and i specifically speak about this with the un secretary general antónio guterres yesterday she be absolutely right and we be do everything we can as she will know darfur be a particular focus of the british government and indeed of parliament through the all party group on sudan and south sudan and through a number of mechanism we be do everything we can to try to ensure that the people in darfur be protect 
 i do not know whether the deputy foreign secretary have have the opportunity to see the evidence that frontline aid worker give to the international development committee last week it be very traumatic evidence but the chink of light be their positivity towards the work that the fcdo have be do to try to continue education for child displace during this crisis will my right hon friend give a commitment that that support will continue and indeed be enhance 
 i be very grateful to my right hon friend for what he have say we be seek to assist child under in sudan he will know that people have be displace have flee across border and be suffer acute food insecurity more widely sudanese child be suffer from the deadly form of malnutrition 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we know and as have be say right now an offensive be under way to capture el fasher the last remain city in darfur outside rapid support forces control the risk of massacre and rape target at non arab community be imminent and i fear that it will be simply appal in scale all arm supply to the war side must stop and we thank our tireless diplomat alongside african security council colleague for friday ’s statement at the un but what mechanism be the government use with our partner every single day to build pressure for an immediate ceasefire and a sustainable peace 
 we very much hope that jeddah will be the next significant opportunity to negotiate what we require be a ceasefire with the troop return to barrack and a political track when i be in adré on the chad sudan border a few week ago i see for myself the difficulty of support darfur include with food the hon lady and indeed the house may rest assure that sudan be not forget and that britain as the pen holder at the united nations be do everything it can to help 
 what step he be take to support freedom of religion or belief in nicaragua 
 the uk be commit to defend freedom of religion or belief for all we share widespread international concern about the suppression of human right in nicaragua include the right to freedom of religion or belief we continue to call in bilateral and multilateral setting for the nicaraguan government to respect democracy and all human right 
 all party parliamentary group include that on international freedom of religion or belief recently produce an inquiry report the silencing of democracy in nicaragua outline widespread grave and brutal human right violation by the regime against journalist academic political opponent religious leader and wide civil society our report make recommendation for the uk government and other state what public step will ministers take both unilaterally and jointly with other country to challenge those violation to support the victim and survivor   such as bishop álvarez and to call to account the nicaraguan regime for such violation in line with our recommendation 
 i very much welcome the report it be good to meet my hon friend and parliamentary neighbour the respected special envoy on forb to review the report i read it with interest and will respond to the inquiry member shortly she can be assure that we continue to call out this behaviour this unacceptable behaviour by the regime which do not respect human right and certainly do not respect freedom of religion or belief 
 what step his department be take to support jimmy lai during his trial in hong kong 
 we have call for an end to british citizen jimmy lai ’s prosecution in hong kong and for his release the foreign secretary raise his case with the chinese foreign minister in february and i raise it during my visit to beijing and hong kong last week 
 would ministers agree that this dreadful case show the true nature of the chinese communist regime could we be do more to really get a stout    defence of british citizen throughout the world include vladimir kara murza in russia and jimmy lai in hong kong who be part of political show trial in authoritarian or fascist state 
 mr lai have face multiple charge to silence and discredit he and he have be target in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association my hon friend raise an important question about dual national and the challenge that our consular team face in country that do not recognise that british nationality we will continue to champion they and we have consular team at jimmy lai ’s trial almost every day and will continue to provide what support we can include to his family 
 i know that the minister take a close interest in this issue have she or any other foreign office minister have an opportunity to raise this directly with the chinese ambassador 
 i have raise this issue with the ambassador and be able to raise it last week when i be in beijing with my foreign minister counterpart 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the trial and detention of british citizen jimmy lai show the symbolism and importance of get a grip on the question of hong kongers and their right can the minister confirm that when she be in beijing she be able to get the balance right between the legitimate trade interest and the importance of human right freedom of religion or belief freedom of expression and all those other moral and political duty that we have in foreign policy 
 i be able to meet many different group from business to civil society and religious voice and indeed political interlocutor last week in beijing and also in hong kong i raise very firmly all those issue such as freedom of expression without fear or favour they be robust discussion it be so important that we be able to engage so that we can have those conversation our complex relationship with china and hong kong continue but we will continue to stand firm to make sure we champion and stand up for all those who defend those freedom

 we be try to make sure that the water be restore as i set out early and we be champion the provision of aid by land sea and air and i set out the help we have receive from the royal air force in that respect but at the end of the day the right way to get aid into gaza be by road and we be press in every way we can to ensure that that access be restore

 the government consistently raise human right issue with the chinese authority as i do during my visit last week as i have mention we also regularly raise tibet in multilateral fora such as in january at china ’s universal periodic review and in march as part of our item statement at the un human rights council 
 many people in the aylesbury constituency be understandably concerned about the plight of palestinians in gaza they condemn the appalling action of hamas but at the same time want the uk to do everything possible to get more aid in can my right hon friend let they know what further plan he have to provide more aid directly especially with our friend in the region include egypt qatar and jordan 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his thought and idea which he come and speak to i about last week he be convey the view of the mosque in aylesbury we be pursue many of the idea that he set out as he know especially on meet the evident humanitarian need that have rightly preoccupy the house today

 i understand the hon lady ’s concern i be not familiar with the case but i will follow up and get back to she 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for wales if he will make a statement on tata end the statutory consultation on redundancy at port talbot steelwork 
 on   april   tata announce its strategic direction to proceed with its port talbot transformation follow the launch of the formal national consultation with the union on   february technically the consultation have not conclude at national or local level the statutory consultation remain under way and i understand that the company intend to move to local consultation with staff who may be affect 
 this be a deeply concern time for the tata workforce and the wide community i hold regular conversation and meeting with the union and management and will continue to do so as we develop intervention to build a bright future for port talbot on   september   we announce an unprecedented £ government grant as part of the £ investment by tata steel to build a new electric arc furnace tata steel employ more than people include at port talbot all those job along with many thousand more in the supply chain would be under threat be it not for the agreement that we strike the transformation will be difficult but the funding have save job in the company it be not the case that we have pay money to put people out of work we have pay a lot of money to save job we be also look to modernise production and ensure that steelmaking in south wales can continue for generation to come 
 go beyond that to support those affect by tata ’s decision we have put £ towards the creation of the transition board which i chair and which include representative of the uk and welsh governments local authority and industry the funding include £ from the uk government and £ from tata nothing as yet from the welsh government but we hope that there will be some it will be use to achieve the transition board ’s priority the of which be to support those affected employee to find new well pay job the board ’s priority also include support business in the supply chain and the long term regeneration of the region 
 in its most recent meeting last week the transition board endorse a local economic action plan which will act as a road map for how good to use the funding to support those affect while the ongoing consultation be a matter between the trade union and the company we will continue discussion with all party we hope a resolution be find that avoid industrial action the government will continue to work closely with industry to secure a sustainable and competitive future for the welsh steel sector 
 i be confident of a good future for port talbot and the region with the uk government progress the bid by associated british ports to the next stage for up to £ of funding to support our nascent float offshore wind industry and our progress towards establish the celtic freeport back by £ of uk government funding 
 last thursday ’s news be a gut punch for worker in port talbot with economic consequence that could reverberate across south wales for decade last month i meet worker at the plant the sense of the threat to nearly people ’s livelihood be all consume the wide supply chain in llanwern shotton and trostre be vulnerable too we again urge tata not to make any irreversible decision before a general election 
 my hon friend the members for aberavon stephen kinnock for newport east jessica morden for newport west ruth jones and for llanelli dame nia griffith have be proud vocal advocate for their constituent in contrast the government have fork out £ of taxpayer cash for the loss of job that be their deal and they own it 
 in addition the loss of sovereign steelmaking be a fundamental threat to our uk economy and security it will constrain our ability to build the float offshore wind we need to lower energy bill deliver energy security and create the job of the future 
 we be now around a month away from blast furnace no potentially close so what assessment have the government make of the impact of the closure on job loss at the plant and in the supply chain across wales with the talk ongoing between union and tata this week do the secretary of state like i want to see an agreement from tata that compulsory redundancy will be avoid what step will he take to encourage such an agreement he have say that no will be leave behind if they lose their job will he publish the local economic plan that the transition board have agree as the basis for its investment decision 
 with labour ’s national wealth fund the future of uk steel will be fuel by the skill talent and ambition of welsh steelworker but until the country be give the chance to have its say at a general election i want worker across wales to know that labour members have their back 
 let i take the hon lady ’s point by the £ investment will save job we be not pay money to throw people out of work we do not want to see anyone throw out of work tata have make a decision to close blast furnace base on the loss it be make when it come to we we say what can we do to keep people in work this be the plan it come up with 
 secondly the plan will have no impact on sovereign steelmaking the hon lady if she talk to tata will understand—[interruption she be chuntering but all the iron ore that go into the blast furnace come from abroad all the coal that be turn into coke come in from abroad and all the limestone come in from abroad it therefore have no impact whatever on our sovereign steelmaking ability in fact we have tonne of scrap steel in this country much of which have be export abroad we be go to use that scrap steel and put it in the electric arc furnace which will increase our sovereign ability 
 the hon lady say that the plan will have an impact on our ability to create float offshore wind last time she say it would have an impact on our ability to create battleship she need to understand that battleship be make use steel plate and that float offshore wind turbine be also make use steel plate steel plate   be not make by tata at port talbot tata at port talbot produce coil which be thin and not strong enough to make either battleship or float offshore wind turbine 
 the hon lady ask about the number of people affect we have be very clear about that from the start interruption i be try to answer the hon lady ’s question she ask the question i list they and i be answer they she ask about the number of job affect we have say all along that we expect it to be around but it be for tata to confirm that once it have go through the statutory consultation procedure 
 the hon lady ask whether we would encourage tata to come to an agreement so that there be no compulsory redundancy of course we would we do not want anyone to be make redundant against their wish we do not want this process to happen in the place but as i say to her several time tata come to the uk government with a threat to pull out which would have cost job and the entire supply chain 
 the hon lady ask if the local area action plan can be publish it be not fully finalise yet it be a road map but she will surely be aware that the current minister be sit on the board as the economic development minister the labour economic development minister in the senedd be on the board the local member of parliament be on the board as be the local senedd member the chief executive of the local authority and the representative of trade union so it be hardly a secret document it be not as if the transition board be meet in condition of great secrecy 
 if the hon lady have any further question i be more than happy to answer they 
 when will the government do something about the very high energy price in this country which have be make high by regulation and taxis do my right hon friend not accept that any kind of steelmaking will be extremely difficult if we have uncompetitive energy and be it not wrong to import such material because it will mean even more carbon dioxide emission as well as destroy job here 
 we have look carefully at the loss that tata be make which have come about partly because of the age of the infrastructure in fact tata have have to close down the furnace at the morfa coke oven within the last few week the uk government be fully cognisant of the cost of energy at the moment which be why tata have already benefit from many of the scheme that we have introduce over the past few year will begin to benefit from the british industry supercharger scheme shortly and will benefit from the carbon border adjustment mechanism at the start of 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 despite what the secretary of state may claim the government be invest in support of plan that will lead to approximately job cut along with an irreversible cut in the capacity to produce virgin steel tata have announce that it will open a voluntary redundancy scheme on   may can the secretary of state update the house   on what he expect the redundancy package to include and will he join i in condemn threat that the company appear to have make to withdraw enhanced redundancy package if industrial action go ahead 
 let i answer the hon gentleman ’s question directly the value of the redundancy package will have to be agree between tata and the trade union but tata have make it very clear that it want to go well beyond statutory redundancy it have put out several figure some of which could be more generous if there be no industrial action i do not want to see industrial action but i do not condemn the union either i think that they have play a very positive role in discussion on the transition board and outside it and i understand the strength of feeling among people at port talbot 
 as for the other point make by the hon gentleman let i say this again and say it clearly so that everyone can understand it tata come to the uk government and say that it be go to pull out of steelmaking in south wales that decision would have cost job as well as we think about in the wide supply chain official from the department for business and trade want to come up with a plan that would save as many job as possible which be where the arc furnace plan have come from that plan will save job with a government investment of half a pound it be not the outcome that anyone want but it be a well outcome to see job lose than to see lose neither be a good outcome but that be what we want to achieve 
 let i repeat that this be not really about a sovereign ability to produce virgin steel all the element of steelmaking be be import from abroad we be not about to start open up iron ore mine steel be produce here with iron ore from abroad limestone from abroad and coke make from coal from abroad we can not do this by ourselves at the same time we have tonne of steel that be be export we will be make use of a resource that be already in our country 
 back home in scunthorpe we watch very closely what be happen in port talbot what work have be do to determine the quality of those tonne of scrap and whether it will be suitable for use in the electric arc furnace may i also ask my right hon friend to reflect on this point when it come to sovereign capability the issue be not always what you be do and choose to make it sometimes come down to what you may need to make at some point in the future may i remind my right hon friend that we have a perfectly good mine full of coke and coal in cumbria and that there be an awful lot of limestone under the ground in this country as well 
 my hon friend be right that if we want to we could probably find iron ore coke coal and limestone in the uk but i do not see any great enthusiasm at the moment for open up the mine to do that as for the tonne of scrap in the uk that will go into the arc furnace official from the department for business and trade and ey have go over very carefully the business plan be put forward by tata let i point out to my hon friend that not   only be the uk government invest half a pound but tata be invest £ so tata obviously feel that there be a good strong commercial case for build that arc furnace and be put its money where its mouth be 
 the port talbot steelworker in my constituency have give their life to the steel industry and to tata steel the reckless deal that have be do by the uk government and tata be a hammer blow for they and we hope that there be still time for the employer and the union to come together drop the bad deal for steel and adopt the compelling and robust multi union deal instead 
 may i ask the secretary of state about the role of contractor in all this everyone know that for every job lose in a steelwork between and more be lose through supply chain and contractor so the figure of that be be use be a massive underestimate of the devastating impact as there will be job loss through supply chain and subcontractor do he agree that the number of job loss will be far high than if this reckless deal be adopt if so do he agree that it be time for everyone to pull back from the brink and adopt the multi union plan which offer we a bridge to the future rather than the cliff edge that be currently be pursue 
 clearly there will be an impact on those in the supply chain there have be absolutely no doubt about that at the last transition board meeting at which the hon gentleman be present we discuss that and we agree that we would want to support anyone in the supply chain who have be affect but we can not start put number on this it would be irresponsible to start guess the number of people who will lose their job but i agree with the hon gentleman that there will clearly be an effect 
 the hon gentleman talk about a reckless plan but ours be the only plan on the table he keep suggest that we adopt the syndex plan but it be not a plan unless tata agree to it i have discuss the syndex plan with senior management at tata and with the head of tata holdings mr chandrasekaran in mumbai he do not believe that it be commercially viable and he believe that it would be technically far too difficult to try to build an electric arc furnace on the site of the steel melt shop 
 indicate dissent 
 the hon gentleman shake his head i do not know what the answer be he say that it be possible to implement the syndex plan but tata say that it be not what the hon gentleman have to realise be that it be not the uk government he have to convince it be tata the uk government have never say that they would be against the syndex plan it be tata that have to be persuade 
 i commend my right hon friend for his comment and for remind we that half a pound be no small beer when it come to intervention in a private industry there be clearly difficulty with the transition and a lot of we who care deeply about the steel industry in wales and   britain be worried about our capacity to do what we need to in the future as my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   say what ongoing discussion be there on whether tata will keep of the blast furnace open for long than be set out in the plan in which they be to be shut down by the end of this year 
 i have have that discussion with senior management at tata as have member of the labour party trade union and many other tata face loss of over £ a day as a result of keep the blast furnace open it say that those loss would continue even if be function because it would have to make significant capital expenditure on blast furnace for that to go ahead and secondly it would have to import all the coke that go into that blast furnace as the coke oven be shut down with the agreement of the union because of health and safety concern then tata would face the additional technical problem of try to build an electric arc furnace on the same site as a steel melt shop contain hundred of tonne of molten steel that be pour off into caster that be why it have say very clearly that it will not entertain the proposal the uk government have never say that we would not entertain the proposal if tata want to come forward with a plan to build the arc furnace use the grant that the government have put forward while keep blast furnace open for long of course the government would be open to discussion of that 
 i call liz saville roberts 
 diolch yn fawr iawn llefarydd in the netherlands political pressure have result in tata investing in an electric arc furnace and direct reduce iron technology all while protect job and keep blast furnace open the german government be spend € over time more than the uk be spend on transition the country ’s steel industry towards hydrogen why be the uk so uniquely incapable of effective investment in our strategic steel future 
 a few people seem to have the idea that build a dri plant would resolve this problem the point to remember be that if a dri plant be build on the site it would probably save another job there be a plant in texas run by voestalpine which i believe produce tonne or so of steel every year and employ people so a dri plant will not resolve the problem clearly dri plant require access to a regular and affordable amount of natural gas there be however nothing whatsoever to stop tata at some point in future build a dri plant to go along with the electric arc furnace if it believe that that be commercially sensible even if it be to do that it would not really resolve the problem that we face job be lose in port talbot at well it would save another job 
 i be sorry but this government ’s lack of ambition for our steel industry be just disgraceful as many of the secretary of state ’s constituent work in llanwern he should understand that decision make about port talbot have a direct impact on newport and can lead to problem with   securing volume for llanwern we be look at potential redundancy and uncertainty about the long term future of the plant it be not too late for the secretary of state to stand up for his constituent show more ambition for our steel industry as other country do argue for a fair transition and try to avoid compulsory redundancy why will he not do that for his own constituent 
 we have acknowledge all along that under the proposal port talbot plan to close down the pickle line at llanwern but not until the electric arc furnace be build we discuss that at the last meeting of the transition board and we all agree that just as we want to help everyone in port talbot we want to help anyone affect in llanwern 
 the hon lady keep talk about a lack of ambition we can all dream about a situation in which blast furnace be keep open for another year but what we can not do be force tata to continue accept loss of over £ a day in order for that to happen i have to say that there have be a lack of responsibility on the part of some labour member though not any present in this chamber who seem to have go around suggest that they have a special costed secret plan that would save all those job they do not they have not put any kind of a cost plan to any senior management in tata they have never sit down and say if you do this we will give you this and that way we could save all those job they have simply go around say that they want to see all the job save we all want to see every single job save but we can not force tata to continue to take loss of over £ a day 
 i come from an area of the country that suffer from industrial decline generation ago and the human impact of what we see happen to port talbot will blight the current generation we talk a lot about a transition to a green economy when will the government invest in the national skill strategy that we need to provide people in port talbot be about to lose their job and redundancy payment do not last forever a generation will be blight they need skill for the century so will the government commit to a national skill strategy 
 the hon lady ask about the money to support the town of port talbot i have say already that there be £ to build an arc furnace that will save thousand of job there be £ go into regenerate the town there be £ of funding for the freeport £ of funding for launchpad and as far as skill be concern £ from the uk government primarily to retrain people there be another £ come in from tata there have not be penny from the welsh government towards this endeavour they have be able to find £ to spend on more senedd members and £ to spend on mph road sign and we have just learn that they have lose £ have set up a bank but they have not be able to find penny to support the steelworker at port talbot 
 be this not just the tail end of a government who abandon the word industrial strategy a decade ago when i ask question on this matter why have the government not have the   ambition and the vision to realise the potential for example if there be a plate mill on the site it could produce the steel for the substructure and wind turbine that be plan to be build in the celtic sea around the milford haven and port talbot freeport there be no industrial strategy there be no vision and there be no joined upness there be just massive sticking plaster from this government 
 there be discussion go on about the possibility of build a plate mill on the site when the electric arc furnace be complete there be nothing whatsoever to prevent a plate mill from be build the hon gentleman will not be aware of all the discussion go on but i say respectfully to he that a plate mill will not save job we face the loss of a significant number of job as a result of the decision to close down the blast furnace and even if a plate mill a direct reduce iron plant or a hot zinc dip line be build on the site all of which be reasonable thing to consider it would not solve the problem that people be face the loss of their job that be why the £ for the arc furnace be so important as be the £ for the transition board 
 we talk early about the supply chain the repercussion of this decision will be feel across south wales so can i ask the secretary of state directly whether he have secure any commitment whatsoever from tata about the future of the worker at those downstream facility across south wales 
 yes tata have be clear that it be originally go to close those site but it now expect all those site to remain open during the process of build the arc furnace while the blast furnace be shut down it will be bring steel in from elsewhere to make sure that the product be go into those other plant 
 with the closure of the coke oven make the viable lifespan of the blast furnace all the more precarious and the electric arc furnace still be a long way off we will rapidly reach a situation where port talbot can no long supply the trostre work in llanelli in my constituency so what talk have the secretary of state have with tata boss about secure high quality interim supply for trostre and secure all the job there 
 i have speak to tata on that very issue it have be clear that it would have to import steel to feed trostre and it be willing to do that the timeline for the electric arc furnace be ambitious but work be ongoing the groundwork will start very shortly the application for planning permission should go in in the autumn and hopefully it will be turn round and deal with by early next year it will then take about year to build the electric arc furnace 
 the secretary of state casually discard job and be so uninterested in the ongoing effect on the rest of the economy in south wales that he have not even make an assessment of what the economic impact will be on the south wales valley more generally can he clear up for we precisely how many other people ’s job be likely to be affect   be he aware that in the last few month we have have job go at uk windows and doors in the rhondda and job go in the last hour at everest in the rhondda as my hon friend   the member for cardiff west kevin brennan   say it do not feel as if the government have an industrial strategy nor do it feel as if they have an anti poverty strategy for that matter they do not have a levelling up strategy either do they be it not time we have a new secretary of state for wales so that we can get on and have a proper plan for the economy of south wales 
 i be sorry to have to say this to the hon gentleman but it be slightly insulting for he to suggest that the tone in which i have set out the answer suggest casual disregard or a lack of interest i assure he that nothing whatsoever in the wales office at the moment be more important than secure the future of port talbot i be sorry but frankly while this government be put up £ to ensure the future of steelmaking in south wales and demonstrate an interest in make steel some opposition members be more interested in make headline 
 my constituent who work in port talbot inform i that there have be no progress on enhance redundancy negotiation between the union and tata give the scale of the public investment involve will the british government use their leverage to ensure that tata treat its workforce with a degree of dignity 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right i think that tata now need to come forward with a bit more information about who exactly we can expect to see be make redundant and what their current skillset be so that we can begin target the help the challenge up until now be that we have not have the information on who be be make redundant tata have make it clear that it will not automatically be the people on the blast furnace for example who be make redundant because it hop to retain some of the people who be work there but offer redundancy to people in other part of the plant we have not have the information as of yet but i think the time have come to have that information we of course want to ensure that any redundancy package be as generous as possible 
 my constituent who work at the shotton plant be very worried about the news they be hear and concerned about their colleague future but they be also wonder what it mean for they clearly there will be knock on effect not just in the supply chain but in other tata plant around the country so what assessment have the secretary of state make of the short medium and long term impact of these decision on other plant 
 we be very clear that while the arc furnace be be build we want to make absolutely certain that all those other plant around wales be able to receive product to finish and tata have be very clear that that will happen it will have to bring it in from elsewhere over the next to year but that will happen there will therefore not be the impact that the hon gentleman be rightly concerned about 
 of course that be possible only because of what some of the hon gentleman ’s colleague have describe as a reckless deal what would have be reckless would have be for we to see tata in an office and say okay you ’re go to make people redundant and shut down all these site and there ’ nothing for we to do about it that would have be reckless what we actually do be to come forward with a £ package of taxpayer money and rightly so to support the continuation of steelmaking in port talbot and to ensure that all the other plant in wales shotton trostre and llanwern continue to receive product during that interim period so that we do not see significant job loss anywhere else 
 it be an increasingly dangerous world as   the hon member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft   and   the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland   say so will the secretary of state release an impact assessment on britain lose its sovereign capability to produce virgin steel 
 it be start to feel a bit like groundhog day here can i explain again that the iron ore the limestone and the coke be all come in from abroad there be no sovereign capability to make steel in the blast furnace at port talbot however we be already produce high quality steel in arc furnace that be use in the defence industry i recently meet sheffield forgemasters which be produce steel for nuclear submarine in an electric arc furnace in the united kingdom 
 we have great hope and plan to build offshore float wind structure in the cromarty firth and the surround area which would be a fantastic use of the great fabrication skill we have there but do the government recognise that the continued production of steel and very probably the increase production of steel will be crucial to this plan become a reality 
 yes i agree with the hon gentleman that it be important that we have a means of produce steel that can be use to build float offshore wind turbine technically that be quite difficult to do it would require either steel plate or a very heavily reinforce version of steel coil i know that discussion be go on between tata and at least of the likely major investor in float offshore wind turbine to ensure that the steel can be make and we hope that we will use steel from the electric arc furnace to do just that 
 i thank the minister for his answer it be clear that he be keen to find solution but obviously many on this side of the chamber indeed on both side be a bit concerned bear in mind that steel produce in port talbot be the backbone of much construction in northern ireland which prompt   the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock   to highlight protocol problem with the prime minister in the past i too want to express my deep concern and ask the minister to explain where the steel for our construction sector in northern ireland will come from if the government be unable to step in and save job in port talbot 
 in the short term i assume that the steel go into the industry in northern ireland do not come directly from port talbot it probably come from some of the other finish plant i do not know the full detail of the exact grade of steel that go into the northern ireland construction industry but i be happy to discuss that with the hon gentleman 
 tata have make it absolutely clear that it do not expect any disruption in supply while the arc furnace be be build everyone i have speak to not just those at tata but independent expert have say that of the grade currently produce use blast furnace can be produce use an electric arc furnace and that the technology of electric arc furnace steel production be rapidly improve so i would not expect there to be any disruption to supply in the medium or long term 
 with permission mr speaker i will update the house on the propose acquisition of the telegraph media group by rb investco ltd. i will refer to the telegraph media group as the telegraph and to rb investco ltd as the purchaser 
 as the house will know the sale of the telegraph be currently subject to the medium merger process today i would like to confirm that the purchaser have notify i of its intention to sell the call option agreement that give it the ability to buy the telegraph in effect withdraw from the purchase of the newspaper this step follow the intervention i make on the merger situation on   january both to issue a public interest intervention notice or piin and to issue a pre emptive action order it also follow on from my announcement of   march   on my assessment follow the report of the competition and markets authority and ofcom that i be minded to refer the merger to a far more detailed phase investigation i have take these decision on the basis of the evidence in the case and i will continue to do so 
 i be now update the house on the procedure and protection for the public interest that be in place in respect of the telegraph give the sale process that i understand will begin shortly i have inform the party that it would not be appropriate at this stage for i to take a decision on whether or not to make a phase reference in my view the relevant merger situation remain in contemplation i therefore continue to have power under the order to prevent action by the party to the merger that might prejudice any phase reference to the cma or make it more difficult for i to take action as a result of my final decision follow such a reference the order prohibit the party from make significant organisational and staff change include to the editorial team without my consent these restriction remain in place however i have now agree to derogation from the order that will give the party the flexibility and regulatory space to make all reasonable preparation for the sale of the call option agreement 
 it be important to be clear that i will not be engage with prospective buyer nor select the preferred bidder the sale process will be run by redbird imi alone my decision on any further derogation from the order that redbird imi will need to receive to complete the sale of the call option agreement will be make accord to my power and obligation under the enterprise act and it will be base on the public interest rather than a qualitative decision on who should buy the title any transfer to new ownership will also potentially be subject to the medium merger regime as set out in the act 
 it be appropriate for i to say a few word about the underlie matter i initiate this process under the power i have under the enterprise act to protect the accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion in newspaper these power be vital the freedom of the press to express opinion to criticise and to hold power to account be all a fundamental part of our democracy it be often say that the freedom of the press protect not the press ’s freedom but our 
 it would not be appropriate for a foreign state to interfere with the accurate presentation of our news or the freedom of expression in newspaper although these power under the exist medium merger regime be broad the government have take action to rule out newspaper and news magazine merger involve any influence ownership or control by foreign state we have do that by amend the digital markets competition and consumers bill which will shortly return to this house 
 as a nation we be a proud open democracy and a strong trading power with a vibrant economy although we be rightly limit power to interfere with our democracy as many other state do in term of foreign investment more generally we remain open for business 
 i end by recognise the strength of feeling in this house and the other place and by recognise the work do by the minister of state my hon friend   the member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez by the parliamentary under secretary of state lord parkinson of whitley bay and in particular by the right hon baroness stowell of beeston 
 i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of the statement 
 from the very start labour have question about the propose sale of some of our country ’s most highly influential and historical news publication we share legitimate public interest concern about the accurate presentation of news free expression of opinion and fair competition we can not take those freedom for grant 
 it be disappointing that this weak government do not do the right thing from the start do the secretary of state agree that this be not about single out the united arab emirates our important partner she say that it be not appropriate for a foreign state to interfere with the accurate presentation of news and i be glad that she have come round to that point of view but surely no government anywhere in the world include our should own any news publication 
 labour will always act to safeguard the uk ’s strong and independent free press regardless of any publication ’s political persuasion we will champion its right to hold we to account we will safeguard the freedom to scrutinise to expose wrongdoing and to speak truth to power because this be about protect our democracy 
 we of course welcome investment that make a valuable contribution to our diverse medium landscape so we will closely follow this auction process can the secretary of state give we more information on the timescale for the auction what discussion have she have with trade union represent the staff of the telegraph media group what step will she take to ensure that this be a free and open sale and will she keep the house update what will she do to ensure a competitive medium landscape into the future 
 it be important that the secretary of state get this right especially in an election year our democracy be too precious to leave to chance 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for welcome this statement on the position in which we now find ourselves i reiterate her point that the uae be an important trading partner the legislation relate to all foreign state we welcome our relationship with the uae 
 the hon lady say that this be an important point and i have be very conscious of this matter since it fall on my desk from the outset i have raise and deal with the concern in this case although she raise it now and i be not look at the complete record i do not recall any occasion on which she have raise this matter either directly with i or in this house
