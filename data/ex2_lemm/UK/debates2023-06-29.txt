 no i do not accept that at all if anything what be increase the cost be what the scottish government have be do in relation to the deposit return scheme while complain about our divergence between here and the eu they be try to split the uk single market and we be not go to let they do that 
 what step she be take to help the steel industry to decarbonise 
 the paris agreement make clear that the steel industry need to cut emission by by and the government recognise the vital role that the steel sector play in our economy the net strategy set out our aim to make the transition to a low carbon economy and reaffirm our commitment to continue to work with the steel industry on decarbonisation 
 hundred of steelworker gather in westminster yesterday to make absolutely clear their feeling that the government be not do enough particularly in comparison with competitor nation when it come to investment in the transition to decarbonise steel the number do not lie the government be also worryingly slow in introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism uk steel have estimate that nearly tonne of non eu steel could flood the uk market if the uk fail to introduce its own carbon border adjustment mechanism at the same time as the eu in when will we see the government step up and invest in green steel as be be do in competitor country and when can we expect the introduction of a british cbam 
 we have be support the steel industry with more than £ available in grant to help decarbonise the sector and the provision of more than £ to cover energy cost since the cbam be clearly an issue for many country not just ours we have just finish consultation and will produce a response in due course a transitional reporting phase be due to start in october with full introduction in the eu be still develop detail about cbam implementation and have a consultation open on propose reporting requirement until   july i know that the hon member chair the all party parliamentary group for steel and metal relate industry and i urge he to ensure that all business express their view as strongly as possible i think we be meet on monday to make sure that we can provide a substantial response 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister say that she recognise the vital role that steel play in this country but the uk be the only country in the g20 where steel production be fall it be also the only g7 country whose government do not insist on use domestically produce steel in defence contract meanwhile uk steel producer pay more than their german counterpart for electricity labour ’s £ green steel plan will give our industry the bright future that other country be offer their steel sector labour believe in our steel why do this government not 
 i be not sure where labour member will get the money to fund that programme of work i have not even get to the end of read this paper but they will probably u turn by the time i do so i be not sure how sensible it be go to be we have provide more than £ for decarbonisation unprecedented support to help with energy cost and just recently there be fantastic news from celsa when it be able to repay a government loan of £ that we provide to they sensibly spend taxpayer money there be and always have be support available when it come to procurement it be absolutely right that we do everything we can to make sure that we have uk firm procure uk steel 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of her department ’s trade policy on food price 
 we recognise the important role that trade can play in improve food security that be why our trade policy aim to help people to access good quality and good value food our free trade agreement help to remove market access barrier support our importer and exporter the new develop country trading scheme for example reduce tariff on nearly £ worth of agriculture good and we work with international partner include at the world trade organisation to remove trade barrier and strengthen the uk ’s global food supply 
 i be grateful to the minister for his answer but melissa leach the director of the institute of development studies have speak about the need to increase access to affordable nutritious food she say 
 over the last decade charity have step in to plug the gap leave by the state but this be not an acceptable or sustainable way to address the grow prevalence of hunger 
 do the minister accept that his government ’s commitment to brexit have lead to increase price of food that be import and have contribute to food poverty in the uk 
 the hon gentleman will be well aware that food price inflation be not unique to the uk it be a global phenomenon that we all face actually food price inflation peak at in the eu and at in the uk so we be face the same problem however we have provide more than £ worth of support precisely to help the most vulnerable in society 
 there be many factor impact food inflation not least increase global input cost but surely the most important thing that my hon friend ’s department can do to shore up british agriculture and have a positive impact on food price be to carry on full speed ahead get the new trade deal that will see british class produce sell as a premium product worldwide 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct it be really important that we have support across the house for these important trade deal they be good for the british economy particularly good for british farmer and good for price in the uk i hope at some point to see the opposition party support of these important deal which be transparently in the interest of british consumer in every nation and region of the united kingdom 
 i call the shadow minister 
 since food price in the uk have rocket by a figure that be among the high in the g7 yet the prime minister ’s plan for new border check on highly perishable food from europe could push price up again a veterinary agreement would cut the cost of bring food into britain from europe give that many family be already struggle to put enough food on the table and that every significant business organisation support a veterinary agreement with the eu why will the secretary of state not take the sensible and pragmatic step of start negotiation for such an agreement 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that discussion be happen on an ongoing basis with the foreign commonwealth and development office about the trade and co operation agreement and other matter we have very constructive dialogue with our eu partner in fact the secretary of state and i have a meeting with the eu ambassador just yesterday 
 as for our achievement since leave the eu it be important to stress thing we have be laser focused on make sure that the benefit be for the british consumer we have get rid of thousand and thousand of tariff we have liberalise tariff reduce they or eliminate they altogether for example to compare we with the eu of the eu ’s current external tariff be rat whereas the proportion for the uk be we be significantly reduce tariff which be in the good interest of the british consumer as a result of leave the european union 
 what step she be take to increase trade with african country 
 to increase and grow trade with africa we be use our trade agreement cover african nation in april the prime minister will host the uk africa investment summit to showcase investment opportunity and advance way trade just this month we launch the develop country trading scheme which cover country include african country 
 that be all good news particularly the develop country trading scheme i be recently in ethiopia for a trade visit can the minister tell i how the develop country trading scheme in particular will help ethiopia 
 i thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for the work he do as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to ethiopia and many other country i be also in ethiopia recently and many people be praise my hon friend and his work he be right that the develop country trading scheme will reduce tariff which be a win win both for develop country make it easy and cheap for they to export to the uk and for uk consumer because it will reduce price it be not just a matter of have the deal we be laser focused on make sure the benefit of the deal be realise with more than department for business and trade official work in africa to make sure we get the full benefit of these deal 
 as the government rightly consider new trade deal with other country what lesson will they learn from the hideous mistake make in the new zealand and australia trade deal   the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice a former secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs rightly say that they be bad deal for britain give that british farmer be so angry with this government have be throw under the bus on animal welfare and on environmental and cost issue will he learn lesson from those mistake and make sure british farmer be protect and that environmental and animal welfare standard be protect too 
 i be quite frankly astound by the hon gentleman ’s comment he be well aware as i have say repeatedly and be widely acknowledge that the trade deal we have develop include with australia and new zealand be economically beneficial right across the uk include in his constituency if he do not wish to support policy that be in the good economic interest of his constituency that be something his constituent probably need to recognise come the next election 
 what progress she have make on negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with israel 
 we be continue to make progress towards an upgrade uk israel free trade agreement focus on service procurement and innovation and we conclude the round of negotiation on   may as service drive economy this negotiation be an excellent opportunity to build on our exist good focus agreement particularly to boost trade in service with an innovative high tech nation such as israel 
 the uk ’s trade with israel increase by in compare with and it be value at £ israel be a key trade and security partner in the region and it be a world leader in many area can the minister update the house on the department ’s progress on the trade aim outline in the road map for uk israel bilateral relation namely the establishment of a uk israel free trade agreement the britain israel investment group and a uk israel innovation and investment summit 
 my hon friend be all over the number which save i from repeat they the benefit of the trade agreement be obvious and we continue to strengthen our trade relationship with israel which be a value friend and ally as outline in the road map for uk israel relation a service base free trade agreement between our nation will act as a cornerstone of this relationship in year to come as such we be pleased to have successfully conclude the round of negotiation in london just last month and we look forward to hold further talk in due course 
 i thank the minister for that very positive response we in northern ireland be keen to ensure that the bilateral trade agreement benefit our company as well some people and council across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland wish to downgrade israel ’s good i know that the minister and our government want to do the very opposite will the minister tell the house what he be prepared to do to ensure that israeli good be promote right across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 absolutely israel be already a really important trading partner right across the uk and it will continue to be so as we negotiate this deal it be important that we focus on the area of great opportunity once the deal be do of course this be an upgrade we will be actively work to make sure that the communication about the benefit of the deal be understand by everybody we will be work with various body and group include the devolve administrations and body to make sure that we take full benefit from these deal sign the deal be thing but take and make the good of the opportunity be another we will be work on that as well 
 what step her department be take to ensure that the uk ’s accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership increase economic opportunity for business and consumer 
 the cptpp will be benefit every nation and region of our country in particular uk firm will enjoy enhance access to malaysia for the time include a reduction on tariff on whisky sale to malaysia of within year improve prospect for trade and open up opportunity in an economy worth £ 
 we should all congratulate the secretary of state and her team on conclude the cptpp negotiation and it should be ratify any time now in new zealand of course the most important new element of the trans pacific partnership be this ever free trade agreement with our long term friend and ally malaysia whether in car cyber chocolate vaccine or legal and other service the opportunity for british exporter be considerable and of course the dividend from our investment there such as the new smith nephew plant will also help our balance of payment do my right hon friend therefore agree that there be a great opportunity for we and malaysia to work together on spread the word through our regional office the uk asean business council and every other mean possible to make sure that business in both country be absolutely aware of the opportunity that the deal offer 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he will be pleased to know that ministers in the department meet their counterpart the malaysian export minister this very week a lot be go on between our country the department work closely with the uk asean business council and our bilateral joint economic trade committee with malaysia be expect later this year it will help promote the bilateral trade and investment and economic co operation that he rightly champion as the trade envoy to that country he will know that i will be sign the cptpp agreement next month in new zealand 
 i call the shadow minister 
 clearly it be vital that british business that want to export can access the benefit of trade deal however the government admit to i in a write answer that they have not model the benefit of the cptpp for our hard press manufacturing business so will the minister tell i how many uk manufacturer will benefit from the rule of origin requirement under the cptpp 
 the hon lady will know that we do not count the number of company specifically in our modelling the modelling happen at a very high level it be macro level modelling what she should know be that rule of origin will benefit people who export to that region particularly auto manufacturer who be very pleased about the deal 
 what step her department have take to ensure that the free trade agreement with israel complie with the uk ’s obligation in section of united nations security council resolution 
 what step her department have take to ensure that the free trade agreement with israel complie with international law 
 what step her department have take to ensure that the free trade agreement with israel complie with the uk ’s obligation in section of united nations security council resolution 
 the uk ’s position on settlement be clear they be illegal under international law present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a state solution as set out in the un security council resolution and restate recently by the unsc presidential statement in february we repeatedly call on israel to abide by its obligation under international law and have a regular dialogue with israel on legal issue relate to the occupation 
 the minister be clearly aware then that resolution state that country must 
 distinguish in their relevant dealing between the territory of the state of israel and the territory occupy since 
 i welcome his comment confirm that the government ’s belief be that the settlement be illegal under international law how will the government ensure that good and service from these illegal settlement in effect steal land be exclude from the benefit of a free trade agreement 
 under our exist agreement israeli good from the state of israel receive tariff preference under the uk israel partnership agreement palestinian good from the occupied palestinian territories benefit from trade preference in the interim uk palestinian authority bilateral agreement to be clear only good originate from the state of israel be cover by our current fta and that will not change in the upgrade fta 
 last week it be report by the jerusalem post that israel ’s national security minister ben gvir who just year ago be convict of incite racism and support a terrorist organisation have tell settler in the illegal west bank outpost of evyatar 
 the land of israel must be settle and at the same time as the settlement of the land a military operation must be launch 
 he then speak of demolition and the killing of thousand of palestinians in order to fulfil our great mission will the minister condemn those genocidal remark about palestinians and ensure that any trade deal with israel explicitly ban uk trade with those illegal settlement and make binding regulation for company to uphold human right standard 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that the uk be a lead advocate of human right around the world we have very frank conversation with our ally and we have frank and honest discussion across government in answer to the trade element of his question as i say previously only good originate in the state of israel be cover by our current fta and that will not change under the upgrade fta 
 i welcome the minister ’s restatement of government policy in his previous answer but if the uk sign a trade deal without a territorial clause define the border between israel and palestine it will be see in legal term as equivalent to let israel decide by default to include its settlement in the occupied palestinian territories as part of israel be the minister aware that that risk a situation where in effect the uk recognise illegal settlement in the west bank as part of israel which be counter to the government ’s state policy 
 i refer the hon lady to the answer i give a moment ago but i wish to reiterate that it be long stand uk foreign policy that israeli settlement beyond the boundary be illegal 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the potential effect of the uk ’s withdrawal from the european single market on business and trade 
 have regain our regulatory sovereignty now that we have leave the european union we be now able to ensure that our regulation be tailor to the uk economy support our business and protect our consumer have leave the single market we can focus on uk trade with the world where total trade be up so the answer to his question be that the effect be that total trade be up 
 resilient and effective route to market be essential for trade the congestion that be currently be experience at dover be a significant barrier to effective trade we can add to that the hgv mile from scotland to the south east and the impact on the quantity carry on perishable and on cost never mind the environmental impact will the minister meet i to discuss how we reintroduce direct link from scotland to mainland europe and ensure trade be friction free from scotland 
 i do not think the hon member hear my answer trade be up the reality be that this scaremongering just have to stop the scaremongering be basically a cover for petty nationalism and i would ask he to be passionate about the market that matter which be between scotland and england 
 rise 
 if the hon member be passionate about scottish business and scottish job he would be passionate about the single market that matter 
 what step she be take to implement the neonatal care leave and pay act 
 i thank my hon friend for be the foremost parliamentary champion for this important cause the neonatal care leave and pay   act will give eligible employ parent up to week of extra pay leave if their new baby be admit to neonatal care provide extra support at a very worrying time we be keen to introduce the new entitlement as quickly as possible 
 i thank the minister for that answer and his department for its work on deliver the neonatal care leave and pay act it be fantastic news for so many parent across the country we all want to see this entitlement deliver as quickly as possible it really should be possible for the department to deliver it for april next year as there be time to deliver the require statutory instrument and guidance there be example of where his majesty ’s revenue and customs have be able to move forward quickly to deliver such change will the minister update the house on his work to drive through this important change so that parent do not have to wait a long than necessary for this entitlement which will support they during the most difficult and dark time in their life 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to press we on this we need to do this as quickly as possible and we be keen as i have say to do that similar work do require update hmrc it system and parliamentary consideration be of course require for secondary legislation there be piece of secondary legislation and support be need for employer and payroll provider to implement the change we can not introduce this mid year it have to be at the start of the year i therefore think it very unlikely that we will be able to do that before april 
 what step her department be take to support the battery sector 
 i recently visit williams advanced engineering an excellent example of british engineer work at the cutting edge of battery technology include on project benefit from the faraday battery challenge the government ’s £ faraday battery challenge have support more than organisation work across the uk attract over £ in co investment and enable researcher across more than university to improve and develop battery technology 
 we know that the united kingdom need more battery production facility in order to achieve net and build an automotive industry that be fit for the future on the blyth estuary we have the good site in the uk for high volume battery manufacturing with green power supply a deep water port and a talented and willing workforce do the minister agree that it be vital that this government grasp the opportunity and do all that they can to bring much need new green job to south east northumberland 
 yes of course i do agree with my hon friend i know that blyth have an excellent location for a gigafactory i just want he to know as he represent that constituency that we continue to work closely with the local authority to secure the good outcome for that site 
 will the secretary of state be slightly cautious about a battery drive future i recently visit jcb which have develop a hydrogen combustion engine that be work well with heavy vehicle hydrogen be move very fast indeed will she encourage the production of hydrogen and visit jcb just to see the really innovative work that it be do will she stop the transport minister in the house of lords diss hydrogen as ineffective 
 far be it from i to stop our noble friend in the other place from do what they think be right none the less i do agree with the hon gentleman my view be let a flower bloom hydrogen be of the viable way of help we to get to net and the government be look at all possible option to make sure that we support the cutting edge technology that will get we to our green transition 
 what the value of export to the eu be in a b and c the last year for which data be available 
 the value of uk export measure in current price to the eu include good and service be £ in £ in and £ in the eu remain the uk ’s large export market receive of uk export in 
 that be all very interesting because during the brexit referendum project fear tell we that if we leave the eu million of people would lose their job our export would collapse and the economy would go into freefall here in with we outside the european union employment be at record high and unemployment at record low the eurozone be in recession and we be not and our export to the eu be at record level be it not now demonstrably true that we be always go to be well off out 
 as churchill once say the pessimist see a crisis in every opportunity but the optimist which my hon friend be see an opportunity in every crisis the uk ’s total export have recover to pre pandemic level measure against in uk export be £ up in current price and up once adjust for inflation there be no doubt that uk export be excel and will continue to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the truth be that in the year state export to the eu fall as a proportion of total trade last month it be not inflation that halve but export of fruit to the eu the british chambers of commerce have report that more small and medium sized enterprise be see export fall than rise and britain have the low export rate in the g7 when a business tell i that it use to take day for its product to reach shelf in germany and now it take be it not fair to conclude   that the government have fail on the economy have no plan to make brexit work and be make business pay the price 
 that back up my comment on pessimism the hon lady be cherry pick the bad possible figure she can find in my conversation this week at the oecd conference on sme nation around the world be cry out to do business with the uk and indeed be do so of course we be try to tackle market barrier where they exist we be lead a whole of government effort to remove a hit list of market access barrier include those arise in europe to open up opportunity to uk exporter worth more than £ the most recent statistic for the year end march show that barrier be resolve in europe in that year compare with in the previous year 
 what recent assessment her department have make of trend in the level of good export since the uk ’s withdrawal from the eu 
 on a similar theme to my previous answer the uk ’s total export have recover to pre pandemic level measure against in uk export be £ up in current price and by once adjust for inflation 
 i thank the minister for that answer however since the uk leave the european union its trade surplus with the rest of the world have decline from £ to £ be it this government ’s goal to wipe out the uk ’s trade surplus when they commit to leave the european union 
 i say again that uk trade with the eu have recover to pre pandemic level when measure in current price worth £ in high in current price than in we be make significant progress not just with the european union but with the rest of the world we see our place in the world as be able to trade with the entire world not just focus entirely on the eu 
 what step she be take to help support the steel industry 
 the government be actively engage with the steel industry for a sustainable future and my right hon friend the business secretary recently visit tata and british steel to see work that be under way since the government have provide some £ in direct funding to support steel producer on top of the hundred of million of pound in energy price relief for the sector since 
 i echo the early comment of my hon friend   the member for aberavon stephen kinnock   on the great need for support to help our steel sector decarbonise steelworker from my constituency rally   in parliament square yesterday call for the government to support our steel sector yet they will have hear the prime minister ’s poor response to my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore   at prime minister ’s question when he merely refer to pre existing package of support and funding that be not exclusive to steel in the place when will the government accept the scale of the challenge and commit to help 
 we accept the scale of the challenge it be a global challenge to decarbonise the sector and many country be feel it however a potential £ in support be not a small measure it be a large measure deal with the procurement process to ensure that we have uk contractor secure uk steel in their programme of work be not a small task nor be deal with energy price we have provide more than £ when the sector need support and we know it be a valid use of taxpayer money we have step in such as with the more than £ in government loan to celsa steel in that secure job and the money have be return to the taxpayer we be more than happy to work with the hon lady and all member who have steel firm in their constituency but we be go to provide steady support for the long term 
 what step her department be take to help reduce potential barrier to trade for cornish business 
 we be target a global hit list of barrier whose removal will deliver massive new opportunity for uk business throughout the country include in cornwall it be estimate that that will be worth more than £ over year the government be work to open up new market include for cornish farmer british lamb be now be export to america for the time in over year and british beef be be send to the philippines 
 many of the business in my constituency pay an additional tax by way of a toll to cross the tamar which can run into many thousand of pound for they what representation have the department make to the department for transport to have that additional tax which can make it hard to compete with firm in the rest of the uk remove 
 i thank my hon friend for bring that to my attention she be such a powerful voice for cornwall i be surprised that the department for transport have not yet buckle because i know what a champion she be for her constituency and the region i will ask my team to engage on this matter with their counterpart at the dft and the department for levelling up housing and communities i know that she will not stop until she get what she deserve for her constituent so i be more than happy to give the strength to her elbow 
 how many trade deal have be agree since 
 we have secure trade deal with country include the eu since partner that account for £ of uk bilateral trade in as i mention early in march we conclude negotiation with the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership the uk ’s big trade deal since brexit in addition we have sign new comprehensive trade deal tailor to the uk those with japan australia and new zealand a groundbreaking digital economy agreement with singapore and a digital trade agreement with ukraine as well as the programme of non eu continuity agreement 
 the post brexit develop country trading scheme which be allude to in early question cover develop country and people will my right hon friend spell out exactly what the benefit be for business and consumer in hinckley and bosworth and the uk and can she confirm that that be a more generous scheme than the eu scheme that we leave 
 i can confirm that our offer be now more generous than what the eu offer in term of market access for example we allow the least develop country to source raw material from other market and still import good tariff free overall my hon friend ’s constituent will be pleased to know that the trade preference in the develop country trading scheme reduce import cost by more than £ a year that be key because it help to reduce price and increase choice for uk business and consumer and to tackle inflation particularly for the highest sell item such as clothe and food 
 what step she be take to increase trade with european country 
 europe remain a vital export destination for british business with export of £ in an increase of on the previous year in current price only this week i attend the oecd small and medium sized enterprise conference which deal largely with international barrier to trade we be determined to remove market barrier to make it easy particularly for sme to trade across border 
 on the subject of barrier to trade not only be our world lead cultural sector valuable in itself for our soft power but it be an important part of our export trade but our musician face unnecessary red tape when try to tour europe we need an eu wide visa waiver for tour artist the secretary of state say early that her department work closely with musician so what be it actually do to resolve this problem 
 i know that my colleague at the department for culture media and sport be work hard with our european counterpart to try to ease the difficulty in that area we recognise it as a problem many positive thing be happen in current trade with the eu indeed in the north west the hon   gentleman ’s region export £ worth of good and £ worth of service which be the area he be refer to the north west be the large area in the country for service export to the eu 
 what progress she have make on improve market access to the us 
 as part of the atlantic declaration we launch negotiation on a critical mineral agreement with the us which will secure market access for a strategically important sector of the uk economy my department have secure tariff free import of uk steel and aluminium into the us support job in uk supply chain we have remove the year us ban on uk lamb open the market to us customer and have sign trade and economic development memorandum of understanding with individual us state which import £ worth of good from the uk in most recently last week with utah 
 in their election manifesto the conservatives declare to the british people 
 our goal for british trade be ambitious we aim to have per cent of uk trade cover by free trade agreement within the next year start with the usa 
 however there have be abject failure with a free trade agreement nowhere in sight and instead of come clean on their incompetence laughingly tories be now line up to blame the biden administration for the lack of progress will the secretary of state concede that the government ’s failure to negotiate an fta with the usa have potentially lock out british business from vital new market create by the us inflation reduction act 
 i be afraid that be not the case at all if the hon gentleman look at the detail of the atlantic declaration he will see that we be co operate very closely with the us on his point about our manifesto we do say that that be what we be go to do because the administration at the time be willing this administration be not it have nothing to do with the uk they be not negotiate any fta with any country that be what the us trade representative have say to i in many meeting and they have say that to eu counterpart 
 if what the hon gentleman suggest be true he be basically say that every government should be bind by their predecessor in which case should anything happen he be say that he agree with everything this government be do and nothing should change what we have negotiate with the atlantic declaration be a success and he should be praise this government for achieve something so monumental 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my interest as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to the united states for regional trade and investment our programme of mou with state in the united states be a major driver of improve market access and trade between the uk and the us as i embark on a visit to florida to advance our objective there will   my right hon friend use this opportunity to reaffirm not just that we want to enter into multiple mou with state in the united states but that we want british business to step up to the opportunity they create and we want to create the mechanism to allow business to business delivery 
 absolutely i can affirm that my right hon friend make a very good point about the mou the opposition would like to present a false story about we not get along with our us counterpart the fact that so many state know that their federal government be not negotiate an fta have decide to step up and negotiate mou with we show that this country be still attract a large amount of investment and co operation from our international partner we want british business to be able to take part in that and we be do everything we can to help they use the mou 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 last week i be pleased to lead discussion with international partner and business at the ukraine recovery conference and welcome the prime minister of ukraine and deputy prime minister to mansion house alongside over company showcase how uk company in our private sector can use their ingenuity and expertise to support the reconstruction of ukraine 
 i be very proud to announce that the uk government have back a £ equivalent loan which be an unprecedented transaction the business bridge ukraine platform match ukrainian business with complementary partner the uk ukraine tech bridge to bring together uk and ukrainian tech business to harness opportunity for innovation and collaboration and the london conference framework on war risk insurance 
 recent research by a former chief competition economist to the european commission share with i by unite the union estimate that average uk mobile phone bill could rise by up to £ a year in the case of a merger between and vodafone be the secretary of state aware of that risk and will her department be take any action to prevent such a merger which would be disastrous for competition in the mobile network operator sector 
 the hon lady will know that we have an independent regulator the competition and markets authority which would look at case such as the she raise and make a call on whether it would be harmful or beneficial to the uk economy i trust the cma it have be do a good job so far and i look forward to see its read out on forthcoming merger and proposal by large business in our country 
 morocco be very much look to do more trade and business with the united kingdom what be the government do to enable that country to do so

 i hope that my hon friend will allow i to use my brain to help unlock this with the department for transport we have the automotive transformation fund and the advanced propulsion centre so we be do a huge amount of work in this space to ensure that we be not only on the cutting edge of electric emission vehicle but look at what the opportunity be for hydrogen we do not want to be leave behind anywhere in this space but we do need to align ourselves with the rest of our departments and i will do so

 it should be transparently clear that the uk be conduct trade deal that be in the uk ’s economic interest that be the criterion we would not do they if they be not in the uk ’s interest we be therefore work really hard with a particular focus on opportunity for sme to trade not only with the eu but right around the world where there be immense opportunity for further trade we will continue to pursue opportunity in south asia africa and south america all over the world where we have not take full advantage of those opportunity this will benefit many sme include food and beverage producer in the long term

 the hon gentleman raise a very good point he be right that we need to make sure there be resilience across the sector and i think our regulator be well place to do that they be carry out a number of review at the moment and i and colleague across government be work closely with they 
 the secretary of state early tell my hon friend   the member for gordon richard thomson   that she do not accept that brexit be have a negative impact on the scottish seafood industry it be a bit like say she do not accept that the earth be round although admittedly sometimes people on her back benches need to be persuade of that if she do not think that brexit be have a negative impact on the scottish seafood industry do she think it have be positive or do she think there have not be any change at all 
 the hon gentleman be entitle to his opinion as i be entitle to mine he have do absolutely nothing except try to re litigate brexit over and over again the fact be that we be not go back into the eu we be use our independent trade policy negotiate with country around the world and deliver more for the uk as well as for scotland scottish business be happy with what we be do and in particular they be happy that the grown up in westminster have stop they make the catastrophic decision that be destroy the internal market 
 be the secretary of state aware of just how much influence the chinese government and chinese company have on our economy be she aware that many time i have ask for an audit of how big that influence be do she share the concern of many business in our country that the chinese government be use subterfuge and espionage to further their interest 
 that ’ question pick whichever

 how do it help uk steel to decarbonise or help the uk to reclaim its position of global leadership in reduce climate emission to support the opening of a sure to be doom new coalmine in west cumbria

 go back to brexit can the secretary of state name scottish sheep farmer who be happy with the brexit   deal or any seafood producer and exporter that she speak to who be happy with brexit can she name any scottish farming sector that be happy with brexit 
 it be not my job to memorise name of scottish business and just as i say in response to a previous question snp members be not serious perhaps if they stand up and actually represent their business in try to make use of all the opportunity we have they would be in a well place 
 when it come to increase trade with african country what step be be take to ensure that increase trade be carry out with company that take human right seriously and be ethically aware in the treatment of their worker

 on a point of order mr speaker during question time this morning the minister for industry and economic security   the hon member for wealden ms ghani appear to have be confuse about the nature of oral question i ask a supplementary question which be ostensibly a polite request to meet the minister to discuss matter of importance to my constituent in her response she choose to use a pejorative insult clearly intend to be an insult and that do not reflect well on the government i be a member of this parliament just as any other member and i deserve to be able to ask question about the interest of my constituency without that kind of harassment she accuse i of nationalism but i suggest that the only nationalism on display be from those benches 
 order i do not know whether the minister want to respond 
 indicate dissent 
 if not there be nothing disorderly and i can not continue the debate what i can say be that the hon member have certainly put his view on the record 
 am

 friday july the house will not be sit 
 the provisional business for the week commence   july   include 
 monday july debate on the special report of the committee of privileges follow by remain stage of the electronic trade documents bill lords follow by reading of the northern ireland budget no bill 
 i thank the leader of the house for announce the forthcoming business i be glad she have announce that the government will follow precedent and allow mps to approve the privileges committee special report release this morning its conclusion be clear it find that senior tory parliamentarian take it upon themselves to undermine the procedure of this house and shamefully that include a serve minister and a former leader of the house the report note that the matter be make more difficult because of the member mount the most vociferous attack on the committee do so from the platform of their own host tv show that undermine democracy and undermine this house we owe it to the member of the privileges committee to give they our support 
 frankly it be about time that the prime minister show up and show some leadership if he do not stand up for standard what do he actually stand for i urge this house to endorse the report a week on monday that matter because the public need to be able to trust the system we have when ministers mislead the house whether intentionally or not and fail to correct the record or when an mp a minister or bad of all a serve prime minister lie to this house and   thereby to the public the public need to know that we have proper process for deal with that which we do by undermine this committee the members risk undermine democracy itself 
 as we find out during last week ’s vote when it come to uphold standard this prime minister stand down be that what he be plan to do again with this report be he really still happy for senior mps in his own party to undermine and attack britain ’s democratic institution be it not time that he personally condemn those who seek to override parliament ’s standard system to get of their own off the hook 
 we have break news that the plan to send asylum seeker to rwanda have be rule unlawful i be sure the leader of the house be expect i to welcome the long await impact assessment for that illegal migration bill i would call it the big migration backlog bill or now the unlawful migration bill i use the word impact assessment with a heavy dose of irony as it do not tell we how much the bill would cost or what the impact of any of its policy would be so it be not much of an impact assessment be it the leader of the house have previously describe impact assessment as very handy and most helpful and i could not agree more why do the government wait so long to publish the impact assessment and then publish this which be neither handy nor helpful be that perhaps why she should not be surprised nor should any of we by the break news from the court 
 while the current prime minister focus on keep boris johnson ’s sycophant in his own party happy introduce new law which by his government ’s own admission will not work and now seem to have be find illegal and swerve scrutiny people up and down the country be leave face the cost of tory mortgage penalty and soar rent the leader of the opposition a man of honour and integrity will restore trust in politic he will show leadership on the issue that matter to work people and act immediately to bring down the cost of living

 the hon lady mention the break news of the court of appeal judgment it be a mixed judgment because although what she say about the ruling on the policy be absolutely true the court also confirm that rwanda be a safe country this be clearly a matter for the home office to update the house on we respect the court ’s decision and i think there will be a statement later today from the home secretary on that 
 the hon lady know that i have push department to make sure that impact assessment be publish in a timely way they be important i hope all member of the house will also consider the impact of we not have system that be fit for purpose we have to direct our finite resource for these matter at the people we need to help if our asylum system be overload and we be not able to send back people who do not have the right to be here we be not use the finite resource we have effectively 
 the hon lady mention the cost of living crisis particularly as it relate to housing cost i understand how frightening and stressful those cost can be it make life incredibly complicated when people have to juggle how they will get through the week these be very difficult time and we be determined to ensure that family and individual can get through they there be unprecedented global challenge that we be have to deal with for example we have to stick to the plan on ukraine and not waver in our support as member will have hear in the chancellor ’s statement on monday we have increase support for mortgage interest scheme and there be all the other thing that we have do regard provider there be also the new consumer duty place on the financial conduct authority and of course there be the £ for cost of live support measure we will do everything that we can to ensure that family get through this difficult time and further business will be announce in the usual way

 that write statement be not available at the end of prime minister ’s question at it become available in the library at over an hour and a quarter later it be not mention by either minister in the debate on the bill and no member of this house know about it 
 will my right hon friend say to parliamentary clerks if not to the cabinet that that be no way to treat this house information that be important to the house should be available for a debate especially as the statement say that the estimate cost of the memorial have go up from £ to £ an increase of over a in year i hope she will agree that that be not the way to treat this place

 in scotland this week the iconic caledonian sleeper rail service be return to public ownership where it join scotrail lner london north eastern railway northern rail southeastern transport for wales and transpennine express although they be often refer to as operator of last resort experience show that they make excellent operator of resort perhaps the conclusion to draw be that some thing just naturally belong in public ownership like the water industry in scotland give the current travail of thames water may i suggest that the leader of the house make time available for a debate on why the public interest should always take precedence over private profit not only in the rail sector but in the provision of water 
 i understand that it be the leader of the house ’s custom and practice to spend almost as much time respond to what the snp spokesperson say as criticise public service in scotland before she get to that may i ask that she make time for debate on why police force in england continue to remain in special measure and why a report publish today show that nhs staff sickness in england have hit a record high so that we can find out what the government intend to do about it

 we be promise another oral statement and a chance for member to scrutinise the government ’s response but that response have be downgrade to a write ministerial statement which mean that members of parliament include local mp such as i cannot ask question on behalf of the family who be grieve and who want to avert a repeat of this tragedy when will we have opportunity to bring home office ministers to the house to ask they why they reject so many of the coroner ’s recommendation which would have make gun law well and safe for all our community so that a tragedy such as the we see in plymouth could never be repeat

 for i harm reduction have to be the focal point when organise those fantastic musical event i would like a debate in government time that get to the bottom of that inexplicable home office u turn because in prior time the home office sanction this activity take place on site at festival with home office branding in fact it have even permit greater manchester police and avon and somerset police to allow this stuff to take place as well as have their own forensic early warning system in place so that people can participate and make adult inform choice about what they be and be not go to do in a much safe way 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i know that this be of concern to other member our position on this issue have not change drug testing provider must have a licence to test for control drug include at festival we have always have that condition in place and we have make that clear and law enforcement have always have a responsibility to uphold that legal requirement we have not receive any application for drug testing at major festival this summer and we continue to keep an open dialogue with any potential applicant he will know that home office question be on monday so he may wish to pursue the matter with the department 
 my norwegian constituent have make her life here with her scottish husband and their son she should be welcome but she have to win she right to residence via the court month on her life be in limbo because the home office have not issue a biometric residence permit which be prevent she from work from access healthcare and from leave the country can we have a statement on home office timescale for issue residence permit what can be do to expedite matter for my constituent whose lawyer say this be the bad delay he have ever encounter 
 i be sorry to hear about that unfortunate case the hon gentleman will know because i have advertise it many time include i think to he that the home office be offer surgery and bespoke service to all member either face to face or remotely he will know that home office question be on monday and i encourage he to raise this matter with the home secretary and her ministers 
 i preface my remark by say that i completely appreciate how busy minister be and the workload they carry which be why i have never before raise such a concern in parliament 
 on sunday there be a demonstration by detainee at harmondsworth detention centre in my constituency i email the relevant minister on the various email account that be available to we and i simply want to know what be happen i be concern about the   welfare of the detainee and staff many of whom be my constituent and i receive no response on sunday i think that in the normal run of thing we would have have either an oral or write statement on monday as we have have in the past nothing happen so we contact the minister ’s office again nothing happen on tuesday so we contact the office again and no response 
 as you know mr speaker i also seek to raise the matter in the house on tuesday but other business understandably take precedence i contact the minister ’s office on wednesday and basically say that if i have not hear anything by noon i would be raise a point of order minute before noon i receive a reply which be inaccurate 
 i understand how busy people be but this be just unacceptable behaviour when i have constituent and other contact i about this incident there be continue problem so i ask the leader of the house to raise this with the ministers concerned and say that this behaviour be not acceptable secondly i would welcome a debate in the house on what be happen at harmondsworth because there be continue concern about the welfare of both detainee and staff and this have continue year after year without resolution 
 i be sorry to hear about the right hon gentleman ’s experience when there be particular incident and situation it be important that member be able to get hold of the relevant people quickly whether that be official or minister if he could take the trouble to send i an email with the detail of what happen i would be very happy to raise it with the department
