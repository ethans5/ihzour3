i thank you madam deputy speaker for this opportunity to come to the house to discuss the importance of river crossing in my constituency of gravesham i be grateful to the minister for give up his time today to respond to the debate 
 i wish to cover crossing old and closed which be the gravesend to tilbury ferry and planned and very expensive which be the low thames crossing for those who do not know gravesham constituency be a river community we be bind by the river thames with all its history just as we member be here in the house and we be only mile apart for much of the history of the borough there have be river crossing certainly since roman time accord to esteemed local historian christoph bull the right of long ferry be exclusively give to gravesend waterman to provide a river service to and from london this be a bit of a history lesson but that be confirm by the king in in a charter the aim be to help rebuild the town after a fire in 
 since then there have be a river crossing in place between the constituency of my hon friend   the member for thurrock jen craft   and mine it have connect the ancient kingdom of kent and essex for eon enable travel for trade leisure and tourism today the port of london authority which control all travel of boat up and down the thames be base in my constituency and i pay tribute to it the royal national lifeboat institution have a base on the river in gravesend and i know that the house would want to extend our thank to it for the work it do across the country 
 the people of gravesham and of my hon friend ’s constituency of thurrock be river people many family include mine have link to the river my late father in law trevor mochrie be a gravesend tug seaman who work on the river early in his career before work on the high sea as the river be the main artery to and from london gravesham be and be strong on industry and it be a source of employment in tourism and leisure in particular we have our gravesend regatta which be celebrate year it be run before that but it be make official year ago by the council because of some very unparliamentary dispute that take place about who win a race i place on record my tribute to the committee its chair shane cleaver and all the volunteer for keep this tradition go in a sportsmanlike fashion and there have be no further dispute of that kind 
 give that extensive local history and heritage it be to our dismay and that of resident business and visitor from thurrock and gravesend that thurrock council and kent county council cease fund the gravesend tilbury ferry service last year since the ending of that service local business have suffer significantly they have tell i that it have impact on people ’s ability to get to and from work and that they have lose many people who can not bear the thought of take the dartford crossing in order to get to work on our high street particular business marie ’s tea room which use to cater for the pass trade from the large cruise ship that use to dock at tilbury have   be impact to the point that it can no long employ a member of staff these thing have impact and i be sure it be the same across our high street 
 i have be run a petition as have my hon friend the member for thurrock and there have be other my petition have garner thousand of signature 
 motion lapse standing order no 9(3 
 motion make and question propose that this house do now adjourn.—(keir mather 
 my petition which have garner thousand of signature call for the return of the ferry service it be clear that business and resident want their ferry back 
 at present there be a desire for people to travel by public transport which i support people should leave their car at home but they need option previously the option be a minute jump across the water now the option be a train into london and back out again or multiple bus to get through the dartford crossing all this be cost we precious time 
 if we as a society want to support public transport relieve congestion on the road should be at the heart of everything we do take the example of the woolwich ferry which by parliamentary statute must be run and be not able to charge i be not ask tempt as it be for that to be the case for the gravesend tilbury ferry but i be ask the local authority to protect these valuable transport route 
 the hon gentleman be welcome to choose his tone i will continue to the end of my comment my job be to come and explain the government ’s decision and to be hold accountable for it that be what i be do today and what i will continue to do over the course of my remark it be right that the government be then ask question about their decision that be the nature of this democracy as the hon member for east wiltshire say 
 an important consideration in the government make this decision be that evidence show that send people unsolicited letter be unlikely to affect what they know that be why letter be send only as part of wide communication campaign this evidence be not properly consider by the ombudsman another consideration be that the great majority of 1950 bear woman be aware of the state pension age change if not of a change in their specific state pension age as several hon member have point out my hon friend the member for salford mention the statistic of refer to the rather than survey however as she will know that refer to all woman include some woman as young as if we look at the cohort of woman bear in the 1950 the figure be far far high on those and other ground we reject the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice and remedy 
 member will be aware that litigation be live so i will not go into lot more detail on the research evidence which be the core of that litigation i will just say thing our decision be base on publish research report which be robust and meet professional standard secondly the same awareness research which the right hon member for new forest east disparage be use by the ombudsman 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of the spending review on the heritage sector 
 i want to pay tribute to the chancellor of the exchequer for the way she conduct the spending review in the word of diana ross she reach out and touch our department with £ mean we can make this world a well place for the heritage sector the department for culture media and sport be already invest an additional £ this year through the heritage at risk and heritage revival fund 
 last month i be pleased to host a true heritage champion dame mary beard in colchester she come to visit an incredible sporting heritage site britain ’s only know roman chariot race track the colchester roman circus she like i think that we should make much more of the site and that we be miss a national trick if we do not do the minister agree that any new housing development adjacent to the site must make the most of this national heritage value and will he visit the site which surely combine both element of his brief actually all the element sport culture and medium in the most spectacular fashion 
 ben hur 
 do you say ben hur mr speaker i do not think we be go to enact ben hur 
 we could ride chariot at once 
 it be not rugby league mr speaker 
 as my hon friend know i fully support the project which i know she have be engage in since before she be an mp right through until now i be delighted that she have mary beard involve and i be sure that by   the end of this she will be able to pronounce veni vidi vici 
 the secretary of state and i be lucky enough to represent greater manchester constituency in a part of the country that play a pivotal role in our industrial heritage now although wigan be lovely it be not hazel grove so she will not have the junction of the macclesfield and peak forest canal she will not have our wonderful marple aqueduct and she will not have of the long lock flight in the country what support will the minister give to community like mine that be keen to see our area have world heritage site status so that these heritage asset get the support funding and protection that they deserve 
 well i have just be tell that i be on the side of wigan laughter but there be a more serious point here which be that the uk have unesco world heritage site we be of the big contributor in the world to unesco and passionate supporter of it there be a slight danger that if we have too many and we add too many to the list people will start try to take other off we so we have to manage it carefully none the less the hon lady make a good point about the historic site in many of our constituency that we need to preserve not least as part of our tourism offer for international visitor 
 what step she be take to support child ’s access to theatre 
 art and culture be erase from both our classroom and our community for year and we be waste no time in fix that i be really pleased that in february we be able to announce the £ art everywhere fund which will help a whole generation of young people to access theatre and the art that they deserve as part of their rich large life 
 i recently visit keir hardie primary school in canning town which have be involve in a scheme run by disney that end up with of the child perform in the jungle book in the west end the child be now absolutely enthuse by the idea of performance and theatre and the teacher tell i that their concentration be well their confidence be well and they be show benefit in their academic work do the secretary of state agree that as well as the benefit of access to theatre there be clearly academic benefit too we need to see more opportunity like this particularly in constituency like mine where circumstance often mean that child do not get access to this kind of thing 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend and throw the government ’s full weight behind the work he be do to support this area i have see it for myself at shakespeare north in knowsley where young people be develop communication and oracy skill that they would not otherwise have have through the amazing work that those institution do that be why this government be determined to turn around the appalling legacy that we inherit from the last government 
 we will shortly publish the interim report of our national youth strategy i be appal to find that only in young people in the last year have be able to access the art in this country we be determined that will change 
 the secretary of state be get a liking for visit northern ireland with that in mind what discussion have she have with her counterpart in northern ireland on the importance of further engagement between local theatre and school across northern ireland the very thing   the hon member for west ham and beckton james asser   mention to ensure that young child can access drama in educational setting 
 we be very aware of the importance of the art in northern ireland and my hon friend the minister for creative industries arts and tourism have have discussion directly with our counterpart it be a devolved matter but it be the clear view of this government that art and culture belong to everybody we be work closely with all nation and region across the uk to make sure that wherever people grow up and whatever their background there be no barrier to they be able to access the art which be an essential part of a rich large life 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we come into the chamber today we hear the tragic news of the passing of diogo jota the liverpool footballer at the age of i want to put on the record our condolence to his friend and family and to liverpool fan across the world 
 these be the dcms oral since the spending review which make real term cut to dcms revenue and capital budget for month we have be warn the secretary of state not to let the chancellor take money away from the creative industry but it be quite clear that the secretary of state and her ministers fail to stand up for this key sector she talk about the legacy of theatre for child but of course to have that we need a thriving theatre sector the society of london theatre and uk theatre say that although the government talk a good game on back our creative industry the figure tell a different story they be right be n’t they the secretary of state and the minister fail to stand up for our world lead theatre and creative industry do n’t they 
 that be some brass neck from the opposition give the appalling state of what we inherit not only year of neglect of theatre in particular but also the lack of investment in the infrastructure and the building which leave we with a situation where our great national institution be struggle just to stay open across the country and in so many community the local theatre which provide the access to the rich large life that we have be discuss be allow to close the last government show a violent indifference to theatre and the art in general we have more than double investment into the creative industry and make they of our priority for growth i be proud to be work with theatre big and small across the country to usher in a new golden era in which they can flourish 
 what step her department be take to ensure the creative industry sector plan support the growth of live music 
 may i take a moment to echo the shadow minister ’s comment about diogo jota we receive the heartbreaking news before we come into the chamber that he tragically lose his life at just year of age the whole house and my hon friend   the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker   in particular will be heartbroken by this news and i want to send our sympathy to his friend and family on behalf of the whole house 
 the whole house should be proud of the creative industry sector plan we work on it with the creative industry as a whole and with member across the house i be really pleased that we have a transformative music growth package worth up to £ in that sector plan that more than double annual funding 
 the secretary of state will know that   oasis kick off their world tour this week and i be proud that their english gig be in the borough of bury a brilliant moment for manchester ’s world class   live music scene host the sell out show with fan a night bring the band quid but it bring serious local pressure on licensing safety transport and clean up yet bury receive no funding for those additional cost the as yet unconfirmed suggest £ community fund barely scratch the surface while we be proud to host should the legacy of such a global event really just be the prep and clear up cost will the secretary of state and her department ensure that community like mine see a fair share of the benefit and not just the burden of host major cultural event 
 my hon friend make an important point it be absolutely fitting that oasis be return to greater manchester and bury be a very fitting venue not least because my hon friend have long champion live music and also indulge or should i say inflicted?—live music on many of we for year he will know that this government be keen to ensure that the community feel the benefit in particular the minister for creative industries arts and tourism have be work hard with industry to introduce a levy on arena and stadium ticket to ensure that we support small venue and help more artist tour nationally the art and music in particular be an ecosystem which we be determined to rebuild after year of neglect 
 i very much support the creative industry sector plan i think it will do a lot of good in ensure that live music be promote and i hope to see some of the trickle down effect that the secretary of state talk about but the creative industry sector plan also talk about establish a copyright regime that value and protect human creativity can she say when we might see the promise report when the work group might be set up and who will be ask to serve on they 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question because i know this have cause considerable concern to many people in this house and the other place we be absolutely committed to bring forward legislative change that provide certainty and clarity both for ai and tech company and for the creative industry and to ensure that transparency and remuneration be at the heart of that legislation as he rightly say the creative industry be central to the future of our economy and must be protect the government recognise that as well my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade and i will bring forward the roundtable and working group before the summer recess

 my last point if you will indulge i mr speaker be that the woman ’s euros kick off this week and even though it be the wrong shape ball i be excited to see the lionesses and the welsh football team in the competition it be so important that we celebrate woman in sport 
 my hon friend be an incredible champion for sport in general and rugby in particular 
 rugby union 
 i know it be the wrong sort of rugby as far as you be concern mr speaker we be really proud of this incredible achievement for the uk it be fitting that my hon friend ask this question with exactly day to go until the woman ’s rugby world cup kick off we want to make it the big ever so far ticket have be sell 
 recently the prime minister and i be at st george ’s park watch the lionesses train it be quite a challenge to stop the prime minister get involve although i be not sure he would have come off well give the   level of skill on the pitch what be so inspiring to the whole nation whether they be fan of a particular sport or not be the work the lionesses have do to ensure that an entire generation of girl know that they belong on the pitch every bit as much as anyone else we be determined to ensure that this woman ’s rugby world cup do exactly the same for rugby 
 i call the chair of the select committee

 the secretary of state will know that royal ascot last week attract a view population of ten of million and glorious goodwood be about to do the same horserace support about job across the uk and generate about £ a year for the uk economy but the secretary of state will know that it face a loom and imminent crisis when will the government really start to back british horseracing

 i call the shadow minister a former rugby league player 
 the government be on the rope after a grand slam of unforced error since we last meet we have see the secretary of state place under investigation after appoint a labour crony to head the football regulator the chancellor slash the dcms budget and the dcms government whip resign in protest own goal knock on double fault whatever our choice of sporting analogy it be clear that they have royally ballse it up 
 with labour ’s late u turn create a fiscal black hole set to be £ what assurance can the secretary of state give today that her government will not go ahead with their plan tax raid on bingo hall racecourse and sport betting which will immensely damage sponsorship of major sporting event fuel the black market and cost thousand of job across the country 
 i apologise i could not make head nor tail of that but this government be absolutely determined to support bingo it be something that i immensely enjoy it be very popular in my home town and will continue to do so 
 what step she have take to promote british musical act internationally 
 the new music growth package will invest up to £ to help emerge british artist access international market with support for touring showcasing and export promotion 
 i welcome anything the government bring forward to support our new band and musician across the country but the big thing that so many musician be ask for be that we get tour right sort out with our european counterpart could the minister update the house on what progress there have be if any and how we can go far to get our band out there and their band over here 
 if only the right hon gentleman have be a minister in the previous government when they fail to take the deal that be on offer from the european union i be absolutely determined to get this sort we get something—[interruption if he want to start promote creative industry abroad he might start think about film for instance chicken run we want to make sure that british act can prosper across the whole of europe and i be talk not just about the big name like dua lipa i be also talk about young act like otto aday who perform at the rhondda arts festival on saturday and be amazing and caitlin lavagna whose song run a mile perhaps would suit the right hon gentleman 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i associate my party with the word say about diogo jota it be a tragic loss to the world of football 
 a few week ago we stand in this place and talk about the uk eu reset deal my party welcome the moderate progress but we think the government should go far particularly on tour artist the minister ask we to talk about this with our european liberal colleague we have start those discussion can he update we on his discussion and reassure we that this be on the agenda for the next review if he do not give we any good news soon on europe will he admit that we be close to the final countdown 
 i have a horrible fear how that question be go to end it be really important that we win this battle this have to be a campaign that we wage across all of europe we need to get every single capital city in europe on our side to make sure that by the time we get to the next eu uk summit we can get this over the line british act be desperately want apart from anything else in lot of different venue and art festival across the whole of europe i have speak to the commissioner who be in charge of this i have also speak to of my european counterpart my intention be to get round every single of they so that we can get this over the line

 i establish the woman ’s football taskforce in in response to the karen carney review of woman ’s football the taskforce aim to achieve a financially sustainable woman ’s football pyramid raise minimum standard for player fan and everyone involve in the game as the euros begin i know the whole house will join i in wish the lionesses and of course wales the very good of luck 
 i thank the minister for her response i know she be aware of some of the financial challenge that my local club in lewes face with england about to start the defence of their european title in switzerland against france on saturday do she share my concern that despite the phenomenal rise in popularity of the woman ’s game domestic prize money for the woman ’s fa cup still fall woefully short of that for the man ’s it be frankly embarrass that in we still tolerate that glare inequality will she support my call for the football association and the premier league to equalise the woman ’s fa cup prize fund so that woman footballer be reward equally for the same achievement as their male counterpart 
 i know that the hon gentleman be a huge supporter and champion of woman ’s football and i look forward to visit his constituency in september i have hear the call from the liberal democrat benches and across the house on the fa cup prize money the fa have take step to increase the total fund for the woman ’s fa cup and we be pay attention to what happen next 
 what step she be take to help ensure that disabled people have equal access to live event 
 it be crucial that access to live event be open to disabled people we be support arts council england and its partner to develop the all in scheme which should significantly improve accessibility in that area last summer i be at the paralympics where i be horrified to hear from young people with disability about their lack of access to sport in particular this government be take every action and use every lever at our disposal to change that 
 in my shipley constituency the highly value bingley art centre have make great stride in improve accessibility for disabled people however with of art centre behind schedule on essential building maintenance it be clear that more investment be need i welcome the secretary of state ’s announcement of the all in fund can she assure i that local theatre such as bingley art centre will benefit from that investment to help they continue to make the art inclusive

 the government highly value the charity sector and its positive contribution however we have have to take a number of difficult decision on tax welfare and spending to fix the public finance fund public service and restore economic stability 
 the national council for voluntary organisations put the cost at £ that be right be n’t it 
 i reiterate that we really value the charity sector but we have have to make some very difficult decision

 we have discuss the ruling with sport england and uk sport it obviously have profound implication for sport as a whole and those organisation be currently consider the implication for their own guidance we be keen to support they in that but my hon friend will know that national governing body set their own policy for who can participate in domestic competition 
 more than month after the supreme court clarify the law there remain a long list of sporting body that be deny fairness to woman and girl include parkrun and remarkably sport such as weightlifting and wrestling the mind boggle do my right hon friend agree that there be no need to wait for further guidance and that these body should take the advice of the prime minister and get on with it 
 as i say to my hon friend a moment ago we have be work closely with sporting body to support they as they implement the recent judgment by the supreme court as a government we have always be clear that when it come to woman ’s sport biology matter and our sporting body need to come up with policy that protect fairness and safety while rightly ensure that everyone have the opportunity to participate in sport in some capacity

 with the closure of many church in rural community in england and in scotland too be the commissioner concern that people live in rural area particularly those on low income might not be able to access worship within easy reach of their own community 
 the right hon gentleman ask an important question the church value all its rural community and that be why we have so many different project to ensure that place of worship not only exist but operate as a community hub to ensure that people in those local area have place to go whether that be for worship a local food bank or a mother and baby group

 in north east derbyshire we be proud to have many historic beautiful church that reflect the many broad tradition within christian faith in this country can my hon friend please provide clarity on the future of the list place of worship scheme so that we can continue to treasure these place for many generation to come 
 as i have highlight we value our church and our list place of worship and it be important that the government hear these call and provide some clarity and certainty about the future of the scheme the church commissioners have fund   many project provide around £ of grant for repair to church and church building support officer be also in place to advise on management how repair can be carry out and the essential development of these place of worship i hear my hon friend and i invite she to lobby the secretary of state for culture media and sport to give we some certainty about the scheme 
 i have be visit place of worship in my constituency include st probus and st grace church with the tall church tower in cornwall and st gerrans church with its distinctive tower and spire both need extensive and expensive work to keep they watertight so all that good work with food bank coffee morning and warm hub that go on there can continue to happen they be both concerned about the new annual cap as they have cost their scheme and the potential ending of the list place of worship grant scheme next year what alternative support will be available to they and other now that the scheme be reduce and potentially end of course i will be lobby dcms too 
 i commend the work of the church in my hon friend ’s constituency she highlight st probus and st grace church which be found in ad i understand that it be a truly wonderful building and establishment but it need a new roof and the fundraising be under way to try to ensure that it get the funding i highlight early the church commissioners building emission fund this issue have be raise every time i stand here and respond to question on behalf of the church it be vital that the list place of worship grant scheme continue and that the government provide clarity on the future of the scheme so that all the wonderful list place of worship in all our constituency have certainty go forward

 as i highlight there be other fund and i will write to my hon friend to set out some additional support that might be available i understand that work at st nicholas church will cost around £ which be a great deal of money i be very pleased to hear that she too will be lobby the department for culture media and sport for certainty about the list place of worship grant scheme i really think i have do my job in call for that today 
 i thank the hon lady for her answer like other member i will ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport whether there will be more money for church give that the minister for creative industries arts and tourism say that funding be now available church be more   than just building for people in rural community they be hub for worship and social engagement let we be honest about the £ cap building material cost maybe to more than they do a year ago which mean that the grant do not go very far the heritage lottery fund give some money but what can be do to work with other organisation to ensure that money can come from other group that may be anxious and willing i have a church in my constituency that get a figure sum which give the house an idea of what money can be gain through co operation and partnership 
 the hon gentleman rightly highlight that there be other way to acquire funding such as through the heritage lottery and so forth i will certainly write to he if there be specific place that he be concerned about although the grant scheme be for the church of england i be certain that there be other support for church and i can certainly put he in touch with the relevant people if that be helpful

 the uk government have begin to issue visa for critically injured and sick gazan child in need of specialist expert medical treatment but only a handful of child have be grant visa and bring to the uk for urgent treatment what support can the church provide to not just christian child but all child in the occupied palestinian territories in desperate need of medical evacuation 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question there be no safe space for child in gaza where we know that over people have lose their life include more than child the church have rightly condemn the attack on hospital and civilian but we can certainly do more and the church must do more the church must continue to be a voice for the voiceless and gazan child be   the voiceless i encourage the government to enable medical evacuation heed call for the creation of a gaza family visa scheme and take concrete step to ensure israel allow vital medical aid into gaza 
 i call the father of the house 
 the christian town of taybeh be the same town as ephraim in john ’s gospel where jesus go before his passion this town be enter a new passion there be a violent attack by extremist israeli settler on the town on   june there be a continue pattern of crop be destroy and outpost be set up and it be happen all over the west bank this be outrageous racial cleansing deliberately design to prevent a state solution and to drive out the people who have tend their crop there for year will the church of england call out this outrage every day of the week in an attempt to put some sort of pressure on the israeli government 
 i thank the father of the house for his question he be absolutely right the attack that take place in taybeh last week be outrageous and should not have be allow to happen if we be all go to be the hand and foot of jesus we have to speak out when we see such atrocity happen we must be a voice for the voiceless i hear he when he say that the church must speak out every day against what be happen in gaza and indeed across the whole occupied territory 
 what statutory power the church plan to use to facilitate project spire 
 i thank the right hon member for his question and draw his attention to a write response i give on   april it be the church ’s intention subject to the approval of the trustee for the church commissioners to make an application to the charity commission to authorise an ex gratia payment under section of the charities act on the basis of moral obligation 
 a number of member this morning have lobby for expenditure to repair their church and the hon lady have tell they to lobby the government the department for culture media and sport for that money at the same time the church have already spend £ on this project with the aspiration of take it to £ when the charity commission have yet to deliver its verdict on whether that be within the charitable objective allowable how have that be allow to happen 
 these be separate issue what be go on in relation to funding for project spire be totally separate to any other funding the list place of worship grant scheme be a separate scheme the building for mission fund that support our church be totally separate 
 what information the church hold on the operational situation of the anglican al ahli hospital in gaza 
 the israeli attack on patient and medic at hospital be abhorrent as i have say on many occasion the church be in close contact with the diocese of jerusalem which oversee the al ahli hospital in gaza the challenge of operate while under attack by israel and with the hospital and church building have be strike directly on separate occasion mean that the hospital be in chaos it will soon run out of fuel and medical supply 
 i raise the al ahli hospital at the end of last year when it suffer quite a lot of damage the situation have deteriorate rapidly since then i understand that the hospital as my hon friend outline have suffer further damage include the loss of its emergency room give it be of the few function hospital leave in gaza do my hon friend agree that it be vital that it stay open give it be of the old hospital operate for almost year its loss would be an absolutely damn indictment of the disregard for the medical facility and for the health and life of the palestinian people 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the diocese of jerusalem have inform we that the hospital continue to provide critical medical service but only just food fuel and medical supply be critically low due to israel prevent aid from get into gaza the church commissioners repeat the diocese ’s urgent call for a renew ceasefire and the establishment of safe and sustained humanitarian corridor i urge the foreign commonwealth and development office to pressure israel to allow in fuel and vital medical supply 
 what step the church of england be take to help to tackle poverty 
 church and all our faith community make a powerful difference in the life of all our constituent every single day and church of england parish provide more than social action project in church school and educate million of child each day parish initiative include food bank credit union warm space school club and other form of family support 
 for too long charity faith group and church such as my own st bede ’s have be support people struggle to get by do my hon friend agree that our child poverty taskforce need to seriously consider scrap the awful child benefit cap because rely on charity to lift child out of poverty be simply unsustainable 
 my hon friend make an important point everyone have a responsibility to tackle child poverty and we should all commend and thank the church for the role it have play in this space i know that the bishop of derby host baroness sherlock the child poverty unit and colleague for a roundtable where many issue be discuss 
 church across the country be do amazing work tackle poverty but they could be do more many of my constituent will be surprised that the church commissioners have already spend £ on project spire when it be not within their charitable objective and that they plan to spend £ when the charity commission have not sign that off why be the church commissioners do something that be not within their charitable objective 
 no decision have be take on that when the board of governor and the church of commissioners make that decision they will follow the right process to do so 
 will the leader of the house give the house the forthcoming business

 the provisional business for the week commence   july   will include 
 monday july committee of the whole house and remain stage of the deprivation of citizenship orders effect during appeal bill follow which the chairman of ways and means be expect to name opposed private business for consideration 
 tuesday july opposition day allot day debate on a motion in the name of the official opposition subject to be announce 
 i be sure the leader of the house and all member will want to join i in recognise this year as the anniversary of the announcement by the government of a national health service by sir henry willink in 
 most of we wish to celebrate an anniversary would probably have a bit of a party maybe get a few friend round order in some pizza and put up decoration only the labour party would seek to celebrate its year in office with the kind of charlie foxtrot multidimensional legislative omnishamble that we have see in the past few day 
 give their massive reverse ferret of recent week i must say i have think that the government have perfect the art of the u turn after all they have have u turn on winter fuel payment and the child benefit cap each in its own way a little masterpiece of slow motion dithering and indecision but then the other day the government up their game significantly by execute a comprehensive ° u turn on their decision to hold a statutory inquiry into groom gang have repeatedly say that it be not necessary brilliantly the prime minister manage to u turn at the same time on his own speech about the uk be an island of stranger 
 i naively believe that that be the state of the art the government have maxe out on u turn and nobody could be more bewilderingly incompetent than that how wrong i be on tuesday we see something that be almost unheard of in the year of our   parliament a minister pull out his chainsaw and disembowel his own government ’s flagship welfare bill in mid air on live television from the dispatch box really mr speaker that outstrip my poor power of description we need the pen of a shakespeare or a thackeray to do it justice it be the quintessence of cock up 
 but actually mr speaker this past week have be much bad even than that just as nick clegg be define by his u turn on student fee so the prime minister will be define by this moment a new and supposedly reform government with an enormous majority have be unable not to cut but to reduce the rate of increase in public spending on benefit let alone make any serious actual reform to protect people 
 there have be a remarkable complacency about this government and this past week have show it up they regard disagreement as something to be ignore or crush they do not answer question at the dispatch box they obfuscate on write question they try to ignore the opposition they dismiss the house of lords and they spurn their own back benchers 
 loyal labour mp concerned about disabled people have be try to get a hearing on this issue for month only to be repeatedly reject and this have be the result thing follow from it there be the immediate consequence it will be next to impossible now for the government to achieve meaningful reform of the welfare system they have show that they have no ability to make saving taxis will go up while the economy continue to stall little wonder the gilt market explode during prime minister ’s question yesterday 
 secondly the prime minister have open the door to future rebellion indeed he have go far than that he have write the playbook for they doubtless he will have a reshuffle sometime soon loyal dissenter will be punish the talented cast out and select committee chairs buy off but that will make no difference there will be other the select committee chairs have show that they be a powerful new force in labour politic 
 finally the prime minister have massively damage his own reputation he have endlessly harp on about the need for professional competence and moral seriousness but this have be a year in government that start with a host of undisclosed personal gift receive and have end with utter political humiliation he have show that he be in office but not in power what be the point of this government no know not even the prime minister 
 i start by send all our condolence to the friend and family of liverpool football club star diogo jota follow the shocking news of his and his brother ’s death in a tragic car accident it come only week after his wedding and after win last season ’s premier league i be sure the thought of the whole house be with his family friend liverpool teammate and former wolf teammate i also send my good wish to the lionesses at the start of the euros 
 tomorrow be action mesothelioma day i commend all the campaigner who continue to fight for justice for those who have die or be ill as a result of asbestos cancer my dear friend and former colleague tony lloyd and paul goggins sadly no long with we be real champion of this cause and i pay tribute to they 
 may i take this opportunity mr speaker i would rarely do this to put on record how proud i be of my friend the female chancellor who have be do a very difficult and formidable job hon member hear hear quite honestly she have more class than most opposition member include i be sure some on the front bench as the shadow leader of the house have ask i to do so may i update the house on the universal credit bill as it will soon be rename i completely acknowledge that how this business be manage be not the way that it should have be the process do not live up to the standard to which i and the government hold ourselves however as i say last week we value the contribution of member especially those with particular experience of and interest in these issue critical to any good legislation be that it reflect parliamentary opinion and i believe the bill now do that i think it be actually a good thing that we be prepared to listen and change but member should rest assure that we will take stock and reflect on how we can do thing well go forward 
 the bill as amend and the timms review alongside it now reflect the reform and safeguard that the house want to see and we will consider its remain stage next week the bill ’s title will become the universal credit bill as it will be narrow in scope it will focus on end the perverse incentive in universal credit protect the income of those currently in receipt of the universal credit health element and end the reassessment of those with the most severe condition and clause relate to personal independence payment will be delete any future change to pip will come only follow the timms review co produce with disabled people and the body that represent they 
 we can all agree that the welfare system need reform and need to be sustainable the conservatives should quite frankly be ashamed of their legacy which need address it be a legacy of in working age people on sickness or disability benefit a legacy of a generation of young people with no mental health support and too few opportunity a legacy of over people on nhs waiting list many unable to work a legacy of stagnant growth and no plan for job creation it be this government who be tackle those long term challenge 
 the shadow leader of the house want to talk about the government ’s anniversary i be really happy to talk about our anniversary because i be proud of our year in office our year nhs plan come out today and waiting list come down month on month a new ambitious industrial strategy create job opportunity around the country mental health support and the skill revolution british job for british worker with decent pay and condition the big investment in affordable and social housing in year finally clear up our river and sea bring the railway into public ownership create gb energy and get bill down half a more child get free school meal every day and new free breakfast club wage go up and the big ever wage rise for the lowest pay worker that be the change that people vote for and that be the change that we be bring in 
 tomorrow be another anniversary that the tories do not want to talk about their bad ever election defeat they be utterly reject and year on it have get no well for they it be just get bad and    bad they have not learn they have not reflect they have not apologise the shadow leader of the house talk about u turn but no know more about change position and change direction than the conservatives they change prime ministers time in month they go from austerity month to spaffe money up the wall the next moment it be level up and the next it be funnel money into the shire from brexit opportunity to brexit disaster day they have an industrial strategy the next they rip it up they be for net then against it they could not even cancel hs2 properly in year they have have more position than the kama sutra it be no wonder they be completely knackered 
 my constituency have a fantastic group of volunteer and sponsor for congleton pride but they have have to show extraordinary resilience after multiple attack on their banner for pride month and our major pride event i know that the leader of the house will want to thank all the volunteer and sponsor who have provide new banner and put more banner in more location i thank very much the volunteer for persevere and the police for their involvement in this matter and i thank the member of the community who support pride i encourage as many people as possible to come to the pride event in congleton town centre on   saturday july   from am please can we have a debate in government time about how we can support the lgbtq+ community

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 several of my chelmsford constituent have contact i about the lack of local nhs dentistry service constituent tell i an all too familiar story waiting list for nhs patient be either too long or closed so he have have to rely on private dentistry for routine check up now he can not afford crucial dental care because it would cost hundred of pound that he do not have 
 that be a concern not only for patient but for dentist chelmsford dentist recently write to i detail the need for the government to urgently fix the fail contract that he work under to ensure that provider be fund to carry out nhs service and take on more patient as with all healthcare we know that the long it take to treat a problem the more serious and expensive it can become 
 the minister for care have say that critical negotiation be take place between the department of health and the treasury so will the leader of the house encourage her treasury colleague to prioritise that to allow the department to renegotiate the dental contract as soon as possible as liberal democrats have be call for   will she also ensure that a statement be make to the house to provide an update on the progress of the renegotiation 
 i thank the hon member for raise that important matter i be sure that as constituency mp we all know how important it be for people to have access to nhs dental care and dental appointment she be right to highlight how many dental desert there still be that be the legacy that we have inherit we be commit to provide more nhs dentist appointment that be a key part of our nhs year plan which the secretary of state will soon be set out that do mean look at issue relate to the contract and how that care be provide i will ensure that in addition to the statement be give today the house be keep fully update on these matter

 member who have be here for a while will know that i have be campaign for more than year for stanmore station in my constituency to receive a lift or some form of step free access the good news a little while ago be that queensbury and canons park station be now on the list to have step free access i immediately write to the commissioner of transport for london to say what about stanmore station i have receive a reply this week which may interest you mr speaker and other 
 the definition of step free access 
 mean lift ramp and level surface so you do not have to use stair or escalator and can avoid the step and gap onto our train bus and boat 
 however the reply go on to say that stanmore station be classify as have step free access despite the fact that it say quite clearly 
 station entry and exit require a m journey via the station car park include steep ramp 
 tfl forget to say that this be the access to the royal national orthopaedic hospital in stanmore and that a paralympian be unable to get up that slope unaided 
 i have be in correspondence with the chair of the transport committee   the hon member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury who agree that we need an update definition the secretary of state for transport be a former deputy mayor of london for transport so may we have a statement from she on what we will do about ensure that there be proper step free access and a proper definition of it 
 may i thank the chair of the backbench business committee for announce some of the forthcoming business i can assure he that we will be in conversation very soon about the business on the following thursday and ahead of the recess i know how important it be to this house and to he as the chair of the committee that we have the sir david amess pre summer recess debate and the whole house would expect that we have that at the appropriate moment hopefully we can have positive conversation about that come up 
 the hon member be right to raise issue about step free access i have hear he do that many time before particularly at stanmore station and other in his constituency he will know that those station be a matter for tfl but ministers talk to tfl about such matter on an ongoing basis i can assure he that the secretary of state for transport be personally very committed to ensure that all our station become step free with access to all eventually it be a big job because over half the station across the country do not currently have that it be important not just for those with disability but for those with buggy and young child those who carry lot of luggage and all sort of other people to ensure that our transport network be truly accessible 
 to help everybody let i say that my intention be to call everyone so let we help each other by speed through as a good example i call andy macnae 
 every day in my constituency we be face with poorly organise and overrun street work clog up our road a lane rental scheme through which company pay for   the time the work take would reduce such delay on our busy road however i remain frustrated that so far lancashire county council have refuse to introduce i welcome the announcement last year by the secretary of state for transport that the authority for lane rental scheme would be devolve to regional mayor however it be notably absent from the english devolution white paper so i be concerned that it may fall by the wayside will the leader of the house agree to a debate in government time on this important subject 
 my hon friend be always a good candidate to call early because he ask good question about his constituency he be absolutely right that poorly manage roadwork be a blight on our community i hear about that many time in these session we be give local area more power in that regard and be double fine and apply charge of up to £ a day for utility work that overrun he can be assure that the devolution bill will be come before this house imminently
