 of the strength of the union of the united kingdom be that we can choose different way of do thing often achieve the same outcome and certainly share our objective she will know this government ’s record in this area we have few workless household and base on recent figure we have lift more than child out of poverty we all must work on these thing whatever particular system cover our nation 
 resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of the report entitle the angiolini inquiry part report date   february .—(mark fletcher 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what progress he have make on consider the recommendation of the interim report of the infected blood inquiry 
 what progress he have make on consider the recommendation of the interim report of the infected blood inquiry 
 what progress he have make on consider the recommendation of the interim report of the infected blood inquiry 
 what progress he have make on respond to the final recommendation on compensation by the infected blood inquiry 
 what progress he have make on consider the recommendation of the interim report of the infected blood inquiry 
 the government recognise the urgency of the issue and be commit to progress the work as quickly as we can for that reason we have appoint an expert group to advise the cabinet office on detailed technical consideration on monday in the other place the government commit to bring forward   an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill on report with the intention of speed up the implementation of the government ’s response to the infected blood inquiry 
 my constituent mark ward a haemophiliac contract hiv after be give contaminate blood at the royal free hospital he be he be now and it be and a half year since he give evidence at the inquiry and a year since the initial recommendation come out it be a scandal be it not that the government be force to give in by a defeat in the other place frankly the government have be complicit in people ’s live continue to be lose how long before compensation will be pay what date should i give mr ward how many people ’s life will be lose while we wait for the government to get into action 
 there be working day before the report be publish on   monday may the government have commit to respond to it within sitting day but i will do everything i can to bring forward as substantive a response as possible as soon as possible after that date 
 my constituent gerald stone a victim of the contaminated blood scandal be year old he be in and out of hospital and be have to take morphine for the insurmountable pain he suffer after bravely give evidence to the public inquiry and the public see that story his lifelong neighbour begin to question whether it be safe to live on the same street as he and even go to the police victim such as gerald deal with the physical and mental consequence every day but query he have for the minister be the figure of potential claimant which have be dispute regularly and be reason for the hold up in provide justice will the minister provide clarity on that figure 
 i be try to ensure a comprehensive response as soon as possible that be why we have appoint professor sir jonathan montgomery to head up a team to advise on how to implement the recommendation of the report i be do that as quickly as i can there be issue around eligibility the severity of disease and its progression and so on which i need to be sure on so that i can address the challenge that exist with respect to the figure i can not give a number from the dispatch box but i will ensure that the government response when it come will be as comprehensive as possible to give some assurance to the hon lady ’s constituent 
 itv be now set to produce a drama about the contaminate blood scandal follow the success of mr bates vs the post office as we know thousand of people have be affect by the scandal include my constituent catherine who lose her husband in and margaret who lose her husband bill in bill be a local councillor i know he very well he be an absolutely lovely man he be also a trustee of the haemophilia society some people include bill have be fight this battle for year why have it take we this long to get to this point will it really take a tv drama to make the government finally act 
 i be aware of the comment about a tv drama but i be concerned to ensure that we build on the decision of this place on   december   with respect to the victims and prisoners bill that bill be work its way through the other place committee will finish on   march so report stage can not happen before   april listen to the testimony of the hon lady and of those in the other place whose nephew and husband die as a result of contaminate blood have make i more determined to ensure that the government ’s response be as comprehensive as possible and that it meet the expectation of everyone in this place and of the country at large 
 i think the minister be a good man and be try to do his good but this be the big treatment scandal in the history of the nhs we have have year of a public inquiry the government have now have the recommendation on compensation for month i understand that the minister have not yet meet anyone infect or affect or take any sounding from any of the campaign group now we hear in a write question this week that his expert group be not allow to know the name of those people or to have the minute of those meeting or of any of the working that be take place do he understand that after decade of cover up and criminal activity the lack of transparency with which the infected and affected be be treat be totally unacceptable 
 i explain to the right hon lady when i meet she on   february and again when i speak to she on   february the context of professor sir jonathan montgomery ’s appointment as she know sir brian recommend that eligibility for compensation include those with hepatitis c hiv and all chronic case of hepatitis b. 
 on the right hon lady ’s question about engagement with the group i be very keen to engage when the report stage happen in the middle of april i will then work on plan to engage with as many group as possible across the united kingdom build on my conversation with representative of the devolved administration on   february 
 since the recommendation of the infected blood inquiry be announce another victim of the scandal have sadly die i note what the minister say about the appointment of sir jonathan montgomery as chair of the expert offer technical advice on the compensation talk but may i express the anger of of my constituent who be a victim of the scandal about that appointment he have ask i to ask what confidence can victim have in the compensation process when an individual who be link to pharmaceutical firm bayer a company that supply infected blood and chair the oxford university hospitals nhs foundation trust which be at the epicentre of the scandal be advise the cabinet office 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question the appointment of sir jonathan montgomery be compliant with all the process similar to those use for the appointment of sir robert francis and other i recognise the concern express around jonathan ’s involvement with bayer that cease at the end of october last year he be part of an independent advisory group not   make executive decision for the pharmaceutical company in the other place the noble baroness brinton describe sir jonathan as a well respect ethicist he have be ask not for further recommendation but to advise the government on the implementation of the recommendation make in the report i hope that be helpful 
 like other member i have constituent and friend who have be profoundly affect by the scandal through both hepatitis and hiv i recognise that my right hon friend be work extremely hard to come up with a solution to move the conversation forward but can he update the house on any conversation he have have with the treasury on deliver compensation as swiftly as possible once it be available 
 conversation about this be take place all the time across whitehall that will continue at pace as we move towards the   may   publication my determination be to bring forward as substantive a response as possible on the compensation issue as soon as possible after that obviously those conversation happen over time but i undertake to update the house at the next opportunity when there be something substantive to say 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in his interim report of   april sir brian langstaff set out 
 i recommend that a compensation scheme should be set up now and it should begin work this year 
 now we be into the next year and the scheme have not be set up we have no timetable from the government on when work will begin the minister do not need to wait until   may   for the final report can the minister tell the victim group who have wait for so long whether he have persuade the chancellor to include the funding for the scheme in next week ’s budget and when will the substantive payment be make 
 i think the right hon gentleman will understand that i can not pre announce aspect of the budget but his general point about urgency be that i hear as i say to he when i meet he before the february recess as i also explain report stage in this place on   december   leave we with legislation that be not fit for purpose which be why further change need to be make those change be be make as urgently as possible 
 on monday of this week the government commit that on report in the other place we will bring forward the appropriate amendment to enable that arm ’s length body to be create with the legal function and uk wide remit that be necessary i have be work closely with earl howe meet with he as the bill have go through the other place however i can not announce aspect of the budget in any form i hope the right hon gentleman will forgive i 
 what recent progress he have make on the roll out of veteran id card 
 to date we have receive over application we be committed to ensure that as many veteran as possible know how to apply for a card we have launch a national promotional campaign to raise awareness of the card ’s availability and over the next few month we will continue to work with the charity sector and other to ensure as many people as possible know about the card and its benefit 
 veteran in my constituency of ynys môn such as the brilliant mark davis who serve our country for many year be now eligible for a veteran card can my right hon friend confirm how veteran such as mark davis be be tell about that card and how to get diolch yn fawr 
 a significant program of work be go on at the moment to make sure everyone be aware of the card this have be the no ask of the major military charity in this country for some time and i encourage everybody who be eligible who have serve and be a veteran to apply for their veteran id card which open up a whole gamut of service we have completely transform what it mean to be a veteran in this country those service be available you can get help with so many issue please do apply for your card and slowly we will make this the good country in the world to be a veteran 
 as always i thank the minister for his very positive response he will know of course that people in northern ireland be join up to serve whether it be in the army the royal navy or the royal air force as they have do over the year beyond the battlefield which i hope the minister will visit shortly be of the organisation that help veteran do the minister hold any statistic on how many service personnel from northern ireland have apply for veteran id card 
 i do not have those figure to hand but northern ireland traditionally have a high representation of service personnel i be in northern ireland week ago and i be impressed with some of the service but to be honest northern ireland be not where i want it to be in term of veteran affair we be look at all option for how the office for veterans affair can really lean in while mindful of the fact that health housing and many other thing be devolve and make sure that the standard that we now see in england for veteran care be replicate across the united kingdom in northern ireland scotland and wales 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate the office for veterans affairs and the ministry of defence on its achievement with the roll out so far although it be probably fair to acknowledge that there be still some way to go be it not quite surprising that the veteran id card can not be use for the purpose of id in a uk election when do the minister hope to put that right 
 the id card be the phase in a multi phase operation to ensure that that objective can be achieve alongside a whole load of other objective   the challenge be digitise veteran record to ensure that we have an accurate picture of veteran get the id card out be the phase but of course the ambition be to ensure that the card be use for all sort of purpose include the that the hon gentleman have mention 
 what step his department be take to improve access to public sector procurement process for small and medium sized business 
 what step his department be take to improve access to public sector procurement process for small and medium sized business 
 the landmark procurement act which this government pass last year will deliver simple and more effective public sector procurement and help small and medium sized enterprise across the country secure a great share of that expenditure which total approximately £ every year the act include a new duty on contracting authority to have regard for the particular barrier face by sme and consider what can be do to overcome they 
 small business be the lifeblood of our economy there be of they in the uk make up over of all business and of private sector employment however currently only a fraction of offer their good and service to the public sector could the minister say a little more about the work that be be do to encourage more of they to enter tender process 
 i would be delighted to because the government be entirely committed to ensure that sme get a big share of that pie the late publish sme spend figure show that uk small business receive £ of work which be an increase of £ on the previous year ’s figure that be the high since record begin and the consecutive year that government work win by small business have increase crucially that be before the effect of the procurement act kick in 
 as my hon friend have say in his reply the procurement act be i hope the solution to many of these problem but it be not due to come into force until the beginning of october can he confirm that it will definitely come into force then and that the necessary secondary legislation be in hand 
 i be pleased to be able to report that despite the fact that this be complex legislation that require workstream in a number of area not just secondary legislation but learning and development for those work for contracting authority and a new online platform that will make procurement much easy and well for both those supply service and those procure they we be on track to meet our target 
 what recent assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the border target operating model on cross border flow of good 
 the government be deliver a programme of engagement with stakeholder across all sector in all part of the country and with key european union trading partner to ensure that good continue to move across the border we have not identify any specific risk to the cross border flow of good 
 the minister may not have identify risk but business be certainly very worried about potential delay and cost alongside the not for eu labelling issue the food and drink federation estimate that there will be an extra £ a year in cost so i challenge he be he really say there will be no extra cost for our hard press constituent as a result of all this extra bureaucracy 
 we be not say that no but i would say to the hon member that appropriate import control be fundamental to ensure that we can protect the uk ’s food supply chain our food and farming industry and our natural environment from biosecurity risk the border target operating model will have very little impact on most of our fruit and vegetable import which have be classify as low risk as he press i i would say to he that inflationary impact on food for consumer will be at most less than percentage point over a year period and we have publish the methodology online of course no should ever be cavalier about the cost of food but i be sure he would agree with i that percentage point over year be a small figure 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be absolutely astonish i really be astonish at the complacency about the impact on uk food bill because the government ’s own projection say that this border scheme will cost uk business some £ per year while the british chambers of commerce have highlight charge for eu good come into the uk what assessment have the minister make of the full inflationary impact of these measure on uk food bill and with further check due to start in april what preparation be in hand to prevent a repeat of the chaotic scene at our port that we have see before on this government ’s watch 
 alas that there be disease outbreak in the european union and alas that food be circulate that do not comply with eu standard i hope to protect the people of wycombe and the whole united kingdom from unsafe pork and chicken and to ensure that we do not end up vulnerable to thing such as the horsemeat scandal as i understand it the labour party wish to revert to the regime we have when we be an eu member state by align with the eu on sanitary and phytosanitary matter i remember very well the horsemeat scandal that arise and i do not want to see anything like that occur again 
 i would just point out that an outbreak of african swine fever would be a fundamental threat to the viability of our pig industry foot and mouth cost british business £ at price in the cost of ash dieback be forecast to be £ to the uk i think we need to take seriously the need to protect our border and the need to check these medium to high risk product and that be what this government will responsibly do 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 have the government make any assessment of the additional cost to sme of these change the red tape they have have and will have to wrangle with and how many business will go under as a result 
 we be not expect business to go under as a result of this but i refer the hon lady to the answer i just give it be vital that we protect our border the reality be that there be risk to public health from food and we need to make sure that we be not cavalier about these check it be vital that we protect our border and protect the public and that be what we be go to do we be continue to engage with business we expect there to be very few problem and we will work our way through there be no question of be cavalier we have be work very carefully to consult stakeholder and make sure there have not be great problem 
 indicate dissent 
 the hon lady shake her head but i just point out that the   january   deadline for export health certificate pass by and there be not the problem that be forecast 
 how many application have be make for hm armed force veteran card by military veteran live in devon and cornwall 
 the office for veterans affairs and the ministry of defence launch a new service in january to allow veteran to apply for their card since then veteran have apply from cornwall and from devon 
 i thank the minister my fellow devon mp for his answer it be very encouraging to have have positive feedback from veteran in torbay about the simplicity of apply online but question come to mind what work be be do with local authority that encounter veteran through service such as housing to encourage they to apply online or make an application if they have not do so 
 that be a good question and i can not emphasise this point enough obviously this be my responsibility as the veteran minister but it be also the nation ’s duty to look after these people we need local authority to understand what be available to look after these people we have armed force champion in local authority now and i want to see that role take seriously there be multiple pathway specifically for veteran through health housing employment and a   number of other topic but clearly it be incumbent on all of we in public life to understand what be available for veteran so that when we find in need they get the world class help they deserve 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of procurement fraud during the covid-19 pandemic 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of procurement fraud during the covid-19 pandemic 
 the government ’s cross government fraud landscape annual report include datum from the year of the government ’s response to the pandemic the report suggest that in government departments and arm ’s length body report a total of £ of detect procurement fraud the same report show that at the end of march some £ of fraud and error have be recover within covid-19 scheme since then crucially further fund have be recover and the government will continue to update the house as fresh data become available 
 when people think back to the sacrifice they make during the pandemic the greed associate with the personal protective equipment scandal really jar with they so will the minister commit to follow the labour party ’s lead and appoint a covid corruption commissioner to chase down and claw back every penny of taxpayer money that be waste 
 this government take ppe fraud extremely seriously to remind the house of the figure of expenditure on ppe be lose to fraud at a time when there be the most extraordinary public crisis in several generation and we be compete in an extremely overheated international market to date we have recover more than a quarter of that and the fight to recover more continue ppe procurement be subject to ongoing contract management control active dispute resolution and recovery action the law be on our side and we be use it 
 the covid procurement scandal upset many people and rightly so i speak with a fantastic local business in tamworth wearwell uk which be manufacture ppe as part of the regional procurement but be cut out of the process during the pandemic the uk must be prepare in the event of another pandemic and british manufacturing offer a great response time and a more stable supply chain when will we return to regional procurement to ensure that local business be prioritise when provide ppe for the nation 
 i welcome the hon lady to what i think be her cabinet office question she be right to draw attention to the fantastic textile manufacturing that exist in the region in which her constituency sit she will have hear i talk about the procurement   act which be pass last year and will make sure that small and medium sized enterprise which by their nature be often local enterprise will have a big share of public procurement 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we have not just have the infamous baroness mone scandal at the time there be report of a hedge fund in mauritius that get a £ contract for face mask that could not be use and a jeweller in florida that get a multimillion pound contract for gown that could not be use the government have to incinerate billion of pound worth of faulty personal protective equipment that be taxpayer money literally go up in smoke in the pandemic the then health secretary   the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock tell i at the dispatch box 
 where a contract be not deliver against we do not intend to pay taxpayer money”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 but taxpayer money be spend be n’t it why be that promise not meet 
 i gently refer the right hon gentleman to the answer i just give the fact be that although problem arise with ppe procurement in this uniquely difficult environment in which official be work unbelievably hard for the public good ppe procurement be still subject to ongoing contract management control active dispute resolution and recovery action the fact of the matter be that this government take it seriously during the pandemic the department of health and social care realise the risk of fraud early on and the government establish a counter fraud team to counter that threat we be use all the legal tool at our disposal to get taxpayer money back the house should be in no doubt that the government ’s speed of action during the crisis enable many life to be save and for the country to overcome the covid-19 crisis 
 what step he be take to support veteran with the cost of living 
 what step he be take to support veteran with the cost of living 
 the government have successfully reduce inflation by more than half which will make the cost of live more affordable for veteran along with every other resident in the united kingdom we be also get support directly to those who need it with the £ cost of live package worth an average of £ a household in addition the government be provide £ over year to well support veteran 
 my constituent in gower and especially my veteran want to know whether the minister for veterans affair stand by his comment that food bank usage be a personal choice 
 it be important in this place that we do not misrepresent what other member say i very clearly say that service personnel who receive subsidised accommodation should not be use food bank there be no requirement for they to do it and that be not appropriate that be what i have say i have obviously never say that food bank be a personal choice this be a real opportunity to come here and ask i any question at all about veteran affair i suggest we try to raise the debate and actually improve their life 
 with ten of thousand of veteran across the uk force to rely on universal credit to get by what be the minister do to help veteran in swansea east and right across the country who be in receipt of universal credit to cope with the increase cost of living cause by this government ’s economic failing 
 i spend my entire life visit veteran who consistently raise with i the help that they get there be plenty of place for they to go to whether it be the royal british legion or other that have specific grant on top of that the government have put in an enormous package of help for citizen across the united kingdom of £ that be £ a household and that be just for the cost of living it be an incredibly difficult time for lot of people across the united kingdom but i be comfortable that the government be do all we can and we stand ready to do more 
 what assessment his department have make of trend in the diversity of appointment to the house of lords 
 since female representation have rise to and ethnic minority representation have rise by november those be the late verify figure i have to 
 that be good progress but can the minister explain why her right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss liz of the day reign be allow to award her mate for their part in her failure with job for life in the legislature be she proud of that 
 it be a long stand tradition that anybody who reach the height of prime minister irrespective of which party that be for have a resignation list the former prime minister have appoint accomplished people and i be quite sure that they will contribute significantly to the other house 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the publication of the resignation honour list of the right hon member for south west norfolk on public trust in a politician and b political institution 
 it be a long stand convention under successive government that outgoing prime ministers can draw up a resignation list that have be the case under past government from across the political spectrum and any name propose be subject to the usual propriety check 
 political polarisation be more prevalent than ever but polling consistently show that voter across the political spectrum be unite in their opposition to an unelected house of lords the trouble the public face be that this place and this government do not want to know they merrily carry on stuff the house of lords full of loyal stooge when will the government finally take their finger out of their ear listen to the public and begin to consider long require reform of the place through those door 
 many people in the other house be probably somewhat insult by the hon member ’s word many of they be highly accomplish in a variety of specialism and bring much insight as they scrutinise the legislation that come from this house 
 if he will undertake a review of the effectiveness of gov.uk for the public and business 
 gov.uk be among the uk ’s most recognise and trust digital service it be constantly monitor to assure and improve the service it provide to its user through data analytic user research and feedback while the late gov.uk strategy prioritise proactively reach more people in more place 
 government process need to work if our democratic system be to have the trust of our constituent we know that many people who use government it system to manage their tax payment national insurance credit or benefit experience error in how their account of money be handle which be unacceptable will the minister accept that a cross departmental review of how those it system work need to be carry out so that constituent can trust that the government be not lose their hard earn money 
 i be pleased to tell the hon lady that polling at the end of last year find that of respondent be satisfied with gov.uk agree that they could typically find what they want and trust the information they find obviously we keep all our system under review but gov.uk be a trusted brand and it be get well every day 
 what recent discussion he have have with the independent adviser on ministers interest on trend in the level of compliance with the ministerial code 
 the prime minister have be clear that he will lead a government of 
 integrity professionalism and accountability at every level 
 he be deliver on that promise i meet sir laurie magnus the independent adviser on ministers interest in november 
 a survey publish just this week by the institute for government reveal that third of the public do not believe that the government behave accord to high ethical standard i do not think anyone in the house will be surprise by that give the behaviour we have see from some particularly former ministers over the past year even in the last few week question have be raise about potential breach of the ministerial code by the business secretary and we have see failure reward constantly with outrageous severance payment will the minister finally fully enshrine the ministerial code into law 
 that matter have be discuss the committee on standards in public life do not recommend that in because it would afford significant authority to a body that be outwith accountability to the house 
 what step he be take to improve support for veteran who serve in northern ireland 
 we have expand the veterans welfare service provision in northern ireland and allocate £ to a defence medical welfare service pilot to support veteran health and wellbee in northern ireland on legacy we be commit to work with the northern ireland office the ministry of defence and the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery to ensure that veteran be fully engage and support 
 what support can veteran expect from the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery 
 we be do everything we can to support veteran who be go through that process it be essential that veteran be engage as the commission develop its policy and process we be work closely with the ministry of defence to ensure that legal and welfare provision be establish to ensure that veteran be support through that process 
 we now come to topical question i call barry sheerman not here 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 later today i will set out how we be put more artificial   intelligence expert at the heart of government to drive the adoption of ai right across the public sector we will not only revolutionise service but increase productivity cut inefficiency and save taxpayer million of pound early this month i launch the pall mall process alongside international ally which will combat the proliferation of the irresponsible use of cyber intrusion tool that be commercially available i be determined that the cabinet office will lead the way in seize the opportunity present by these new technology while guard against the risk 
 i thank my right hon friend for his update every day this place be combat cyber security challenge what action be he take to ensure that not only this place but the whole of the united kingdom be safe from iran russia and other hostile element that want to intrude on our security 
 my hon friend be entirely right to raise that risk we live in a more dangerous and hostile world i be particularly mindful of the risk pose by hostile foreign state such as iran we rely heavily on the national cyber security centre with which we work closely to ensure the security of government this house and the private sector in addition i chair a ministerial cyber board where we constantly challenge department to improve their cyber security which we be improve but the risk continue to arise 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as the minister have see many question have be ask today on the infected blood scandal will he confirm that it be no part of the government ’s decision make process on the timescale of grant compensation payment to create the fiscal headroom need for the much anticipated pre election tax cut in next week ’s budget 
 i can confirm that be not the case 
 baroness mone and her husband make a £ profit on a £ contract for personal protective equipment much of which the nhs deem unusable the couple reportedly have have £ of asset frozen but they also have a horse run in britain ’s favourite horserace the grand national that be not race ’s fault but would it not be a grand national disgrace if the owner be able to walk away with winning while taxpayer be still wait to get their money back from be sell a mountain of unusable ppe 
 the government continue to take robust action to recover any misuse fund as the right hon gentleman will be aware both criminal and civil proceeding be ongoing so there be limited thing i can say in respect of the allegation that he have make as the secretary of state in the cabinet office and deputy prime minister my remit run to many area but unfortunately not to the outcome of the grand national 
 if it do we could all win 
 dedicated people such as kath eastment of ssafa piers beeland from the royal british legion and the raf valley padre mike hall work tirelessly to support veteran across ynys môn i be delighted that a veteran hub be to open at raf valley on friday march which will give local veteran a place to meet and access support will my right hon friend extend his congratulation to the team responsible and will he come to raf valley to visit the hub 
 i would love to come to raf valley at some point i visit my hon friend ’s constituency before she be a member it be a beautiful part of the united kingdom i pay tribute to everybody who work in this sector and who step into the breach and work hard to ensure that those come out of service with particular need be support and that we look after they in the manner that i want to see 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 in response to the question from   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson the minister stress the importance of ministers be accountable to this house particularly for breach of the ministerial code but neither the independent adviser on ministers interest nor the prime minister be truly accountable to the house when it come to the ministerial code and the foreign secretary be not accountable to this house at all trust be at an all time low and breach of the ministerial code be rife when will the government revise the code to include appropriate sanction so that ministers can no long break the code with impunity 
 the government continue to keep the ministerial code under review the prime minister of the day have to be able to determine who the ministers will be in the government that he lead on behalf of his majesty that be an important constitutional principle but the prime minister will not hesitate to take action if there have be inappropriate breach on the accountability of the foreign secretary discussion continue on the good way to ensure that this house hold he to account in the same way that he be already accountable to for example select committees 
 in july the minister ’s department issue new guidance effectively outlaw gag clause across government departments do the department have any plan to extend that to local authority i be sure that the minister would like i be appal that labour run rossendale borough council have issue a gagging clause against its elect representative back up by a threat of legal proceeding because it want to cover up a £ fraud in which labour councillor may have be complicit and about which they certainly have question to answer 
 my right hon friend rightly raise some very concern allegation so call gag order should not be use in that way and i undertake to look into the matter on his behalf 
 i have raise the subject of the pressure face prison officer on a number of occasion prison officer be part of the civil service pension scheme and must work until the age of to retire on a full pension do the minister recognise that that be unrealistic give the number of assault on they and the pressure they face will he work with i and the prison officers association to seek an exception for prison officer so that they can retire at after year service as be currently the case for firefighter and the police 
 the hon gentleman rightly raise the matter of the enormous contribution of prison officer they be often under sing member of our public service risk their life day in day out to protect we all from dangerous and violent criminal of course as minister we have a duty to protect the public purse we have set out a clear principle on the age of retirement from government role we would be reluctant to start vary that for a further group of people because it be very difficult to draw the line once we start unpick that principle 
 it have be report in the daily telegraph that the starmerite think tank labour together have have to pay a fine of just over £ for fail to declare hundred of thousand of donation the rationale it give be that it do not want to name some of its donor do my right hon friend think that simply not want to do something be a reasonable basis on which to break the law 
 the short answer be clearly no indeed it really worry i that thing have come to a state where the labour party allegedly do not want to declare donation because of concern about grow antisemitism that be a very worrying allegation 
 the independent review into the teesworks project find there to be a lack of 
 transparency and oversight across the system to evidence value for money 
 as well as 
 a persistent theme or culture of excessive confidentiality 
 the department for levelling up housing and communities do not seem to be interested in pursue those matter and refuse to refer they to the national audit office can the minister explain what his department be do to make sure that public money be spend properly 
 the government remain committed to ensure value for the taxpayer across all project as the hon gentleman highlight this be principally a matter for dluhc 
 what be the late position on a review of the impact of the statute of limitation on the ability of people injure   by covid-19 vaccine to bring civil claim more than claim have not yet be deal with by the government ’s compensation scheme and people ’s ability to begin civil litigation will be prejudice unless something be do quickly 
 my hon friend be a champion and a campaigner on behalf of all those people who have suffer covid vaccine damage we have meet and i have take the issue to the permanent secretary to see what we can do whether it would involve extend the timeframe that he be talk about or not start the clock tick until a decision have be make 
 give that ministers be pilot the use of artificial intelligence in departments to answer parliamentary question which ministers will the secretary of state wish to replace 
 until this moment i have not think of draw up a list but as the hon lady will have hear we say on a number of occasion artificial intelligence provide a remarkable opportunity to create supplementary capacity and capability for the civil service and the government i have be very pleased to pilot a new programme call red box devise by a fantastic young crack ai team which summarise long document and make the work of my private office easy however it be enhance capability not replace it 
 the minister talk early about protect our border i be sure he will know that dover port health authority have seize worrying amount of contaminated meat over the last few month but in just the last few day we have learn that the government be withdraw the fund that make it possible for the authority to do that why be the government ignore the advice of experienced public health official 
 there be absolutely no question of ignore the advice of expert indeed only yesterday i have relevant meeting to discuss adjacent matter as i say in an early answer meat be circulate particularly pork and chicken that be not fit under either eu or uk rule and we will continue to take step to ensure that our border be protect 
 sir brian langstaff recommend in april that before the publication of his final report interim payment should be make to parent who have lose child and to child who have lose parent why be this minister such a computer say no man 
 i respectfully reject that characterisation as the hon gentleman know the government have spend £ of taxpayer money since october the arrangement for the distribution of further compensation payment be obviously be consider at this point and as i say during the extensive exchange that open this question session that work be continue apace so that i can produce a comprehensive response from the government as soon as possible 
 how do the secretary of state expect the civil service to function effectively for the public if the government go ahead with headcount cut of up to which aim    to return civil service number to pre pandemic and pre brexit level and which will mean a huge loss of expertise and knowledge what discussion have he have with trade union about these proposal 
 i meet several union leader a few week ago on   october the chancellor announce that the civil service would be cap at the level that be current at that time which would save up to £ against the trajectory that be then in place as of september there be civil servant it be an important government responsibility to ensure that we have the right number of civil servant perform effectively and efficiently in public service and we will continue to work on that.[official report   march vol c. 2mc correction 
 what discussion have the minister have with charity back home in northern ireland such as beyond the battlefield and ssafa about improve mental health support for veteran who serve in northern ireland during the trouble i have extend this invitation in the past and i extend it again now will the minister join i in visit portavogie to see the wonderful work of beyond the battlefield which be conduct a project there we really want to see he there 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind invitation i would love to come and i be in northern ireland a couple of week ago health be clearly devolve but i make it very clear that i want the same standard in northern ireland that we have achieve with op courage in england a single dedicated mental healthcare pathway for veteran with referral in its year where be all these people go before that it be an incredible story i want to see that standard achieve in northern ireland and we will keep work at it until we do 
 may i ask my hon friend what work be be do to ensure that the government give value for money for the taxpayer when it come to the government estate 
 i be pleased to say that of our major government function the government property agency be constantly look at how we can refresh the government estate to make sure not just that our office be fit for purpose and be wonderful working space for our excellent civil servant but that we be not hang on to outdated building that be expensive to run we be very mindful of achieve value for money in this area 
 interim payment be by their very nature interim they be pay before final payment perhaps the minister might be able to help i to understand he just say that work be go on at pace so when will the interim payment recommend by sir brian langstaff in april to parent who lose child and child who lose parent be pay before the final payment be make 
 as soon as possible and when the government ’s position be clear 
 on the efficiency of government departments i be sure that minister want report by inspectorate that be the responsibility of their department to be produce in a timely manner be the minister aware that the now sack chief inspector of border and immigration have produce report which have be sit on the home secretary ’s desk in some case for over a year there be complete confusion about how they can be publish in the absence of the inspector and his deputy will the minister look into that and give reassurance to the house that these report will be publish in a timely fashion 
 my hon friend raise a very important matter i will look into it urgently and come back to he as soon as possible 
 the experience of the last year have teach we that energy security be now national security the more we can generate our own renewable the less reliant on tyrant we will be have the secretary of state ask the national security council to report on the national and energy security implication of the prime minister ’s decision last year to scale back his government ’s energy transition target if he have not why not 
 we continue to monitor energy security principally through the national security council resilience committee which i chair i say gently to the hon lady that if she be concerned about energy security why do her party consistently vote against grant new licence for north sea oil and gas which would enhance our energy security 
 why do this government think it be right that church of england bishop in the house of lords can have great    say on legislation affect scotland than the scottish parliament and when will there ever be meaningful reform to the bloated house of lords 
 as the hon gentleman will have hear i say in a westminster hall debate not so long ago it remain a great pity that the snp refuse to play in the house of lords the fact be that the people of scotland reject the idea of an independent scotland some time ago and it would have be to the benefit of his constituent and other around scotland if his party have have the good sense to ask for people to be put in the upper house 
 on the contaminated blood scandal why have the government not name the expert 
 we have give detail of the appointment of sir jonathan montgomery and a number of other individual be work on clinical and other matter it be really important that we get on with this work and we will report back on their conclusion as soon as we can 
 we know that the cabinet office be often focus on make sure that procurement contract go to small and medium sized enterprise but can my hon friend tell i what work be be do to make sure that female lead business get a chance at those contract 
 i think my right hon friend be refer to social value which be obviously an important part of our procurement regime social value be discuss extensively during the passage of the procurement act and contract authority in local area must pay regard to it 
 will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business

 tuesday march conclusion of the budget debate 
 colleague should also be aware that   thursday march   will be estimate day at pm on that day the house will be ask to agree all outstanding estimate 
 i start by pay tribute to ronnie campbell and sir patrick cormack ronnie be a large than life character proudly and staunchly represent his community and his root although sir patrick be an mp before my time i have read the glow tribute which all describe he as incredibly kind 
 i be also incredibly sadden by the news just announce that dave myers of the hairy bikers have die he be a hugely popular and much love figure 
 i be go to welcome the motion on the risk base exclusion of members that we be due to debate on monday as the leader of the house announce last week but it appear that she have pull it this decision will be meet with dismay by member staff and union who have work on it for more than a year can she let we know when the motion will return i note that some on the conservative benches have table amendment which report suggest be why the motion have be withdraw will she confirm that she still support the motion as agree by the house of commons commission on which we both sit 
 i welcome the new funding and protocol that have be announce to enhance mps security and defend our democracy we have see a huge rise in antisemitism islamophobia hate and the intimidation of elect representative especially since hamas ’s barbaric attack on israel on   october i put on record my thank to you mr speaker and the security service for your leadership i ask last week as i have before for a new cross party taskforce to address these issue can the leader of the house help to make sure that happen 
 we have discuss these issue many time but do the leader of the house not agree that it be incumbent on all of we to be mindful of our language and conduct   when we see racism antisemitism or islamophobia in our own rank we must take action however difficult the consequence and we must be clear in call it out to that end i hope she will take this opportunity to say what be very clear for all to see that the comment of   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson   about the mayor of london be racist and islamophobic do the leader of the house agree that we need to uphold the high standard of conduct towards another and that highly personalised and wrong head attack by section of the medium or by political party towards individual member only fuel hatred disdain and those who pose security threat we must strive to do well 
 in an age of social medium the spread of misinformation disinformation and deep fake will shape the general election in way that we can not imagine so will the leader of the house update we on regulation and action to tackle it the government water down the online safety act and take all of this out of scope just when we need it most 
 finally ahead of next week ’s budget i want to turn to the economy last week it become official we be in recession most people do not need the office for national statistics to tell they that because they have be struggle with its reality for a long time sit beneath the headline figure be a record the government do not want to admit we have see the big fall in living standard since record begin let we just let that sink in for a moment to emphasise that gdp per capita have fall for quarter in a row that mean family up and down the country have much less money to spend the pound in their pocket worth less 
 this total crisis of living standard have the prime minister ’s name write all over it he be the chancellor and now as prime minister he have fail he have fail to meet his own pledge to grow the economy and he have fail each and every of we 
 to make matter bad the government seem unable to show any understanding or humility they repeat that their plan be work and that they have turn a corner but we have not alternatively they blame other for their failure the chief secretary to the treasury seem not to understand the number at all conservative member blame the weather and another blame disabled people when ask about our fail economy at yesterday ’s prime minister ’s question the prime minister blame labour ’s policy 
 it be the conservative year of decision that have lead we here and leave britain uniquely expose with austerity political and economic instability energy insecurity and the kamikaze budget send mortgage and interest rate soar after year people be bad off taxis be high cost be high and growth be stagnant and there be nothing the government can announce next week to change any of that 
 let i add my voice to the many tribute that have be pay both to lord cormack and to ronnie campbell they be public servant who be thoughtful and committed both to parliament and to many other organisation and institution i hope that those many tribute bring comfort to their loved one i also join in the tribute the hon lady pay to dave myers half of the hairy bikers he bring so much joy to so many people across our country and elsewhere 
 the hon lady ask i several question about risk base exclusion i do not think she have quite process the full extent of the consequence of what happen last week the government give time to this debate and we want it debate i be part of the commission and i want it debate and resolve in this house give the current climate and the concern that hon member have raise since the motion be table there have be some serious question in particular from learn colleague there will be a well opportunity to debate this in the house and i hope that will be soon 
 i be not expect the hon lady to give we any credit at all as that be not her job she do not welcome the figure on irregular migration that be out today which show that our plan be work she will know that the budget which i announce in the business will be very soon and i be sure we can all see the progress that have be make and that the chancellor will set that out in due course 
 as for what the hon lady say about intimidation let i repeat what i say last week this house will not have not and must not bow to terrorism or intimidation we be experience a new form of an old story as well as those colleague slay since there be other who be murder and whose shield be on the wall of this chamber above the door there be member who sit on these benches who can recall be issue with mirror to look under their car in the morning we be face a new form of that old threat it fail then and it be go to fail now but while we focus on end that threat we must not lose sight of the good in our country and what we can all do to help this situation 
 the hon lady raise the issue of   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson i know she will want to hear word from he but yesterday he provide we with word i read his piece in the express and it be some distance from the view he express in the original interview i think what he write in the express be his genuine view we might have to accept that those word be the close we will get to the word apology that other seek the hon lady have understandably choose to scold he i would rather ask he to consider all the good he could do whatever political hue he end up be in these particular time with the trust and follow he have build up she ask what action the government have take to combat these issue i point she to the work of the defend democracy taskforce the work i have do in this place on combat conspiracy theory and the new system we have set up 
 the shadow leader of the house be right that we also need to reflect on our own behaviour i would ask she to consider on whose benches members sit who have suggest that we lynch a government minister who have call hon member scum or who have say 
 i want to be in a situation where no tory mp no tory mp no coalition minister can travel anywhere in the country or show their face anywhere in public without be challenge 
 which party ’s action have make it more likely that an antisemite will be swear into this house next week which party last week trash the understanding and foundation of trust upon which this place need to operate interruption the hon lady roll her eye i would ask she to consider what she could do to rectify that situation there be many good people in the   labour party there be many good people who have also be drive from it despite good attempt to knock it off the medium agenda or pretend it be otherwise the strong moral compass we want to see from our nation ’s political leader especially at time like this be miss from the labour party that be sad and it be shameful 
 i call the father of the house 
 follow the comment make by the shadow leader of the house about risk base exclusion i be glad that motion be not come forward next week as there should be more consideration it be a matter of record that major newspaper make sex base accusation against i but i be not investigate by the police or as a result refer it be only arrest that make a difference it be absurd and naive to think that be someone to be suspend and get a proxy vote their anonymity could in any sense be guarantee in this country or not report in other country this be a serious problem i be not certain we have find exactly the right way of deal with it 
 will the government make a statement next week on revisionism and who be the lead designer of the national holocaust memorial and propose learning centre of the government ’s nominee as chair of the uk holocaust memorial foundation be quote in the jewish news yesterday say that ron arad be the person responsible every government comment from onwards have acknowledge quite rightly that the main designer be sir david adjaye om a name that can not normally be mention because of problem i do not want to go into on the floor of the house could ministers refer lord pickles to the press notice that go out in the uk holocaust memorial foundation ’s name in and every year since because we must get the fact right and not change they 
 i reassure my hon friend that we be listen to the house risk base exclusion and other such scheme be a matter for the house and all member need to have confidence in those process he have successfully put on record his concern about that aspect of the holocaust memorial i will ensure the secretary of state have hear what he have say and he can raise it directly with he on   march 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 a lot have happen since the leader of the house and i last face each other and i commend she for her intervention in last week ’s event she act as she say to defend the right of minority party that be the right thing to do but what a dismal reflection on westminster that the right of minority party mp in this place now need protect and defend the whole house know how we get here at some point we will get to the bottom of what pressure there be exactly what dealing be do behind victorian screen and what simply urge the speaker actually mean to be fair some labour figure be fesse up at the weekend or perhaps gloating about their tactic all because the snp want to debate an immediate ceasefire in gaza 
 people might ask why i be not tackle the leader of the house today on her government ’s economic policy brexit or child poverty we will return to our normal business question exchange of course but at the core of our work as mps be that all member and party must be treat fairly and see to be treat fairly for as long as scotland send mps here we will expect and demand that no party can be allow to change the rule by bully there be not a great deal that the leader of the house and i agree on but i know that on this we do what use can she make of her office to ensure that we never find ourselves in that sorry procedural mess again and can she tell we when the replacement snp opposition day will be 
 finally after the giant lobby of parliament by campaigner yesterday i must again raise the government ’s repeat delay in deliver full and fair compensation to those infect and affect by the contaminated blood scandal i know that the leader of the house recognise the fully justified depth of anger about this can she tell we what progress have be make ahead of the budget to set up the structure of the compensation scheme transparently and in consultation with victim and their family so that it be ready to start allocate fund at the early opportunity 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and i understand why people will have to wait for normal combat to be resume between we i disagree with thing that she and other hon member have say that this chamber and westminster collectively do not cover itself in glory last week i think that the issue have be about the action of particular individual and what they have do many member of this house do a good thing last week by stand up to protect the right the foundation and the rulebook that we operate on with regard to those who be catch up in something else many member have recognise that that be the wrong thing to do and that we need to address that the government will give the snp more time to have the debate that it ought to have i understand that you mr speaker have commission the procedure committee to look at the particular procedural issue that happen last week i understand that the scope of that work be narrow so it should be do swiftly i hope that it will be conclude before the snp have its next debate so that it can have confidence in how that debate will run 
 on the hon lady ’s final very important point we have just hear from the paymaster general who be lead on the issue of infected blood on behalf of the government she be right that i have very strong view about this but they be share by the paymaster general and all those on the government benches that be why we set up the inquiry and why we set up the compensation study to run concurrently with it so that we would not have to wait any long before people get proper redress i know that the paymaster general be work on this very swiftly he update i on a regular basis and we will keep the house inform 
 on the anniversary of the come into force of the marriage and civil partnership minimum age act i be very concerned to learn that child marriage be still take place and that those with safeguard responsibility be fail to prosecute it be my understanding that the relevant authority be fail to interpret the law correctly   particularly in relation to marriage take place overseas can we have a statement on what further education be require as a matter of urgency so that all those with safeguard responsibility have the necessary knowledge and skill to protect child 
 i thank my hon friend for all her work in this area she have be an absolute force for good we would not have bring forward that legislation without her great effort she be right that we want to ensure that people particularly those with safeguard responsibility be take this issue seriously she will also know that a private member ’s bill be look at the responsibility of statutory authority in this regard i will make sure that the department have hear the hon lady ’s concern on this matter and i be sure that give her reputation they will be listen to 
 i thank the leader of the house for our meeting yesterday and for the business statement confirm the timing of the estimate debate for   thursday march let i inform the house that application for those debate must be with the clerk of the committee by lunch time on monday so we do not have much time to sort this out so that be this come   monday march at lunch time the application will be before the committee on tuesday afternoon at our normal meeting 
 may i let the leader of the house know that i have now receive a letter from the procedure committee regard the proposal to change the timing of debate in westminster hall i be hopeful that she will have that imminently 
 may i add my penn’orth in memory of my friend ronnie campbell i have be a member of this house for only year but i know ronnie for more than year i will be at his funeral in blyth tomorrow and will certainly pass on the good wish of the member of this house to his wife deirdre and son when i see they 
 i thank the hon member for deliver our message at ronnie ’s funeral tomorrow i also thank he for the helpful advert for the work of his committee he will know that we be keen to ensure that the new innovation in the sit hour of westminster hall can be bring into effect and he have my commitment to that i will also ensure that we be give he good notice on future timing for his committee i be very conscious as we discuss yesterday that debate have be move for understandable reason for example the debate on coalmine community be move because of important matter relate to northern ireland and we want to ensure that there be time for those matter to be hear 
 thank you mr speaker for host a dinner for onside in your apartment this week that make i think that it be high time that we have a debate in this house about the contribution that youth zone make to east lancashire the centre of that debate mr speaker will be not the chorley youth zone as fine as it be but the brand new youth zone that be about to be build in darwen the £ project to help all our young people be support by this government as part of our £ town deal to transform darwen 
 may i congratulate my right hon friend on another success that he have have with his wish list for his constituent i congratulate everyone involve in that project these be vital community facility and we all send our congratulation and good wish for this late project in this area 
 i thank the leader of the house for an opportunity to raise this question on freedom of religion or belief the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief which i chair visit tunisia last may to highlight some of the issue that be relevant to our all party group on sunday past a mob in tunisia burn a synagogue in the city of sfax thankfully no be injure will the leader of the house join i and other in denounce this attack and call for close monitoring of the issue relate to freedom of religion or belief 
 we again thank the hon gentleman for what he do every week which be to shine a spotlight on the situation that be go on around the world that would not normally get this level of attention it be good to hear from he slightly early in the session this week as he know on each occasion i follow up with the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure that our people in country realise the importance of these matter to we in this place and i thank he again on behalf of we all for raise they 
 if freedom of the press mean anything it mean the freedom to criticise and to oppose that freedom be in danger if we become the democracy in the world to allow a foreign government to buy a national newspaper and medium organisation my right hon friend the leader of the house may be aware that the noble baroness stowell have table an amendment to the digital markets competition and consumers bill with cross party support in the house of lords to prevent that from happen will the government support or at least not oppose that amendment in the house of lords be it to come to the commons i certainly would support it and i encourage all right hon and hon member to do the same we must prize freedom of the press in this country and that amendment be our opportunity to do so 
 i agree with my right hon friend have a free press and a competitive media sector be a vital part of our democracy the secretary of state for culture media and sport have an obligation to intervene in media transaction where there be a public interest to do so as my right hon friend will understand more than many that be a statutory judicial process so it would not be right for i to comment on his general point however he be absolutely right and there be audible support from across this chamber for the position that he outline 
 on   november   last year i write to the then secretary of state for health and social care seek a meeting with i and a cross party group of local mp to discuss an issue of concern express by our constituent follow the reshuffle and have receive no reply in december i write again to the new secretary of state   we have still not have a response let alone the meeting that we seek with the nhs on its knee i appreciate that the health secretary must have a full inbox but do the leader of the house agree that it be simply unacceptable that after almost month member of this house be still wait for a minister to reply to our correspondence 
 guideline be clear about the time- frame in which department need to respond to member as the hon lady know my office take that very seriously we be involve in train the parliamentary clerk in departments to ensure that they understand the obligation if she give i further information i will follow up on the matter of parliamentary correspondence i do not know the specific of the issue that concern the hon lady and her colleague but she will know that many decision be take locally i be sure however she have already speak to her board and local commissioner i will ensure that the secretary of state have hear what she have say and she can raise it with she directly in oral question on   march 
 the leader of the house will be aware that the barking havering and redbridge university hospitals nhs trust operate the queen ’s hospital in my constituency i praise the staff and the chief executive for all the work that they do to look after my constituent however will the leader of the house ask the secretary of state for health to make a statement about the situation in the accident and emergency unit per cent of patient be be see within hour and yet the national average be that be unacceptable will she ask the secretary of state to visit queen ’s hospital with i to look at solution and to discuss how we can serve the constituent of romford well when it come to the local hospital and nhs service in the london borough of havering 
 i join my hon friend in the praise that he heap on his healthcare professional in particular at the queen ’s hospital in his constituency he may be aware that the secretary of state ’s predecessor do a piece of work to ensure that we be able to compare the performance of different trust and different hospital across the whole uk so that we can identify where more assistance be need or whether there be issue with performance and so forth i will ensure that the secretary of state hear what my hon friend have say today again he may raise it directly with the front bench team on   march   at question time 
 for some time now i have be in support of a safeguard assist die law for mentally competent terminally ill adult with a life expectancy prognosis of month i be not always of that opinion i have have to go on a journey but have conclude that the evidence be overwhelming that that would be a step in the right direction and public opinion be now very much in favour of a change in the law i recognise that there be considerable concern on the opposite side of the argument but in the light of the news that the isle of man and jersey be consider a change in the law be it not time that we in this house have a fresh look at the matter with a debate in government time 
 i thank the hon lady for her work in that area she will know that if such matter come to the floor of the house it would be on a free vote basis they be matter of conscience i very much understand the head of steam that be build behind both side of the argument it have be a little while since we have have a debate on that matter she will know what option be open to she to secure a debate be it an adjournment debate or secure through the backbench business committee but i will ensure that all relevant departments have hear what she and other hon member have say 
 my right hon friend will like i have constituent whose water be supply by southern water after week of obfuscation reassurance and denial by the company that there have be any pollution incident at fullerton wastewater work in my constituency we hear from the environment agency yesterday that there have be a significant pollution incident of a level that would be hazardous to human health will she help i by provide government time for a debate about whether southern water remain a fit and proper company to be manage water resource in our region she will know as well as i do that it be not simply wastewater that it can not cope with it be not any good at supply drinking water either 
 i thank my right hon friend for leave the house in no doubt about her frustration and disappointment about the situation with southern water i have experience similar feeling towards that company what be particularly disappointing in this episode affect her constituent be that although massive progress have be make in monitor storm overflow we have go from just be monitor to almost 100%—the quality of that monitoring be critical and the assurance that she have be give about what be happen and about the type of water be expel into a river have turn out not to be correct there be question for southern water and the environment agency i will ensure that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have hear what she have say and will ask his official to get in contact with her office 
 we need a fresh statement on the infected blood scandal my constituent sue sparkes be in the house yesterday she be widow at the age of when her husband les pass away in have contract hepatitis c and hiv from infected blood the leader of the house mention a moral compass in her statement may i remind she that member from across this house show their moral compass when for the only time in this parliament they defeat the government on this issue that be why the government have make the statement that they have but they be still not pay the full and fair compensation that have be call for by sir brian langstaff when will the government make a statement on the compensation and will the budget indicate that it will happen immediately 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that question and i thank all the directly affected people and those support they and the various campaign group who take the time to visit parliament   yesterday i think that we have do the right thing in grip this issue through the inquiry that we have set up and the compensation study the hon gentleman will know of my interest in this area i assure he that i get regular update from the paymaster general and i do not think it will be too long before he will be able to come to the house to make further announcement he be make progress this be the final stage of the process it be the most difficult i know that the paymaster general be determined to deliver the right outcome for all those infected and affect by that appalling scandal 
 the emotional aftermath and devastate life that be leave after violent knife crime have be highlight in a recent very powerful documentary title grief produce locally in the west midland by the express and star it be a really poignant reminder of the call for action and awareness and feature the brave story of grieve family set of parent include from my constituency i know that the home secretary take this issue very seriously but can my right hon friend provide we with an update on when legislation will be bring forward to deliver a ban on machete and zombie style knife 
 i thank my right hon friend for all the work she be do on this issue i have witness that work at hand have visit her constituency and meet with set of those parent she mention i praise they for all the work they be do to turn the tragedy that befell they into some positive action as she have kindly mention the home secretary be committed to this issue and be continually look at what more can be do the particular statutory instrument to which my right hon friend refer which be lay before parliament on   january be currently on remain order and be yet to be debate in both houses but i think that will happen extremely soon as she know we be make progress on that 
 on   january i raise the case of pilsworth south landfill in my constituency which have be give off an awful smell due to the operator breach its licence i ask the leader of the house whether we could have a debate in government time about give the environment agency more tooth in relation to matter like this and i appreciate she write to the environment secretary on my behalf however can we have a statement from the secretary of state on potential prosecution of operator that breach their licence so that our constituent no long suffer from this stench and we can stop the stink 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his continued work in this area my office stand ready to help he on all front as he know he can raise this matter directly with the secretary of state on   march but give that that date be a little way off i will make sure that the secretary of state hear what the hon gentleman have say today 
 last week the government fund organisation tell mama publish its late datum on anti muslim hatred and islamophobia incident that datum show that there have be plus incident in month an   increase of over between that time and now there have be no statement from the government on tackle islamophobia last week there be a statement from the government on tackle antisemitism can the leader of the house clarify to i when the government will make a statement on tackle islamophobia note those late datum i be sure she agree with i and with every member of this house that we should do everything we can to ensure that all our faith community be treat fairly and equally 
 i agree with my hon friend ’s comment that be a duty on we all he may wish to know that i have also ask for a meeting with the government ’s envoy for freedom of religion or belief my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce and the minister responsible to look at what more we parliamentarian can do to ensure that all community and faith group feel properly support in these time i will make sure that the relevant department hear what my hon friend have say today 
 i have no intention of come to ask the leader of the house a question but early she mention the exclusion of member of parliament just to be clear about the language what we be talk about be people who have be arrest for sexual crime be exclude from this estate she say that we can not have that debate and that member need to trust the process well staff also need to trust what happen here she say that we can not have the debate because of what happen last week i have absolutely no idea how what happen last week have anything to do with keep this building safe could the leader of the house elaborate on why what happen last week have get anything to do with something we have be fight for for year
