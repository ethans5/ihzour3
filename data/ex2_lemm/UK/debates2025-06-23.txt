my hon friend   the member for aldershot alex baker   and i have publish a report highlight the persistent scale up gap for defence sme i welcome the increase in fund   for nationally significant infrastructure project but red tape be hold back investment in british single use military technology so will my right hon friend look at clear up some of that red tape in order to supercharge investment in british defence sme 
 child poverty be a significant challenge in the north east and that be why it be right that mayor kim mcguinness participate in an early session of the taskforce and have shape the agenda since then the child poverty reduction unit engage regularly with colleague from the north east and will hold a dedicated session on strategy with the north east child poverty commission this week mayor have be absolutely critical to the development of the strategy and we will continue to work closely with they 
 we be review universal credit to ensure that it make work pay and tackle poverty and we be look at exactly the kind of problem that my hon friend highlight i would be delighted to meet he to discuss it because nicola steven and all household claim universal credit in his constituency will benefit from the standard allowance increase propose in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill which we will be debate next week it be the big increase in the headline rate of benefit since at least 
 i be really grateful that the right hon gentleman have raise that point and it be good that it be a point of agreement across the whole house there be a time when large number of people in this house would have think that have gay man lesbian or   trans people in the armed force be anathema and i be so glad that we have change the shield on the wall up there be dedicate to member of parliament who be kill in the world war and at least if not of they be gay man who give their life in defence of this country bravery be available to people regardless of their sexuality or their identity the right hon gentleman be also absolutely right to refer to terence his report be an essential part of change the landscape in this country and make sure that compensation be available to the individual who be affect 
 we should acknowledge the fundamental truth that trans people have always be at the forefront of our movement from marsha p. johnson in new york to mark ashton here in the uk trans people and gender non conforming people have lead protest shape policy and build community often with little recognition or safety in return at stonewall at section protest in the founding of support service and hiv charity and at the heart of every movement that push we forward trans people be there and they lead we owe they a debt of gratitude so to treat they now as a threat to the very movement they help build be wrong we will not forget their role and we will not leave they behind trans people deserve safety dignity and the same freedom to live their life as anyone else and under this government they will have it 
 on   august edward carpenter have his birthday he have famously campaign for our right and live with his lover george merrill indeed he be probably the model for e. m. forster ’s novel maurice which i think be publish only after e. m. forster ’s death carpenter be a brave campaigner at a time when it be impossible to be brave man be still be imprison with hard labour for homosexuality in when he come to his birthday so it be a phenomenal act of bravery when every single member of the labour cabinet there be a labour government in sign a letter to carpenter wish he a happy birthday 
 that kind of magnanimity should be the hallmark of our politic today we be not yet the country that we could be but in all we do in our hospital and our school in our law and our language in our foreign policy and our public service this government will uphold principle a little respect for all let that be the legacy of this house 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle fraud in the welfare system by organise criminal group 
 the department work collaboratively across government and law enforcement agency to investigate welfare fraud perpetrate by organise criminal gang this type of criminality be complex and far reach and a collaborative approach be therefore essential i be pleased to confirm that new power in the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill will help we well tackle organise crime by take great control of our investigation through new power of entry search and seizure 
 have spend my career before enter this place tackle fraud i recognise the scale of the challenge so i commend the secretary of state for her leadership with the big ever crackdown on benefit fraud give the success of whistleblow reward scheme in tax and financial crime do my hon friend agree with i that there be merit in explore similar scheme to uncover organise fraud in the benefit system so that more fund can be recover to support those who genuinely need support our constituent 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue we take all allegation of fraud seriously people who suspect fraud against the department for work and pensions can use exist channel to report it include the national benefit fraud hotline this government be not complacent as i mention in my substantive reply we be take action with the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill which will provide a range of new power to address fraud and error in the social security system after the conservative party fail to substantively update our power to tackle ever more complex fraud during long year in office however i will watch with interest whether there be learn from the scheme my hon friend mention that could be apply to case of benefit fraud 
 organise gang operate in many sphere sex drug and as report in the medium our welfare system this totally undermine public confidence in the system will the minister make representation to the home secretary to ensure that foreign national who be find to have abuse our welfare system be remove from the country 
 i be very happy to raise with the home office the issue that the hon gentleman have highlight but i would say to he and indeed to his colleague on the opposition front bench that what genuinely undermine confidence in the welfare system be the record of the previous government who allow welfare fraud to spiral towards £ a year and fail to take the power need as we be do now to get that number down 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of child in poverty in the livingston constituency 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of child in poverty in gloucester 
 if i may briefly say so i be very proud that the spending review deliver the large ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people quadruple what we inherit from the last government to over £ a year or a total of £ over this parliament so that those who can work get the support they need while we protect those who can never work 
 tackle child poverty be my personal priority so i be proud that the education secretary and i be bring in free school meal for all child in family on universal credit lift child out of poverty a down payment on our child poverty strategy we be also deliver the ever year funding settlement for the household support fund include for holiday hunger and we be commit to fund the holiday activity and food programme stop kid go hungry while they be at school and during the holiday too 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response of the good way of reduce child poverty be help parent into good stable and well pay job which the snp scottish government be fail abjectly to do for example the snp manifesto in promise to double investment in the paternal employment fund to £ over year to help low income family get into work however in that pledge be scrap will the secretary of state call on the scottish government to put some of their record funding into employability fund to help my livingston constituent get into work and to provide good job right across scotland 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend economic inactivity be high in scotland than in the uk as a whole and a staggering in young scot be not in education employment or training   we have deliver an extra £ for scotland over the spending review the big settlement in the history of devolution and i hope the snp will match our ambition to get people who can work into work by invest in employment service not cut they as they have in recent year 
 the expansion of free school meal will massively help family in my constituency of gloucester and take they out of poverty can the secretary of state confirm how many more family in gloucester will be eligible for free school meal under the government ’s expansion and what step be she take with the secretary of state for education to ensure that every child be able to access that support 
 this vital step will benefit child in my hon friend ’s constituency it come on top of roll out free breakfast club start with calton and grange primary school in his constituency our new fair repayment rate in universal credit and the ever permanent above inflation increase in the standard allowance of universal credit a vital part of our welfare reform put more money into the pocket of hard work family and help to give all child the good start in life 
 at the lobby last week by the food bank a number of people express the wish to have great facility to educate their client with respect to shop and prepare meal more effectively they make a fair point do n’t they 
 as the former chair of feeding leicester i know that many of our food bank offer a range of support help to signpost people to mental health treatment debt advice and other measure to improve their wellbeing they certainly do not need any advice from conservative member under their watch we see more child and more pensioner in poverty it be time they take a lesson from this side of the house to get this issue right 
 probably the large single driver of child poverty in my community be the enormous cost of housing the average house price in my community be up to time average household income that drive grind poverty particularly among child will the secretary of state have a word with her right hon and hon friend in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that a disproportionate amount of housing grant go to rural community such as mine in particular with the windermere gateway scheme 
 reduce housing cost be of the key thing we be look at in the child poverty taskforce in advance of our strategy which we will publish in the autumn we be invest an additional £ in build more social affordable and other home but i will of course always raise all issue relate to housing because kid deserve to live in good home that be affordable that be what this government intend to achieve 
 as be the case for my hon friend the members for livingston gregor poynton and for gloucester alex mcintyre   a number of my constituent be affect by the child cap with the late statistic show that household in my constituency be impact i absolutely agree with a number of charity that remove the cap alone be not a silver bullet to tackle child poverty but it will make a difference can my right hon friend confirm whether the child poverty taskforce be consider the removal of the child cap 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question i can absolutely confirm that the child poverty strategy will be look at all the lever we need to tackle this really important issue include in relation to social security she be impatient for change for her constituent as be i. we have already put in place a fair repayment rate for universal credit we be increase the standard allowance for universal credit for the time in its history and we be roll out free school meal but i will of course take her representation forward and ensure that they be hear by the taskforce 
 when the government ’s own impact assessment for the pathway to work green paper suggest that child will be plunge into poverty and business be already slash vacancy in the light of the employment rights bill do the secretary of state really believe that the government ’s child poverty taskforce be push in the same direction as the rest of the government 
 the hon gentleman will know that that assessment do not take into account all the step that we be take to get more sick and disabled people into work with the big ever investment into support support that be deny to they by conservative members who write people off consign they to a life on benefit and then blame they we take a different approach we believe that sick and disabled people should have the same right chance and choice to work as anybody else that will be a key measure in tackle poverty 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of recent trend in the level of unemployment 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of recent trend in the level of unemployment 
 we all know the importance of work and since the election we have see employment rise by but britain be a country that have too few young adult in work or education and where the post pandemic employment recovery have take too long that be why we will continue our reform to support more people into work 
 to cut spending and balance the book labour have to get people off welfare but the chancellor ’s job tax and the deputy prime minister ’s unemployment bill mean that there be few job for they to go to some more of my constituent be out of work than last year and since the budget a quarter of a   job have vanish a rise in public sector role in the same period be probably mask a far deep crisis go on in the private sector there be no join up thinking have the secretary of state warn her cabinet colleague that their policy be make her job impossible 
 the secretary of state inherit a labour market that be a mess under the conservatives with nearly young people not in education or training and too sick to work employment be up by economic inactivity—[interruption conservative members might not like to hear it but economic inactivity be down by under this government no on the government benches will take lecture on a good labour market from the conservatives 
 unemployment be now high than when labour take office the chancellor ’s new job tax and the employment rights bill make hire a new person more expensive the family farm and family business taxis be reduce investment can the minister therefore explain how he will reduce unemployment while the chancellor be pursue policy that increase it 
 i do not want to try the patience of the house but as i have say employment be up by under this government interruption conservative member do not like to talk about that the hon gentleman mention what british business want what british business want be a government who be actually fix the public finance and the public service that mean that when a member of staff get sick they do not sit on a waiting list for year as they do under the previous government the conservatives like to attack the employment rights bill but stop good employer be undercut by bad be the pro business thing to do 
 paisley jobcentre run a take a job to work day where work coach look for local employment opportunity and take those suggestion into the jobcentre to match jobseeker with local job do my hon friend agree that that be a good example of local innovation in jobcentre and would the government consider share that good practice across the rest of the country 
 i thank everyone in paisley who have be work on those practice it be exactly the kind of innovation we like to see under the conservatives only in employer say they bother to engage with their local jobcentre which be exactly what we need to change with our reform to jobcentre plus i thank everyone in paisley but there be much more to do right across the uk 
 the previous government leave we with in young people out of work training or education and with people out of work due to long term sickness not only cost the economy billion more but cost people opportunity hope and dignity and now the conservatives can not even agree a plan among themselves to address that do the minister agree that the conservative party be in chaos while this government be bring forward sensible plan to give the country a way forward after the mess the conservatives leave it in 
 that be a powerful and long question and i be glad that conservative members listen to every word of it because they leave we young people not in education employment or training that be what a disgrace look like what be happen now we have see fall number of neet over the past quarter and the past year 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 week ago the hon gentleman ’s government tell people they be u turning on winter fuel payment because the economy be on a firm footing the next day the unemployment figure be release show that a quarter of a job have be lose since the chancellor ’s job tax budget the country be now lose job a month these figure be bad than even the most pessimistic forecast be that what a firm foot look like to the hon gentleman 
 a firm footing for economic recovery look like kick the conservative party out of office and grow the economy once again and that be what we see if we look at the datum the hon lady like to look at month ’s datum well let we look at it datum from the office for national statistics show that vacancy rise by between april and may i know the conservatives want to pretend that everything be wonderful a year ago but every business and every voter in this country know that that be not the case 
 honestly who do the minister think he be fool with this spiel growth forecast have be slash and inflation have surge what world be he live in the government have be in office for a year and people be lose their job because of the decision that they have make how do he think his everything ’s fine mantra actually sound to of the people who have lose their job or to a business face a tax bill that it can not afford have the secretary of state even tell she back benchers who will be strong armed into vote for cut next week that the welfare cut bill that we will be debate will get a grand total of people into work accord to the government ’s own impact assessment 
 the hon lady ask about what be go on with the economy what be go on be that we have have rate cut over the past year what be go on be that we have sign trade deal over the past year what be go on be that employment have go up and inactivity have go down i know that the opposition love to latch on to month ’s datum but let we look at the whole period of this government wage have increase by more under this party in the past month than they do in the year of the conservative government 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the personal independence payment application process 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the personal independence payment application process 
 the current pip application process be outdate and can be very difficult to follow alongside propose legislative change the department ’s health transformation programme will greatly improve the experience of apply and i hope increase confidence in the outcome of the assessment as a result 
 the response to my recent write question on disability benefit application list the most common disability and health condition and show that hundred of thousand of people be award few than point in all living activity and will miss out on the daily living component of pip they include people like jemima in harpenden who suffer from severe physical disability and thyroid cancer and find even walk very difficult will the government please commit to reform the criterion to well reflect the full complexity of claimant condition 
 i recognise that many people who be on the pip daily live component who do not get point on anything at their last assessment be feel rather anxious however what they need to know i hope the hon member will reassure her constituent on this be that it be the view of the office for budget responsibility that most of they will nevertheless still have their pip after their fresh assessment once the change have be introduce they will be introduce in november next year and an individual ’s assessment will take place whenever their award review be after that date the obr be confident and clear that most of those people will keep their pip 
 over people in ely and east cambridgeshire claim pip and they be not just anxious as you put it they be seriously worried that they be go to lose the payment and with they their independence contrary to what you say sorry contrary to what the minister say the government ’s own datum suggest that of people get standard payment and of those get enhance payment will lose support under the propose change what step be the minister take to support those who will be affect include to make sure that their health and eligible care need be meet and most importantly that they can maintain their independence 
 i suggest that in future short question might prevent mistake such as you 
 it be really important for claimant of pip that its funding should be sustainable into the future the trajectory of the past few year have be unsustainable we be take action to put that right the hon member be wrong to say that because people do not get point last time they will not keep their pip as i say the view of the obr which i think be correct be that most of they will we be consult on how to support those who will lose their pip as a result of the change that we have announce 
 minister have highlight that the pip recipient who be expect to lose payment make up in of the total pip caseload that suggest that the impact of the cut will be limit but it still represent current recipient who be expect to lose £ on average however those number rest on a set of assumption that the obr have describe as highly uncertain dwp datum show that people currently receive pip daily living payment would not meet the new criterion before mp be ask to vote on impose such appalling poverty will the dwp or the obr provide further evidence underpin those claim 
 the obr have publish its assessment and my hon friend be right that it have assess that in of those receive pip in november next year will have lose it by in not the much large proportion that we be hear about early follow that we will be able to introduce the big ever investment in employment support for people out of work on health and disability ground we do not want any long to trap people on low income for year and year we want people to be able to enter work and fulfil their ambition that be what the investment will allow 
 be it not the simple and sad truth that any mp who vote for the upcoming welfare bill will be vote to take pip from disabled people who need assistance to cut up their food wash themselves and go to the toilet 
 no member will be vote for reform to open up opportunity for people who have be deny opportunity for far too long we be put that right 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i respect the minister very much and i know that he care deeply about people who rely on the social security system that be why it be such a tragedy that he be preside over these profound reform without have consult disabled people can he explain why so many benefit claimant feel that these reform have be rush through not to make a fair system but because the treasury demand cut to meet the fiscal emergency create by the chancellor ’s job destroy growth stop budget they be right to think that be they not 
 we be put in place a fair system action be urgently need in the year before the pandemic pip cost the government £ at current price and last year it cost £ it also go up last year alone by £ pip require urgent action and that be what we be take 
 i be just sorry that there have be so little consultation with the victim of the change that the government be introduce area where the government do not seem to be look for saving be in the motability scheme it be suppose to help physically disabled people get around but now we have new people a year join the scheme many of they not physically disable at all in of all new car   purchase be buy through this scheme and it be cost taxpayer nearly £ a year i know that the minister will blame we for the system but the fact be that the government be not even look at motability they have have a year and it be their policy now will the minister commit to a proper review of the motability scheme and if not why not 
 i be not sure whether the shadow minister want i to go far or not so far he seem to be face both way he be right that we be not at this point propose any change to the motability scheme 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 recently i meet kathryn from my constituency who have to give up a £ a year job in order to care for her husband with carer set to lose their allowance due to pip eligibility reform some of our country ’s most hard press household face lose £ a year will the minister confirm that even if the welfare reform work out to the most optimistic expectation there will be far more net loser that net gainer among pip claimant 
 among household as a whole there will be more net gainer than net loser from the package the reason for that be the increase to the standard allowance of universal credit which accord to the institute for fiscal studies be the big increase to the headline rate of benefit since at least we be consult on support for those who will lose carer ’s allowance because of the change and consider what additional help they may need include for health and care need the hon member will have see in the bill we have publish that we have commit to a week run on of benefit after an assessment decision so that people have time to adjust to the new situation 
 what step she be take to support people on universal credit into work 
 what step she be take to support people on universal credit into work 
 we be build a new job and career service for all include those on universal credit as the cornerstone of our get britain working reform this new service will build towards an employment rate close the gap between disabled people and other and between parent and those without care responsibility and deal with the crisis in youth unemployment we be also change universal credit to stop people be leave on the scrapheap as per our pathway to work green paper 
 last week i hold an emergency community meeting for worker in my constituency who be about to lose their job follow the closure of the electric fibreglass site in hindley green it be heartbreaking some family have generation of worker who   have power the blast furnace and produce material for our energy defence and housing sector i be bitterly disappointed that after the hard graft of the government i the mayor of greater manchester and the gmb union it have come to this and another foreign company be close a blast furnace in our country what be the minister do to get worker like those back into work so that they can do what they want to do which be contribute to a strong industrial future 
 specifically on the business that my hon friend mention the department ’s rapid response service have work with those affected and be keen to do more i will personally ensure that he be put in touch with my colleague in the department so that he can help facilitate that too 
 more broadly like many industrial community my hon friend ’s constituency deserve more good job our industrial strategy will help lead the way on that as will the chancellor ’s investment plan set out in the recent spending review i know that if my hon friend feel that we need to do more for his constituency he will not hold back in tell we 
 my constituent tracy be live in local authority temporary accommodation after flee domestic violence she be currently trap on universal credit because the cost of her accommodation be way beyond anything she could earn locally by a factor of about as a single young person she face year before she be likely to be allocate a flat and she be rightly concerned that future employer would question her year of unemployment and under employment she want to work full time but have be advise not to do so do the minister agree that we need to do something to address the cliff edge 
 i thank my hon friend for bring that important case to the house universal credit have no fixed hour requirement but the connection between housing cost and universal credit as she mention be still a problem i would be keen to look at the detail of her constituent ’s case universal credit be introduce with the promise that it would move people off benefit and into work but that clearly have not happen as we need it to happen so considerable work be under way to deal with the inadequacy of the mess that the conservative government leave we 
 there be more people on out of work benefit in basildon and billericay than there be month ago local business tell i that that be because business rate have go up under the labour government national insurance tax have go up under the labour government and taxis on investment for the long term have go up under the labour government do the minister agree or have she get another explanation for the fact that more of my constituent be unemployed than there be month ago 
 our department be determined to serve business well if the right hon member would like to help his local jobcentre do that and get good job into the jobcentre so that we can help his constituent i be sure that i can facilitate that however he should be aware that employment be up and inactivity be down   we be move towards an employment rate and the chancellor ’s investment plan as she set out in the spending review will help we move towards that 
 the government ’s proposal to change benefit have a compound consequence for people want to stay in work for example the department have say that working age claimant receive carer ’s allowance and under the proposal would lose the pip they receive do the minister agree that those proposal will actually make it hard for people to stay in work rather than easy as they claim 
 as the secretary of state set out some moment ago we be introduce the big improvement to employment support that the country have know we will ensure that people receive the help they need to get into work and to stay in work 
 what step her department be take to help prevent the use of the child maintenance system to facilitate economic abuse 
 the issue of economic abuse through the child maintenance service be a serious which this government be look to address urgently i be pleased to say that a response to the child maintenance improve the collection and transfer of payment consultation be publish early today we intend to reform the cms into a single service type where the cms collect and transfer all payment this reform will drastically reduce opportunity for economic abuse throughout the service and make sure that money get to the child who need it we estimate that this change alone could lift more than child out of poverty 
 i have too many constituent whose financial abuse be effectively be perpetuate and facilitate by the child maintenance service i have secure a meeting with the relevant minister in the other place but it have be postpone could the minister help i to secure a date for that meeting i be sure that he would agree that if the system be at fault it need to change 
 i hope the hon member have hear i say that we concur with the need for change we have announce change in the right direction today and i will of course pick up with my fellow minister about secure that meeting for she i know they have already be in protract talk about arrange it and i will make sure it happen 
 my constituent deborah should receive monthly child maintenance payment for her daughter but her former partner withhold payment despite my complaint and her to the dwp child maintenance service complaint team advise they that he deliberately withhold payment for month and then backdate they that be a form of abuse and control behaviour but the dwp complaint team have advise i today that there be   nothing they can do to prevent it despite a deduction from earning order be in place do the minister agree that that be a completely inadequate response that require a ministerial review of the system 
 i be sorry to hear about the case that my hon friend have highlight he will have hear the reform that i announce early but i absolutely understand why he want to raise this issue for his constituent and if he would like to meet i to discuss it far i would be happy to do that 
 whether she be take step with cabinet colleague to help support climate and nature target through her department ’s pension policy 
 the short answer to that question be yes the department be contribute to consultation that will shortly be publish by the business and energy departments they will invite view on the new uk sustainability reporting standard and transition plan this will help investor include pension saver and their scheme to understand the impact of climate and nature on investment 
 as a co chair of the all party parliamentary group on sustainable finance and on global deforestation i remain concerned that around £ in uk pension saving be still invest in fossil fuel and deforestation relate activity will the minister reassure i far that undermine the long term financial security of saver in south east cornwall be not the government ’s intention and will he commit to review this include via the pension schemes bill and the landmark pension review 
 my hon friend have be a powerful campaigner on this issue for some year and she will know that large pension scheme be now require to publish annual report with climate relate disclosure the evidence show that around third of pension fund have a net commitment in place and we will be review those regulation over the course of this year 
 it be very important that those who have pension get a return so that their pension be beneficial it be also important to ensure that net be deliver because many people who have pension want to see that happen it be about get a balance so how will the minister get that balance 
 on the part of the hon member ’s question i do not want to get the balance because we want to make sure that saver get the absolute good value they can for every buck they save i completely endorse his sentiment on that part that be the very purpose of the pension schemes bill that be come through on the part of his question i also endorse the point that he make when we look at those disclosure we see that they set out a balance of judgment about the requirement on scheme but they also provide great transparency so that both individual and the scheme themselves can take a view about the investment 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the personal independence payment on the ability of disabled people to work 
 many disabled people want to work but only of people on personal independence payment be in employment we believe that disabled people should have the same right chance and choice to work as anybody else which be why we be deliver the big ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people quadruple what we inherit from the tories to over £ a year and it be why we have ask the former boss of john lewis sir charlie mayfield to review what more we can do to support employer to recruit and retain more disabled people 
 of my constituent who have epilepsy respond to the pathway to work consultation and highlight that the question imply that the department view pip as a pity payment rather than a benefit design to offset the extra cost of disability such as seizure alert device or accessible transport without such support disabled people be less able to live independently do the minister agree that cut pip payment simply push more disabled people far from live independently and from employment 
 i do not recognise the attitude that the hon member describe quite frankly we feel precisely the opposite this vital benefit make a crucial contribution towards the extra cost of live with a disability that be why we want to reform it to protect it for generation to come because we do not think that it be sustainable to have a doubling of the number of people on pip over this decade from to more than it be also why we be put in extra employment support why we want to support employer to do more to recruit and retain disabled people and why we want to reform access to work a vital scheme that help people because disabled people should have equal right chance and choice to work and that be what we seek to deliver 
 this morning i have the pleasure of visit pact for autism a brilliant local charity in harlow it raise concern about the accessibility of the pip application process for those with autism as the department look to reform the process could that be consider 
 i absolutely will consider that in fact i ask my hon friend and his constituent to feed into the work that my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability be do we have to ensure that it be as easy and effective as possible to access that vital benefit it be crucial for people with autism and we want to make it work properly 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the child poverty taskforce on level of child poverty in stroud 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the child poverty taskforce on level of child poverty in north durham constituency 
 give our objective to reduce the number of child in poverty overall i expect the impact of the child poverty strategy on child in stroud to be positive as all child benefit when the whole community can rely on child enjoy a good childhood we will publish the child poverty strategy as soon as possible but as we have say we be not wait to act the secretary of state have list a number of initiative that we have already be get on with 
 in stroud after year of austerity over child be live in poverty a recent joseph rowntree foundation report state that after remove the child limit the next most effective way of reduce child poverty be to get rid of the benefit cap would the minister be willing at least to review the benefit cap 
 as the secretary of state have already say all policy that can lift child out of poverty be under consideration by the taskforce we obviously will not commit to any policy without know how we will pay for it neither as i have say will we wait to act if there be step we can take immediately i thank my hon friend for his question which i will take as input to the child poverty taskforce i also take this opportunity to thank all colleague who have participate in the parliamentary session that the taskforce have host since november 
 will the minister give an update on the work the department be do with the north east mayor kim mcguinness ’s child poverty reduction unit to tackle the specific driver of that issue in our region 
 child poverty be a significant challenge in the north east and that be why it be right that mayor kim mcguinness participate in an early session of the taskforce and have shape the agenda since then the child poverty unit engage regularly with colleague from the north east and will hold a dedicated session on strategy with the north east child poverty commission this week mayor have be absolutely critical to the development of the strategy and we will continue to work closely with they 
 as in stroud and the north east child in poverty rely on food bank to get by—6,617 food parcel in my constituency alone will the government take the advice of the trussell trust and seek and follow independent advice on the universal credit standard allowance 
 as labour ’s manifesto say the emergency food parcel that we have see be a moral scar on our country that be why i be glad that as ministers have say we be increase the standard allowance for the time in as long as i can remember certainly i be also pleased that emergency food parcel be down this year 
 what step she be take to encourage people who be out of work to accept job that they be offer 
 if a person be out of work and be offer a job they be require to accept appropriate work that be offer to they the focus of our get britain working reform be to address the current situation whereby nearly people be out of work sick and not actively look for work and people be out of work but be not get the help they deserve from the exist jobcentre system 
 r and j yorkshire ’s fine butcher in kirkby malzeard have have multiple job application via jobcentre from people who they think never have an intention of go to interview or take a job may i urge the minister to look at how incentive and penalty be match up to ensure that people actually turn up to interview and take a job 
 the right hon gentleman mention a problem that i think be central to the situation that we have inherit that be why as i mention in response to   the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden we be change the way that dwp act so that we serve employer well and match people who actually want to move into those job if the right hon gentleman would allow i i will connect he with his local jobcentre manager so that he can link up the business he mention 
 what step she be take to support severely disabled people who will never be able to work in east worthing and shoreham constituency 
 protect those who can never work be at the heart of our welfare reform that be why in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill we be ensure that those with severe lifelong condition which will never improve and which mean they will never work and those at the end of their life be guarantee the high rate of the universal credit health top up protect in of all future universal credit health top up claim we be also go far by ensure that those who meet the severe condition criterion be never again reassess in order to stop unnecessary anxiety and stress help people over this parliament 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer i have be work with disabled constituent our local jobcentre and employer to ensure that everyone be work together to maximise opportunity for disabled people and that they be not just recruit but retain and thrive in job locally however some people will never be able to work or return to work include many people with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis and it be right that they be properly support will my right hon friend confirm what support will be in place for people like my constituent live with this disease 
 i thank my hon friend for the work he be do locally as i say those with severe lifelong condition progressive condition that will never improve and which mean they will never work will be protect even more importantly they will never again be reassess for their benefit remove that unnecessary and unacceptable anxiety and stress and give they the dignity and security they deserve 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment a recent freedom of information request by the royal national institute of blind people find that thousand of recipient whose primary health condition be list as eye disease be set to lose out from the reform to pip with referral to the rnib ’s counselling service more than double since the secretary of state announce the reform there be over people in leicester with sight impairment what be her department do to help those constituent give these harmful change to pip 
 i know the brilliant work that the rnib do and the brilliant sight service locally in leicester i have visit they myself i would say to the hon gentleman that out of people who be claim pip when these change come into place will be unaffected by they we be go to see more people claim pip by the end of this parliament compare with when we be elect and even with these change spending will still be £ high 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be proud of the step this labour government be take to tackle child poverty our historic expansion of free school meal to family on universal credit will lift child out of poverty and tackle term time hunger that be alongside the £ we be invest in the household support fund and our commitment to fund the holiday activity and food programme which will tackle holiday hunger too make sure that child have hungry mind not hungry belly will help they to fulfil their potential in life and that be what this labour government be all about 
 close the disability employment gap be a matter of opportunity for disabled people in my constituency i recently visit m&m supplies a stand out company in bletchley not only for its many export success but because a quarter of its workforce be adult with learn disability and difficulty and that be thank mainly to the vision of manage director frank purcell who work with organisation like mk snap to run a work experience programme for adult with disability what assurance can my right hon friend give i that this government be commit to work with employer to ensure that no disabled people in my constituency be write off 
 i congratulate through my hon friend those in his constituency on the fantastic work that he have describe i recently visit an incredible support internship programme that help young people with learn disability to get work and stay in work include in our local nhs and with our local hotel voco in the heart of leicester this government be determined to tackle the disability employment gap which fall under the last labour government although movement stall under the tories we be go to turn this around with the big ever investment in employment support introduce mandatory disability pay gap reporting and look at what more we can do to support brilliant employer like the my hon friend describe to recruit and retain more disabled people 
 i call shadow secretary of state 
 more than half of new health and disability benefit claim be now for mental health yet under the government ’s welfare cut bill the personal independence payment could be strip from quarter of claimant with arthritis and third of those with heart disease but few than half of those with anxiety do the right hon lady believe this be the right decision 
 i have great personal respect for the hon lady but she really need to make up her mind she say our proposal be too late then she say they be rush she criticise we for be cruel and then say the opposition be go to vote against our bill because it do not go far enough but her deputy   the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger have let the cat out of the bag say in a recent westminster hall debate 
 i be not able to tell exactly what we would do ”—[official report   may vol c. 301wh 
 the truth be that the conservatives be a broken party with no idea let alone a strategy and unless they change course they have no future either 
 goodness i i ask the right hon lady quite a serious question so that be a very disappointing answer however she and i be in agreement that the benefit bill need to come down and that will need real reform of the system so why be she press ahead in a panic with her half bake cut rather than do the job properly we would support a proper rethink of which condition should get what help and a well system for people struggle with mental health or neurodiversity who would be well off in work than park on benefit why do not she make that part of her plan 
 let i tell the hon lady what we be do to improve mental health support for people in this country and to make sure that it be treat with equal importance to physical health we have make significant progress towards recruit the additional mental health worker we say we would recruit in our manifesto to reduce delay and provide support we have confirm funding to help an extra patient get access to talk therapy and we be invest the big ever amount in employment support for sick and disabled people i say to the hon lady who leave   people out of work due to long term sickness and young people not in education employment or training that it be about time she apologise to the country and make up her mind about whether she will back our reform 
 i remind member that topical question and answer should be brief 
 my constituent nicola smith work for nhs fife like many people across the country she be not pay on the same date each month this lead to incorrect calculation for her husband steven ’s universal credit often leave the family without a payment or be sanction before the system catch up the follow month and i be aware of thousand of other in a similar position what reassurance can the minister provide that he be address these issue ensure smooth and fair payment for nhs worker and their family on universal credit and will he meet i to discuss this issue in more detail 
 we be review universal credit to ensure that it make work pay and tackle poverty and we be look at exactly the kind of problem that my hon friend highlight i would be delighted to meet he to discuss it because nicola steven and all household claim universal credit in his constituency will benefit from the standard allowance increase propose in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill which we will be debate next week it be the big increase in the headline rate of benefit since at least 1980.[official report   june vol c. 6wc correction 
 in her march green paper the secretary of state promise to provide an additional £ in funding to help benefit claimant back into work but only £ have actually be allocate and even that will not come until we have hear some talk of efficiency saving which be practically the definition of a magic money tree if ever there be so will the minister confirm that the promise £ for employment support will be all new money and not cannibalise from other vital dwp service 
 yes already this year we be roll out £ of support through our get britain working plan and connect to work that will rise to £ next year and build to an additional £ this be the big ever investment into employment support for sick and disabled people because we believe work be the route out of poverty we want to build dignity and a well life for those who can work while protect those who can not 
 child poverty in my constituency grow from in to in huge growth under the last government with the child poverty taskforce due to report soon can the secretary of state assure i and my dartford constituent that child poverty at the end of this parliament will be low than it be when it begin 
 yes i can that be a firm commitment from i personally and from the prime minister we have make a start on that work our expansion of free   school meal to child in all household on universal credit will benefit i think around child in my hon friend ’s constituency and we be help more people into work which be the good way to tackle poverty in the long term we have a long way to go but we be absolutely committed to bring those number down 
 some of people in west dorset who be in receipt of a personal independence payment receive the high level of support many be extremely anxious about pip assessment be carry out over the phone rather than in person particularly those with complex or fluctuating condition will the minister guarantee that anyone who want an in person assessment will receive 
 yes we absolutely want that to happen indeed we want to record the assessment as standard to ensure that claimant have confidence in what be be do this be an issue that cause huge anxiety among my constituent too many decision take too long and be overturn and we want to deal with these problem head on 
 when the under-25 universal credit rate be introduce the justification for it be that young people be more likely to be live at home but there be a group care experience young people for whom that be often not the case a transformational decision by this government would be to build on and go far in the work that we be already do with the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill and decision at the spending review by make this change for that very important group of young people 
 i commend my hon friend for all his work on this issue include his seminal independent review he be right that care leaver need support as they move to independent living the department for work and pensions at the moment exempt care leaver from the share accommodation rate and provide support toward sustained employment and career progression we will certainly consider if there be more that we can do 
 i call andrew rosindell not here 
 emma from tring be of my constituent who have say that these change to disability benefit will mean that they will have to come out of a career in the nhs what do the secretary of state have to say to those who be terrify about lose their work after change to disability allowance 
 out of people who be on pip when the change come in will be unaffected by the end of this parliament anybody who be affect will keep that benefit for month that be i think of the long transitional protection ever and certainly time as long as when we move from disability living allowance to pip the important access to work fund be there precisely to help anybody who need that sort of support to get into work we will guarantee that   during those month anyone who be affect and who use their pip for work will get access to an adviser who will help they to apply for access to work because it be so important that we support they 
 with people not go to be in receipt of pip by we have to be honest in this house we all know do n’t we that many of those people be just not able to access the healthcare that they need such as for mental health neurodiversity and physical health as a result they will not be able to work but they will be push into poverty because of these reform will the secretary of state please please please pause these reform to ensure that those people who have desperate health need be not force into poverty 
 my hon friend will know that this labour government be invest billion extra into the nhs precisely so that we can drive down wait for vital operation and increase the number of people get mental health treatment it be also the case that good work be good for physical and mental health there be very clear evidence on that and that be of the thing we know that we can achieve with the £ extra a year in employment support 
 match the scottish child payment by raise the child element of universal credit would bring more than half a child out of poverty the secretary of state have be clear that a lot of issue be be consider by the child poverty taskforce be raise the child element of universal credit to the level of the scottish child payment of those matter 
 at the risk of bore the house let i say that all lever be very much on the table when it come to get our kid out of poverty 
 a single parent in my constituency have work full time for more than year but be now in personal crisis because universal credit be unable to reimburse the childcare cost she have pay in advance i hope the minister agree that it be deeply unfair that my constituent be leave short every month despite work incredibly hard will he set out way in which the government be support hard work woman with childcare need 
 my hon friend ’s constituent will benefit from the big increase in the universal credit standard allowance which we have talk about and from free school meal for her child somebody who start work or increase their hour may also be eligible for support with up front childcare cost the flexible support fund can award the full cost for up to a month of fee to a childcare provider in advance of the care be deliver so that may be an option for his constituent 
 at the weekend vivergo and ensus worker learn that uk negotiator have successfully protect the uk bioethanol industry until president trump call the prime minister and he sell out that industry allow a genetically modify bioethanol to flood the market and put all   those job at risk what can the secretary of state tell those worker who feel that they have be sell out by our prime minister when negotiator have successfully protect an industry of the future 
 this government will always have the back of work people and i believe there will be a statement shortly on our modern industrial strategy i know that ministers from the department for business and trade will be extremely engage in the point that the right hon gentleman have just raise 
 many new mother in plymouth be claim maternity allowance not because they be unemployed but because they do not qualify for statutory maternity pay they may be self employ have recently change job or have have a pregnancy relate sickness many of they have contact i with concern that maternity allowance be treat as unearned income and be therefore subject to universal credit deduction unlike statutory maternity pay what step be the department take to ensure financial security for woman in plymouth who be claim maternity allowance 
 i understand the point that my hon friend make the treatment of maternity allowance in universal credit be subject to a judicial review which uphold the policy of treat it as unearned income when calculate universal credit and of treat smp pay by employer as earning in common with other statutory payment make by employer my hon friend may be interested to know that depend on individual circumstance additional financial support for example child benefit and the sure start maternity grant may be available to parent 
 my constituent tirath be currently be pursue by the child maintenance service for £ despite have   successfully appeal the claim in he be now at risk of lose his professional status as a pharmacist because of this process will the minister encourage the cms to investigate that case urgently or to meet with i to discuss it 
 i be very sorry to hear about the plight of the hon member ’s constituent if she would like a meeting with i i be very happy to give she that and i be also happy to look into the matter as she suggest 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 previous change in eligibility for disability benefit have result in significant adverse health impact include an additional suicide in and more people with new onset mental health condition in what estimate have the government undertake of the impact on health of the universal credit and personal independence payment bill which be due to have its reading next week 
 i be look forward to answer question about these matter in front of the committee on wednesday morning we be work very closely with the department of health and social care to ensure that the health and care need of people who lose benefit as a result of this process be meet 
 do minister agree with the trussell trust ’s recent estimate that the weekly cost of basic essential be £ for a single person and £ for a couple 
 through the child poverty taskforce we have be look at the issue of income versus expenditure we be take step urgently where we be able but we will have more to say about that issue shortly 
 with permission i will make a statement on the israel iran conflict 
 since i last update the house the united states have strike iranian nuclear site at isfahan natanz and fordow defence secretary pete hegseth have say that the action be intentionally limit britain be not involve in the strike just as it be not involve in israel ’s operation but britain have long have concern about iran ’s nuclear programme iran can never have a nuclear weapon and the united states have now take action to alleviate that threat a nuclear armed iran would endanger the immediate region and threaten the global community 
 this be a perilous moment in the middle east wave of strike between israel and iran have last for day continue overnight i know that the whole house will have in their thought the many civilian impact by the fighting i can confirm today that they include british national injure in israel we have reach out to offer consular support 
 iran have consistently fail to reassure the world that it be not pursue a nuclear weapon the house will recall prime minister gordon brown call out iran for perpetrate serial deception over year after exposure of the fortified fordow nuclear site today iran ’s enriched uranium stockpile be time over the limit set by the joint comprehensive plan of action iran be enrich at while typically a commercial nuclear reactor such as the at sizewell operate with uranium enrich at between and iran lack any civilian justification for this level of nuclear activity and the international atomic energy agency ’s board of governor have declare iran to be in breach of its nuclear non proliferation obligation 
 as we respond to this fast move situation our priority remain the welfare of british national in iran and israel and of our staff on the ground our crisis team in london and the region have be work around the clock and israel have put restriction on its airspace since   friday june the british embassy in tel aviv and the british consulate in jerusalem be open all our diplomat remain in place support british national and we have bolster the embassy in tel aviv with a rapid deployment team from the uk 
 we have be work closely with the israeli authority to prepare flight to evacuate vulnerable british national and their dependant yesterday we launch a booking portal for british national today as soon as it be possible to enter israeli airspace i can confirm to the house that a royal air force a400 have fly in to tel aviv and take british national and their dependant to cyprus from where they will be bring home this evening further flight will follow in the come day security allow we will prioritise those with great need and contact those allocate a seat directly we will send update on future flight to all british national register with the foreign office and i encourage all british national still in israel and the occupy territory to register their presence so that they receive our update these british national should follow instruction from the israeli authority international land border crossing   to jordan and egypt be open and commercial flight continue from both those country consular team be on hand to assist british national who have cross the border 
 in iran airspace remain closed and there have be a near total internet shutdown due to the security situation we take the precautionary step last friday of temporarily withdraw our staff from iran the embassy be operate remotely though our ability to support british national still in iran be extremely limited the house will know that the foreign office have advise against travel to iran since those seek to cross iran ’s land border can contact the foreign commonwealth and development office for assistance include with additional paperwork 
 british national in the wide region should follow our travel advice closely follow a us security alert for its national in qatar out of an abundance of caution we now recommend that british national in qatar shelter in place until further notice 
 alongside our consular team our diplomat be fully engage in try to end this crisis we can and we must find a negotiate solution the window have narrow but the risk of further escalation be so great and the cost so considerable for britain and all in the region that this be the government ’s priority we do not yet know precisely how far the us strike have set back iran ’s nuclear programme but there remain the need for a durable diplomatic solution strike can not destroy the knowledge iran have acquire over several decade nor any regime ambition to deploy that knowledge to build a nuclear weapon that be why we have be work so intensively with the new us administration to reach a new agreement with iran 
 iran and president trump ’s envoy steve witkoff hold round of negotiation britain join france and germany in round of engagement with iran too even after the israeli strike i travel to washington and then geneva last week meet in the white house with secretary rubio and witkoff and then sit opposite iranian foreign minister araghchi in several hour of talk push for iran to accept the diplomatic off ramp directly after the us strike we have be at the heart of a collective drive with partner to get back to negotiation my right hon and learn friend the prime minister have speak to president trump i have speak to marco rubio and israeli foreign minister sa’ar we have both be in touch with european and middle eastern partner that be why i speak again to minister araghchi yesterday 
 my message for tehran be clear take the off ramp dial this thing down and negotiate with the united states seriously and immediately the alternative be an even more destructive and far reach conflict which could have unpredictable consequence 
 the situation present serious risk to british interest in the region follow the moving in of additional asset on a precautionary basis force protection be at its high level the house should be in no doubt we be prepared to defend our personnel our asset and those of our ally and partner we be closely monitor how energy market be respond to the conflict and we have be extremely clear with the iranians any action to blockade the strait of hormuz would be a monumental act of economic self harm make a diplomatic solution even hard 
 we be also maintain a sharp focus on other conflict in the region and foremost the catastrophic plight of gazans and the ongoing ordeal of the hostage and their loved one all fear that this war leave they forget today i meet eli sharabi hold in chain by iranian back terrorist who be release from hamas captivity only to discover that they have murder his family last week the israel defence forces recover the body of hostage as well as that of shai levinson an israeli with british family kill on   october which hamas have be cruelly keep from their love one half a palestinian civilian be face starvation and more than have reportedly be kill in recent week try to access food while gazan hospital have have to stop service that be vital for childbirth and emergency surgery this be appalling it be unacceptable and it must finally end the israeli government must lift aid restriction and hamas must release all the hostage an immediate ceasefire have never be more urgent 
 the consequence of the current situation be hard to predict history can offer we no guide after event that be unprecedented in the region the government have seek to react quickly to the twist and turn of recent week while maintain a focus on where british interest lie with a lasting end to iran ’s nuclear programme a de escalation of tension and security for our people across the region we will continue to persevere with diplomacy 
 i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 week ago the iaea produce a report that be damn of the iranian regime iran be not co operate and be breach its obligation it have more than kg of uranium enrich to far beyond any level need for a civilian nuclear programme and enough material to create at least nuclear device while its nuclear facility be bury deep underground to hide its programme and all this from a despotic authoritarian regime that repress and torture its own people be commit to the annihilation of israel the world ’s only jewish state be responsible for so much of the suffering in the region through its sponsorship of terrorist proxy be support putin in his illegal war against ukraine and be involve in plot and activity to undermine our national security here at home on a daily basis 
 it be for these reason and for many more that the iranian regime must never be allow to have nuclear weapon that be why we stand with those who be work to stop they the house will know that as his majesty 's opposition we will always put the defence and security of our country and why we will work constructively with the government to secure the protection of the british people and our national interest we will support the government when they be do the right thing but we will also question challenge and press minister to go far when we think that more need to be do to safeguard our interest and it be in that spirit of constructive scrutiny in the national interest that i put these question and point to the foreign secretary 
 british national and dual national continue to be strand in israel and the middle east owe to airspace closure i have write to the foreign secretary about this matter and note the progress be make with today ’s flight i thank the foreign office for the work that it have be do with many family with whom i have also be in touch who have be able to get on to that flight today can the foreign secretary tell we how many british national may need to be repatriate what resource be be deploy to support those effort be there enough capacity to match the number of people who need to leave and why do it seem that the us and other european country be ahead of we in their operational planning to bring back their citizen the foreign secretary have mention the us embassy ’s advice and he have give advice to british national in qatar today will there be any further notification for other british national in gulf co operation council state 
 secondly on iran ’s nuclear programme the foreign secretary could not say on radio this morning how effective the weekend ’s strike be i understand that it will take time to get information but if more strike to far degrade iran ’s nuclear capacity be plan will the government consider support they the government have not take a clear position on the action that the us and israel have take but we have see report of the apparent legal advice from the attorney general caution against uk involvement 
 while i appreciate that the foreign secretary can not comment on any legal advice do the government have a position on the lawfulness of the strike and do he welcome the end as well as the mean do he share my cynicism about iran ’s attempt to cloak itself in the un charter the same un charter that it have undermine for decade through its brutality can the foreign secretary confirm whether the us will be permit to take action from diego garcia should future strike on iran or action to defend israel be need or do the government think that there be legal barrier to the us do so 
 thirdly with heighten tension in the region can the foreign secretary give an update on what further step be be take to safeguard british military asset in the region and our partner from any unwise military action take by the iranian regime give the report over the weekend of a suspect iranian spy plot target our base in cyprus be we now step up effort to protect basis 
 fourthly what step be be take across government and with our police counter terrorism and security service to reassess the domestic threat level the foreign secretary can not go into operational detail so can he give an assurance that robust action and disruption to any potential iran back plot be under way 
 he rightly mention the issue of gaza and the fact that we absolutely must work together to ensure that humanitarian aid get to people who be desperately in need of it can the foreign secretary update we on what step he have take to engage with israel to get more aid into gaza and do he agree that iran must be weaken to end its ability to sponsor hamas and other terrorist in the region 
 i be very grateful for the co operative tone in which the right hon lady have make her remark quite rightly she have a number of question that i will   attempt to answer but let i begin by say that fundamentally we be in agreement that the regime in iran can never have a nuclear weapon and all our effort be design to ensure that that be the case the whole house will understand that this be not just about iran the region and global security we have to remain steadfast in our commitment not to see nuclear proliferation if iran get a nuclear weapon other in the region would clearly seek to follow it be therefore a sober commitment begin year ago that we must see to completion in relation to those ambition 
 the right hon lady ask about british national in israel just over british national have register their interest follow our appeal last week and judge by the pattern in previous crisis in israel and the region we estimate that between and of they will take up the offer of british assistance to leave as she know the airspace have be close so that offer until this point have be about get they to the border but i be very pleased that a flight have land and take off and we hope to work with the israeli government on further flight from the area my understanding be that the americans have put on a military plane from israel for its citizen but she will understand that the uniqueness of the relationship between the united states and israel facilitate that opening and i be very pleased we have be able to garner the same agreement with the israeli government this be an ongoing and fast move situation and she have hear what i have advise british national in qatar today of course we keep this under close review and there may need to be far update over the next few day 
 it be important that i be in washington dc to sit down with the us administration and in that meeting with marco rubio and steve witkoff last week it be very clear to i that all option be on the table and that president trump have those option in front of he i of course discuss with they in detail the trip i would be make to geneva alongside my french and german counterpart and the european high representative and they be keen and hopeful that it might be successful it be not successful but we continue to press the iranians to take the off ramp and get into negotiation with the united states and the e3 to ensure that they be in compliance 
 the right hon lady ask about the legal advice that must rightly be a matter for the us government in relation to their action i be pleased that she mention the ministerial code she will know that paragraph of the ministerial code prevent those of we in government and she have be in government in the past discuss legal advice so that government can operate in the appropriate way however i would say to she that this be not our action we have be clear that we be not involve she ask whether we have any request from the us government we do not get such a request but we be notify before the action take place 
 the right hon lady also ask about state threat and it be right to say that we have thwart such state threat in this country since she will know include from the fact that we put iran in the high tier for national interference that we take the threat from iran very seriously we be review the gap that jon hall   find in how we deal with state threat in our country and we will come forward with legislation in the come month 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 the only way to stop iran build a nuclear bomb be a deal but there can not be a deal without negotiation and there can not be negotiation without trust president trump tear up the nuclear deal and be now act alongside israel and its attack last week end the us iran negotiation for a new nuclear deal the war aim of this campaign be so unclear with an embolden netanyahu government call for regime change and president trump hint at it too in all those circumstance it be difficult to see how there can be negotiation base on trust do the foreign secretary agree that britain must continue to play a role in the negotiation even though they must seem an incredibly difficult and challenging prospect 
 i be very grateful to my right hon friend the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her question it go to the heart of where the uk should be at this time and that be at the centre of the diplomatic effort a diplomatic effort will be necessary at the end of this process because sadly once people have the ability to enrich uranium to that knowledge be not lose it be the step stone to an advanced weapon and therefore only a diplomatic solution and the correct framework can ensure that we keep the global community safe 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i too thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement 
 the liberal democrats share in the condemnation of an iranian regime that pose an existential threat to israel and have terrorise its own people as surely as it have citizen from other country around the world include the uk that be why we support the consensus in this house that iran can never be allow to have nuclear weapon 
 yet it be not clear that military action by israel and the us can provide the necessary long term lock on iran ’s nuclear ambition follow this weekend ’s strike it be report that iran will work at pace to develop weapon with what remain of its enrich uranium supply that should give pause to those on the conservative and reform benches who have breathlessly echo president trump ’s line that the strike have be an unrivalled success instead of bring security trump and netanyahu ’s unilateral action have increase uncertainty and the risk of a full scale regional war their belief that might be right both further erode the rule base international order and undermine the prospect of contain iran and other rogue state in the long term this be not the uk ’s interest 
 that be why liberal democrats have call consistently for the application of robust diplomacy support by international atomic energy agency monitoring and ground in international law as the only sustainable   way permanently to limit iran ’s nuclear ambition our immediate priority must now be to ensure the safety and support of british national in the region learn the lesson of unacceptable delay on previous occasion so why have it take over a week since the start of strike to begin repatriate britons from israel what more be be do to support those in the wide region who want to leave 
 the government have also remain silent on the legality of this conflict will the foreign secretary now commit to publish the attorney general ’s advice on whether any uk involvement in the conflict would constitute a breach of international law will he confirm that this house will be give a vote before any decision for the uk to enter this conflict 
 i agree with the hon gentleman and the thrust of his remark which be around the need for diplomacy at this time he be absolutely right about the malign intent of the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the iranian regime whose desire be to wipe israel off the map we must stand up to that pernicious ideology we be attempt to again de escalate i remind he that vice president vance say just yesterday that delay the development of a nuclear weapon be the goal he say we be at war with iran ’s nuclear programme we be not at war with the iranian people it be important for the hon gentleman to keep that in his mind ’s eye 
 the hon gentleman ask about british national he hear what i say about the airspace be close i be pleased that the flight have take off i remind he of successive un resolution i refer he in particular to resolution in relation to this long stand breach he ask about the legal advice he hear my comment on the legal advice we be not involve this be not our legal context he ask about publish the attorney general ’s legal advice that might have be appropriate if we be involve i do not think it be but we be not involve so there be no such advice to publish 
 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s call to move this to a negotiate solution and his focus on uk defence and security he be right that iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon however history also teach we on regime change that intervention aim at regime change in iraq libya and afghanistan have produce prolonged instability not just in the region but far wide what concrete lesson do he believe can be learn from this recent history in shape iran policy today 
 i be grateful to my hon friend but he will forgive i i be not go to enter into a history lesson from the dispatch box except to remind he that on sunday i achieve year as an elect parliamentarian during the course of that period there have of course be debate about regime change i also remind he that the us have be clear that its intention be to target the nuclear threat we should keep that in mind 
 will the foreign secretary now concede that the international community ’s unwillingness to take robust action through thing like the snapback mechanism and the jcpoa be part of the reason that israel feel the need to take the initial strike and america to do likewise i agree that diplomatic mean will ultimately be the only long term resolution   but that mean not just ask nicely for iran to put its nuclear weapon away but enforce that and ensure it do so through such mechanism will the foreign secretary ensure that if we be not go to be involve in military action i understand why we might not want to do that we will ensure that robust action be take and that it be underpin by measure that will force iran to do the right thing rather than just hop that it will do the right thing 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman i know he know how difficult it be to deal with iran he will remember that under the jcpoa iran be allow to enrich to today it be at the question be how could that possibly be for civilian use i challenge the iranian foreign minister on that on friday we have have round of negotiation with the iranians which begin under the right hon gentleman ’s government he be foreign secretary for a period of that iran have obfuscate and deceive the time now be to get real 
 will the foreign secretary assure the house that while we all want to see urgent de escalation the escalate conflict in iran will not take focus from the uk ’s effort to end the devastating war in gaza help the palestinian people free the hostage and lift restriction on humanitarian and medical aid 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question the loss of life over the past few day hundred of people who lose their life queue for food be appalling and should offend we all of course when i speak to israel ’s foreign minister yesterday i remind he once again of my deep concern over the new system that israel have put in place to deliver aid and of our belief that that system can not and will not work and that we need to return to a much well provision 
 the foreign secretary have say that iran must not be allow to have a nuclear weapon do he therefore support the recent target strike by the united states and israel on iranian nuclear facility yes or no if not can he explain how exactly that inaction would have curtail iran ’s nuclear ambition 
 i be afraid i be not able to give an assessment of the effectiveness of that action at this stage and neither be the united states the hon lady may think that that be a binary question but i do not believe it be what the uk be engage in be diplomacy and we be work of course with our close ally the united states 
 i associate myself with the foreign secretary ’s condemnation of the humanitarian crisis in gaza but we need to match that condemnation with accountability here in the uk jewish community in particular be deeply concerned about what lie ahead last week the iranian ambassador acknowledge before the foreign affairs committee that mi5 have identify threat on british soil that have be organise by the iranian regime what be the foreign secretary ’s message to jewish community who be in a state of high alert at the moment wonder what will happen 
 my hon friend be right that the iranian regime be the world ’s bad sponsor of state terrorism and state threat we have individual who be arrest under the national security act move through our judicial system i want to reassure those in the jewish community in our country that we take those threat very seriously and i and the home secretary will do all we can to keep they their building their institution and their family safe 
 as usual i agree with much of what the foreign secretary have to say but i have to ask he this how many time must a terrorist funding fanatical regime threaten to wipe another country from the face of the earth before a government advise by lord hermer of chagos acknowledge that military action to delay and degrade its nuclear weapon programme be both ethically and legally justifiable 
 i simply say to the right hon gentleman with all respect that there be a convention in our country about the very important role that attorneys general play in our government they be able to give the government advice when ask for it that happen under all government i do not really recognise the caricature that i have hear or some of the report i want to make it crystal clear that we be not involve in this action and therefore some of what be be say be wholly beyond the pale 
 many constituent contact i over the weekend fearful of the fallout from us intervention in iran they know and we know that war do not make the world a safe place but make it much more dangerous their concern be not unwarranted in netanyahu offer a guarantee that regime change in iraq would bring enormous positive reverberation to the region we now know that there be no imminent threat and no evidence of weapon the scale of the disaster not just in iraq but across the region be so profound that the chilcot inquiry insist that any future military intervention must be meet with rigorous scrutiny do the foreign secretary accept the need for such scrutiny and will he reassure the house again that we will not enter an endless war fuel by reckless provocateur 
 i be in the house during the period in which chilcot be do his work and i reassure my hon friend that our government and i hope all future uk governments have learn from its finding 
 the foreign secretary have confirm that britain be not involve in the strike on iran will he also confirm whether the us administration seek permission to use diego garcia as the launch point for the strike if permission be seek and deny on what basis do the prime minister deny permission if it be not seek what do it say about the uk us relationship that america would rather fly around the world from missouri than launch from diego garcia 
 they do not seek that advice 
 i thank the foreign secretary for his measured approach to this crisis in past round of violence iran have often lean on its proxy to conduct retaliation they include the houthis   of yemen who until recently have be attack uk and international shipping in the red sea what step be the foreign secretary take to protect uk shipping in that area and to keep safe the trade route that be so vital for our country 
 iran ’s proxy include hezbollah and hamas have be considerably degrade over this period the houthis have be hold back but be still active in the red sea we will do all we can work with partner to protect our shipping route we have be crystal clear to the iranian regime about the strait of hormuz in particular 
 the foreign affairs committee meet the iranian ambassador twice last week and he claim that iran ’s nuclear programme be legal and purely civil and he say that they want to negotiate can the foreign secretary say on the basis of the numerous meeting with the iranian foreign minister that he have report whether he gain any impression of iran ’s willingness either to dismantle its nuclear programme or to negotiate 
 that be the central question what i have find be inflexibility as well as a failure to face the seriousness with which the international community be look at this question and to accept both that we have move on from the joint comprehensive plan of action which the iranians pull out of back in and that the focus now be on enrichment maybe they can have a civil nuclear capability but it would have to be heavily monitor and would need some sort of international regime in locus with it they have to face that seriousness now at this point
