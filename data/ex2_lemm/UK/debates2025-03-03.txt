 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she plan to take to ensure that new housing development have adequate access to primary health service 
 what step she plan to take to ensure that new housing development have adequate access to primary health service 
 through the revise national planning policy framework this government have strengthen the exist system of developer contribution to ensure that new development provide the necessary infrastructure that community expect and deserve include health service we will robustly hold developer to account for deliver on their obligation and we will support local planning authority to do so 
 westvale park in my constituency be a new housing development of home its resident have be wait year for a gp surgery and the exist gps can not expand their capacity will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can ensure that westvale park get the gp surgery it have be promise as well as the other associate infrastructure and primary healthcare service for new development across my constituency 
 i sympathise with the hon gentleman which be why this government have say that infrastructure must come as part of our home the housing minister will be happy to meet he 
 cornish house price far exceed local wage and in area such as rock and st minver of house be home meanwhile more than home be set to be build in town such as bodmin by but the only gp surgery building be currently run at capacity despite a new building have be promise for year will the secretary of state please ensure that national planning guidance mandate that primary care and education infrastructure be put in place before development be start prevent developer from later break their promise 
 again i sympathise with the hon gentleman as i have say this government be absolutely committed to ensure that we get that infrastructure and that development be a truly plan lead system the policy framework be mean to do that and we intend to consult on future policy change include a set of national policy for decision making this spring 
 last week the government produce new guidance about build on green belt site particularly the golden rule about have sufficient infrastructure in place for health education and transport at the request of the planning inspectorate sheffield now have to provide site in the green belt to hit its housing target will the secretary of state make arrangement for the housing minister to meet the leader   of the council and local mp to discuss how those arrangement can be deliver and liaise with her colleague in other department to ensure that the resource be available to enable that to happen 
 i can do well than that the housing minister be go on thursday 
 when new housing be build in mickleover under the last government resident be promise time and again that they would get a new gp surgery but it never happen what can this government do to ensure that when new home be build resident have the gp access they need 
 again i totally sympathise i think this be why people have resist some of these planning application a lot of the time that be why our government be absolutely committed to ensure through the revise national planning policy framework that infrastructure include gp surgery be available when new housing be build 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we know that through the section agreement progress the planning system be very good at levy fund for new nhs facility but nhs property services have not always be effective at build those facility out on time what assurance can the secretary of state give the house that across government there will be an appropriate focus on ensure that nhs property services deliver the facility that planning have secure 
 the shadow minister be absolutely right it be his government who do not do enough in this area we have say that we will strengthen section planning obligation and we have also set up a unit within my department to ensure that we hold developer to account and work across government to ensure that infrastructure be build 
 whether the number of house recommend by the new town taskforce will be in addition to the housing target set in the national policy planning framework 
 not least because we will only begin construction of the next generation of new town towards the end of this parliament the government have be clear that they will deliver over and above the target produce by the standard method we will of course keep under review how the taskforce ’ forthcoming recommendation on new town interact with housing target across england 
 community in mid bedfordshire have always do their bit to take new housing but continue pressure to build be chip away at our beautiful countryside and the historical character of our town and village will the minister assure community such as mine that the new town taskforce can not hit we with a double whammy of house building 
 the independent expert taskforce chair by sir michael lyons will be submit its final report to we in the summer and as such we have absolutely no idea which location it will recommend to ministers for decision we have be clear as i have say that our ambition be that new town will contribute over and above the target produce by the standard method but obviously we want to make sure that the right incentive be in place to support proactive local authority such as his come forward with these large scale new community 
 we know that future generation of old people be unlikely to have have generous pension or even to have be homeowner during their work life will the minister therefore confirm whether housing target will include specific reference to old people ’s housing and the grow need for age appropriate accommodation 
 i would say thing to my hon friend the old people ’s housing taskforce recently report and we be weigh up its recommendation we have also make clear through the national planning policy framework that we expect local authority to take into account the type of tenure and home that they need for their local area and local plan be the primary way that different type of housing for different demographic demographic should be bring forward 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for transport on the penistone   line   project 
 our department be in regular dialogue with the department for transport and with regional mayor on how good to support local transport infrastructure investment include the penistone line project with our decision to finally grasp the nettle and support a mass transit system this government be now provide unprecedented level of investment for the region 
 the penistone line connect kirklees barnsley and sheffield single track section constrain capacity and present reliability issue on the day that the previous conservative government announce that network north money would be spend on pothole in london out of service run over a hour period be cancel on the penistone line do the minister agree that the propose improvement will boost connectivity economic growth education and healthcare will the minister meet i and my colleague to discuss advance this project 
 i thank my hon friend for raise these important point i totally agree with he that improve connectivity be essential for place to thrive and that be a point that mayor tracy brabin make to i frequently i can happily say that the case for west yorkshire be hear loud and clear i would of course be happy to hold such a meeting 
 what her plan be for levelling up project 
 despite the difficult fiscal context at the autumn budget we provide stability for legacy levelling up project now call local growth funding prioritise expenditure on the programme that most directly support the mission that this government be elect on the government will set out our long term vision for local growth at the upcoming spending review 
 the provisional local government finance settlement for introduce change to the previous methodology for the then levelling up funding for categorise area of priority need the rural services network have highlight concern and disparity that shift funding away from rural and coastal community to urban area can the minister assure the house that any new funding formula will adequately address the unique challenge of rural and coastal community will he commit to publish the criterion by which future levelling up funding decision will be make 
 we have be clear that for local growth funding we want to move away from the old model of competitive funding pot and beauty parade which be short term and base on central criterion i can assure the hon lady that the model that people get from this government will be long term will be allocative will have more flexibility and will have more local leadership and it will of course be target at those community that need it the most 
 may i thank the secretary of state for visit preston last week to attend this year ’s convention of the north it be a fantastic event and reinvigorate the case for northern investment to be a key determinant in government decision in that vein can the minister outline what conversation be be hold with departmental colleague to ensure that the opportunity of invest in the north be fully realise and understand 
 i know that my right hon friend the secretary of state enjoy her visit our ministry be clear that although we have a crucial role to play in devolution it be a whole government venture we be have frequent conversation with colleague about how to crowd in the important policy intervention they be make to ensure that our community across the country have the tool and resource they need to shape their place 
 what step she be take to help tackle increase in leaseholder cost 
 the government recognise the considerable financial strain that opaque and unfair fee and charge be place on leaseholder across the country as my   hon friend will know on   november   last year i make a write ministerial statement set out the step the government intend to take to provide leaseholder with great right power and protection over their home by implement those reform to the leasehold system already in statute we will also progress the wide set of reform necessary to end the feudal leasehold system for good 
 i welcome this labour government get a grip on the feudal racket that enslave leaseholder to ever rise management fee and ground rent make it impossible to pay and impossible to move will the minister provide transitional arrangement to cap those cost while ensure that all new development even development that be soon to enter the planning stage such as the at york central can make the transition to commonhold as soon as the law change 
 the government have no plan to cap service charge for tenant and leaseholder give that would prevent necessary fund from be raise for legitimate purpose but we do plan to tackle unregulate unaffordable ground rent provision through legislation as the white paper publish today make clear we want to make the process of convert to commonhold as easy as possible and we will set out proposal in the draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill which be to be publish later this year 
 i welcome the government ’s announcement today of change to leasehold and the introduction of commonhold but thousand of leaseholder across the country be still cripple by both high service charge and fail delivery i be sure that the inboxe of member across the house be full of complaint from constituent particularly in relation to firstport management company what can the government do to hold individual management company accountable for the service they deliver to our resident 
 as the hon gentleman will know we intend to bring into force this year the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act which be design to drive up the transparency of service charge so that leaseholder can challenge they more easily if they consider they to be unreasonable we intend to strengthen the regulation of manage agent impose minimum standard in relation to for example qualification i would say to any manage agent and i know that member across the house have be hold they to account that they should improve their performance in the light of the change come forward in the near future 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i thank the minister for his comment over the weekend we really do need to ensure that we ban new leasehold but as he know leaseholder have be promise this many a time before and many will be go to sleep tonight with only a little sigh of relief because those bill will continue to come the minister mention the white paper can he tell we what the status of exist leaseholder will be when the measure to end leasehold be finally introduce 
 let i explain as simply as i can what we want to do as the white paper make clear we will ban the sale of new leasehold flat so that commonhold become the default tenure and we will ensure that the process of conversion be as simple as possible so that those leaseholder in exist leasehold block who want to make that change can do so as simply as possible but we have to ensure that those who do not want to make that change have the power right and protection in relation to their home that will give they the immediate relief that my hon friend talk about 
 what step be the government take to help those leaseholder with double ground rent who now feel trapped and unable to remortgage or sell their property without meet the massive cost of change their lease which as i know from personal experience can amount to figure sum 
 i well recognise the problem as the hon gentleman will probably know historically ground rent be nominal sum often peppercorn sum but over the past year we have see a very different system develop we have make a commitment which we will honour to take action on unregulated and unaffordable ground rent through legislation and we will provide further detail in due course 
 what discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on level of non domestic rate for pub 
 give the importance of business rate to both local government finance and local community and particularly to our high street our departments engage regularly on these matter pub be eligible for the retail hospitality and leisure relief scheme and in the financial year pub will benefit from a relief on their bill up to a cash cap of £ for the government intend to introduce a permanently low rate for qualify retail hospitality and leisure business include pub those rate will be set by the chancellor in the autumn statement 
 the high pub in the yorkshire wold the wolds inn at huggate be a great success story mr speaker i would be delighted to buy you a pint there the next time you find yourself on the right side of the pennines but like many pub in my constituency it face a crippling rise in non domestic rate at a time when margin be very tight local pub be not just business but much love community asset so will the minister reverse this tax grab and start support the great british local 
 if i return as a missionary i will bear that in mind 
 well if it be intend to be a tax grab on pub we be not do a very good job of it because when the permanent scheme come in of pub that   be under the £ threshold will benefit from it we absolutely recognise the importance of our community pub in prop up the community and give they place to meet and to the economy and the good job that they provide 
 the armfield club in my constituency be a fantastic local boozer that be run by and be create by blackpool fc supporter venue such as the armfield be the beat heart of our town provide job and bring local community together what step will the minister take to ensure a bright and sustainable future for club such as the armfield 
 i thank my hon friend for the work that he be do to champion pub in his constituency like all of we he recognise just how important they be to the economy and probably even more so to local community the government can do a lot on business rate and on thing like the community right to buy which give the community the right to step in when pub might face closure as part of the package 
 whether she have have discussion with the secretary of state for scotland on the arbroath town plan 
 my official and i continue to work with our counterpart include in the scotland office and colleague in the devolved government to develop and deliver the reform long term plan for town i be delighted to visit arbroath early this year i be blow away by the quality of its consultation and the boldness of its plan and i commend the leadership of peter stirling and the rest of the town board 
 may i put on record my thank to the minister for visit arbroath it be good of he to do that and i join he in congratulate peter stirling and member of the arbroath town board we have see how hard work they be and the way the community really get behind the project i put on record my thank to everybody in the town who have take part and to my hon friend   the member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan   for his work on it will the minister work with the treasury to ensure that there be maximum flexibility for local community in arbroath and elsewhere in the uk to ensure that we can bring these project to full fruition 
 that be a very important point we want to keep the promise make to the people of arbroath which be why i be very pleased that we have be able to do so through the long term plan for town go forward as i have say to other colleague we want to see a long term more allocative settlement that be drive by local people as i stand in the church hall with board after board after board of feedback from local resident about what they want to see it only firm my resolve that they should be in charge rather than we i come away with arbroath smokie they be always worth a visit as well but i be very impressed with what the town board be do 
 whether she be take step to support landlord in upgrade housing stock to reach an epc rating of c. 
 this government be commit to tackle fuel poverty and deliver warm cheap home for tenant we be currently consult on increase minimum energy efficiency standard in the private rent sector and continue to support landlord to meet the new standard through consultation 
 i understand the answer that the minister just give but when individual private landlord with just or property be come to my surgery to say they will simply sell up and remove those property from the private rent sector because they can not afford to bring property up to epc c when the national trust be leave property in the village of bradenham completely empty because it can not afford to bring those rural home up to epc c and when the charity abbeyfield have close its princes risborough property because it could not afford to bring it up to epc c displace elderly and vulnerable resident do the minister agree that if the government be to bring in new regulation it be equally incumbent on they to help provide funding 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question raise standard in the private rented sector could lift up to people out of fuel poverty there be a number of scheme to support landlord to improve their property and they can look at their eligibility through gov.uk in particular there be scheme such as the boiler upgrade scheme which offer £ off the cost of heat pump we look forward to work in partnership with the sector because we recognise that it be an important sector 
 some of household in england over people be officially in fuel poverty do the minister agree that the last conservative government do not just fail to meet their housing target but leave a legacy of high household bill 
 i thank my hon friend for the question we have inherit a massive challenge and we be work at pace to tackle these issue so that people can live safely and securely in their home and do not face such high cost 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my hon friend   the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith   have highlight simply put people out of their home be not a solution to fuel poverty give that the figure very clearly show that the cost of the upgrade in many case massively exceed the financial benefit to either the tenant or the landlord can the minister give the house her personal assurance that this objective be realistic and achievable 
 we recognise that it be important to get the balance right the renters rights bill will put in place new regulation to protect tenant and as i have say there be scheme to support landlord who need support investment in a property be an important part of ownership and improvement can lead to increase in property value and in the attractiveness of let to tenant 
 what step she be take to build more social housing 
 what step she be take to build more social housing in kent 
 what step she be take to build more social housing 
 the government be commit to deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation in our month in office we have announce £ in new funding for the affordable home programme this top up will support the delivery of up to new home with more than half be social rent home we will set out detail of new investment to succeed the to-2026 programme at the spending review 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer what measure will his department consider to support council that find themselves in viability negotiation with developer who sometimes push down the quota of social home and indeed affordable home 
 i be aware of several scheme in my hon friend ’s constituency that be have viability issue financial support be indeed available while the £ of new in year funding for the affordable home programme announce at the budget be already oversubscribe as a result of significant demand from housing provider across the country the further allocation of £ which we announce last month will help ensure that more social and affordable home be deliver in the case that my hon friend describe i would encourage both his local authority and local social housing provider to bid for that money 
 i recently visit aylesham village with persimmon homes in my constituency and i be delighted to see the number of solar panel on roof across the estate what be this government do to ensure that for new build include social housing new build we deliver solar panel on every roof high level of insulation and charge point on driveway 
 the previous government to their credit introduce change to the building regulation that come into force in june and under those standard new home be be build with high quality insulation and electric vehicle charging point those standard also encourage the use of solar panel or other form of low carbon technology such as heat pump   this government intend to amend building regulation later this year as part of the introduction of future standard that will set more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home 
 the most recent data show that nearly people be stick in temporary accommodation in wales unable to move on from homelessness due to a shortage of social housing and unaffordable private rent give the escalate need for affordable housing across the uk what conversation have the department have with the welsh government to urgently address this crisis and collaborate on quickly increase the availability of social home 
 i understand well the pressure in wales that my hon friend describe so eloquently we know that increase the supply of social home be a cornerstone of the welsh government ’s plan to prevent housing problem and homelessness we speak regularly with our colleague in the welsh government and we will continue to work closely with they on our share objective of get more social home build by council and housing association 
 build more social housing and affordable housing be a principal promise make by leicestershire county council in the proposal for the lutterworth east development that development be subject to a call in so i do not want to go into any detail but i want to ask the minister this very basic question if a senior civil servant in the department give a commitment to an mp to encourage that mp to drop an amendment to legislation can the mp rely on the assurance give by that senior civil servant 
 i note the question the hon member ask we be grateful to all the civil servant who serve the government for act with integrity the civil service code be clear that civil servant must act truthfully and can not deceive or knowingly mislead ministers or parliament if the hon gentleman have serious issue that he wish to raise regard civil servant he can do so with the department ’s permanent secretary 
 chichester ’s planning policy dictate that of all home in new development should be social and affordable housing however we have recently notice a worrying trend of register provider refuse to take on contract in small and medium sized development and favour large development that be put a lot of the social housing in chichester at risk what be the minister do to ensure that register provider continue to take on small contract in mixed use development 
 we know that register provider be face real challenge when it come to their capacity or headroom to take on additional section unit the hon lady may be aware that we set up through homes england a clearing service to try to well match developer with unit that be not be pick up we be give lot more thought to what can be do in this area and i be more than happy to speak to she about the option available to the government 
 the building of more council house throughout the uk be welcome news especially in ashfield where we have people on the waiting list do the minister agree that when we be dish these house out british bear hard work taxpayer should be prioritise 
 i would say to the hon gentleman that they already be there be very strict requirement in place when it come to the allocation of social housing as i be sure he know well local criterion can be impose i be not sure that his council have they in place in term of the amount of time someone need to be resident in an area before they qualify for social rent housing 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 every day another family contact my office because they be homeless and they be place in a hostel with no function kitchen and no private bathroom mile away from their child ’s school i be sure that other hon member can say the same what be bad be that the placement cost council at least time as much as permanent social home so call affordable home be of no use to these family at all at the same time new home be be reject by register housing provider because the standard be not high enough what be the government do to progress the future home standard so that the home be build be not reject by register home provider who say that the home be not good enough for they and will have to be retrofit 
 i understand the point the hon lady be make i refer she to my previous answer the government intend to bring forward through change to building regulation future standard that will increase the energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement on new build home that will give housing association in particular that have get ahead of the change and standard the comfort that they need to start adopt those unit 
 what step she be take to help ensure that level of funding to local government be sufficient to fund public service 
 what step her department be take to ensure area with high level of deprivation receive adequate funding 
 we of course recognise the challenge that local authority face as demand increase for critical service that be why the final settlement for make available over £ for local government in england a cash increase of in core spending power on the most relatively deprive area of england will receive more per dwelling than the least deprive of course spend decision beyond this year be a matter for the upcoming spending review 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response he will be aware that since the conservatives take control of cornwall council year ago they have transform that authority from be financially sound to star down the barrel of bankruptcy cornwall be a rural authority with urban level of deprivation and a super ageing population what assurance can the minister give that through the funding formula and plan for local authority the government will have due regard to the escalate cost for these local authority not least as a result of the national insurance contribution hike 
 the hon gentleman and all member of the house have our absolute commitment that when we revise the funding formula we will ensure that it take into account all the matter he mention the multi year settlement be intend to give stability we have to make sure that council be on their foot at the end of that we recognise entirely that deprivation be a driver of cost but so be the cost of rural service delivery 
 the most deprived locality in england and of the most deprive locality under kent county council be in my constituency yet the council struggle to understand the level of deprivation and to adequately resource those locality can the minister assure my constituent that devolution and reorganisation of local government in kent will ensure that their need be not ignore like this in the future 
 i will not comment on individual council other than to say that this be why local government reorganisation be so important in too many part of england the tier system be not work for local people the tier premium mean that a tier system be a more expensive way of deliver public service and most member of the public have no idea which council be responsible for deliver which service it be therefore right that we go through this reform my hon friend be absolutely right to say that in the end thing have to work for local people all the matter that he cover be on our mind 
 we come to the shadow secretary of state 
 the minister mention local government reorganisation on   february the deputy prime minister state 
 we be postpone election for year from may to may 2026”—[official report   february vol c. 
 but on   february the minister in a write parliamentary question say that 
 new unitary government will be establish or go live in 
 or will the minister confirm that these election be not be postpone and that they be in fact be cancel for up to year mean that councillor will serve term of up to year will he also confirm that the deputy prime minister may have unintentionally mislead the house and will he correct the record 
 i can start by confirm that the deputy prime minister do not mislead the house the opposition would do well not to muddy the water   they know well than anybody what local government reorganisation mean over the past few year when they be in government they postpone set of election to allow reorganisation to take place although election be be postpone in council set of election will still take place this year let we not allow this to be whip up into something that it be not 
 we absolutely want to move at pace on reorganisation we want to see proposal develop and present early the soon the well so that we can move to those shadow authority and so that local people can elect the new body that will deliver public service in their area and be accountable to they to be clear nobody will benefit not the leader of conservative council who have ask for postponement nor member of the public if we make the matter more confused than it need to be 
 what step she be take to help ensure that local authority planning process include fire safety assessment 
 building regulation set fire safety standard for new development and building regulation and planning be of course a devolved matter in england developer submit planning application for high rise residential development be require to submit along with their planning application a fire statement set out fire safety consideration and the local planning authority must also consult the health and safety executive 
 an architect constituent of mine alert i to his concern about camden council ’s approach to fire safety in an application to construct a guest underground hotel at the planning stage the london fire brigade express serious concern that the propose safety feature would be difficult to maintain and dangerous be they to fail a freedom of information request reveal that the london fire brigade ’s fire safety compliance team feel that their concern be ignore by camden council at planning will the minister commit to review regulation to see whether they be sufficient to ensure that local authority in england properly attend to serious concern raise by local fire brigade 
 i be not sure that i can comment on the application the hon gentleman be talk about as it will of course have be subject to the planning process as establish in law however i can say that of the change that the deputy prime minister make early on in our time in government be to ensure that approve document b can be update quickly and in real time so that if issue be highlight the regulation can keep up and building can be keep safe 
 last week labour councillor in york deliver the local plan be you ready for this mr speaker?—since for which they should be commend but local authority need planning officer if they be to ensure that application   can be process quickly will the minister update the house on plan to increase the number of planning officer 
 i fondly remember at least i think i do our consideration of the levelling up and regeneration act interruption   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith   remember it too at every sitting of the public bill committee my hon friend   the member for york central rachael maskell   say that york have never produce a plan so i be overjoy when i hear from the leader of york council this morning that it have have that success of course make these thing real involve really good planner which be why we be pleased to have make a furth £ available for planning capacity 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we note that the government have choose not to take forward the grenfell report recommendation relate to certification body on material safety give the previous minister ’s failure to reply to my question on the new use of european standard in respect of fire performance will the new minister assure the house that we can be absolutely confident that the fire safety performance regulation in place be clear robust and effective 
 they will be all those thing i believe that be a share goal for clarity we be take forward the recommendation as we state last week we do not think that the testing house ought to be under the purview of a single construction regulator as that would mean that the regulator would essentially mark its own homework if there be a problem i know opposition members have a problem with this and i be more than happy to speak about it in great detail 
 we be look very closely at european standard as the hon gentleman will have see in the construction products reform green paper alignment with those european standard be probably a desirable goal but that be subject to the ongoing consultation we be very clear that the current regime do not cover enough construction product there be not enough transparency or accountability when thing go wrong our desire as have be express from the dispatch box be for a very high standard regime and i look forward to work with opposition members in service of that share goal 
 what step she be take to support council with town centre regeneration project 
 we all want to see our town centre thrive and it be of those thing that constituent raise with all of we that be why we be delighted that at the budget the chancellor confirm that the long term plan will be retain and reform the plan be work with town across the uk provide each with £ to support their   regeneration of course this come on top of the innovation of high street rental auction and the forthcoming community right to buy 
 i thank the minister for his answer i be proud to have half of morden town centre in my constituency morden be an area ripe for rejuvenation it have fantastic transport link but like many town centre across the country it be struggle as labour councillor recently note in the council chamber despite year of promise to regenerate morden labour run merton council have fail to deliver just last week it again put off do anything this time until at least will the minister meet i to discuss why the council have fail to begin rejuvenation over the last year and to discuss what support the government can   now give 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s invitation which of course i will take up the experience that he talk about be not uncommon in the rest of the country certainly over the last year there have be very little progress i know that merton council for example be invest some £ in brighten and refresh morden town centre but i know the council like the hon gentleman want to see more do i will be happy to sit down to talk to he about that 
 i warmly welcome today ’s announcement of £ in community regeneration partnership money for rochdale this money will far revitalise our town centre and the area around our train station as well as expand our brilliant hopwood hall college do this prove what can happen when we have a labour government work with a labour council and a labour mp to revive an area 
 it absolutely do my hon friend have be dog almost to the point of well i will not say to what point on secure money for rochdale i know this money will make a real difference despite this be yet another thing that be not fund by the previous government we be delighted to have be able to secure this funding which i know will have a great impact i look forward to visit 
 whether her department be take step to ensure housing target account for protect landscape 
 the government be commit to maintain strong protection for our protect landscape we be clear that the scale and extent of development within such designate area should be limited so that we be able to pass on their attraction and important biodiversity to future generation national planning policy be clear that significant development within a national landscape should be refuse other than in exceptional circumstance where it can be demonstrate that the development be in the public interest 
 west dorset desperately need new housing that be actually affordable for local people especially key worker and young family look to   get on the housing ladder but of west dorset fall within a protect national landscape formerly an area of outstanding natural beauty rigid housing target could lead to inappropriate development that undermine the character of this protect area what discussion have the department have with local authority in dorset on adjust housing target to reflect the constraint of the national landscape and our rural infrastructure challenge 
 local authority use the standard method to assess housing need but they can show evidence of any hard constraint in their area include protect landscape those will be assess by the planning inspectorate to judge whether the plan be sound we be clear that local authority should explore all option to deliver the home that their community need include maximise the use of brownfield land work with neighbouring authority and where appropriate review their green belt 
 what step she be take to help people impact by ews1 fire safety certificate issue by tri fire 
 if she will take step to support resident impact by market disruption due to incorrect building safety documentation 
 the external wall system form be a tool develop by mortgage lender to inform valuation and be not a fire safety certificate we be work very closely with the industry to encourage they to take a proportional approach to form issue by tri fire lender who have sign the industry planning statement should accept alternative evidence as part of mortgage application but if an individual have concern about the fire safety of their building they should contact the person responsible for it 
 i be grateful for that answer but in an answer to a write parliamentary question last week the minister suggest that if a leaseholder can not use an ews1 fire safety certificate to progress the sale and purchase of their home they should use the fire risk assessment however in many case include in my constituency both the ews1 form and the fire risk assessment be most likely invalid if not fraudulent in those circumstance what measure can be take to prioritise fire risk assessment for those leaseholder what can be do to protect leaseholder from the additional cost of conduct another fire safety assessment after the that they conduct in good faith 
 if the building be in of the government back scheme such as the cladding safety scheme the fire risk assessment will have be quality assure by the government which will provide assurance if it be cover by the developer contract it will have be audit by the department so that ought to give cover as well if neither of those thing be the case i be more   than happy to talk to the hon lady about how to give resident surety so that they can evidence to lender that their building be safe 
 hon member across the house have raise concern about the now expel fire safety engineer adam kiziak follow investigation into allege signature fraud include in my constituency of surrey heath from what i understand a fire engineer adair lewis have now disown a further tri fire ews1 form that he allege falsely bear his signature will the secretary of state join i in request an urgent police investigation into these fraud allegation do she agree that her department must urgently reassess building that have be survey by tri fire to protect resident from further uncertainty and market disruption 
 i stress that the ews1 form be an industry form rather than a fire safety if those building be in a government scheme any fire risk assessment will have be quality assured if they be in the developer contract those scheme have be audit as well which should give cover i would not want to speak about individual case at the dispatch box we believe that the quality of those assessment must be sacrosanct and they must be do in good faith that be why as part of our response to the grenfell inquiry we have make significant commitment on standard in this area 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility

 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that issue we acknowledge that there have be criticism of some home deliver through permit development right particularly those that enable commercial building such as office and shop to change use to residential and the government be commit to keep development right under review 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 help to buy help young time buyer and the stamp duty discount help time buyer get on the housing ladder with discount of up to £ both be now scrap be the secretary of state pull up the housing ladder behind she 
 it be staggering that the shadow secretary of state say that give that so many people now can not get housing because his government fail to meet their housing target we will have a mortgage guarantee scheme and we will build home so that young people and other people can get the house that they deserve 
 i will try again the government ’s manifesto promise to preserve the green belt then grey belt come along which be suppose to be a few garage forecourt now it turn out that grey belt will mean square mile of green belt the size of surrey be to be build on be this simply another broken promise 
 i will also try again under the tories the number of home approve on greenfield land increase nearly tenfold since labour will be strategic in grey belt release and we will have a brownfield policy 
 many family in my constituency live in new housing estate where the developer have make their profit sail off into the sunset and leave the road and service in an unacceptable state and unadopted what step might the government be able to take to push local authority like northumberland county council into action to accept their responsibility and adopt those estate 
 i well recognise the situation that my hon friend describe but i also recognise the reluctance of local authority to take on substandard housing estate that have be build we have decide to consult this year on option to reduce the prevalence of private management of estate of the kind he describe we will also importantly implement new consumer protection for homeowner on private estate in the leasehold and freehold reform act 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 homelessness stat publish last week show that rough sleeping have increase for the year in a row and be now high than in yet the vagrancy act have not be repeal and rough sleeping be still a criminal offence in july the minister be ask for a progress report and advise that consideration of relevant legislation be need but it be now more than year since parliament vote to repeal the act will she now give we a date when that will come into force 
 we be take urgent action to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping and have announce £ to tackle winter pressure we will update the house on progress in repeal the vagrancy act in due course 
 in scotland child be currently homeless and record level of child be in temporary accommodation the number of social house build by housing association in scotland be at its low level since margaret thatcher do the minister agree that the snp have take scotland in the wrong direction and that instead we need to see the bold action take by this uk labour government to build more home replicate in scotland with a scottish labour government in 
 i agree with my hon friend last year as the housing emergency take hold the snp government cut £ from the affordable housing budget it be only as a result of labour ’s record budget settlement that they be force to reverse those cut but they be still not show the adequate ambition that we need the snp government must set out a real plan to reform planning and boost house building to meet their affordable housing target 
 in response to the minimum energy efficiency standard consultation for privately rent home landlord group be say that they would pass the cost of energy efficiency work on to tenant despite that be the cost of bring their property up to basic minimum standard rely on council guidance that that should not happen be too weak what additional measure will the minister take to enforce that and ensure that it be private tenant who be already at the great risk of fuel poverty who will benefit and not landlord 
 i refer the hon member to my early answer to that precise question the renters rights bill will protect tenant from have cost pass on to they 
 many of my constituent face extortionate hike in service charge while get little in return with repair not be carry out poor service and a lack of transparency and accountability from their manage agent firstport can the minister outline what the government be do to bring an end to the scandalous fleecehold system that be rip off leaseholder across the country 
 to add to the response i give early we intend to take action to provide leaseholder with the transparency of standardised service charge invoice so that they can well challenge unreasonable rent hike we also need to strengthen the regulation of manage agent include those such as firstport that as be clear from the feeling in the house be not perform the necessary service for their resident 
 welcome though the hundred of million of pound extra for adult social care in the budget be can the secretary of state confirm that the cost of rise in national insurance contribution and the minimum wage will run into the billion and that local authority will in fact be bad off than they be prior to the budget in tackle social care can she confirm that yes or no 
 that be exactly the reason that there be £ of new money for adult social care in the budget 
 eden portland be an exciting proposal for my community and much like the eden project in cornwall and morecambe it would be a hub for education and ecology if deliver it would boost investment and create well pay job i know that minister agree that this could be a real success story so will they meet i and the team at eden portland alongside colleague from the department for culture media and sport and the council to discuss how we can deliver this exciting project 
 i welcome the exciting eden portland proposal and i enjoy meet my hon friend to hear far from he it   be clear that it would be great for the area ’s economic regeneration for tourism in the region and for support great understanding of biodiversity loss colleague at dcms be work closely with the proposer and with official in my department but i would be happy to involve myself in whatever way be useful 
 the planning proposal for laindon road and mountnessing road in billericay and for noak bridge be previously reject because of the green belt aspect but be now be reconsider under grey belt will the minister urgently meet i the billericay action group and some of the local councillor to look at the issue around where grey belt be perhaps not be use in the way the government originally intend 
 local authority can be clear about how grey belt should be use because we release planning policy guidance last week to give they a well sense of where it be appropriate to be release and be bring forward for development 
 far too many renter get a terrible deal live in cold mouldy substandard home and be charge eye water rent by landlord i be proud of this government ’s renters rights bill but while legislation be welcome too many be still pay extortionate price for really shoddy property can the secretary of state assure i that the government be take more step to make renting affordable again 
 i assure my hon friend of that fact and we be also succeed where the previous government fail in that we be finally abolish section no fault eviction the renters rights bill will empower tenant to challenge unreasonable within tenancy rent increase we also need to boost supply which be why we set the hugely ambitious milestone as part of our plan for change of build safe and decent home in this parliament 
 in the lake district and the dale of cumbria average house price be around time average household income will the minister try to tackle this issue by   make sure that there be a specific and unappealable designation of social housing only development that national park authority and local council can enforce 
 we want to see far great use of rural exception site in particular and i be more than happy to sit down with the hon gentleman i think we have already plan to do so to discuss short term let as well as this issue 
 i have recently receive a number of complaint from my constituent about leasehold manage agent these include unacceptably long delay for repair 
 order it be totally unfair when a member be speak to block the vision of the chair 
 these include unacceptably long delay for repair and exorbitant cost at greenmount court in smithills despite spiral fee poor transparency and little to no communication from the agent what step be the minister take to deliver a fair deal for exist leaseholder and to hold poorly perform manage agent to account 
 we need to balance speed with care because we will not make the mistake that the previous government do and pass flawed legislation that require we to fix it therefore delay reform for leaseholder we will as soon as possible introduce the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act which will allow we as i say to bring in transparency around service charge to allow leaseholder to well challenge unreasonable increase and we intend to strengthen the regulation of manage agent 
 on   february the court a grade ii list landmark in chorleywood in my constituency burn down in mysterious circumstance i meet the local councillor councillors cooper hearn and reed on friday to discuss the matter i be not ask the secretary of state to comment on this specific case but will she confirm that where list building be destroy without permission there should be a presumption that they be rebuild brick by brick to how they be before the destruction 
 i be sorry to hear about that particular case and i be happy to meet the hon member to get the detail absolutely list building be an important part of our landscape 
 at nearly every single of my advice surgery leaseholder in stratford and bow have tell i appal story of disrepair high service charge and no accountability from management agent after year of broken promise of reform by the conservative government i be pleased about today ’s announcement on leasehold reform for new build but will the minister assure my constituent about what concrete action will be take for exist leaseholder 
 the publication of the commonhold white paper today mark the beginning of the end of the feudal leasehold system we will succeed where the previous government fail and   bring that system to an end but we be determined to provide immediate relief for leaseholder suffer from unreasonable and unfair charge at present 
 i rise to gently follow up on a critical request for urgent help that i make in november in september kirklees council temporarily close dewsbury sport centre for safety reason due to reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete the centre remain closed until   november   when the council unilaterally decide to permanently close the centre without investigation i raise the issue   with the secretary of state for dcms and have write to the prime minister and the chancellor for assistance will the deputy prime minister facilitate an update for i on the issue 
 the hon member make an important point around safety and raac in our public building we be absolutely committed to do all we can despite the legacy give to we by the previous government i will ensure that he get a meeting with the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris 
 less than a week since i call on this house to show the courage of our predecessor we see clearly before we the test of our time a crossroad in our history with permission mr speaker i will update the house on my effort to secure a strong just and last peace follow russia ’s vile invasion of ukraine 
 it begin in this house where on tuesday i announce the big sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war a recognition of the fact that once again we live in an era where peace in europe depend upon strength and deterrence but also a rediscovery of the old post war argument long hold on these benches that economic security be national security because the demand we now have to make of britain must come alongside a new foundation of security for work people 
 the tough choice that we make last week be not do we must use the process of get to of our national income spend on defence to fundamentally rebuild british industry and use our investment in military spending to create new job and apprenticeship in every part of the country that be why last night i announce a deal that perfectly symbolise the new era a partnership with ukraine that allow they to use £ of uk export finance to buy air defence missile manufacture in belfast that mean uk job uk skill and uk finance pull together for our national interest put ukraine in the strong possible position for peace and protect innocent civilian from the terror of russian drone 
 my effort continue on thursday when i meet president trump in the white house to strengthen our relationship with america now what happen in his subsequent meeting with president zelensky be something nobody in this house want to see but i do want to be crystal clear we must strengthen our relationship with america for our security for our technology and for our trade and investment they be and always will be indispensable and we will never choose between either side of the atlantic in fact if anything the past week have show that that idea be totally unserious while some people may enjoy the simplicity of take a side this week have show with total clarity that the us be vital in secure the peace we all want to see in ukraine 
 i welcome the opportunity for a new economic deal with the us confirm by the president last week because it be an opportunity that i be determined to pursue i welcome the positive discussion that we have on european security include his clear support for article of nato i welcome the understanding from our dialogue that our nation will work together on security arrangement for a last peace in ukraine i also welcome the president ’s continued commitment to that peace which nobody in this house should doubt for a be sincere 
 i now turn to the event of this weekend and the move scene that greet president zelensky as he arrive in london on saturday i see for myself that he be take aback when the crowd in whitehall cheer at the top of their voice they be speak for the whole of our country a reminder that this government   this house and this nation stand in unwavere support behind he and the people of ukraine we resolve together to move forward the strong cause of a just and last peace in ukraine 
 then on sunday i host european leader from across our continent equally committed to this cause include president macron prime minister meloni the leader of nato of the european commission and of the european council and the prime minister of canada a vital ally of this country the commonwealth and ukraine responsible for train over ukrainian troop i also have the privilege beforehand of speak online to the leader of estonia lithuania and latvia each of whom close as they be to the frontline with russia stress the urgency of the moment 
 it be a productive summit together we agree a clear strategy that the united kingdom france and our ally will work closely with ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting which we will then discuss directly with the united states it be a plan with clear principle which i will now share in full with the house we must keep the military aid to ukraine flow and keep increase the economic pressure on russia to that end alongside our partnership on air defence we be double down on military aid already this year we have take our support to record level on saturday we also agree a new £ loan for ukraine back not by the british taxpayer but by the profit from frozen russian asset we agree that any last peace must guarantee the sovereignty and security of ukraine and that ukraine must be at the table when negotiate their future that be absolutely vital we agree that in the event of a peace deal we will continue to boost ukraine ’s defence and ukraine ’s deterrence finally we agree to develop a coalition of the willing ready to defend a deal in ukraine and guarantee the peace 
 after all the ukrainian position be completely understandable for they the war do not begin year ago that be merely the late and most brutal escalation they have sign agreement with putin before they have experience the nature of his diplomacy and the calibre of his word we can not accept a weak deal like minsk again no we must proceed with strength and that do now require urgently a coalition of the willing we agree on sunday that those willing to play a role in this will intensify planning now and as this house would expect britain will play a lead role with if necessary and together with other boot on the ground and plane in the air it be right that europe do the heavy lifting to support peace on our continent but to succeed this effort must also have strong us backing 
 i want to assure the house that i take none of this lightly i have visit british troop in estonia and no aspect of my role weigh more heavily than the deployment of british troop in the service of defence and security in europe yet i do feel very strongly that the future of ukraine be vital for our national security russia be a menace in our water and sky they have launch cyber attack on our nhs and make assassination attempt in our street in this house we stand by ukraine because it be the right thing to do but we also stand by they because it be in our interest to do so if we do not achieve a last peace the instability and insecurity that have hit the living standard of work people in britain will only get bad and putin ’s appetite for conflict and chaos will only grow 
 a strong peace a just peace and a last peace that have now to be our goal it be vital it be in our interest and in its pursuit britain will lead from the front for the security of our continent the security of our country and the security of the british people we must now win the peace i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement and for our conversation early today the united kingdom be a free democratic and sovereign country we recognise that ukraine be fight for her survival and fighting to have the same freedom democracy and sovereignty that all of we here enjoy that be why both the opposition and the government be fully commit to support ukraine and president zelensky i be also glad to see his majesty the king welcome president zelensky at sandringham as i say at the weekend president zelensky be a hero he be a symbol of the bravery of the ukrainian people 
 there be of course many area where the prime minister and i disagree but now be the time for we to discuss where we do agree i welcome all his action this weekend to convene european leader as well as the focus on economic security use uk export finance to support british job 
 as the prime minister know we welcome the uplift in defence spending to of gdp by and we support the use of foreign aid to achieve that we welcome a commitment to reach in the year ahead and we will support he in take difficult spending decision include on welfare we will return to the detail of how the government will fund this in the near future but for now it be right that the prime minister be work with ally in europe and with the united states to bring peace to ukraine and not a surrender to russia 
 as part of that the prime minister have suggest that british troop could be deploy in ukraine there be obviously a range of possible option for what such a deployment could look like and we be keen to work with the government but we will need detail of any such plan this will be a difficult but significant step i know many in parliament and across our country will be interested in what this entail and i ask he to work with we so there can be effective scrutiny i also welcome the coalition of the willing to support ukraine and agree that europe must do the heavy lifting will the prime minister update we on what european and other ally be willing to offer towards this coalition 
 i welcome the use of the proceed from frozen russian asset to support ukraine do the prime minister have plan to go far and use the frozen asset themselves will he provide an update on the government ’s sanction on russian link individual and confirmation that such sanction would not be lift in the event of a ceasefire will he update we on the step that he and other ally be take to ensure that ukraine be at the negotiating table for any peace plan what do he think can be do to heal the rift with washington 
 as the prime minister reference in his speech the minsk agreement of fail to stop russian aggression and ultimately do not return ukraine ’s territorial integrity his principle be that any last peace guarantee the sovereignty of ukraine so how will the prime minister work to ensure we avoid a repeat of the minsk agreement how can we ensure that any peace fully protect ukrainian sovereignty 
 at time like these it be so important that we stand together to defend share value and the fundamental basic principle that aggressor should not win the prime minister will have our support to do that and to ensure that we continue to uphold the value that all of we in this parliament hold dear 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for her message and for our discussion this morning and i thank she for her support for the measure that we be take it matter across this house that we be unite on this issue it matter to the ukrainians and to president zelensky i can tell the right hon lady that he be move by the reception that he get in our country on saturday and i feel very proud to be british on saturday when our country speak with voice the right hon lady reflect that through the unity that have be show from member from across the house and i thank for that 
 the right hon lady ask about the detail of any deployment we will of course put detail before the house when we get to that stage if we get to that stage as i mention in our phone call this morning i will ensure she get whatever briefing she need to be able to look at the detail before it be put before the house so she be fully inform 
 on the question of other ally we have a long meeting yesterday with a number of ally my strong view be that we have to move forward and lead from the front and therefore we need a coalition of the willing otherwise we will move at the speed of the most reluctant which will be too slow a number of country and ally indicate their support they will set that out in due course i will not pretend that every country be in the same place on this issue that be why i and other take the view that we should take a lead position and move forward but i will give further detail as they become available 
 on the question of the frozen asset the proceed the profit be be use in the way that the house understand in accordance with the statement i have just make on use the asset themselves it be a very complicated issue and not straightforward but we need to do and we be do more work to look at the possibility along with other country but i be not go to pretend that that be simple or straightforward 
 on the sanction we introduce last week the heavy sanction that we have put in place and the right hon lady be quite right that they must not be lift just because there be a cessation in the fighting they must be keep in place as a vital part of our armoury something that do not happen with minsk she be quite right to say that we have to avoid the mistake of the past which be why a security guarantee be so important a guarantee that we should lead but which need us backing if it be to act as a proper guarantee of course she be right to say that ukraine must be at the table in any discussion about the future of ukraine and i think that be a common position across the house 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 we all watch with alarm and distress the scene from the white house on friday but equally across the country we be extremely grateful that we have a prime minister who have such a pitch perfect response at the weekend as he work towards a just peace for ukraine he have the support of the whole country in do so 
 here be the question the prime minister say on sunday with laura kuenssberg that follow the cut to the aid budget he would go through line by line to ensure that the priority of ukraine sudan and gaza be all prioritise in a lasting peace the difficulty be that after refugee cost admin cost and the department ’s commitment to thing like the world bank and the un be take into account it be hard to believe that there will be enough leave in the budget to provide meaningful humanitarian support in those priority area do the prime minister understand the concern of so many that these cut could in fact in the long term hobble the very leadership that he have show this weekend which have finally give the world some hope 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question it be a very important issue what i do last week be to announce the big sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war and the circumstance and the context require it that decision have to be make and i be determined that it would be fully fund so the house could see where the money would come from 
 on the question of overseas aid i be committed to it what we will now do be go through line by line the funding and look at our priority of course ukraine sudan and gaza be right up there in our priority but i also want to work with other and across the house if we can on other way of raise money and finance for development and aid overseas i see the president of the world bank on friday to have that very discussion i want to have it and i mention it in my discussion with other country this weekend many of which want to join in attempt to find other way to leverage money particularly from the private sector where state can not do it in the way that they might want to just at the moment that be the approach we will take 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement we be all horrify by friday ’s scene in the oval office president trump ’s attack on the brave and dignified president zelensky leave everyone shocked and appal except it seem   the hon member for clacton nigel farage nobody else watch those scene could fail to understand that we have enter a new era in which the united states prefer to align itself with tyrant like putin rather than its democratic partner 
 on these benches we have support the prime minister ’s action and leadership britain lead the world as we have so many time in the past bring together europe and canada in london to work towards a just peace that guarantee ukraine ’s sovereignty and security but we need to reduce our dependency on the   united states with deep regret i fear that president trump be not a reliable ally in respect of russia in that regard do the prime minister discuss with our european ally our proposal for a new rearmament bank and for seize the ten of billion of pound worth of russian asset to support ukraine in his conversation with the canadian prime minister be he clear that we stand with our commonwealth ally in the face of president trump ’s threat 
 many of we be confuse by lord mandelson ’s comment yesterday so can the prime minister confirm that they do not represent government policy do he agree that the british ambassador should not be freelance on american tv 
 the prime minister will have our support if the uk continue to lead with our european and commonwealth ally for ukraine ’s defence and our collective security 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question he talk about the scene on friday afternoon nobody want to see that my response be to recognise the urgency of the need to repair the breach which be why i speak to president trump and president zelensky on friday night and again on saturday night i be continue in that work because for i the single most important thing be last peace in europe and ukraine nothing be go to deter i from that or cause i to lose my focus on it 
 on the dependency on the us i do not agree with the right hon gentleman the us and the uk have the close of relationship our defence security and intelligence be completely intertwine no country be as close as our country and at a time like this it would be a huge mistake to suggest that any weakening of that link be the way forward for security and defence in europe 
 on the question of a rearmament bank yes i do think we should continue discussion with other as to what the possibility could be that form some of the discussion yesterday with our ally on asset again the right hon gentleman know that the situation be complicated but there be ongoing discussion i speak at length with the canadian prime minister yesterday because we have a bilateral meeting as well as the meeting with other colleague in that meeting i be able to assure he of our strong support for canada which be a close ally of our and a strong supporter of ukraine canada have lead the way on the training that have be so vital to ukraine so it be very welcome at the table yesterday 
 in relation to the ambassador ’s comment the plan be clear we be work particularly with the french i have extensive conversation with president macron over the past week and intensively over the weekend and talk to ukraine as well those conversation be go on at the moment and the intention be to then have discussion with the united states in relation to that plan as soon as the detail be available i will share they with the house but they be still be work on at the moment there be no guarantee of success but i be not go to let up until we have do everything we can to ensure peace in europe and peace for ukraine 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement the warmth of his welcome and hug for president zelensky and his show of leadership on defence and security matter in our continent as he host his sunday summit of leader in london can my right hon and learn friend assure the house that in our pursuit of a just last peace he will do his level well to convince president trump to provide security guarantee for ukraine and to convince those nato ally that be not spend of gdp on defence to step up to the plate and do much more 
 i be of course talk to president trump about security guarantee that form a large part of our discussion on thursday and our subsequent discussion i think it be right that europe do the forward lean on this we have to do more on security guarantee but those guarantee need a us backing and that be the very discussion that i be have 
 on the question of spending across europe in this era we now have to step up on capability co ordination and spending that do form part of our discussion yesterday 
 i find myself in the strange and rather uncomfortable position of very much agree with the prime minister on everything he have say today while i often take great delight in criticism of the government the prime minister do not really put a foot wrong this weekend 
 however he do need to go far the small increase in defence spending that he announce be welcome but fundamentally we need a gear shift on this i echo the point make by my right hon friend the leader of the opposition that when and it will be when not if he have to make some really difficult decision about balance defence spending against domestic expenditure we will not try to play politic we will support he because we need to send a message now to our friend in ukraine and to potential aggressor around the world that we take our defence the defence of our value and the defence of our friend seriously 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for the unity across the house and he be absolutely right it send a message to those who want to challenge our value when they see this house united whether on ukraine or defence spending we have to face this era with confidence and with unity across this house wherever we can it have be good to have he agree with i we should do this more often 
 i thank the prime minister for the leadership he have show in pull together all our ally yesterday in london and for acknowledge the bravery and sacrifice of the people of ukraine i be in ukraine last week i meet the mayor of kharkiv a frontline city of people undergo daily attack and blackout from russian force he tell i that a power project fund by the united states agency for international development have be cancel at short notice it would have generate mw shore up their energy pipeline where other    have step back will we step forward and support such project use either russian asset or our own aid budget 
 power supply be hugely important in ukraine let we face it power and energy have be weaponise by putin that be why he be attack the power supply to community across ukraine we will work with ukraine to ensure that its people have the security and power supply they need as we go forward 
 i call the father of the house 
 our enemy should know that our prime minister have support from we i notice in moscow that they be refer to the small size of the british army perhaps the prime minister could remind they of what the kaiser say in about the contemptible little british army will the prime minister tell president putin and other tyrant that our army the most professional in the world be quite capable of give as good as it get to continue the historical allusion as in if we do stand up to the mark with the french it be good to have a security guarantee from the americans 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his unity because that be really important i think i speak for the whole house in say that we be very proud of our armed force in everything that they do they be at the leading edge they be play a key part in ukraine and they will continue to play a key part in the security and defence of europe 
 i congratulate the prime minister on bring european leader together at the weekend and on set the record straight with   j. d. vance on the issue of free speech president zelensky be resilient and brave just like the nation that he represent in the week of the war when i go to ukraine with my medical team we could see at hand that there be absolutely nothing that the russians will not do will the prime minister promise that our support will not waver and that he will continue work closely with our european ally to make sure that we bring about peace in ukraine 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance we will not waver we will work with our ally 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement express the united kingdom ’s unequivocal support for president zelensky and ukraine in view of the prime minister ’s cut to the aid budget and with the eye of the world focus on zelensky ukraine and russia can he please reassure the house that he will not forget about the middle east and in particular the decision by netanyahu ’s government to block aid to gaza what representation be he make on behalf of the government to reverse that it be a breach of international law 
 let i be really clear the decision to block aid go into gaza be completely wrong and should not be support in this house on the contrary more desperately need aid should be go into gaza at speed and at volume and we be make those representation 
 i congratulate the prime minister on his strong leadership in his response to the fast move event of the weekend will he recommit to increase international aid spending to when the fiscal circumstance allow 
 yes i want to restore aid and development funding as soon as fiscal event allow it be a principle i believe in and i be proud of what we have do in the meantime i want to explore which other lever we can use to increase aid and development without necessarily increase the spend within the government budget 
 there be many issue on which the prime minister and i will passionately disagree but when it come to the security of ukraine and support for president zelensky we be of course united i too commend the prime minister for his announcement yesterday and on his partnership during the summit with our european and indeed our canadian ally unfortunately it have be report this afternoon that president trump be set to meet american aide to discuss withdraw military aid to ukraine be those report something that the prime minister recognise and if so what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and president macron be currently work 
 i have not see report of the united states withdraw support for ukraine and as i understand it that be not its position i thank the right hon gentleman for his support on this issue although i be somewhat concerned that the scottish national party be continue its suggestion that now be the time to abandon the nuclear deterrent if ever there be a time to reaffirm support for a nuclear deterrent it be now we must not reduce our security and defence the snp ’s decision be completely wrong headed and it should reconsider 
 the prime minister ’s action this week demonstrate again why uk leadership in defence and security and on ukraine be crucial i also agree with he that it be important to strengthen our relationship with the united states in the come month will he consider whether we should be propose to hit spending before the next election we need to do what it take 
 i set out our position last week which be that spending will be by and in the next parliament as fiscal circumstance allow 
 the prime minister should surely be commend both for the meeting that he hold in the white house last week and for the effective leadership that he show over the weekend will he bear in mind as he seek to forge this coalition of the willing with urgency and vigour that the gdp of russia be some $ while the gdp of the european member of nato that be the most committed be more than time that at $ that should surely add to the effectiveness of the deterrent and the work that he be now do with european ally 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that point we must not lose sight of the fact that the russian economy be be damage by the measure that we be take collectively particularly on sanction   and we should have self confidence in the ability of europe to pull together whether that be on military or financial issue for the collective security of the defence of europe we have say many time that europe need to step up now be the time to step up now be the time to lead that be why i be pleased that in the last few day we move thing on a little in that regard 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement and for his continue strong leadership in contribute troop drone and munition russia ’s ally remain active participant in russia ’s illegal war in ukraine will the prime minister please assure the house that alongside our ally we be closely monitor russia ’s strategic partner during the ongoing peace effort 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we continue to do that we need to bear down on russia and all those who support russia in this illegal war 
 we welcome the increase in defence spending but when i serve there be more than troop and today there be just over it be essential that we reverse the conservative irresponsible troop cut will the prime minister commit to reverse this devastating cut so that the uk can credibly support collective european security in the absence of us support 
 we will be undertake a strategic review of our capability gauge it against our challenge and obviously i will put the result before the house in due course i would just caution against the suggestion in the part of the hon lady ’s question if i have get it right that somehow we should take this as a moment to go it alone without the us i fundamentally disagree i think that would be wrong we have never choose that course in our history and we should not choose it now 
 i thank the prime minister for today ’s statement and for his diplomatic effort to restore our international reputation since take office will my right hon friend confirm the basic principle that no decision can be make about the future of ukraine without include its elect leadership in the negotiation and that any ceasefire must be adhere to by russian aggressor and not just the ukrainians 
 i agree on both proposition ukraine need to be at the table there have to be security guarantee because we know from history that putin do not honour agreement that do not have security guarantee that be precisely why we need 
 i echo the thank to the prime minister for his leadership over recent day he have definitely speak for britain when he have speak on the world stage may i ask he to join i in thank the parliamentary staffer who while he be do that be drive aid to ukraine 
 quite rightly the prime minister have bring together a coalition of european and nato partner be he work on those far afield as he know very well   australia have already donate bushmasters and many be concern about iran ’s support for the russians through its shahed drone programme be he reach out to our middle eastern ally as well 
 i thank the parliamentary staffer who have do such significant and important work on the right hon gentleman ’s important question about reach out beyond europe i agree with he and we be do that this need to be as broad a coalition as we can put together with different capability each country should make whichever contribution be the most significant from its point of view and i thank he for his support over the weekend 
 the prime minister deserve plaudit for the skilful way in which he handle his visit to washington last week as he do for the resolve that he have show in stand against russia ’s illegal invasion of the sovereign state of ukraine surely though this be a moment to accept that the post war international settlement have now be fractured and that the necessary rise in defence spending should be achieve by change the fiscal rule not by cut to international aid which will only see more people slay by famine drought disaster and war 
 the reason why we will not change the fiscal rule be that we need economic stability we experience economic instability only a few year ago under liz truss the loss to our aid budget and all budget would be far more profound if we go back to instability and i be not prepared to do it 
 it may be a great irony that a remainer prime minister use our brexit freedom as effectively as he do yesterday indeed as no brief we be now in a unique position compare with the rest of europe and yesterday be a triumph i also applaud he for say such positive word about president trump and our relationship with america even if nobody behind he agree 
 but here be the key president zelensky have now accept that he will sign the mineral agreement with america america be go to put in £ or whatever it be and thousand of americans will be in ukraine be that in itself enough of a security guarantee or do it mean that we need to send british troop if we do and give the size of our army how many 
 the mineral deal be not enough on its own may i just remind the hon gentleman that russia be the aggressor and zelensky be a war leader whose country have be invade we should all be support he and not fawn over putin 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement and i congratulate he on the excellent leadership that he have show on the international stage do he agree that in order to achieve any last peace in ukraine russia must return the child it have steal from ukraine 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue because it be absolutely crucial it be a moral outrage that those child have be take and of course we must ensure their safe return that have to be part of any discussion but she be quite right to raise it we should do so more often 
 the leader of the opposition have quite rightly and properly show her support for the prime minister ’s position and i hope he will take comfort from the fact that he have the support of at least these back benches as well those of we who have have dealing with the russians in my case that be through the council of europe know only too well that putin ’s administration can not be trust and that security guarantee be therefore absolutely vital if we be to succeed in get a peace agreement not a surrender a surrender would lead to inevitable further activity in georgia and moldova and then possibly in the baltic state as well be that not right
