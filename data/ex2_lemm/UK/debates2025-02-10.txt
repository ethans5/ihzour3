i rise in support of this important bill which be a crucial step as this government regain control of our border after the conservative party lose control 
 my constituency be a diverse and welcome place we have a long and proud history of migrant from around the world come to work and contribute to our community and we have a proud history of welcome refugee flee persecution and abuse that compassion be part of who we be as a country but our compassion must always come alongside control and a system that be fair that be why my constituent be right to be angry about illegal crossing when the last government lose control of our border it risk life and undermine our national security and mean that people could cheat the system it also mean that million of pound be be spend unnecessarily while our public service be on their knee enough be enough this government be determined to secure our border 
 whereas the conservative party choose the path of sound tough but fail to deliver since the election this government have roll up their sleeve whereas the conservative party pick fight with france we have make landmark deal with international partner whereas the conservative party spend nearly £ a day on hotel for asylum seeker we have restart process to save the taxpayer £ a year over the   next year and to end the use of hotel whereas the conservative party spend year pursue the fiction of the rwanda scheme to send a sum total of volunteer on our watch charter flight have return migrant across the world enforce return be up by on the year before the election and our street have be make safe through the removal of foreign criminal 
 the bill before we do really important thing it remove from the statute book the fallacy of the rwanda scheme the so call deterrent that see people cross the channel between the day it be announce and the day it be scrap secondly the bill remove a hodgepodge of unenacted and unworkable clause whose sole purpose in law be to act as a monument to conservative failure 
 most importantly this bill deliver a range of counter terror style power that i believe will enable we systematically to dismantle the vile criminal gang who facilitate small boat crossing and risk life it introduce new offence so that we can use every tool possible to put gang leader away new power to seize device check biometric and share datum and a new role for our new border security command so that we can ensure that all agency work together no more empty rhetoric instead a common sense intelligence lead approach to border security we be take down the gang and build the international relationship that we need to regain control we have turbocharge our asylum system so that we can return people with no right to be here and allow those grant asylum the chance to work and contribute a real plan no more empty rhetoric from the conservatives or reform these be concrete step to secure our border and i will be proud to vote for reading today 
 i be grateful for the hon member ’s question it be a good we be see more risk pose to our critical underwater infrastructure by player who wish harm to our national security we already have brilliant capability in raf proteus which be able to support our infrastructure and that of our ally   when the strategic defence review be publish in the spring i be sure that there will be more development in that direction 
 i thank and pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton who bring the debate to the house this evening all hon member will agree that her passion and commitment to her constituency and this subject shine through i can only say what an absolute honour it be to visit her constituency to discuss the work of the north birmingham economic recovery board i will come shortly to the situation in birmingham and the approach that my hon friend recommend that the government take i hope that her remark at the end of her speech on the purpose of politic and the role we all must play in give everybody a chance and an opportunity in our society would be support across the house but she make the case well for that approach 
 and so to birmingham this debate be important for many reason not least because some part of our country suffer much bad than other with poor employment outcome the government be commit to move towards our goal of an employment rate though some place in our country be already there unfortunately that be not the case in birmingham where the employment rate be around just that be not acceptable because when some part of our country fall behind economically it be bad for those place and bad for all of we because it mean that some people in our country can not play their full role in our economic growth 
 economic inactivity be also high than the average and that be why our reform plan take a different approach we be no long do the same thing everywhere but try to tailor and personalise our employment support to where people be and what they need 
 britain have a long and proud tradition of provide asylum to those flee war and persecution and that patriotic principle must always remain however we must be honest too many people be arrive in our country with no legal right to be here and they must be return far still they must be prevent from enter our country altogether the number be too high they must come down 
 the alternative be unacceptable town such as hartlepool be target by private provider of asylum accommodation because of our low housing cost those provider be profit from this crisis and put a burden on hartlepool ’s public service local school hospital and social service be force to absorb the consequence of a broken system that be the reality that we face and it must change the bill signal the government ’s intention to do just that instead of open border we will have a border security command instead of a soft touch we will have record deportation instead of expensive gimmick we will have far reach new power that will put the boot of the state on the throat of the criminal gang whose trade let we not forget be the trafficking of human being the bill be about restore control and take decisive action to fix the system 
 hartlepool people be open generous and welcoming i have personally see their fundamental decency on display in community across our town include at the salaam community centre on murray street where nancy pout and her amazing team take to the street after last summer ’s right and alongside volunteer and council worker clean up the devastation leave by mindless thug they symbolise fundamental hartlepool value 
 those value include fairness which be why i believe that transparency in these matter be essential home office figure provide to i by the house of commons library show that as of september hartlepool be support asylum seeker per people the neighbour large local authority be host just   per there be local authority up and down this county for which the figure be that can not be right after year of austerity for our public service it must not be the most deprived area of our country that carry the big burden 
 when the break clause in the asylum accommodation contract come up in i urge minister to use they and spread the burden fairly as we fix the system and bring the number down this be about take back control of our asylum and immigration system not through slogan and broken promise but through real enforceable action the people of hartlepool and community across the uk deserve nothing less 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what his plan be for the disposal of hms albion and hms bulwark 
 neither hms albion nor hms bulwark be due to go to sea ahead of their out of service date in and the royal navy be explore option to sell both hms albion and hms bulwark in a government to government sale several potential customer have show interest but no final decision have be make 
 give that hms albion and hms bulwark be reportedly be sell to another navy for a figure that could well undervalue previous spend on refit and maintenance how do the minister justify the economic impact of their sale on plymouth and devonport dockyard let alone the reduction in amphibious capability in the navy when the promise multi role support ship be at least half a decade away from service 
 i do not recognise any of the figure that have be bandy around in the newspaper it would not be accurate to take they as anything other than speculation the disposal show that we be deliver for defence by divest ourselves of old capability to make way for the future as the sea lord admiral ben key put it those ship be effectively mothball by the previous government so i will not take any lesson from conservative member on how to deal with these matter 
 in which financial year he plan to spend of gdp on defence 
 in which financial year he plan to spend of gdp on defence 
 the government be elect on a firm commitment to set a path to increase defence spending to of gdp the prime minister have say that we will do so in the spring 
 so that my constituent can well understand the government ’s priority which do the minister think that we will achieve a deal to lease diego garcia for billion of pound or spend of gdp on defence 
 everyone agree that we must increase defence spending to meet the increase threat this government be deliver for defence by increase defence spending and we have already increase defence spending by almost £ next year 
 it be clear that we face increasingly volatile and dangerous global security challenge which be why the previous government set a path to of gdp be spend on defence by what conversation have the minister and official at the ministry of defence have with nato counterpart particularly from the united states on increase defence spending what implication do he think his party ’s lack of timeline for reach will have on the special relationship give the new us administration 
 this country be at the forefront of defence spending in nato and we be ready to increase it to of gdp the hon lady talk about the previous government ’s plan for of gdp i have to tell she that that be an election gimmick announce week before the prime minister call the election the institute for fiscal studies describe it as misleading and the institute for government describe it as a work of fiction 
 this labour government have give our armed service their big pay rise in almost year i have speak to service personnel in my constituency and those who be part of the armed force parliamentary scheme they talk about pay but they also talk about service condition and support for their family be key driver of retention what be the government do on those matter 
 i be proud to be the defence secretary who have be able this year to give the armed force the large pay rise in over year i be proud to have be able to do the deal that have see force family home bring back into public control so that we can develop they for the future this government will reset the nation ’s contract with those who serve and the family who support they 
 in my time in the army i see at hand bloke not get the kit and equipment that they need to operate efficiently it anger i to read this weekend that the previous administration waste £ on mcclaren mudflap will the secretary of state promise i that he will not take the—[interruption 
 order shadow secretary of state you will have the floor after the next question but i have not call you yet come on mr stone 
 to return to my question i anger i that the previous administration waste £ when bloke like i do not have the kit and equipment that they need to operate—[interruption that be a fact will the secretary of state promise i that he will put service personnel and our nation ’s security 
 order i think you need an adjournment debate 
 my hon friend speak from experience in the rifles and he be completely right the issue be not just how much we spend but how we spend it the government be deliver for defence by get a grip of defence budget tackle ministry of defence waste and invest in the kit that our frontline service people need we scrap   the £ vip helicopter deal we have end the pointless race car sponsorship and we have save £ from an out of control consultancy spend 
 when the uk persuade nato to spend of gdp on defence in just other country do so now country do do the secretary of state agree that it be time once again for the uk to play a leadership role in europe by persuade nato to spend the money it should and keep america part of the alliance 
 i do indeed it be time for the uk and european ally to step up and do more of the heavy lifting that include increase defence spending so that we can meet the threat that we face and as i have discuss with the new defence secretary in the us boost our defence industry on both side of the atlantic 
 in the light of the grow threat face our united kingdom it be genuinely shocking to read at the weekend that conservative defence ministers spend taxpayer money sponsor a race car my constituent in paisley and renfrewshire south be livid about the waste of their taxpayer money can the secretary of state reassure my constituent that he will continue his action to root out every aspect of wasteful spending in the ministry of defence 
 i can indeed we have to get a grip of out of control defence waste and out of control defence budget i be pleased to have be able to put an end to that pointless race car deal which deliver free race day ticket and mod sponsor branded mudflap instead of the kit that our frontline troop need of course the shadow defence secretary   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge be the minister responsible for that deal he agree the contract and tell the house that it be a brilliant partnership 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 you will know mr speaker the importance of secure communication and this be defence question so before i ask my question may i say that conservative members be send all the ministry of defence ’s answer to our oral question in advance i do not know whether we should be grateful or concerned we have be forewarn 
 i think that ministers think up the answer themselves you have shock i 
 i think that it would benefit the house to know that give the importance of secure communication i turn to my question which involve secure communication it say everything about the government ’s priority that they be delay increase defence spending to but accelerate their terrible chagos deal at a cost of up to £ last week the prime minister justify the deal by state that without it 
 the base can not operate in practical term as it should 
 no later brief that that be a reference to satellite link be the secretary of state seriously suggest that there be an operational threat to us and uk military satellite communication at diego garcia 
 this be a question about defence spending we have a cast iron commitment to increase defence spending to of gdp a level that the uk have not spend on defence since under the last labour government on the chagos deal this be a military base that be vital to our national security the prime minister be right to say that its legal certainty have be call into doubt that be bad for our national security and a gift to our adversary that be why we look for a deal that would safeguard the operation for at least the next century 
 when the prime minister say that the base can not operate he be refer to operation that imply that there must be some kind of direct threat to satellite communication on diego garcia the world will have see that the secretary of state have not defend that position he be not lean into it in any way which make we think this give that the former foreign secretary lord cameron and the previous defence secretary grant shapps see the same intelligence and reject the deal which have since get bad and more expensive be not the obvious thing to scrap it and to spend every penny that be save on our armed force 
 the hon gentleman ’s colleague of course be responsible for round of negotiation on the deal and the prime minister ’s point be that a lack of long term legal certainty cast into doubt the operational security of the base this deal will secure an operational guarantee for at least a century 
 what step he be take to protect undersea infrastructure 
 what step he be take to protect undersea infrastructure 
 what step he be take to protect critical undersea infrastructure 
 the government be deliver for defence with strong measure to protect our underwater critical national infrastructure we have declassify the activity of the russian spy ship yantar we have call out its activity by say we see you we know what you ’re do and we will robustly defend our critical national infrastructure 
 the secretary of state agree that the threat to critical undersea infrastructure be serious so will he prioritise development of underwater capability such as uncrewed system include under pillar of aukus and will he increase research and development investment into system that could protect that critical undersea infrastructure 
 i be grateful for the hon member ’s question it be a good we be see more risk pose to our critical underwater infrastructure by player who wish harm to our national security we already have brilliant capability in rfa proteus which be able to support our infrastructure and that of our ally   when the strategic defence review be publish in the spring i be sure that there will be more development in that direction 
 the secretary of state recently outline to this house the serious situation with the yantar a clear example of the threat pose to our critical undersea infrastructure and of the work that we need to do to defend ourselves and deter potential attack do that not show that we need to increase our defence spending as quickly as possible to defend our crucial infrastructure and protect national security 
 the hon member be right we be increase our defence spending in the budget we increase defence spending by £ and in the spring after the publication of the strategic defence review we will set out a path to spend of our gdp on defence 
 our undersea cable be critical to the economy public service and social order in this country give the hostile activity undertake the surveying of our cable can minister give assurance that the full need of our navy will be reflect in the strategic defence review so that we can defend our homeland security 
 as a navy brat and representative of a naval constituency that be foremost in my mind it be not just the royal navy that defend our critical national infrastructure in the case of the yantar that be do by the raf the royal fleet auxiliary and the royal navy as well as a joint integrate operation of all our force work together to defend our interest anyone threaten our infrastructure should be in no doubt that the uk possess formidable capability to defend itself and we will 
 last week i have the privilege of visit his majesty ’s naval base clyde with a number of my colleague from across the house will the secretary of state reassure the house that he be work with the scottish government to address the capacity and retention issue at the base and that the scottish government be engage positively on the industrial defence strategy 
 clyde be an important base for our national security it be of our critical military asset and we work closely on it not just with the scottish government and local council but across the entirety of government the success of our defence do not rely just on the action and decision of the ministry of defence it be a whole of government approach that keep our nation safe in these more difficult time we will ask for more of a whole of government approach to ensure that the man and woman of our fighting force and the civilian who support they have what they need to keep our nation safe 
 the propose aquind interconnector between france and england will slice through my constituency cause huge disruption but of more significant concern be the fact that the ministry of defence have raise serious national security concern about the propose submarine power cable do the minister agree that we can not do   anything to jeopardise our national security and will he formally lodge an objection with the secretary of state for energy security and net who will consider the proposal 
 i be familiar with the campaign work of my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan who have raise similar concern if the right hon lady write to i about that i will be happy to meet she to discuss it far 
 i welcome the strength of the response on protect our undersea infrastructure the defence secretary have be clear that grow russian aggression will not be tolerate here or in ukraine will the minister confirm that homeland security will be a key focus of the strategic defence review 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we live in more difficult and uncertain time with increase risk to uk homeland security that be an evolution from some of the strategic assessment in previous review it be for that reason that the strategic defence review be look not only at how we support our nato ally with a nato approach but at how we invest in capability to ensure that we be look after the uk homeland and mr speaker the uk homeland include our overseas territory 
 we have stretch that answer out well have n’t we let we go on to tom tugendhat 
 if he will have discussion with the chancellor of the exchequer on the potential merit of remove taxation from death in service payment 
 if he will have discussion with the chancellor of the exchequer on the potential merit of remove taxation from death in service payment 
 i thank   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   for his important question he have my absolute assurance that if anyone die in service from train all the way through to combat and operation they will absolutely be exempt from inheritance tax provision i will continue to discuss that issue as well as many other to do with armed force pay with my opposite number in the treasury this government be deeply proud of the armed force and i be deeply proud of they they will have my full backing as we move forward 
 of all i place on record my full congratulation to the hon and gallant member for his recent award in the new year ’s honour that be a fantastic achievement for somebody for whom i have the great admiration and with whom i have serve in numerous field may i raise the problem with his answer however retention in the armed force be already suffer number be already come down and people be struggle to make the math add up between serve today and have a future tomorrow the problem with   these argument and the lack of clarity from the government be that too many people be make decision on which we all need they to think again we need people to serve and stay and it be his responsibility to keep they there 
 i thank the right hon and gallant member for his response we need to take a holistic view of this i remind he that we have miss every recruitment and retention target for the past year we be work really hard to get after that now we have just put in place wraparound welfare we have do the annington homes deal we have put additional resource into veteran home for after service and we have give the big pay rise in year we be work really hard on that in discussion with our treasury counterpart and we will move it forward 
 will the minister give an assurance that the propose change to the application of inheritance tax to certain armed force death in service payment be compatible with the commitment in the armed force covenant to ensure that our brave and loyal armed force personnel 
 face no disadvantage compare to other citizen in the provision of public and commercial service 
 yes or no 
 the covenant will come into law in the next year or so on the back of the armed force bill that will result in a great expansion with all government departments fall in line with the covenant so that no individual who have serve be disadvantage because of that service 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the forces pension society have already state that levy inheritance tax on death in service benefit would be wholly counter to the armed force covenant and we conservatives wholly agree the consultation by his majesty ’s revenue and customs on that proposal close on   january on what day do the mod submit its response to that key consultation presumably in defence of service family interest and will the minister place a copy of that response in the library 
 may i remind the right hon member of my service and of the fact that i will in no way shape or form take this for grant i be put all my effort into those discussion at the moment my official have discuss that with the treasury i have discuss it with the treasury and we will continue to discuss such issue with the treasury to ensure that our armed force personnel get the deal that they deserve 
 i commend the minister on his distinguished service order we all do but in answer to a parliamentary question we be tell 
 the ministry of defence have not make a formal response to hm revenue and customs technical consultation 
 it really should have do who in their right mind would soldier for a government who do not have their back whether on school fee lawfare or inheritance tax or bad do not have the back of their family if they die unmarried and in service 
 score political point on the back of armed force family be unacceptable this be a public consultation and it be not the government ’s responsibility to answer it we have discuss this department to department from both an official perspective and a ministerial perspective and we will continue to do so we will bring this to a close 
 whether he have have discussion with official in the us administration on its commitment to nato 
 i hold the call with the new us secretary of defence pete hegseth last month we discuss the importance of all nato ally do more include on defence spending i look forward to meet secretary hegseth this week at the meeting of nato defence ministers 
 member of this house have raise concern about the impact on ukraine of both the new us administration and continue russian aggression can the secretary of state assure i that he will use the upcoming munich security conference to determine with ally the good way of ensure ukraine ’s victory 
 i can indeed i welcome the fact as i think will the hon lady that the new us defence secretary be spend his full week in office in europe he have make it clear that he want to discuss how to strengthen alliance how to expand our defence industry on both side of the atlantic and how to boost ally defence spending include on ukraine that be something we all agree on 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s answer but in the face of wide russian aggression could he expand on what conversation he have already have with nato counterpart about how nato can respond appropriately to the threat from russia 
 i can indeed everyone in nato include every of the european ally within nato be ready and be step up on euro atlantic security this wednesday i will have the privilege of chair the ukraine defence contact group a nation strong group in which we co ordinate the support that ukraine need because we must stay with ukraine for as long as it take 
 what his plan timetable be for the annual provision of £ of military support to ukraine 
 the government have commit to maintain £ in military aid to ukraine this year next year and each year for as long as it take 
 i come back from ukraine a week and a half ago i be very close to the front and talk to many of the military commander there and they make it very clear to i that they be desperately short of artillery piece mm and most importantly munition they could hardly respond to the russians as i understand it they be also short of c ram counter rocket artillery and mortar defence missile which be desperately need to protect ukraine ’s energy site and its civilian flat and house that hardware have be promise by many european nation and of course by the usa and i must say that when you be that close to the front mr speaker you realise how desperate it be there in the light of this delay will the government commit the uk to at least provide the sort of weaponry that it can provide to alleviate that problem as far as humanly possible but mostly to push our ally to do what they promise to do from what i hear without that hardware ukraine run the risk of lose this war 
 i welcome the fact that the right hon gentleman go to ukraine he be there with my hon friend   the member for macclesfield tim roca and i look forward to meet they both later this month to discuss the detail of what they see from my day in this job when i be in odessa with president zelensky i make the commitment that the uk would step up and speed up support for ukraine which be exactly what we have do that will be part of the discussion we will have with other nation at the meeting i will chair on wednesday and i be sure it will also be part of our discussion at nato on thursday 
 along with many hon member on both side of the house i welcome the £ commitment to ukraine this year next year and the year after but there be thing that we can do at home as well for example this weekend i hope to host a reception for ukrainian refugee in my constituency a valentine ’s for ukraine that we can send from all of we to all of they and all the ukrainians who be find refuge in our country 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s action in his constituency the uk have a proud unity on ukraine and it have give a proud welcome to ukrainians under the homes for ukraine scheme since day of putin ’s illegal full scale invasion as my hon friend say nearly year into the conflict valentine ’s day be a useful marker to recognise the warmth of welcome from the uk people and the struggle and fight that the ukrainian people military and civilian alike be wag for their freedom and their future 
 what step he be take to help increase recruitment to the armed force 
 what step he be take to help increase recruitment to the armed force 
 what step he be take to help increase recruitment to the armed force 
 the government be deliver for defence by address the deep retention and recruitment crisis that we inherit from the conservatives last week i announce more detail on a brand new fast track cyber entry to boost uk cyber defence bolster our capability in response to the grow threat and address a global shortage of cyber talent i also announce the award of a new contract for a tri service armed force recruit service 
 west herts college in my constituency offer a great selection of course include compute course that offer a pathway to a career in cyber security for young people in hemel hempstead consider a career in that field to defend our country can the minister outline further detail of the step that he take last week to boost recruitment to cyber security in this country 
 i be grateful for the enthusiasm of young people in my hon friend ’s constituency for a career in cyber last week the new cyber direct entry pathway for our armed force be open for the royal air force and the navy the army entry will come online next year that allow people to join directly to pursue a career in cyber by change the entry requirement it will bring on board the cyber expertise that we need to keep our country safe the frontline of the future be not tomorrow it be today it be the cyber frontline young people across the nation should look on the royal navy and raf website at a career in cyber it be well pay and will keep our country safe 
 i welcome the news that the mod have sign the british dyslexia association ’s dyslexia friendly workplace pledge do the minister agree that to address the recruitment crisis it be vital that the armed force remain inclusive for recruit from all background and with all experience while rightly continue to demand high standard 
 i be pleased to confirm that the ministry of defence sign the dyslexia friendly workplace pledge at the end of last year make we the uk government department to do so it be a fantastic step forward that signal that the mod be a top employer for people with dyslexia whatever someone ’s ability there be a role for they within our armed force because our armed force need people with a whole range of ability background and expertise to keep our nation safe 
 in my constituency we be proud to host the defence medical services at whittington we be look forward to a fresh date be set for a visit from my hon friend the minister for veterans and people so that he can see its brilliant work for himself what step be the minister take to build on the success of such centre of excellence in any new recruitment programme 
 it be vital that we seek to invest in defence medical services especially as we live in more difficult and contested time where we may need to use its expertise and that of the national health service across the uk to support a warfighting effort i know the minister for veterans and people be look forward to visit whittington later this year i hope that when   the strategic defence review come out my hon friend   the member for tamworth sarah edwards   will see the path to investment and support that we be offer defence medical services as we look to create a whole of society approach to our defence 
 soldier will be leave the army rather than be recruit if we continue to allow the persecution of soldier who serve in northern ireland last week ’s coroner ’s report into the clonoe and coalisland shooting be page of fact and page of naïve speculation which lead right into the ira ’s attempt to rewrite the history of northern ireland without the northern ireland legacy legislation how will the secretary of state prevent that because if he fail what should be a process of peace and reconciliation will turn into a vindictive vengeful pursuit of man whose only sin be to serve their country with honour heroism and skill and in the most terrifying condition if we can not prevent that all the recruiting effort will fail 
 i assure the right hon gentleman that his passion be also feel on the government benches and the ministerial team want to support all our veteran the issue that he raise be difficult for i to comment on as it be subject to ongoing legal matter and he will appreciate that it be hard for a minister to comment in such circumstance 
 order i reassure the minister that there be no legal restriction on this case it be not the court it be only a coroner 
 thank you mr speaker i be grateful for the right hon gentleman ’s question none the less the ministry of defence be continue our conversation with the northern ireland office which be the lead department for such matter we will continue to support our veteran and we will continue conversation with the northern ireland veteran commissioner as to how we can support veteran in northern ireland in particular 
 follow on from the previous question do the minister accept that recruitment be bind to be disincentivise by a finding year on that people who do their duty and encounter armed ira terrorist on murderous active service and protect the public as a consequence find themselves vilify year later by the coroner ’s service how can that be right and what step will the government take to protect our armed force not just now but go into the future include what happen in the past 
 this be a matter that the ministry of defence have discuss today with the northern ireland office it be a northern ireland office lead and we will be work closely with it on that announcement have already be make in relation to this by the secretary of state for northern ireland and i reassure the hon and learn gentleman that a career in the armed force be a brilliant career for anyone look at it this government will continue to support those people who serve and those who have serve to ensure that they get all the support they need to defend our country in service and benefit from that service after they have leave uniform 
 far to the point make by right hon and hon member if we be go to have recruitment we need to have protection if we be to have protection we must ensure that the disgraceful scene the sas kill ira man who be return from a bombing and shoot attack on a police station try to kill the sas be confront by those killer murderer terrorist scum that they be who be armed to the tooth with a machine gun that could fire round in a minute and an ak-47 be it not right that our soldier should be protect they be confront by the enemy that enemy be never go to surrender and they get their just desert 
 i reassure the hon gentleman that we on the government benches share the same passion that all veteran should get the support they need we will continue to discuss that aspect with our northern ireland office colleague who take the lead on this matter i encourage he to continue to raise question because it be important that we support all our veteran no matter where they serve across the united kingdom that be a matter that the secretary of state and i as well as the minister for veterans and people will continue to discuss with colleague across the government 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 if we want to strengthen our armed force we must fix the recruitment delay young recruit signer jimmy apply in september but will not start until january that be largely due to medical record hold up and poor communication i welcome the aim for applicant to receive a decision within day and a training start date within day but how will serco deliver that in practice what safeguard will be in place to ensure that recruit get clear timely response and be not lose in the system 
 the hon lady be right that we need to speed up the recruitment process we inherit a situation where it take on average more than day from the point of application to turn up at a training establishment often without any understanding of how long that will take that be why the secretary of state introduce the policy which mean a provisional offer within day of starting and a provisional start date within day of application we be do that to reduce the time of flight include work cross government to improve speed of access to medical record there will be further announcement in due course we be make progress on that but there be a lot more to do to fix the damage to the recruitment process that be run by the last government 
 how many afghans who work directly for british force have be relocate to the uk under the afghan resettlement programme 
 the afghan resettlement programme be a cross government delivery programme that will bring exist resettlement scheme into single pipeline under such scheme   more than eligible afghans have relocate to the uk as confirm in my recent write parliamentary answer to the hon gentleman it be not possible to provide a breakdown of relocation figure by job role include those who work directly for british force 
 have admit afghans into the country as part of the afghan resettlement programme it be concern to learn that the ministry of defence have no idea how many of they actually ever work for british force the government ’s own figure estimate the total number of local afghans employ by british force during op herrick to be around only of whom work as interpreter and translator on the frontline a fraction of the if the mod do not know why they be eligible to be let into the country the mod presumably also do not know who they be or what they have be do in afghanistan over the past decade can the minister confirm that the afghan resettlement programme have not be exploit by criminal terrorist or hostile state influence 
 can i thank the hon gentleman not just for that question but for his ongoing interest in this area we owe a debt of gratitude to those people who serve alongside our force in afghanistan this programme be start by the last government and this government be proud to continue it everyone who be bring to safety in the uk from the taliban under the afghan scheme have be vet in relation to that there be a variety of role that cover support to our armed force in relation to our uk mission in afghanistan but i can reassure he that i pay close attention to this area if he would like to meet to discuss this far to deepen his interest and to help he in his inquiry i be happy to do so 
 what step he be take to support minority group in the armed force 
 why do we support a more diverse military it be simple it make we well it make we think differently and importantly it mean the military represent the society we be try to protect since come into government we have launch our raise our standards programme we be seek to make defence the most attractive employer for all walk of society i will be unequivocally clear that the underlie principle for why we pursue a more diverse military well welfare well housing and well kit and equipment be simply to ensure that we can call upon our man and woman to do their job and that they can close with the enemy and win 
 in the wigston review identify that serve personnel from ethnic minority background be subject to high level of harassment and bullying than their white british counterpart give the recent success of the atherton review which cast light on the structural challenge face by woman in the armed force and give that of the british army workforce come from ethnic minority group do the ministerial team think it might be time to have an atherton style review independent of the mod into the challenge face by ethnic minority group to ensure and enhance recruitment retention and promotional opportunity 
 i thank the hon member for his useful comment we have launch our raise our standards programme which will take standard from where they be and raise they we will make defence the most inclusive career and indeed the most rewarding for any part of society to join the defence committee will hold we to account on some of that when the covenant come into place that will also cover certain element of standard too 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 recent week have see troubling headline for lgbt personnel and we on the lib dem benches believe that everyone be welcome in our armed force regardless of their sexual orientation ethnicity or gender identity can the minister outline what step have be take to promote the british value of inclusion particularly for the lgbt community among our nato ally will the minister provide an update on the compensation scheme for lgbt veteran who be impact by the military ’s anti gay ban 
 when we start the etherton review a lot of engagement go out across some of our nato ally to take good practice now that we have launch the programme we be also make sure that people can understand the success and perhaps some of the improvement as it progress as the house will know the defence secretary announce our finding from the etherton review on   december with a increase in the financial redress system for those affect by the lgbt ban thing be now head in the right direction with more than people start the application process 
 what his plan timetable be for award the new medium helicopter contract 
 the new medium helicopter competition be at the evaluation and approval stage if everything go well i anticipate a contract award later this year subject to all the usual approval 
 a significant number of my constituent contribute to the defence sector whether through apprenticeship graduate role or skilled employment many be school in west dorset and now work in the surround area include for firm such as leonardo in the neighbouring constituency of yeovil what assurance can the minister give that contract such as the new medium helicopter will be award quickly so that the future of the many apprentice and employee in the defence sector be protect 
 the hon gentleman be right some of these programme can take a long time to get to contract in fact this programme experience delay in secure outline business case approval under the previous government i hope that we can get it to the end of the line as swiftly as possible in accordance with the current process and that some of his constituent will benefit from have work to do on the new programme 
 what progress his department have make on achieve a inflow of woman into the armed force by 
 we inherit a retention and recruitment crisis which must be address across all different cohort increase female representation benefit our warfighting and readiness but we be still some way from where the hon lady and i would like we to be on the issue the late figure from october show female representation in the regular force and in the reserve 
 a balanced workforce in the armed force be good for british defence but woman still face a raft of challenge make it hard to attract and retain female talent what step be the minister take to accelerate progress towards the woman in defence charter ambition of and to make the armed force a well workplace for woman 
 this be an important topic and it really matter implement the recommendation of the atherton review and raise standard as the minister for veterans and people have speak about will benefit everyone in the armed force but woman in particular we need to improve culture and behaviour and focus on woman ’s health and wellbeing new policy be be bring forward to address that we be also stand up more work on call out crime and behaviour that be unacceptable in our armed force everyone should have a place in our armed force because defend our country require a whole of society approach we must not neglect any part of society 
 whether he plan to appoint a veteran commissioner for england 
 i reassure the hon member that i work closely with my northern ireland welsh and scottish commissioner we be currently look at the structure by which we support veteran across the whole tapestry of the united kingdom and we really want to put in place an institutional resilience system that give the good care at the right time and in the right place to the right people that primarily involve work with thousand of charity collaboratively and coherently to ensure that we can get the good bang for our buck from all the amazing volunteer and charitable service out there a big review be go on it be on hold at the moment and we will let the house know more in due course

 absolutely i just travel to the north east of england and hit different council look at the different way in which they deal with the veteran issue i be really look forward to the launch event which will have a variety of different race car i just hope that i do not get to see the mudflap when i be there 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 on behalf of we all i wish our uk team in canada good luck for the invictus game this week i will have the privilege of chair the nation ukraine defence contact group i will also attend the meeting of nato defence ministers and then the munich security conference 
 mr speaker be the critical year for the war in ukraine the world be watch and it be imperative that all ally step up their support i be proud of the uk ’s continue unity and leadership on ukraine this year the uk will provide £ in military aid more than ever before our commitment be absolute we will strengthen ukraine on the battlefield and at any negotiating table i be grateful to continue to have the support of both side of the house together we will stand with the people of ukraine for as long as it take 
 us navy official have report increase russian and chinese patrol in the high north last week the danish navy announce plan to acquire new arctic patrol ship and march will see of the large exercise joint viking operation in nato ’s history with these concern in mind will the secretary of state confirm which uk asset will be involve in joint viking this year what plan do he have to update the policy paper on the uk ’s defence contribution in the high north 
 my hon friend be right about the high north we will continue to maintain a strong defence profile and posture both the royal navy and the royal fleet auxiliary will be take part in exercise joint viking 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 surely of the most important lesson from the war in ukraine for our own military base be the urgent need to fire up the defence industry and increase its capacity however today we learn from ads that british defence manufacturer will be hit with a £ tax rise this parliament from high national insurance why be the government prioritise high taxis on defence instead of high defence spending 
 on the contrary we be back british industry we be look for firm that can design invent and make in britain a big change from the industrial policy under the previous government i be   in derby recently to announce an year contract for rolls royce that will support more than apprentices—200 each year and thousand of small business in supply chain across the country 
 i know all about the unity deal because as the minister for defence procurement and industry say i negotiate it this be extraordinary complacency on tax from the secretary of state the government be tax not just the defence industry but the education of defence people ’s child and death in service payment the fact be that the defence secretary be under a tax from all side the question be be that how the government will pay for their chagos deal 
 we step up and accelerate the negotiation to conclude the rolls royce contract and i be able to announce it the other week to apprentice and management at rolls royce we be put nearly £ extra into defence this year we recognise as everyone do that we must increase defence spending we will return uk defence spending to a level that we have not see since labour be last in government in direct it and foremost to british industry 
 this week be national apprenticeship week i know from my constituent that apprenticeship be a vital and successful route into the workplace will the minister join i in welcome the apprenticeship in the defence sector across the country will the government continue to build the right skill and workforce of the future through apprenticeship 
 i be very happy to acknowledge my hon friend ’s point i meet many apprentice late last week at the launch of national apprenticeship week whichever factory i visit i meet apprentice young man and woman who be thrill by the opportunity that a career in defence give they they all have smile on their face and future in front of they it be great that national apprenticeship week highlight all that 
 we press the government to extend continuity of education allowance to for service family we be tell that there would be no exemption from the depredation of the decision to impose vat on school fee but it turn out that the child of american servicemen and woman be exempt would it not be fair to extend that exemption to the man and woman who serve our country 
 there be a long stand deal with other nation on the welfare of family and so on this government be support our armed force community we will pay through the cea we have give service personnel the big pay rise and we be address the recruitment and retention crisis that we be leave with 
 the government be rightly proud of the man and woman who work in our defence industry will the minister join i in encourage excellent university such as   keele university in newcastle under lyme to work with our defence sector to create good job for local people boost skill and safeguard our national security 
 i be more than happy to join my hon friend in make those point he be right that we must fully support defence company and their personnel and we must ensure that university such as keele and all other across the further and high education sector welcome defence firm at their career fair 
 do the secretary of state his official and his chief have a plan to implement the additional resource from of gdp when it arrive if they do not we will be face with lengthy delay while procurement plan be put in place be this a case of ministerial prevarication or be there a serious plan if arrive but there be no plan for procurement ready to hit the ground run we will actually be no far forward than we be at 
 mr speaker we have the commitment and we have the plan 
 i thank the veterans minister for recently visit redditch for a roundtable where he hear from veteran about the excellent work by the redditch armed force and veteran breakfast club in bring together the community and signpost critical support do he agree it be vital that the government continue to work with such organisation to ensure that no veteran miss out on the support they deserve 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the visit to redditch be truly enlightening the charitable sector there be do amazing work to support veteran in his constituency i fully champion the breakfast club they be put on 
 the united kingdom have a strong defence industry worth £ in export which be important to company in my constituency such as collins aerospace amentum and chess dynamics the government ’s commitment to strengthen uk eu relation be especially welcome in this sector what step be the department take to boost export with our eu and nato ally 
 we be set out to reset relation with key european ally we have say we will look to co operate more closely with the european union where that be in british interest and where we can add to the defence and security arrangement for europe as a whole we have strike some deep new bilateral agreement such as the trinity house agreement with germany we have to see our british industry not just as produce the kit our force need but as an essential part of our deterrence that alongside ally deter aggression 
 last month i host the annual dinner for former servicepeople in my constituency where i meet score of people who serve our country proudly and bravely like councillor clive morgan i will ask the secretary of state the question they ask i which become ever more urgent by   the day what be the government do to boost the resilience of the general public in this country in an ever more hostile world 
 national resilience and defence in depth be essential as we move forward when the threat be transfer from non state actor to state actor across the globe when the strategic defence review come out in the next couple of the month in the spring member will see that that be a central tenet throughout 
 last week the gurkha class of proudly attest in pokhara there be part of the british armed force that do not yet have woman the brigade of gurkhas will minister do what sadly and not for the want of try i fail to do and rectify that omission 
 i serve with the gurkhas on various tour in afghanistan and across the world they be some of the good force we have and they do a fantastic job uphold the freedom we enjoy i will continue to work with the gurkhas and i look forward to meet their ambassador here very soon to discuss issue such as this 
 i thank the government for improve the pay and housing condition of our armed force bishop auckland have turn out some excellent young man and woman into the armed force many of whom go through our brilliant volunteer lead cadet force without wish to pre empt the strategic defence review will the government commit to ensure strong funding for our local cadet 
 we just talk about resilience and defence in depth the cadet provide an example of where we can bring society and defence together to help people understand the benefit of defence it give they some great example from courage to commitment dedication drive and indeed become a net contributor to society i fully support it 
 be the government do any forward thinking—[laughter no i be be serious about what will happen when the shooting stop with a ceasefire agreement in ukraine wherever the border between free and occupy ukraine finally form will become the new frontline for europe so what provision be we make even now to be able to secure the future shape and safety of europe 
 despite the titter on his own side the right hon gentleman make a really important point at the point at which ukraine decide to talk instead of or as well as fight security guarantee will need to be in place to ensure that russia do not resume its aggression in washington last year the nato ally make a commitment that ukraine be on an irreversible path to nato membership but there will be a period when during the talk just as in the fight they will require our support we be give that detailed discussion now 
 on thursday my hon and gallant friend the minister for veterans and people come to my constituency   for an important discussion on veteran mental health may i ask he for his reflection on that discussion and on what action he will be take move forward 
 of all i thank my hon friend for host a fantastic get together with veteran bereaved family and the charitable sector i learn a huge amount from the visit i look again at how council be deliver support to veteran which i can contrast and compare with other visit and will come out with a plan in due course 
 the secretary of state will have hear the exchange early about the grave injustice and slur that be deliver upon sas personnel in the coroner ’s judgment last week follow the incident in clonoe will the secretary of state take this opportunity to indicate not only to the house but to service personnel and the nation that he as defence secretary support those who bravely serve in northern ireland and stand on the precipice between peace and tyranny 
 i be glad to accept the right hon gentleman ’s invitation to do just that it behove we all to remember that those who serve in our force in northern ireland be part of a campaign that lead to more death of uk security personnel in northern ireland than in afghanistan they deserve and they will have our full support 
 as seem to be the consensus of the house our support for ukraine must remain unwavering in the face of putin ’s war of nationalist aggression i be proud that this country retrofit storm shadow missile in my constituency with an increasingly unstable geopolitical situation do the secretary of state agree that full co operation with our nato ally to defend ukraine and guarantee the security of europe continue to be integral in the defence of our own country 
 my hon friend point to of the major item for discussion on wednesday at the ukraine defence contact group and of the main concern of nato and the new secretary general which be to boost the capacity of the european defence industry 
 the eskdalemuir seismic array in my constituency monitor compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty at the moment there be a restriction on wind farm development in the vicinity of the array but wind farm developer be lobby hard to have those restriction relax can ministers give a guarantee that they will not be relax if there be any suggestion that that would interfere with the array ’s effectiveness 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i be deal with this issue before i come to the house early today support our national security be the no priority of the government we need to keep our nation safe there be a variety of mean by which we do so and the array be an important contributor i would be very happy to meet he to discuss the detail of the issue he raise 
 as the minister point out early the royal fleet auxiliary service have take a prominent role in protect our subsea infrastructure i welcome the settlement of the rfa pay dispute will that help the minister to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis that see number of rfa seafarer fall by under the previous government 
 it be vital that we value the royal fleet auxiliary and we have do so by settle the pay dispute and make it very clear that there be a bright future for seafarer in the rfa its work with rfa proteus in relation to the yantar have be exceptional but each and every day those seafarer be support our royal navy on global operation they have the support of our ministerial team and i be sure that they have the support of member on both side of the house 
 with the russians use drone to drop cs gas into the trench of the donbas and avon protection in my constituency ready to manufacture the residue of the gas mask that ukraine request will the government put in an order as soon as possible please 
 we have take many step to try to improve the capability of the ukrainians when it come to drone technology and i be perfectly happy to look at the point that the hon gentleman have raise 
 portsmouth be the home of the royal navy but it be also the proud home of many company in the defence sector bae airbus and accuracy international to name just a few those company provide fantastic job opportunity for my constituent but they have face real difficulty in the last decade what step be the department take to support our defence sector in the uk and in portsmouth in particular both the business themselves and the recruitment and training of the skilled workforce as part of our government ’s industrial strategy 
 i look forward to meet my hon friend shortly when i visit some of those business in her constituency the defence industrial strategy be the way in which we will seek to deal with the issue that she have raise 
 my constituent owen be medically discharge from the army after year of service since then he have be wait for year for a resolution of his claim under the armed force compensation scheme do the minister agree that that be too long to make a veteran wait and what advice can he give i so that i can resolve my constituent ’s case 
 we be absolutely a government who support veteran if the hon gentleman will send i the detail of that case i will look into it personally we pay out over £ in compensation and i have be to norcross to ensure good standard up there 
 i recently visit the royal orthopaedic hospital in my constituency which have an outstanding veteran care   service do the minister agree that it be essential for former and current service personnel in birmingham and beyond to continue to have access to specialised musculoskeletal rehabilitation service 
 absolutely birmingham have a cluster of fantastic hospital and medical care facility as well as the royal centre for defence medicine i would love to visit and i hope i can do so in due course 
 i think i be right in say that i be the only member of the house of commons if not parliament as a whole to have mauritian heritage if i be wrong about that i be happy to be correct why do the secretary of state not see that the propose deal between the united kingdom and mauritius be a dangerous because of the increase in china ’s access to the island near diego garcia an unaffordable whether it be £ £ or £ that be money that   should go to our armed force and above all a humiliating in the eye of the mauritians the americans and the international community why will he not scrap it 
 the deal with the mauritians be design to secure the long term operation and the legal base and to guarantee our ability and that of our ally in the us to continue to operate from diego garcia for at least the next century 
 early in topical question the veterans minister say that the strategic defence review would be publish in the next couple of month can he confirm that it will be publish by the end of april 
 it be a fair correction i say in a couple of month and then in the spring 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on the ruling on the rosebank and jackdaw oilfield as unlawful 
 the government ’s priority be to deliver a fair orderly and prosperous transition in the north sea that recognise the role that oil and gas will play in the come decade this transition will be in line with our climate and legal obligation it will drive we towards our clean energy future of energy security low bill and good long term job 
 on   january the court of session publish its judgment on the rosebank and jackdaw oil and gas field in the north sea the judgment set out that the previous consent grant to rosebank and jackdaw be unlawful as they fail to take into account the emission from burn the fuel produce as a result if developer wish to proceed with these project they will need to reapply for consent this time consider scope emission as require by the supreme court judgment last year 
 although the judgment itself be a matter for the court the government have take rapid action in early january we consult on revised environmental guidance to take into account emission from burn extract oil and gas to provide stability for industry the consultation close on   july and we be work towards publish the finalised guidance as soon as possible once the guidance be in place the government will resume make decision with regard to the environmental impact assessment for offshore oil and gas development the court confirm that it be in the interest of good administration for the consultation and guidance to be complete properly it would therefore be inappropriate for i to comment on the specific of individual project such as rosebank and jackdaw in parliament or anywhere else because do so would prejudice future regulatory decision making should the respective developer decide to resubmit these project for approval 
 more widely this government be determined to deliver the long term job and investment and the clean energy future that this country need to ensure that people work in the north sea and those involve in the oil and gas industry across this country have the long term future they need 
 rise 
 order just for clarification you do not have jurisdiction on the planning issue and it be no long in the court so i be a little bit confused by your assertion that you will be involve go forward 
 i be happy to provide clarification base on the advice that i have which be that this be a matter for the applicant in the court case who be entitle to appeal the judgment should they wish to do so if they wish to make a further application in this matter my department will be responsible for make   that judgment and i seek not to prejudice an application by give an opinion way or the other on these matter i hope that that sit well with you mr speaker 
 well kind of but obviously member will want to ask you about this issue today so i do not want to try to close it down too early 
 in august this government withdraw lawyer from the case defend the legal challenge to the issuing of licence for rosebank and jackdaw in the north sea give this government ’s decision to revoke any defence the court ’s quashing of approval be all but inevitable it be deeply disappointing and yet unsurprise that this government drive by their zealotry be happy to put billion of pound of investment and thousand of job at risk just because something do not align with just stop oil ’s vision of the future it demonstrate that this government be not willing to stand up for business or worker 
 the labour party seem to misunderstand this simple point if we shut down our oil and gas industry we will not use any less oil and gas even the climate change committee know that the department seem to ignore the fact that we will simply rely on more import instead if those import be liquify natural gas they will come with time the production emission and if we import from norway we will be ship in gas from underneath the very same north sea sacrifice our domestic industry only to rely on foreign import and compound global carbon emission be utter madness for our economy and for the climate it make a mockery of our prospect for growth and it will cost the treasury £ in lose revenue to put that figure into perspective it be equivalent to and a half year worth of winter fuel payment 
 last week the developer of rosebank equinor announce that it be slash its offshore wind investment do the minister appreciate that the self harm inflict on the north sea be damage investment in other offshore renewable industry too that could be wreck our path forward 
 the government be utterly confused the chancellor and the secretary of state be completely out of touch with the public obviously but apparently also with each other it be no surprise that the secretary of state be prepared to sacrifice growth and investment in energy security for his ideological obsession so may i ask the minister for clarity this be a very important point will the department treat the application if they be resubmitte as existing application or new application give that it have a ban on all new licence move forward will the government back growth and back british worker when the decision reach his department and who do he think will win this argument outright the secretary of state or the chancellor of the exchequer 
 i thank the shadow minister for his response although i be not sure it be entirely constructive in this conversation he know as well as anyone that the process be live and the company involve in these project have the right to apply in future it would be wrong for i to prejudice those application in the house of commons or anywhere else by state an opinion 
 new application 
 i will come to the hon gentleman ’s question in a moment but what he fail to mention be how we get to this position the court of session clearly outline in its judgment that the previous secretary of state have make a decision that be unlawful so once again this labour government be have to clear up a mess create by the previous conservative government unlike they we will follow due process as i outline we consult on what the future of the consenting process would look like in light of the supreme court judgment that be something he would have have to do if he be still in this job because we have to respond to the supreme court judgment if he be tell we now that in government he would have ignore the judgment of the supreme court that be an interesting perspective to take 
 on the hon gentleman ’s specific point we be clear during the election that our position be no new licence to explore new field the project be in exist licensed field the question for the court to decide be the consent for those individual new project and that be the process that we will now take forward if those company should wish to resubmit their application the broad question about the future of the north sea will be about not or individual project but the reality that it be a decline basin and that the long term future do not rest in oil and gas as important as they will continue to be for many year to come 
 what we have seek to do as a government be to kick start what the economic future will look like beyond oil and gas recognise that the north sea be a decline basin recognise the importance of new technology such as carbon capture and hydrogen and investing in measure such as the clean industry bonus that will deliver job in aberdeen there be only party that be serious about work out what the transition look like and what come next to safeguard job in the hon gentleman ’s constituency and across the north east and it be not the conservative party 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i thank my hon friend for confirm the government ’s commitment to support production in exist north sea oil and gas field and for confirm the desire to partner closely with industry and worker on the transition away from fossil fuel do he agree that the worker and community that rely on the north sea would be in a much strong position if we have not witness over the last decade a chaotic mismanagement of the decline in the basin that he have just refer to and the failure to plan for the loss of job in that decade alone 
 the chair of the select committee make an important point which be that the failure to acknowledge that the transition be already under way be to bury your head in the sand and pretend that everything will carry on as it be the reality be that in the past decade a of the oil and gas workforce—70,000 worker as my hon friend say have already lose their job and the transition be under way we be determined to ensure not only that the transition lead to a future in the north sea energy sector that yes involve oil and gas   for many year to come but that we build the industry of the future now so that there be no gap the alternative be to do what the previous government do which be to pretend that the transition be not under way and then somehow deal with the shock that would come when north sea oil and gas inevitably decline to the point where worker job be not protect we be determined to build what come next and to protect good well pay job in the north sea for many decade to come 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the decision that we make in the next decade on energy will make or break the planet and this be also key for the jackdaw and rosebank oilfield should the propose developer apply for a new development consent the ruling give the government the opportunity to take a rational science base approach and make a decision on the future of the field base on what be good for the planet the people of britain and the uk ’s international leadership 
 contrary to what have be say by   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie approve these oilfield this will not protect uk worker despite promise of job not a single uk design or construction role have be create instead that work have be outsource to dubai business leader agree that a fair transition away from oil and gas will boost our economy create job and attract investment the liberal democrats oppose the oilfield at jackdaw and rosebank instead of pour money into an energy source that be not consistent with our climate commitment we should be call on the government to invest in renewable and an ambitious green energy strategy that lower cost create job and secure our future what assessment will the minister make of our climate commitment 
 for the reason i outline in previous answer i will not comment specifically on these project in answer to the hon lady ’s broad point any future application for the north sea have to recognise the supreme court ’s ruling that the end use emission the scope emission must be take into account in any application 
 we be now work through the significant number of response to our consultation at the start of this year on how people who wish to apply for consent to extract hydrocarbon from the continental shelf can comply with the supreme court ’s judgment an environmental assessment will be absolutely necessary that be not a decision we have make from a political point of view it be require by the supreme court 
 we will follow the law of this land as i would expect any government to do although apparently not a conservative government we will put in place a robust system to ensure that any application that come before we be judge fairly on their merit 
 i thank the minister for his statement constrain as it be by the legal situation what a cheek   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   have he come to the house pretend to be a hero and   protector of the oil industry when job as my hon friend   the member for sefton central bill esterson   point out be lose on his government ’s watch 
 on the point at issue there must be balance in the necessary transition from carbon to renewable it be not an either or we have be in the north sea for generation and we will be there for generation more as we wind down the basin politic be often about symbol and the renew consent for rosebank and jackdaw if they come offer an opportunity to reassure worker in this industry that they will not be leave behind when we plan for a fair and just transition from the old to the new 
 i thank my hon friend for the tone of his question this industry have many thousand of extremely talented skilled and experienced worker whom i have have the great privilege of meeting over the past month in this role we have to ensure that we build a resilient industry for many decade to come 
 some of that will be the oil and gas that be already license and consent and any other project that come through the process but it will also be about build the industry that come next it would be irresponsible of any government to focus on at the exclusion of the other 
 the reality be that the north sea be a super mature basin a transition be already under way and it be incumbent on we and on any responsible government to build the industry that come next while continue to support the oil and gas industry that we have today 
 do the minister agree that there be a double standard in the government back heathrow expansion to drive economic growth but not provide the maximum possible support for our domestic oil and gas industry 
 the chancellor be very clear in her speech that there be no conflict between our net commitment and the industrialisation that we want to see economic growth project such as the runway at heathrow will be important but as the chancellor say they will have to be in line with our climate obligation 
 importantly as my hon friend   the member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton   say this be not an either or oil and gas will continue to play an important role in our economy for many year to come but we have to plan for what come next and take cognisance of our legal and climate obligation 
 i urge the minister and labour colleague to take no lesson from the conservative party on a fair and just transition away from fossil fuel because our coalfield community in this country be destroy by tory governments over decade in contrast we need to look at the growth we be now provide by lift the onshore wind ban invest in carbon capture and storage and establish gb energy 
 order where be the question 
 i will find the question mr speaker my hon friend be right that historical transition in key industry have leave worker high and dry instead of recognise that a transition be under way and support   that workforce into what come next the coal industry devastate large part of my constituency in lanarkshire and area across england and wales which continue to have consequence for generation we be determined that that will not happen with the north sea but it require we to plan the transition and to put it in place now not to bury our head in the sand and pretend everything be fine 
 what will worker in scotland be think right now as they watch the uk government and a scottish minister go out of their way to accelerate the decline in north sea oil and gas job in advance of replacement job come onstream as they can see at grangemouth do the minister not understand that the reduction in attrition to north sea oil and gas production must be commensurate with a reduction in demand and an increase in renewable job he have get that mix all over the place 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman be of the scottish national party cohort seek to move to our other parliament but the snp ’s position in holyrood be the same as our which be that we must be cognisant of climate change obligation with regard to any new licence perhaps he have a different position from his colleague in holyrood i be not sure but the snp recognise rightly as we do that the future require investment in oil and gas for many year to come to which we be commit and that investment must match our climate obligation the transition that be now under way must have government at its heart support the job and industry that come in the future if the hon gentleman support some of the investment that we propose such as at great british energy in aberdeen instead of deride it at every single turn—[interruption mr speaker i have again unite all the members of parliament from north east scotland who oppose investment in their own constituency if the hon gentleman support that investment maybe he would see the job of the future come 
 under the previous government thousand upon thousand of job be lose in the north sea energy bill hit record high and the government put britain ’s energy security in the hand of vladimir putin have make a patently unlawful decision on rosebank the conservatives be lecture we on energy policy the truth be that our clean energy mission will deliver the job and economic growth of the future our commitment to climate action and low bill the conservative party be stick in the past will the minister remain focused on the future and deliver our clean energy mission which will deliver the economic and environmental benefit the public want to see 
 as my hon friend say the long term future of our energy security in this country be not in oil and gas as important a part as it will continue to play for many year to come the clean power mission that we be drive forward at pace be about build home grow renewable power that will deliver energy security in the long term although oil and gas will continue to play an important part for many year to come not just in our energy mix but in our country ’s wide economic system we will support the job and industry in north east scotland to ensure that transition be fair and prosperous for all 
 be i right in think that if the government take the factor around emission into account in a future application it will not be for the court to then say that have take they into account the government have arrive at the wrong decision in want to proceed surely it be for the government to decide whether to proceed not the court 
 we be still digest the detail of the judgment but my understanding be that as the right hon gentleman put it the supreme court make it clear that application should take account of scope emission in the process that we put in place which i will not pre empt we will have to justify how the application have meet that requirement it will then be for the north sea transition authority to make a judgment and the secretary of state ultimately to make a decision if somebody want to take that judgment to a judicial review they could be entitle to do so but the right hon gentleman be quite right that the decision will be for the government 
 i thank the minister for the thoughtful way in which he be proceed we all recognise that climate change be a threat to growth rather than a driver of it whether that be through flooding fire or the chaos that it cause it be therefore shocking that the previous government do not take account of emission and the impact that they might have on our economy in make the decision to proceed with rosebank and it be right that we rethink that 
 i recognise what the minister say about court judgment may i press he though his predecessor have to admit that there be no energy security in proceed with rosebank because of the oil and gas that it would provide would not be for the uk market so it would not drive down british consumer bill be that still his understanding of the project be that not another good reason why we should rethink it 
 my hon friend be right to make the point that climate change be not a future threat but a present reality this year alone there have be a number of example around the world of that present reality already have a huge and devastating impact on people ’s life 
 on the balance that we want to strike yes the oil and gas industry be important to our economy and to our energy mix but the long term future require we to move towards clean power even if gas be extract from the north sea it do not help with consumer bill in this country because it be trade on an open market to the high bidder and sell by private company this be not a nationalise industry it be own by private company and gas be extract by private company and sell by private company and consumer in this country do not benefit from their gas come from abroad or from the north sea 
 if the minister will not comment on rosebank or jackdaw because of the threat of legal appeal will he at least confirm that his government will put a stop to extraction from a report new oil and gas field that receive licence   from the previous government but be still await their final consent i believe that they be not subject to the restriction that cause he not to want to comment on rosebank and jackdaw 
 to be clear i be not suggest that i can not comment because of particular legal action my department will have responsibility for make the decision and it would be wrong for i to prejudice that process by give my view on those application in parliament or anywhere else that be entirely how such application end up back in court and that be what i be determined to avoid 
 we clearly outline the question of licensing at the election we will not issue new licence to explore new field exist licence will be honour and we will not remove licence from field that already have a licence however consent the point at which extraction take place must take into account climate test and not least the compatibility test lay down by the supreme court any application now or in future must take account of that 
 the carbon budget be put in place by the previous government it be pretty ambitious and it be now for this government to identify how it will be achieve the minister seem to be take an entirely practical approach and i commend he for that but can he assure we that the government will ensure that any new application will be approve only if they can achieve any offset or mitigation in their own right so that we keep in line with the carbon budget that be in place which we be legally oblige to achieve 
 my hon friend touch on some of the key question that we ask in the consultation which close just a few week ago and to which we have a significant number of response the supreme court ’s judgment require we to look at some of the test that he mention particularly whether there be offset or mitigation and we will announce how we will put that into effect in due course 
 on the guidance that come from the consultation we have only just close the consultation and be work as fast as possible on the result from that however applicant for consent will absolutely have to take account of the scope emission it will be for they to outline in their application how they intend to mitigate any impact to achieve such consent 
 we have already see that if rosebank do not go ahead £ worth of investment and job will be lose those job be really important to we in the north east of scotland they be there for sentiment and for confidence and they be also to show that we have a future at the moment it feel like the north east be be sell down the river and that any opportunity we have be be lose because the government be so ideologically commit to move away from oil and gas now as quickly as possible and not to do that when it be right be the government still commit to job and security in the north east of scotland it do not feel like that live up there 
 i gently say to the hon lady that it have nothing whatsoever to do with ideology—[interruption it be about the government respond to a legal judgment of a court not just the court of session in this particular case but the supreme court on a decision take by the previous government to grant consent unlawfully we now have to respond to that supreme court judgment and ensure that any future application process be robust and do not end up in the court again that be what we be determined to do it will be for individual applicant to bring forward their application 
 on the wide point on job i be acutely aware of the importance of ensure that there be certainty in the north east of scotland i have spend a lot of time in this job make an effort to get to know not just the individual company but the supply chain support company and those on apprenticeship that work in the north east it be important to i as it be to the hon lady but i say to she and her whole party that we can not move forward simply say that oil and gas be the only future for the north east of scotland they be finite resource and we be clearly say that the balance require we to start invest now in the transition so that there be good well pay job for many generation to come 
 i welcome what my hon friend have say about the importance of the just transition and the need to move gradually to renewable he quote from our party ’s manifesto that 
 we will not issue new licence to explore new field 
 but i remind he that there be another part to that paragraph it say 
 because 
 there be a reason for it 
 they will not take a penny off bill can not make we energy secure and will only accelerate the worsen climate crisis 
 can he confirm that the oil barrel that would come out of rosebank would in fact not take a penny off bill can not make we energy secure and would only worsen the climate crisis
