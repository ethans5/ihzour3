i thank the hon lady and all other member of the committee for their engagement in this report and for the way in which they approach the work of the committee as a whole i may be slightly biased but i really think they be quite excellent in the way they go about their business i could not ask for a well membership 
 what we see at dover be truly shocking we be still close enough to lunch that i be not go to give too many detail but the photograph that be provide to the committee be truly horrendous the hon lady suggest that the control point at sevington and bastion point could be repurpose which be an obvious solution the condition in which the port health authority worker operate be disgraceful work in big shed that we probably would not keep cattle in with hole in the roof and pigeon fly around meanwhile just a few mile up the road there be purpose build facility where worker would at least be able to change into their personal protective equipment and have proper shower at the end of the day 
 i place on the record the committee ’s gratitude to and my personal admiration of luzy manzano and her team at the dover port health authority who   have do a remarkable job and a significant public service in bring this to the attention of the wide population 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance 
 the previous government ’s neglect of the railway see a decade of decline in passenger performance but we be start to see performance stabilise passenger be respond to these improvement and passenger number be up last year we be now work with the rail industry on a performance restoration framework with clear focus area include timetable resilience staffing and keep train safely move during disruptive event to help restore the performance that passenger deserve 
 i be sure i speak for all fellow mp on the west coast main line who be regular commuter on avanti when i say that have to plan our week around its appalling service and regular last minute delay and cancellation be among the bad part of the job my constituent both those travel north to wigan and cumbria and those travel south to london be feed up with the service which affect their ability to work visit family and travel for leisure what consideration have the secretary of state give to review whether avanti have breach the term of its franchise contract and accelerate the process by which it can be bring into public ownership 
 i be obviously sorry to hear about the issue that my hon friend and her constituent experience when attempt to travel on avanti west coast i know how frustrating these issue can be but let i reassure she that while performance have improve official continue to hold regular meeting with avanti and network rail to try to resolve matter we have always be clear that we will transfer operation to public ownership when contract end rather than spend money on break contract early we expect the transfer to have complete by the end of 
 last week london north eastern railway announce huge cut to rail service from berwick upon tweed station which serve not only the town of berwick but my constituent in the scottish borders and north northumberland the government promise more train but this be the opposite lner be now own by the government so will the secretary of state meet i and local resident so that we can explain the impact that the cut will have on local community 
 passenger on lner will benefit from the new december timetable which will bring an overall improvement in reliability and capacity but i would be very happy to ask the rail minister to speak to the hon gentleman about the particular issue at berwick upon tweed 
 i call the shadow minister 
 before i ask my question i would like to take a moment to reflect on the fact that last night a man lose his life a wife lose her husband and child lose their father because of political intolerance it be a personal tragedy but also a tragedy for the body politic i want to take a moment to recognise the importance of free speech in our democracy 
 the secretary of state quite rightly talk about improve rail performance yet we be in a city paralyse by strike action from the rmt the government claim that nationalise the railway under great british railways will bring untold improvement they be untold lord hendy tell we that there will be rigorous performance standard but he have repeatedly refuse to set out what they will be when will the secretary of state set out the standard by which the government ’s nationalisation experiment should be judge or be they still discuss they with the rmt 
 i associate myself with the hon gentleman ’s remark about the importance of free speech but i disagree with his assertion about improvement under great british railways conservative members know the value of bring train operating company into public ownership they do it themselves when they be in government back in they bring transpennine express into public control follow year of poor performance it be no surprise to i and labour members that since then transpennine express have have a reduction in cancellation and growth in passenger number

 fundamental to economic growth be a function transport system but face with tax hike and inflation bust fare rise people will find the secretary of   state ’s comment difficult to believe aslef strike on crosscountry our capital city hammer with tube strike and bus driver strike tomorrow next weekend manchester will see the big strike in year follow closely by strike in luton milton keynes stevenage hemel hempstead preston and even mr speaker chorley sir sadiq khan say that strike in london be nothing to do with he the department for transport downing street and the whole labour government say that they be nothing to do with they despite many of the union on strike be labour ’s multimillion pound funder so i ask the transport secretary will anyone anywhere in the labour government stand up for passenger face an autumn of discontent 
 before the secretary of state answer i say to the right hon gentleman that welcome the shadow secretary of state do not mean that he can then have an essay to portray question laughter 
 let i congratulate the right hon gentleman on his appointment i know he have experience as a transport minister and of course he have extensive experience of travel the length and breadth of the country before the last election search for that rarest thing a tory safe seat laughter

 we have freeze fuel duty that be what we have do we have also invest £ this year to fix pothole a record amount of money which will fix the equivalent of extra pothole 
 i also say gently to the right hon gentleman that i be a very proud representative of my home town in swindon search around the country for a safe seat be not something that i indulge in 
 right with all those pleasantry do we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 a transport system can support economic growth only if it provide a reliable service on which business and passenger can depend accord to the evening standard there have be incident of industrial action on tfl since sadiq khan become mayor with million of people inconvenience and business disrupt again this week in yet another tube strike can the secretary of state tell we what step she be take as a senior labour politician to sort out the mess cause by the labour mayor of london ’s failure to reach an agreement with his labour friend in the rmt a union that have give hundred of thousand of pound to their comrade on the government benches in recent year 
 i understand everyone ’s frustration with the tube strike i use public transport in london every week and i know that when the tube be down not only be there queue for bus but there be gridlock on our road it be right that the mayor of london have call for the rmt to get back around the table with tfl. that be what this government want and it be what the travel public want i will be talk to the director of operation at transport for london claire mann this afternoon to understand what the next step be in resolve this dispute

 learner driver in sunderland be feed up of wait of around week for a driving test in that time they be often face high cost and barrier in access job opportunity can the minister tell the house what step he be take to reduce driving test waiting time in sunderland and when he expect those wait to fall 
 obviously there be some issue with the close of the south shields drive test centre but no capacity be lose as a result of that we recognise the impact that high waiting time be have on learner driver across the country include in the constituency of sunderland central and the importance of help learner driver pass quickly on   september the driver and vehicle standards agency launch its late recruitment campaign which aim to recruit additional drive examiner resource to provide much need test capacity in sunderland gateshead gosforth and blythe 
 of my constituent write to i this week about the difficulty she be face rebooke her driving test the near slot that she could find be in swansea hour away from bath when she try the am rush she face a queue of and when she finally reach the front the site fail alongside test availability will the government review the quality and reliability of the booking system 
 we be absolutely committed to drive down the delay in these booking i would be delighted to chat far with the hon member to discuss the specific problem within her area 
 when drive test come up at transport question in may it be reveal that the wait time for a drive test on average be up from week in july to week now it have since be reveal that many test centre around the country have reach the maximum legal limit of a week wait will the minister acknowledge that for thousand of people up and down the country wait for a driving test wait for that step on the ladder to get their job or to college through the freedom of drive it be simply not good enough for the secretary of state to have push back the government ’s new target to fix this to real people need real answer now so will he redouble the effort to get the wait time at least back down to the point it be at when the last government leave office 
 we inherit a broken system in which many learner driver find themselves stick in a frustrating limbo unable to ditch their l plate we instruct the dvsa to take further measure this year and we be begin to see early sign of improvement we promise more test and we have deliver more test the dvsa carry out over more test between june and august this year and the pass rate remain at the high it have be since may there be still more to be do and we will do just that 
 the minister be right that there be still more to be do there be a lot more to be do he inherit a broken system from his own predecessor in the department for transport under whom the problem get significantly bad over the last year 
 i do not think the minister be listen to the country i can not be alone in have an inbox full of email from constituent complain about the wait time to get themselves or indeed their child a driving test my constituent sarah write 
 young people ’s work opportunity be significantly reduce by not be able to drive 
 particularly in rural england in this case steeple claydon in my constituency sarah set her alarm for every day to try to secure a test and the good she have manage be next february will the minister apologise to everybody up and down the land who set their alarm early because the government be make the situation a lot bad

 will the minister assure we that any enforcement power will be extend to local authority not just the police in order to make any regulation effective alongside that will he reassure we that local authority will have the power to make exception in area where such restriction would be impractical as be the case in many street in my horsham constituency 
 we of course continue to engage actively with local authority in the development of this policy local authority already have the power to restrict pavement parking wherever there be a need by introduce traffic regulation order and we be explore additional measure to help they to tackle the issue 
 on sunnyside avenue in tunstall in my stoke on trent north and kidsgrove constituency a particular issue with pavement parking occur outside mill hill primary academy where car dangerously mount kerb will the minister please outline what more can be do to keep our kid safe around our school

 share e scooter scheme can provide a great way to get around but the scooter can pose a nuisance for other people so we need to ensure that their roll out be both safe and properly regulate we have extend e scooter trial until may to allow local authority to test how the technology work we have also commit to pursue legislation when parliamentary time allow for the full regulation of micromobility in order to create a safe share use network where they work for all people 
 i declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for wheelchair user do the minister accept that a wheelchair whether manual or with power be a medical device that enable disabled people to maximise their independence and live the life they choose do he therefore agree that the terminology of invalid carriage in the legislation be discriminatory and outdated and that the regulation on the use of micromobility vehicle require update urgently

 i congratulate my parliamentary neighbour on his accession it be good to see his talent recognise 
 much of the technology currently use in sustainable aviation fuel be of foreign origin part of the reason for that be that no government body directly support the development of core technology use for that support only the development of production facility the aerospace technology institute for example should be able to invest in research and development programme to develop sustainable fuel but be currently not permit to do so will the minister look at allow that so we can accelerate the development of our own technology in this area

 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if she will make a statement on the process for the appointment of the united kingdom ’s ambassador to the united states 
 before i respond to the question it be important that as a house we all recognise that today be the anniversary of the   september   attack many of we will attend commemoration later and our thought be with all the thousand of people who lose their life in that despicable terrorist attack include many british and american citizen as well as those from many other country 
 the whole house ’s condolence and thought will also be with the family and friend of charlie kirk it be an absolutely appalling attack and murder yesterday in this house as we sit under the shield commemorate our dear colleague from across the political spectrum we know too well the terrible consequence of political violence i know that the whole house will be think of charlie ’s family friend and other and urge an end to that sort of political violence which be absolutely appalling 
 in light of additional information in email write by peter mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador to the united states the email show that the depth and extent of lord mandelson ’s relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment in particular lord mandelson ’s suggestion that jeffrey epstein ’s conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information in the light of that and mindful as we all be of the victim of epstein ’s appalling crime lord mandelson have be withdraw as ambassador with immediate effect 
 mr speaker i thank you for grant this urgent question and i agree with the word of the minister about   september   and charlie kirk 
 this be yet another extraordinary error of judgment by this weak prime minister i pay tribute to the leader of the opposition for yesterday secure justice for the victim of epstein this raise massive question it be not just that peter mandelson be epstein ’s good pal and say that he love he or that he broker a deal for he while he be business secretary but that as we now know he be work for epstein ’s early release after epstein be convict 
 the simple question be this be the minister now say that the prime minister do not know about any of that at the point when lord mandelson be appoint the minister should not say that the box be tick and the process follow what do the prime minister know at the point of lord mandelson ’s appointment the minister say this morning that his understanding be that all the information be present be that correct do the prime minister know will the government now publish all the document relate to peter mandelson ’s   vetting if the minister say that the prime minister do not know at the time when do he become aware of the revelation 
 peter mandelson quietly stay at epstein ’s house while epstein be in prison mandelson now say that he be wrong to think that epstein be innocent that be his defence but epstein have plead guilty there be huge question here do the us state department give any warning to our government ahead of this appointment do the prime minister ’s chief of staff sue gray give any warning have any employee of global counsel visit our washington embassy since peter mandelson ’s appointment 
 next week will be the state visit this be huge turmoil ahead of that and i can not believe that the government have put our monarch in this terrible position i be glad that peter mandelson have now go the foreign secretary have say that protect woman girl and victim be her priority how on earth do that square with the behaviour of the government over recent day squirm and twisting to try to protect peter mandelson rather than the victim 
 to be clear this be a government in which we have a corruption minister have to resign over link to corruption a former police officer have to resign over have not be clear with the police a housing minister have to resign over not pay tax on a house and now we have our ambassador to washington in the middle of the big scandal in washington this be a weak prime minister with error after error of judgment 
 the thing that we all need to be clear on across this house be that the victim of epstein be at the forefront of all our mind i be sure the hon gentleman will not disagree with that epstein be a despicable criminal who commit the most heinous crime and destroy the life of so many woman and girl 
 obviously the hon gentleman write his remark before the event in the last few hour but i reiterate what i say to he the email show that the depth and extent of lord mandelson ’s relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment in particular the suggestion that jeffrey epstein ’s conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information lord mandelson have resign and that decision have be take that be a very clear answer to the hon gentleman ’s question 
 i be sure i speak for the whole house in send our good wish to my hon friend   the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson   on the appalling fire at her office overnight we send our very good wish to she and her staff 
 may i thank the minister for his statement the prime minister have make exactly the right decision and i think that have to be acknowledge he have move at pace to put it right—[interruption do not be ridiculous treat this seriously 
 order please this be very important a lot of people will be listen to what be go on in this chamber so let we give some courtesy to each other 
 clearly the appointment process do not pick up these issue that be self evident can we have an assurance that there will be an inquiry into why that be not the case and that this house will be keep inform 
 i be not aware of the terrible incident that my hon friend refer to i have just be inform of that this morning i be sure the thought of the whole house will be with my hon friend   the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson i know how seriously you take the safety and security of member of this house mr speaker particularly in the light of international event and the tragic loss of colleague that underline all the more why we must be able to go about democratic debate in this country whatever our view in a safe and secure way 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald   for his comment on the decision as i say the decision have be take by the prime minister and the foreign secretary and lord mandelson have resign my hon friend ask about the process any candidate for ambassador position be subject to routine extensive vetting and background check as a matter of course i point he to the formal process outline in the diplomatic service code which highlight the robust security clearance and vetting process that all member of the diplomatic service undergo 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 our thought be with the friend and family of the victim of i also express my regret and sadness at the murder of charlie kirk and i hope that   the hon member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson   and her staff be all okay follow the incident at her office political violence should have absolutely no place in society 
 lord mandelson be task with oversee the uk ’s relationship with trump and the accusation surround he cast a damn shadow so it be right that the prime minister have withdraw his support for lord mandelson yesterday the prime minister stand by lord mandelson ’s appointment and confirm that rigorous background check have take place what have change since then question remain over what the government know and when about lord mandelson ’s relationship with the sex offender whom he have previously describe as his good pal do he resign or be he sack 
 it be vital that the civil service commission now investigate whether the ambassador break the diplomatic service code by fail to come clean over these revelation soon be the vetting process push through too fast will the minister confirm that an investigation will take place so that no such incident can happen again report have surface that the cabinet office suppress the release of a memo about mandelson ’s relationship because it could compromise relation with the us will the minister confirm whether that be the case 
 i thank the hon member for her remark regard my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south again i underline the importance of we all be able to go about our role   in a safe and secure way whatever our political view and belief in the light of international event particularly in the united states that should be at the forefront of our mind today 
 in the light of the additional information in the email write by lord mandelson i have be very clear that the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador that be very clear the decision be take by the prime minister and the foreign secretary those email show that the depth and extent of the relationship be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment 
 i associate myself with hon member condolence and concern about my hon friend   the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson 
 i thank the minister for his statement i too be disgusted and appal by epstein ’s action and my thought be with the victim of his crime will the minister confirm that we have an excellent deputy ambassador in washington who will ensure that our mission continue and that next week ’s visit will go ahead 
 we have an excellent team overall in british embassy washington indeed i pay tribute to the work of all our diplomatic service colleague across the world who do an excellent job in represent this country and ensure that our security and prosperity be at the forefront of their work of course our special relationship and unique security partnership with the united staes be crucially important i will be at the united states embassy later today it be our close and most important relationship i agree with my hon friend that there be an excellent team in british embassy washington 
 i call the father of the house 
 obviously this be a very sad day for the united states with and the assassination last night our relationship with the united states be crucial and there be a dark cloud over the upcoming state visit so will the minister forgive i if i give he some gentle advice in my experience of such scandal the cover up the lack of due process and allegation of cronyism be much more serious than any original offence or allege offence will he ensure that every single document about the process be release post haste include about the meeting that mandelson request with prime minister blair over epstein we need everything release straightaway and we need to move on and get a new ambassador 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the importance of our relationship with the united states the upcoming state visit be very important and we have an extensive team work on it his majesty the king be obviously very much look forward to welcome president trump and many many official be work diligently day and night to ensure the visit be a success i will not get into the individual issue and claim that the right hon gentleman make but what i will say be that this be a decisive action in the light of the additional information in email write by lord mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador 
 i would also like to offer my support to my hon friend   the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson that incident follow a number of other that she have experience this week it be out of order 
 i thank the minister for his statement and i be really pleased that lord mandelson have be sack but i would like to know what due diligence be undertake prior to his appointment everybody know about his relationship with epstein before it 
 as i have make very clear it be in the light of additional information and email write by lord mandelson that the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador in particular lord mandelson ’s suggestion that jeffrey epstein ’s conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information i know my hon friend well and i know that her thought and the thought of we all will be with the victim of epstein ’s appalling crime 
 the house need to understand the sheer size of the failure of the vetting process here it be in the public domain that peter mandelson have to resign for not tell the truth about an interest free loan and that he have to resign on a occasion because he have help a business friend to get a passport beyond that there be still unresolved doubt about his behaviour as the european trade commissioner when he give concession to the russians which help his other dubious close friend mr deripaska 
 on the positive vetting process for when peter mandelson come to be a minister again in section of the ministerial code say 
 minister must ensure that no conflict arise or could reasonably be perceive to arise between their public duty and their private interest financial or otherwise 
 secretary of state do not have private diary he spend time in mr epstein flat it seem quietly meet other people involve in the sempra deal that can not be see as follow his proper duty as secretary of state it be in the government document it do not have to be a private email be that investigate and be a judgment make on it 
 the right hon gentleman ask specifically about vetting as i have say all candidate for ambassador position be subject to routine extensive vetting and background check as a matter of course i point he to the formal process outline in the diplomatic service code which highlight the robust security clearance and vetting process that all member of the diplomatic service undergo again i point out that in the light of additional information in email write by lord mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador to the united states 
 i agree with the minister ’s utter condemnation of all the horrendous crime of jeffrey epstein do he agree that as soon as this new information come to light the government take decisive action very swiftly which be different from the conservative when they be in government and there be serious misgiving it be actually the independent ethic adviser who end up resign 
 i agree that this be decisive action the prime minister have act in the light of that additional information the foreign secretary have act and lord mandelson have be withdraw as ambassador to washington 
 i be sure that the minister be delighted that he have not have to shred his own reputation like his ministerial and cabinet colleague have have to do on the broadcast round over the course of recent day include this morning in try to defend lord mandelson and the lack of judgment show by the prime minister i do not know what it be about the decade of scandal and be good friend with a notorious child trafficker and paedophile which should have ring some alarm bell in no before this decision be take if i listen correctly the minister do not confirm to the father of the house that all relevant material will be publish do the prime minister know about these email prior to stand up at the dispatch box just yesterday to say he have confidence in mr mandelson and do he retain the labour whip in the house of lords 
 what i can commit to be that we will keep the house update on these matter a decisive decision have be make as i have make very clear all candidate be subject to routine extensive vetting and background check as a matter of course the prime minister in the light of the additional information have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador to washington in particular the email show that the depth and extent of lord mandelson ’s relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment but i agree of course with the right hon gentleman on the appalling crime commit by jeffrey epstein and the thought of all of we be with his victim as they be every day 
 i associate myself with the comment that other have make about the disgusting crime of jeffrey epstein 
 year ago today on i be sit in the tuc congress as a delegate when we be make aware of what have happen may i put on the record my tribute to the responder and public service worker in new york who come to the aid of people many of they be still pay the price today 
 a lot have change in politic in the past year of the motivation that get i into public life be about the lack of accountability that we see from senior ministers when the conservative party be in government their failure to resign when scandal come up and the failure of front benchers to take action so i welcome the swift action that this government have take now that new information have come to light can the minister assure we that lesson will be learn and that if these thing arise again this government will uphold the high standard and take the action need to protect public life 
 i can absolutely assure my hon friend of that and this be decisive action he refer to the   september   attack and i think we all remember where we be on that fateful and tragic day that be why we remember the victim particularly on the anniversary today 
 may i just point out that it be as plain as day after the exchange between the prime minister and my right hon friend the leader of the opposition yesterday that lord mandelson could not possibly carry on in his role why do the prime minister delay or do he have to wait to be tell what to do by morgan mcsweeney who be go to be the new ambassador and how quickly will the new ambassador be appoint at this absolutely critical time when russia be test the defence of nato country and we be show such a weak response 
 the hon gentleman who i be sure have visit our embassy in washington on many occasion will know that we have an excellent and dedicated team there as well of course in the foreign office in king charles street in london they be work on many aspect of that crucial security defence and economic relationship we be work diligently in preparation for the state visit and i commend they for that work 
 the hon gentleman ask about new information i have be very clear in the light of the additional information and email write by lord mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador i have go into the particular item and in the light of that and mindful of the victim of epstein ’s crime lord mandelson have be withdraw as ambassador with immediate effect 
 the prime minister have act swiftly and decisively what a contrast with the conservative party i note that the shadow foreign secretary be not in her place today what happen when she break the ministerial code the conservatives promote she do the minister agree that we will not take lecture on ethic from they 
 i have be very clear that the prime minister have act decisively on this matter and in the light of that additional information the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador to washington that be decisive action and that be respond to that information and i have explain the reason for it 
 rise 
 order   the hon member for camborne and redruth perran moon   have just mention another member i presume that he have contact she to let she know that he be go to do so be that the case 
 no mr speaker 
 please do not do that again we be mean to treat each other with respect this message be for all member if you be go to mention another member do they the courtesy of ensure that they be make aware of the fact 
 on the foreign affairs committee we have see the high calibre of career diplomat who usually take up the most senior ambassadorial appointment so it be not obvious to i why the british ambassador to the united states be a former mp in the email that have leak overnight it   appear that lord mandelson think that to govern be to schmooze he famously declare in an election victory speech that he be a fighter not a quitter yet he urge the convict paedophile jeffrey epstein that to fight for early release be the right thing and lord mandelson do not do the decent thing and quit do the minister regret the original appointment 
 the hon gentleman ask about precedent he will know that there be precedent and we do have excellent ambassador and high commissioner around the world he and i have meet many of they directly as they represent this country diligently i have be clear in the light of the additional information and email write by lord mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador in particular lord mandelson ’s suggestion that jeffrey epstein ’s conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information and the email show that the depth and extent of lord mandelson ’s relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment 
 the minister be a decent man and the house know that the business of the house be delay while he hurriedly have to rewrite the statement that he be expect to make but he be stretch the bound of credibility too far yesterday the prime minister tell the house that he have full confidence in a man who befriend the vilest of convict paedophile he should not have be appoint in the place that be a gross error of judgment and everybody in this house know it and the prime minister have to take responsibility now that lord mandelson have go will there be a cabinet office inquiry into the manner in which mandelson be negotiate with a convict paedophile while he be a minister 
 the right hon gentleman will understand why i will not comment from the dispatch box on his last remark what i will say be that the prime minister have act decisively in the light of the new information and he have take the decision to ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador again for the house ’s information the suggestion that jeffrey epstein ’s conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information the email show the depth and extent of the relationship be materially different from that know at the time of lord mandelson ’s appointment again in the light of that and mindful of the victim of epstein ’s crime he have be withdraw as ambassador with immediate effect 
 the idea that our country should be represent in america or on the world stage by somebody who try to get a paedophile out of prison early will fill we all with revulsion can the minister be clear he have say that the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw the ambassador he say the prime minister make the decision but he also say in his statement that mandelson resign do he resign or be he sack 
 i have be very clear the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador that be the process and he   be no long in his position i agree with the hon member about our absolute revulsion across this house at jeffrey epstein ’s crime 
 i concur with the comment about charlie kirk that the minister make at the beginning it show that anybody who be brave enough to put themselves up for public service and try to change the world for the well face such danger and risk 
 may i ask the minister to reassure we that we will have total transparency about the process that be follow in this ambassadorial appointment secondly assume we get over that hurdle can he please explain to the house why the appointment of a man who describe president trump as a danger to the world whom the americans describe as an absolute moron who have close link with china and who have a history of misfeasance in public office be the right appointment for the relationship with the most important and powerful country in the world and that be essential to this country 
 on the hon member ’s comment he and i fundamentally disagree on many issue but we know that we conduct our robust debate in this house in our medium and in our political society and we do not engage in any form of political violence what have happen in the united states over the past hour be simply appalling and our thought be with all of charlie kirk ’s family and friend as somebody who work very closely with our late colleague jo cox and david amess it have shock i to the core i think it have shock all of we to the core and it can never be acceptable 
 the hon member ask about the process and i have be very clear all candidate for ambassador position be subject to extensive vetting and background check as a matter of course and i refer he to the formal process outline in the diplomatic service code i assure he that we will keep the house update on these matter 
 while the whole house welcome the withdrawal of lord mandelson as head of mission can the minister confirm whether he be still be pay as a civil servant 
 my understanding be that lord mandelson be still an employee and proper employment process will take place but i will write to the hon member to confirm my answer to that question lord mandelson have recently be ask to withdraw as ambassador and i will come back to the hon member with a detailed answer but i do not want in any way to inadvertently mislead the house on an important matter 
 it seem that there be a broad consensus across the whole house that this feel as though it be a question of when not if so during the extended vetting procedure be there ever any interference or pressure from either no or the prime minister 
 as the hon member will know i simply be not go to go into the vetting procedure which be conduct independently he can certainly   look at the detail of how vetting process be under- take in the diplomatic service code which outline the process 
 the diplomatic service code state that diplomat 
 behaviour action or inaction must not significantly disrupt or damage the performance or reputation of the diplomatic service 
 it also state that diplomat 
 must set out the fact and relevant issue truthfully and correct any error as soon as possible 
 in the light of that do lord mandelson set out how many payment he have receive from the sanctioned russian oligarch oleg deripaska to account in this country switzerland or other area and have there be set of rule for civil servant and another set of rule for friend of the prime minister and jeffrey epstein
