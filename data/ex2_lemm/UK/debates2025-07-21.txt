 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of introduce alternative method of primary school assessment 
 mr speaker may i take this opportunity to thank all those who work in our school and wish they a well earn break over the summer holiday high and rise school standard be a non negotiable for this labour government as we seek to build a school system that enable every child to achieve and thrive our independent expert lead curriculum and assessment review have find that the current system for primary assessment be broadly work well however we will take on board any recommendation from the review panel when it report in the autumn 
 a recent survey by young minds find that over a of year pupil feel ill due to standard assessment test and over a quarter say they make they feel bad about themselves per cent of headteacher say that sats harm wellbee and doubt their accuracy our child and teacher be tell we that sats be break will the department consider a more holistic assessment approach that ensure the wellbeing of our child at such a young age 
 it be our ambition that all child get the chance not just to achieve at school but to thrive sat be carefully develop to ensure that they be   accessible it be clear that school should not over prepare child for the assessment at the expense of their wellbeing 
 it be so well know how damaging formal assessment can be for some child their wellbeing should be at the forefront of our mind i know that from primary school teacher in my bath constituency be it not time that we completely scrap sat 
 national curriculum test and assessment be crucial to support school in build strong foundation for child regardless of background and prior attainment we will continue to keep the matter under review of course child should not be make to feel stress they should be support to achieve and thrive in any assessment at school 
 what step she be take to recruit teacher 
 what step she be take to recruit new teacher 
 what step she be take to recruit new teacher 
 with the summer holiday just around the corner i want to say a huge thank you to everyone work across education for all their hard work this year improve the quality of teaching be the good way to drive up school standard support every child to achieve and thrive through our plan for change we will recruit an additional expert teacher in our school and college with an almost pay award we be make good progress with over more teacher in our secondary and special school 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on the department for education be more than a of the way through recruit those teacher a recent public accounts committee report show that school with a high proportion of disadvantaged pupil experience the bad teacher shortage will the secretary of state reassure i that extra effort will be put into recruiting and retain teacher at all those school 
 i give my hon friend that assurance and thank he for all the work he do for school right across his constituency recruit and retain more teacher particularly in the most disadvantaged area be critical to our opportunity mission but i be also delighted that initial teacher training acceptance be up in secondary that be positive progress be make with a increase in math and a increase in physics that be the change that the labour government be deliver 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response and for the government ’s commitment to recruit new teacher however as we know   dyslexic child tend to leave school or education with disproportionately low attainment level they be also over represent in the criminal justice system and often have low self esteem with much of that come from their experience in educational setting will the secretary of state outline how she will ensure that the recruitment of new teacher will bring in those who can meet the education need of dyslexic and neurodiverse child 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for all her work to support neurodiverse student in broxtowe and beyond from september thank to this labour government ’s reform all new teacher will receive year of evidence base training include significantly enhance content on support child with additional need we know there be much more we have to do so that all our student include those with special educational need and disability be able to achieve and thrive and i look forward to discuss that far with she very soon 
 as a former teacher i know that new school building not only help student progress but encourage teacher retention can the minister confirm that new school building be indeed part of this government ’s programme for change and will she commit to visit bradfields academy in my constituency a specialist send school that be invest million as part of the school rebuild programme 
 i be grateful to my hon friend i know he care deeply about outcome for child in chatham and aylesford and that he bring real experience to this house he be right to demonstrate the important role of the specialist sector he mention bradfields academy which have already secure a place on the school rebuild programme with the approval of the trust i would be delighted to arrange for i or of my colleague to visit and see the brilliant work they be do 
 this government be hamper school recruitment of new teacher they hike up the cost through the increase in employer national insurance contribution then the money promise to state school from charge vat on private school fee be spend on housing instead can the secretary of state tell the house how much the increase in employer national insurance contribution will cost school in total over this parliament 
 we be invest record sum in our state school the conservative party however want to take money out of our state school to give tax break back to private school that tell we everything we need to know about their priority 
 the headteacher of the thomas hardye school in west dorset previously work in a london school he tell i that in london he receive nearly £ per pupil but in west dorset nearly £ yet the challenge of rural education be no less complex not least in the recruitment of teacher what step be the secretary of state take to address the funding inequality face rural school to ensure that all pupil receive the teaching they deserve 
 we continue to keep all these area under review if the hon gentleman would like to write to i with more information i would be happy to respond with more detail however i be clear that this government be invest more in education we be turn around the year on year decline in teacher number with well pay more support on workload and more money for our school include tackle child poverty that be the difference that a labour government be make for our country 
 the government have try to have it every which way on these elusive extra teacher if the labour manifesto have mean that only secondary teacher count but they could be in any subject presumably that be what it would have say what it actually say be new specialist teacher in key subject so will the secretary of state enlighten we what be those subject 
 i would be very happy to do so as the right hon gentleman just hear we be see big increase in initial teacher training acceptance in many of those key subject such as math and science on the commitment we have make we have few child in primary over the course of the last year and as a former holder of this office he would rightly expect that we target our effort in area of great need sadly we be see a big decline in the number of child in primary with the number forecast to fall by another over the next few year so we be focus our effort where they be need 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state just say that the government be turn around decline in teacher number under the last government the number of teacher go up by under this government it be down by that be the opposite of the truth 
 thing that drive people out of teaching be poor discipline yet the government have abolish behaviour hub despite the evidence that they be work the government say they would put in place new behaviour ambassador who be suppose to be in place on   july but the contract have now lapse and the position be vacant why the delay on this vital issue 
 that be very shouty from the shadow minister and as per usual very negative about what we be see across education we be turn around the problem that the conservatives leave behind on teacher recruitment and retention we be increase attendance in our school and improve behaviour a challenge that i completely agree school need support to deal with put more money back into parent pocket and tackle child poverty the conservatives have only policy and that be to give a tax break to private school 
 what step she be take to improve mental health support in school 
 this government be commit to improve mental health support for all child and young people that be why we be provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school by expand mental health support team so that every child and young person have access to early support to address problem before they escalate

 i would like to take this opportunity to celebrate the great gain that the labour government have make through our plan for change since enter power we have cut red tape tilt the system towards young people and commit unprecedented investment for our school system we be go far and fast with our post-16 education and skill strategy 
 the apprenticeship levy be collect equally across the united kingdom but unfortunately it come back to northern ireland under the barnett consequential will the minister look at an option for a system in which those employer who contribute to the apprenticeship levy can draw it back directly to support apprentice employ in their company 
 i thank the hon member for his question and his thoughtfulness regard the levy and its operation as he be fully aware skill be a devolved matter and funding in the devolved administration remain the responsibility of that government we will continue to engage with the devolved administrations as we develop the levy fund growth and skill offer for england 
 i be recently lucky enough to visit brigg infant school in south normanton it be a gorgeous school full of talented pupil and dedicated staff but it have a problem and year old be be teach in a prefab building that be not fit for purpose i love to see the way that we invest in education but these child have be let down by the previous government do the minister agree that they deserve a classroom that be fit to be teach in and will she look at this case 
 i thank my hon friend for her thoughtful question on the prefab we have a plan to build and i will take up this matter far with the appropriate minister 
 i call the shadow minister 
 before the election labour say that it would allow employer to take of their apprenticeship levy money and spend it on other thing but since the a while election different minister have say different thing about whether that be still happen the skills minister say it would all depend on the spending review but of course the spending review be back will business be able to take out as labour promise or not 
 i thank the hon member for his question we be a government who continue to invest in education we have flexibility available and we have foundation apprenticeship and short apprenticeship we be absolutely invest in young people to get they into the right job

 what step she be take to improve the quality of the further education estate 
 excellent further education college be a key building block of the government ’s opportunity and growth mission the government be commit to improve the condition of school and college in england and will invest nearly £ per year by rise from £ in 
 the old survive locomotive roundhouse in britain be in derby and what be once at the forefront of victorian engineering be now a cutting edge learning environment for local young people who will build the home of the future but the site be full to burst derby college need more space do the minister agree that if it become a construction technical excellence college it could extend its site increase its capacity in brickwork carpentry and joinery by and teach more student the construction skill we desperately need

 i know that the minister will agree with i that in exeter we have of the country ’s most outstanding fe institution exeter college be rat outstanding by ofsted and as strong in its approach to meet the skill need of our area the time a college have achieve both exeter math school be also rat outstanding and give student from across the south west the opportunity to specialise in math physics and computing but as my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson   say that success come with its own challenge both be burst at the seam and need capital investment to allow they to expand and continue their exceptional work do the minister agree that exeter college could also be an exceptional candidate to become a construction technical excellence college for the south west and will he meet i to discuss the way in which we can support those change 
 i join my hon friend in recognise the success of exeter college and exeter math school which be both outstanding as he will know the government have announce capital funding to improve the condition of the estate and accommodate rise student number as we hope to replicate the success of these setting across the country

 ensure that school and college have the resource and building that they need be key to our mission to break down barrier to opportunity and ensure that every child can succeed and thrive as always i be very happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer as always   the hon member for derby north catherine atkinson   refer to the construction sector be it time perhaps to think outside the circle of what we usually do through deal and partnership with construction company that would give we the opportunity to improve the education and college estate while make people available and knowledgeable for job in their future life whether in construction or otherwise it be time for partnership let we do something perhaps a wee bit different 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right the construction sector be fundamental to the uk economy that be why the government ’s industrial strategy include a construction sector deal we have commit £ to support construction skill training and that funding include capital investment through   the establishment of technical excellence college and the creation of an employer match funding pot worth £ 
 what step she be take to increase the number of child meet the early learn goal 
 what step her department be take to ensure more child receive support during their early year

 i thank the minister for join i at curwen primary school in plaistow recently to see its excellent early year education work he hear from parent about the struggle they often face as a result of serious economic and housing hardship will he assure my constituent that the government will look at community like mine where housing and poverty create serious challenge for family to ensure that all child no matter their circumstance get the good possible educational start in life 
 i thank my hon friend for our excellent visit to curwen primary school last week where i see excellent work on support child ’s speech and language to deliver for some of our most vulnerable child and family our spending review commitment be a downpayment on the child poverty strategy to build on expand free breakfast club and free school meal boost the national minimum wage and cap universal credit deduction through the fair repayment rate 
 sure start which be create by the previous labour government boost attainment improve health outcome and increase long term earning however under the conservatives more than child ’s centre in derbyshire be closed and derbyshire now do not have a single family hub what action will the government take to ensure that more young child in derbyshire can once again access support during their early year 
 it be a pleasure to visit my hon friend ’s constituency recently too he be a real champion for child and young people we will fund best start family hub in every local authority include in derbyshire we estimate that the expansion could reach half a child across the country good start family hub will be open to all and base in disadvantaged community where they be need most 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i join ministers in thank our school and college staff up and down the country for their dedication i wish they happy and restorative summer holiday 
 child with special educational need who start reception last year be over a year behind their peer accord to the education policy institute staggeringly those with an education health and care plan be already over month behind the wide gap that the epi have record since it start monitor in give the importance of the early year in narrow the gap it be crucial that we give every child the help that they need as soon as possible will the minister confirm how much of the £ for send transformation announce in the spending review will go towards early identification and intervention 
 the government be commit to ensure excellence for everyone so that child have the support skill and opportunity that they need and that start in early year we be actively work with parent and expert on solution include more early intervention to prevent need from escalate any change we make will improve support for child and parent stop parent have to fight for support and protect current effective provision 
 what step her department be take to ensure adequate funding for send provision 
 i be grateful to my hon friend that important question labour be provide £ more for high need budget and also provide council with £ of capital funding to improve support for child with send in specialist and mainstream school this investment will lay the foundation for the well system that child with send need work with expert we will set out our plan in the school white paper in the autumn 
 the last government leave behind a send system that be fail child and family parent be make to fight for support with education health and care plan deny or delayed and vital service take away tory cut to early year support rise poverty and extreme deprivation in blackpool as well as the pandemic hit our child hard than most have all combine to deepen the crisis face our most vulnerable young people what step be the education secretary take to ensure child in disadvantaged community like mine where the need be high and support often fall short receive the targeted send support they urgently require 
 my hon friend be a powerful champion for his constituent and for blackpool and he be right that far too many child be not currently get the support they need in order to thrive early intervention be key more support at the early possible point to identify where child might be struggle and to make sure that they get the help they need that be why i be very proud to announce to the house that build on the proud labour legacy of sure start we    will be roll out best start family hub to make sure that we have well family support service in every part of our country include my hon friend ’s community 
 the secretary of state know that out of county placement be very expensive and highly unsatisfactory both for pupil and for family will she therefore confirm that the excellent news that we have last year about a new send school be build at bitham park in westbury will go ahead to the advantage of child and importantly their family and can she assure i it be not go to be cancel in the proposal she have allude to 
 i will happily write to the right hon gentleman in relation to his constituency case we be look carefully at all the proposal we inherit when we come in as a new government but the assurance i can give he be that through the spending review we secure additional investment not just for revenue funding but also for capital funding to make sure that we be create the specialist place that be need in both the mainstream and also the specialist sector which have an enormous amount of expertise sadly i have hear far too many case of the kind that he describe where child be be force to travel considerable distance away from their local community and their friend because of an absence of specialist place we be determined to improve that 
 will the secretary of state join i in congratulate the staff pupil and governor at henry tyndale community school on the official opening today of their new park campus in aldershot a vital new facility for student age to with complex learning difficulty this outstanding school be name after henry tyndale who give decade of tireless service as a volunteer fundraiser and friend to child with the great difficulty and whose legacy continue to shape the school ’s inclusive spirit what step be the government take to support the creation of more school like henry tyndale so that child with send in my community and beyond have access to the high quality specialist environment they deserve 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the amazing work in the specialist sector and the tremendous expertise knowledge and passion that so many people bring to support child with some of the most complex need that be why how we can deliver well outcome for child with send be at the forefront of all of our mind as we bring forward any reform to the system that will be our guide principle it must be our guide principle so alongside well mainstream inclusion we will of course make sure that there be the specialist provision necessary for the child who need it 
 i have hear from and meet with numerous constituent who be parent of child with special educational need all frustrated with the way that the system currently work i welcome the secretary of state say she want outcome for child to be at the centre of reform but a parent of a child with an ehcp which help they to be in mainstream education recently tell   i of the fear and horror she feel when she hear about potential government reform due to the risk of her son lose the ability to stay in a school that have in her word be an absolute godsend for he can the secretary of state assure parent that her reform will not take away support that child currently have and will ensure that every child have the support they need to genuinely thrive 
 i can be clear that child with send have a legal right to additional support and labour will always protect that i would say however that we all have a responsibility in how we approach the issue a responsibility not to cause undue alarm among parent who be experience a system that be not work and that be too adversarial i believe that a well system will be deliver we can make sure that child get early timely support that be much more effective and focus on their outcome the plan that we will set out later this year will be shape by all the conversation with the parent who she describe conversation that i too have have and with expert school leader and campaigner to make sure that we get they right 
 i call the shadow minister 
 parent be get in touch with mps across the country to ask whether exist special need support will continue under the plan reform the minister for school standards have say that the government will not remove effective support but what do that word effective mean who will judge what be effective and on what basis why will the government not just guarantee that all child will keep the support that they currently have 
 as i say in response to   the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns child with send have a legal right to additional support we will not just protect it but improve it we will deliver well outcome and support for child with send 
 i do not know how the shadow minister have the brass neck to stand there and ask that question give that the conservatives leave behind a system that their last education secretary describe as lose lose lose it be for that reason that we deal with so many question on this topic every time we gather for education question what we have at the moment be not work by any objective measure child be be fail and parent be be fail it fall to the labour government to deliver the well system of support that all our child with send desperately need 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of the use of smartphone in school on level of disruption in classroom 
 what step she be take to support school that plan to ban smartphone 
 mobile phone have no place in school government guidance be clear that school should prohibit the use of device with smart technology   throughout the school day research from the children ’s commissioner show that of primary school and of secondary school already have policy restrict the use of mobile phone 
 many of the young people i meet in school across epping forest be clear that they agree with the local school policy of restrict mobile phone when they be at school sadly however the government have repeatedly refuse to heed conservative call to protect our child with a national ban on phone in school even vote against it body such as unesco and the oecd be crystal clear about the negative impact of phone on young people ’s education so when will the government listen to the evidence and to our school leader and support a ban on smartphone in school for the sake of our young people ’s education and mental health 
 i have say that phone should not be out in school and head have the power to enforce that the opposition back those measure if they feel they need to go far they have long year in which to do so 
 last thursday i feel the fear in a hall full of parent of primary school child in totnes as they listen to campaigner go through the evidence of the impact of smartphone on kid at secondary school there be a clear safeguarding issue around kid see video of hardcore pornography and violence 
 i be therefore pleased that tina graham the head of kingsbridge community college have just announce a smartphone free policy from september to protect child which will mean no phone in school at all except for reasonable adjustment that be a much well policy than the not see put it in your bag policy that most school follow in the light of such safeguarding concern where every child be only as safe as the least safe phone in school why will the minister not do the thing that could transform our child ’s mental and physical health and school attainment and direct all school to go smartphone free 
 order please this be not fair i have to get other in i call the minister 
 the hon lady ’s question demonstrate that mobile phone have no place in school and there be already guidance to reflect that the mobile phone in school guidance be clear and school should prohibit the use of device with smart technology throughout the school day include during lesson transition and break we expect all school to take step in line with that guidance to ensure that mobile phone do not disrupt pupil learning if pupil fail to follow those rule school should have the power to confiscate device 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the other place baroness smith of malvern a minister in the department for education say 
 there be no clear scientific consensus on   a negative impact from screen time and social medium use on the mental health and neurological or functional development of child and young people ”—[official report house of lords   june vol c. 
 i fundamentally disagree there be overwhelming and extensive evidence of the harm cause so i want to know the government ’s position do the minister agree with his ministerial colleague or with i on this issue 
 last year the right hon lady ’s government claim that action on mobile phone be prohibit their use in school and that guidance mean 
 a consistent approach across all school 
 those be their word in back the tory government ’s measure be she wrong then or be she wrong now 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of funding for form college 
 i take this opportunity to thank all post-16 provider and staff for their tireless work over the last academic year and wish they a restful summer break follow the autumn budget this government make available more than £ extra plan spending on to-19 education in the financial year since then an additional £ for have be make available to respond to to-19 demographic growth and other pressure on the system create opportunity for young people to succeed 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be a governor of the city of stoke on trent form college and the chair of the all party parliamentary group on form education i thank the minister for her answer the additional capital available for post-16 provider be very welcome the city of stoke on trent form college be see a huge increase in interest around science healthcare science and computer science subject that be mission critical to the delivery of the government ’s ambitious programme when will the capital be available so that my form and other around the country can build high quality learning environment for young learner 
 i thank my hon friend for mention his fantastic city of stoke on trent form college i reassure he and other member that this government be commit to ensure that there be a place in education or training for every to year old who want detail of the £ of capital investment to accommodate additional learner enter the system will be announce in due course 
 a report present to the appg for care experience child and young people reveal that more than young people in care either move placement or leave care during their a level exam period what step be the minister take to ensure that school and college be properly equip to support care experience student face such instability at a crucial point in their education 
 i thank the hon member for her thought provoke question she really advocate for care leaver and for ensure that they have the durability they need   at school to ensure they have a seamless experience i reassure she that care leaver who start an apprenticeship be entitle to £ bursary and local authority must provide a £ bursary for care leaver who go on to university let i just say that this government be extremely concerned with education not be break for care leaver and ensure that we support they in every which way we can 
 what step she be take to support child with send who do not have an education health and care plan 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with send 
 we be engage extensively with family and expert as we seek to improve support for child with special educational need and disability we have invest £ into high need budget and £ into create more specialist place we be roll out scheme from the partnership for inclusion of neurodiversity in school the pins programme to inclusion which be lay the groundwork for long term reform we be build a system in which every child can achieve and thrive 
 i thank the minister for that answer on friday i have the opportunity to visit the outstanding springfield primary school in my constituency it have pupil of whom have education health and care plan with application in currently can the minister reassure the parent of those child and the many many parent across the country that while this review into ehcp be go on local education authority will not slow roll exist application or fail they as a default in order for they to go to tribunal and try to beat the clock 
 we have yet to decide on the future of education health and care plan but we be extremely focused on strengthen the support system so that every child can receive timely high quality help we will set out further detail about our approach to special educational need in this autumn ’s white paper in the meantime obviously child should be get the support they need and we be put in the groundwork so that more child can have that 
 we know that early intervention be most effective for child with sen but too many child in my constituency of morecambe and lunesdale have be let down in that respect however lancashire be for the time receive funding for best start hub can the minister tell i how that will improve early support for those child 
 as i say we be already invest in support child and their family include through best start family hub as my hon friend mention we want to ensure that all child have access to a family service professional who be train to support inclusion can identify where child have additional need ahead of start school and can support parent to navigate service 
 if she will provide a timeline for the completion of construction work at the magna carta school in egham 
 ensure that school and college have the resource and building they need be a key part of our mission to break down the barrier to opportunity and give every child the good start in life for this project i can confirm that the department be in the process of finalise the feasibility study and we expect to procure the work later this year until that process be complete we will be unable to advise on the length of the construction programme however positive progress continue to be make in collaboration with the trust 
 i thank the minister for his answer can he clarify whether the magna carta school will have a full rebuild due to the presence of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete or be it just the science and art block that will be rebuild will he meet i to discuss this issue and the work that will take place on such a fantastic local school 
 i be very happy to meet the hon member 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of virtual teacher on school child 
 this government be commit to ensure that every child can access the tool they need in order to achieve and thrive we inherit a challenge workforce picture from the previous government which be why we be commit to recruit an additional teacher we be back teacher and restore teaching to be a highly value profession there be no doubt that technology have a key role to play in drive high and rise standard at school however the most important factor for high quality education be have an expert teacher at the front of the classroom 
 in rossendale the academy trust that run our stuck school valley leadership academy recently announce plan to introduce a virtual teacher for top set math this approach have understandably raise a lot of concern and i have be work with the trust to make sure it be design in the pupil good interest i have be assure that this will be a temporary measure that a qualified math teacher will be in the room to provide additional support and that an appropriate range of adjustment will be make for send pupil however i remain concerned that without safeguard virtual teacher may become a default cost save measure to address recruitment challenge will the minister share her view on how we can ensure that such an approach be always design in pupil good interest 
 order come on andy i call the minister 
 technology have the potential to enhance time efficiency for teacher reduce workload and improve student engagement and attainment but it can not replace the valuable relationship between teacher and pupil we know that high quality teaching have the big impact on a child ’s educational outcome school leader rightly have the autonomy to make decision about staff deployment and they be well place to make decision about the need of their pupil 
 what step she be take to increase security in school against bomb threat 
 safeguard child in school be a priority for this government and school have a critical role to play in protect child and keep they safe departmental guidance be clear that school and college should have a policy and an emergency plan in place to manage and respond to security relate incident 
 i thank the minister for his response and for our recent meeting give that we have have fake bomb threat in swindon which have obviously have a negative impact on my school will he assess the current guidance so that we can learn lesson from what have happen in swindon and improve that guidance for the future 
 i thank my hon friend for our meeting last week as i explain to he then the department for education publish the protective security and preparedness guidance which set out how school should respond to bomb threat and how to embed a security culture action counter terrorism for education e learning which include information on what to do in the event of a bomb threat be also available to all school staff 
 what step she be take to help rebuild school 
 this government have make a long term commitment to improve the condition of school and college we be invest almost £ in the school rebuilding programme through to deliver rebuilding project at over school across england include school in scarborough and whitby a further school will be select within the next year by we will also be invest almost £ per year in capital maintenance for school and college and that figure will rise to £ this year 
 springhead form in scarborough have be rat outstanding for the education and care it provide for student with complex special educational need and disability the staff be amazing but the form be house in an old and unsuitable building when i visit springhead i see student be tutor in a modify corridor due to overcrowding   what step be the minister take to ensure that pupil with special educational need be educate in school building that can match those need 
 we have increase funding to improve the condition of school to £ for which include more than £ for north yorkshire to invest in its maintain school include springhead north yorkshire have also be allocate £ for to provide suitable and accessible school place for pupil with send who require alternative provision 
 a number of year ago woodfield school in bilton in my constituency be closed it have be rebuild as a specialist school for child with autism it be mean to open in september last year but that be delay until september this year will the minister meet i and confirm whether it will open on time this september 
 i be happy to meet the hon member 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of propose reform to education health and care plan on child with send 
 give the lose lose lose system that the last government leave behind in their own word we be work hard to reform the system so that every child can achieve and thrive any reform will be guide by how we improve support for child with send there will always be a legal right to additional support which this government will protect 
 give that answer i will quote the secretary of state she be say early that the system be so distorted that the financial allocation do not reflect the real need of child that mean that local authority have huge deficit through no fault of their own they be try to do their job when she come up with her new policy in the autumn will she commit to write off those deficit so that those authority can do the job in the future 
 as part of our reform we will commence a phase transition process which will include work with local authority to manage their send system include their deficit alongside an extension to the statutory override until the end of we will set out more detail about the plan for how we will support local authority with the historical and accruing deficit accumulate under the last government and since due to the appalling situation that we inherit 
 on friday i have the privilege of spend a good few hour with send parent in my constituency talk about what do not work under the current system and what we would like to see change there be a lot of frustration and a lot of tear they be honest and open about their upset at the current system but there be also a lot of idea and a determination to make change happen so that   those who come after we do not have to go through the same stress and anxiety that we do as send parent will the secretary of state guarantee that the voice of parent carer and family will be integral to form the school white paper that be due out in the autumn 
 i can give my hon friend that reassurance i know that she be incredibly passionate about improve the send system and this government share that passion we be not only determined to restore the trust of parent by ensure that school and local area can well identify and support child we be also work with parent and family to create that system which we know will improve outcome for child and their family 
 what step she be take to support young people into apprenticeship 
 labour be rebalancing opportunity towards young people give they the skill they need to get on apprenticeship start achievement and participation be all up under this government from august we be introduce foundation apprenticeship to support young people into career in critical sector such as construction and health and social care 
 i feel sure that the minister be aware that the outstanding west suffolk college in bury st edmunds with more than enrol student be part of the outstanding eastern education group under the leadership of nikos savvas do she agree that west suffolk college be an outstanding candidate to be award the status of be the construction technical college of excellence for the east of england that would boost skill in construction which be crucial for the new west suffolk hospital and the sizewell c construction site which be the large construction site in europe 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and indeed for his lobbying labour ’s technical excellence college will be crucial to our plan to rewire our school system to unlock opportunity for young people and drive growth for our country my hon friend be right west suffolk college be an outstanding provider and i be sure that its remarkable achievement will be consider during the selection of our technical excellence college 
 degree apprenticeship be great for social mobility and for matching skill to the economy and i be such a fan of they that i create in my parliamentary office would the secretary of state like to take the time for congratulate jack kellas who have achieve not just a distinction in his apprenticeship but a class honour degree from the university of lincoln and will she do all that she can to ensure that more people have opportunity to take part in degree apprenticeship and achieve the same success as jack 
 i thank the hon member for share jack kellas ’s wonderful achievement level apprenticeship be a core part of our offer and we continue to fund they 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility

 this labour government believe that child grow up in our country deserve the very good start in life which be why we be invest nearly £ over the next year to transform early year and family service that will include £ to roll out good start family hub in every local authority honour the proud legacy of sure start and ensure that every family can thrive regardless of postcode or income labour be build back the crucial family service that be decimate by the tories provide high quality support for parent baby and child from pregnancy onwards and we be only just get start 
 last week i visit the outwood academy school in kirkby in ashfield which have go from double special measure to good in just year under the leadership of the outwood grange academies trust will the secretary of state please say a big thank you to the trust and the staff for help to turn the school around and give the child in my town the education that they deserve 
 like the hon gentleman i welcome the hard work of our teacher leader and support staff and i be always pleased to hear about improvement in standard this government be ambitious for every child and our new regional improvement in standard and excellence team be work across school to bring together leader with experience in turn school around what i would say to the hon gentleman ’s constituent be that thank to this labour government thousand of child will now benefit from free school meal the new breakfast club that be open in his constituency will be a big boost to his constituent and we be deliver new funding for best start family hub that be the difference that a labour government be make for his constituent 
 it remain a reality that it be possible to take a gcse in russian but not in ukrainian and i have resolve to do   my part to help because i believe that a ukrainian gcse should be available to all as this be a topical question i bring some encouraging news i have write to all the exam board 
 order topical question should be quick 
 it will be mr speaker absolutely topical and quick 
 aqa have report back to i that it be very open to the idea but it need to see evidence that we have enough ukraine speak teacher who be willing to teach the subject and to mark the paper the good news be that with support from parliamentary colleague i have find teacher who can do just that do my hon friend agree that it should now be just a matter of time before a ukrainian gcse be available to all 
 my hon friend clearly know that the decision to create any new gcse be make by an independent award organisation but i have also meet the ukrainian education minister and i know how important this issue be to ukrainian family live in the united kingdom and to other the secretary of state have write to the award organisation to encourage they to create a ukrainian gcse i be now well aware of my hon friend ’s interest in the issue and i be more than happy to convey it as well 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i completely support the secretary of state ’s opening word and my thought and prayer be with all those affect by the devastating incident 
 government document state that the step in achieve their primary school readiness mission be meet their target of recruit teacher the secretary of state claim at the last oral question that she have always be clear that the teacher be in secondary school if that be true can she explain how secondary school teacher recruitment contribute to improve primary school readiness for year old 
 this labour government be deliver the teacher that be desperately need right across our school we be leave behind a terrible crisis when it come to recruitment and retention but this labour government know that improve standard in our school require have the good possible teacher available to teach all our child that be why we deliver a pay award and why we be make sure that we be tackle all the issue around workload we be get on and deliver the plan for change the right hon lady come here with the same relentless negativity week in week out we be deliver new free breakfast club free school meal cheap uniform high quality childcare and more apprenticeship that be the difference the labour government be make 
 this be farcical will the secretary of state finally admit that the original pledge to hire teacher include primary school teacher and that the government be now abandon their pledge the reality be that accord to their own website there be few teacher than last year 
 there be few child in primary school this year i know the right hon lady be at the treasury so i would expect a bit more when it come to her math it would be nonsensical to recruit even more primary school teacher when we have fall roll we be focus our effort where they be need and i be delighted that we be see big increase in the number of secondary math teacher secondary physics teacher and secondary stem teacher there be big increase right across the board that be what labour be deliver 
 last week i have the pleasure of host in parliament the outcomes group a group of specialist send school they present their proposal for fix the broken send system include support more child in mainstream education support collaboration between school and upskille teacher do the minister agree that those be exactly the sort of change that be need to fix the send system and will she meet i and the school in my constituency to learn more 
 indeed we be build a reform system in which child and young people ’s need will be identify early so that evidence base support can be provide at the early opportunity early this year i be pleased to open benton house a special school in my constituency that be also run by the outcomes group it be great to see such a well resource facility support child with complex need i would be delighted to hear more about the work in my hon friend ’s constituency and the proposal 
 rise 
 order please we have to try to get in as many member as possible i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i echo the secretary of state ’s remark about the tragedy in minehead my thought and prayer be with all those affect 
 every parent who put a baby into childcare want to know that they be safe in the light of the crucial role that cctv play in the harrowing case at twickenham green nursery in my constituency which result in a nursery worker be convict of count of child cruelty last month and in the tragic case of gigi meehan in cheadle will the secretary of state commit to issue fresh guidance to nursery on the use and regular monitoring of cctv footage 
 the hon member will know that i meet the family of genevieve meehan recently that be a tragic case we need to make sure that we be do everything we possibly can to protect child in nursery setting that be why i be pleased that in the good start in life strategy publish just week ago we commit to have early year setting inspect within month and indeed within year i have offer a meeting with the hon member and i be very happy to discuss these issue far 
 apprenticeship should be open to everyone i have meet too many young people in doncaster   east and the isle of axholme who be more than capable of do the job they have the hand on skill the attitude and the drive to work but be be hold back from apprenticeship because they have to get a grade in english or math when will the government move forward with reform the rule so that we stop shut out good people from good job just because they do not get a pass in the classroom 
 i absolute agree with my hon friend this government will indeed stop shut good people out of good job he be probably aware that the department fund apprentice to achieve a qualification as part of their training we do not set entry requirement these be decision for employer however we have allow for more flexibility in english and math requirement for adult age and over 
 child in receipt of fund from the adoption and special guardianship support fund often have significant mental health wellbee and educational need for many of these child their individual therapy be the single big factor enable they to continue at school what assessment have the minister make of the implication of cut funding for this therapy 
 the adoption and special guardianship support fund provide valuable therapeutic support to child and family which be why we have commit to continue the £ to this financial year we have be hold discussion with key stakeholder and we will soon announce the next step for the fund 
 as well as be the governor of a form college i be proud to be a governor of the abbey hill special school in stoke on trent i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests accordingly which be why i be so appalled by the comment of the reform uk chairman that child with special need be naughty child often as the result of bad parenting can i invite the secretary of state to condemn those comment and to reaffirm our support for those child and parent 
 i join my hon friend in condemn those remark i be aware that the reform uk leader say in similar comment 
 i ’m not be heartless i ’m be frank 
 well i will be frank reform uk would plunge the send system into further disarray only labour will back the child with send who need support 
 the citizenaid aid charity provide excellent education in emergency situation to child and young people i have write to the scottish education department to invite it to introduce it to the curriculum be there any interest from the department for education down here 
 if the hon gentleman would write to i i will look into that far 
 meaningful work experience can be a life changer for our young child cut the risk of their be out of education employment or training the derby promise   be hard at work link school with employer to raise the aspiration of our young people do the minister agree with i and do she recognise the valuable work that the derby promise deliver in open door for young people 
 i do indeed agree with my hon friend and i applaud he for the work he do on the derby promise before he enter this place and for all he have do for child in derby south since i be delighted that employer such as rolls royce have sign up to the derby promise to bring industry close to young people and to inspire their future career 
 essex have see a huge increase in the number of request for education health and care need assessment and be fail to meet the target in part due to the difficulty of recruit educational psychologist rather than try to bury the problem by scrap education health and care plan can the minister say what the government be do to meet that need 
 the right hon gentleman be pre empte decision before they have be make we have not make decision about the future of ehcp we be listen carefully and work with the sector to make sure we have the workforce in the system and the support system to identify need early we will continue to do that and we will work with family to design a system that work rather than the we inherit 
 york be seek to advance new model of support for child with send that be inclusive and provide opportunity include great curriculum flexibility to deliver a broad education in small group and a life skill curriculum so child be equip to navigate the world around they safely would the minister support city of york council to deliver such measure 
 the hon lady will know that a curriculum and assessment review be currently be undertake by an independent panel we be keen that the curriculum be broad and rich but also inclusive we will be respond when the panel report with its recommendation in the autumn 
 when the secretary of state talk of such a large reduction in the number of anticipate future primary school pupil do she attribute any part of that to a wish by certain community to develop a parallel education system rather than engage in full integration with this country 
 i be not quite clear what the right hon gentleman be drive at with that question what i have say in response to the very sharp decline in the birth rate be that as a government we want to make sure that people be able to make choice that be right for they include around family size my concern be that too many young people because of the inaccessibility of housing and the challenge they face in the job market be make decision they do not necessarily   want to make that be why the expansion of childcare for example be a critical part of how we be support family 
 those work in our school in south gloucestershire do a brilliant job but they receive the low funding per pupil in all of england via a funding formula inherit from the previous government do the minister have plan to review the formula as part of the impactful wide work to ensure that every child receive the education they need to thrive no matter where they live 
 we recognise that school be work incredibly hard to deliver in their community there be a whole range of factor that impact school funding include their rural or urban nature and pupil number we have discuss decline roll we will continue to keep the school funding formula under review that do take time and it have to be do very carefully to ensure certainty for school about their funding planning 
 last year ehcp be issue in cambridgeshire with few than complete within the statutory week deadline cambridgeshire county council now rank as the bad nationally for meet the timeline on their delivery with of send tribunal finding in favour of the parent what step be the secretary of state take to improve the process that see so many application require a tribunal and to improve the delivery of ehcp in cambridgeshire assume they be not go to be scrap in mainstream school 
 until that final point i think the hon gentleman raise some serious concern which we have hear this afternoon from many colleague across the house who need we to bring forward reform to deliver well outcome for child with send if the conservative party want to work with we to do this in a way that deliver a well system for child with send i would be very happy to do so but at the moment all we seem to get be opposition for opposition ’s sake 
 victoria college in my constituency be of the relatively small number of send specialist further education college in the country it do outstanding work for many year such college have not have access to dedicated capital grant funding will the minister be so good as to look into the issue and agree to meet i to discuss it far 
 ensure that school and college have the resource and building they need be a key part of our mission to break down barrier to opportunity i will be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these issue far 
 sadly both university in my constituency de montfort university and leicester university be on the verge of make hundred of redundancy and even shut down complete faculty what financial commitment be the department   make to secure academic job especially in subject such as chemistry humanity and language rather than make short term cut 
 the hon gentleman will appreciate that university be independent institution that be able to make their own decision around financial management as a government we have seek to stabilise the high education sector that be why we take the difficult but necessary decision to increase tuition fee later this year we will be publish a post-16 strategy that will deal with many of his question 
 last week i hear from a mum who apply for an ehcp for her son in december and be tell it would be ready in june she have now be inform by buckinghamshire council that he remain unallocated with child ahead of he i be very grateful to the secretary of state for the work she be do to grip and reform the send system but can she talk more about her ambition to support people catch in the horrible waiting game for ehcp 
 we have hear this afternoon from my hon friend and so many member across the house about the urgent need to make improvement for child with send we be lay the foundation with more investment in the system through both the high need budget and capital so we have the place that be need there be of course much we be do right now with council to improve some of the unacceptable wait that parent currently face 
 the superb john hampden school in wendover report that it be run a £ deficit support student with significant send while they await assessment however it be an infant only school and the money often do not come through until the pupil have move up to a junior school will the minister look at how the system be work for infant only school to make the system fairer 
 as we have say we be look at reform to the system we recognise that there be challenge right across the system that we inherit we know that family face challenge in secure support and that school face challenge too we will look at every detail and announce reform in the white paper in the autumn 
 i recently host a series of engagement and roundtable on the sen reform and it be impossible to ignore the sheer size of the problem this government be confront will the secretary of state confirm that the legal right to specialist support will remain a core principle of every child ’s entitlement as labour rebuild this break system and that we will go far deliver real outcome genuine inclusion and an sen system build to serve family not fail they 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the work he have do in this area over many year and for the way he champion this cause here on behalf of his constituent i can confirm that child with send have a legal right to additional support and that   labour will protect that he will appreciate that discussion be under way with family campaigner and school leader to ensure that we get this system right a well system with strengthen support and more timely   intervention and early identification of need it be clear this afternoon that that mission be urgent and that we need to deliver well outcome for child with send i look forward to work with my hon friend on that 
 before i call the shadow home secretary to ask this urgent question i remind the house that hon member must not refer to any matter that be currently before the court member be free to refer to broad policy issue but they should not get into the detail of the specific case for which criminal charge be be bring 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on criminal activity by illegal immigrant at asylum hotel 
 as the house will be aware on   tuesday july   an arrest be make by essex police follow incident that take place in epping early that day and a man be subsequently charge his trial be due to start on   august and he have be remand in custody until that time these be very serious allegation and it be vital that criminal justice procedure be able to run their course superintendent tim tubbs of essex police have say that 
 the last thing we want be for any public discussion to hinder an ongoing prosecution 
 i thank essex police both for its swift response on that case and for handle the protest in essex yesterday evening and in previous day with diligence and professionalism 
 criminal activity of any kind be totally unacceptable wherever it occur and whoever it be perpetrate by as outline follow the recent casey report we be improve joint protection arrangement between the police and immigration enforcement link to the asylum system we be clear that where crime be commit every effort must be make to catch prosecute and punish those responsible 
 let there be absolutely no doubt foreign national include asylum seeker who abuse our hospitality by break our law should expect to be remove from this country in the year of this government foreign national criminal be remove from the uk a increase on the previous year that be important progress but we want to go far through the border security asylum and immigration bill we be change the law to ensure that individual convict of any register sexual offence be not grant asylum and we be legislate to allow for the tagging of any migrant consider to pose a threat to public safety or national security as well as strengthen our crackdown on illegal working 
 but we must go far to end hotel use this labour government inherit an asylum system in chaos with hotel in use at the peak in at a cost of almost £ a day we be change that clear the asylum backlog and increase return to end the use of asylum hotel all together by the end of this parliament alongside those action we be mount a comprehensive and wide range effort to tackle small boat crossing include the intensified co operation and pilot return scheme with france outline by the home secretary in her statement last week 
 there be no quick fix for the chronic problem this government inherit but for the time in year there be now a serious and sensible plan to restore order and proper management to the asylum and immigration system let i state plainly to the house that we expect rule to be respect and enforce and we expect the law to be follow when it be not we expect those involve to face the full force of the law we be take every possible step to deliver the strong border security that the country need because nothing matter more than the safety of the british people 
 the policing minister be crow about the government ’s action on small boat but the truth be this so far this year the government have allow in illegal immigrant across the channel that be up on last year this year have be by far the bad ever and number in asylum hotel be now high than at the time of the election this be a border security crisis but it be also a public safety crisis especially for woman and girl many nationality cross for example afghans commit up to time more sex offence than average louise casey make that point in her report 
 now we have press reporting on the huge scale of the crime commit by illegal immigrant house in the government ’s own asylum hotel the sun find charge in the last month base on only half the hotel currently operate the mail on sunday find charge base on only a of those hotel those crime include multiple case of rape sexual assault violence theft and arson include the case that the minister refer to in epping where a year old ethiopian man have be charge with sexually assault a year old girl an illegal immigrant in oxford have be convict of rap a year old woman in a churchyard a sudanese man be convict of strangle and attempt to rape a woman in a nightclub toilet in wakefield violent protest in response to those appalling crime be never justify the public though be rightly sick of this illegal immigrant crime wave it have to end 
 will the minister commit now to do the follow thing will she record and publish the immigration status of all offender secondly will she close that asylum hotel in epping thirdly will she repeal the human rights act for immigration matter finally will she emulate greece ’s new approach which start today and deport all illegal immigrant on arrival from france without judicial process either back to their country of origin or to a safe country will she give the house and the country those commitment 
 let i repeat to the house that any allegation of crime or sexual assault include by individual in the asylum system be incredibly serious and be to be treat so by the authority and by the government i regret the tone that the shadow home secretary be take on such a serious and important matter i also gently remind he to look at his record and that of the conservative party on this issue more than asylum hotel be in operation at their peak housing over people at a cost of almost £ a day enforce return be down on return of foreign national offender have fall by a criminal smuggler gang be able to exploit our weak border security 
 it be the bad year ever 
 there be no proper management of public safety risk pose by individual asylum seeker interruption 
 order do we both understand 
 indicate assent 
 okay carry on minister 
 there be no proper management of public safety risk pose by individual asylum seeker and migrant could work illegally in the gig economy with few sanction for the company responsible 
 this government be grip the situation and turn the system around we have remove foreign national offender in our year in office just to put that in perspective for the benefit of the house that be more foreign criminal than be remove in the entire month when the right hon gentleman be the minister for immigration 
 we have covid 
 excuse excuse excuse 
 i would say that the same pattern be true of illegal working but actually it be even bad in the quarter of this year we deliver more raid more arrest and more fine for illegal working than the shadow home secretary manage in the entire time he be immigration minister we do more in month to crack down on illegal working than he manage in now 
 that ’ nonsense 
 it be not nonsense it be fact 
 now we be try to go far in all these area but it be clear that the conservatives and their friend in reform be the one try to stop we we introduce counter terror measure at the border to smash the gang responsible for the vile trade they vote against the bill that deliver that we introduce measure to ban sex offender from get asylum in the uk they vote against the bill that deliver they we introduce tag for those arrive illegally who pose a risk to the public and extend illegal working duty to cover the gig economy once again they vote against it we have see year of inaction leave our border expose and our community fracture yet the shadow home secretary have the cheek to lecture we about keep the country safe 
 i draw the attention of the house to my declaration of interest people who come to this country legally and work hard be welcome but the minister be right to say that those who do not be not we know that of the big pull factor be the ability to work illegally in the uk can the minister set out what the government be do to stamp out illegal working and in particular the role of the new fair work agency introduce by the employment rights bill which will be critical in stop illegal working in the uk 
 my hon friend will know that the immigration minister my hon friend   the member for wallasey dame angela eagle who i believe give evidence to the esteemed home affairs committee on which he sit be look at that issue a number of company have be report in the press as employ or use people in particular from asylum hotel i know the shadow home secretary have take a particular interest in this and the minister be work very hard to ensure that those company be hold to account and that the new provision we be bring in to ensure that the gig economy be treat in the same way as other employer who have to check individual immigration status be follow through there be much more to do but certainly i know the immigration minister be work hard on this 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the scene of violent unrest at the bell hotel this weekend be deeply concern liberal democrats will always defend the right to peaceful protest but what we see go far beyond that there be no place for that sort of violence and thuggery in our society i thank the police and the emergency service for their brave and professional response and my thought go out to anyone who be feel frightened as a result of those unacceptable scene 
 it be completely understandable that people be concerned about criminal activity not least after the former conservative government ’s chaotic approach to immigration shatter public trust that be why we need an efficient asylum system that swiftly return those without a genuine right to stay i would welcome detail from the minister on what step the government be take to deliver that clear rule that be properly enforce will be key to rebuild public trust in the system after it be break by the conservatives 
 i welcome the tone of the hon lady ’s contribution this be a serious issue i fully agree with she on peaceful protest but it be totally unacceptable when that step over into violent disorder as we see last summer for example she will know that there be a huge effort go in to deal with the backlog we inherit from the previous government to speed up the process so that those people who should not be in our country be swiftly remove and those refugee and asylum seeker whose claim be accept can get on with the rest of their life 
 i welcome the surge in return that we have see and the raid on company with illegal working practice as we have speak about many time in this house those company be incentivise the boat crossing and ultimately undermine our national security can the minister set out what further enforcement there can be be it possible that conversation could be have with the treasury about further measure that could be take to bring some of these company to heel 
 i be the policing minister but i know that work be already under way on that issue the immigration minister have have a number of conversation particularly with employer as i have just say about where work should not be take place   because of individual immigration status there have be investment in the national crime agency additional officer be work on this issue and work be under way on smash the gang who be behind bring people across in the small boat there be also our international arrangement and treaty that we be sign with various country which the previous government be unable to do 
 i call the father of the house 
 this be a real national crisis and there be such an outcry and such outrage in the country that there be a real danger that people will take the law into their own hand which we all deprecate we have to solve this and the only way to do so be to have a reasonable and proper deterrent we must arrest the people who land on our shore detain they and send they back to where they come from the human rights act be never intend to cover illegal immigrant of this sort we have to do this for all our sake otherwise people will wrongly take the law into their own hand 
 as i just say to   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney who speak for the liberal democrats peaceful protest be completely acceptable we understand that there be different opinion on immigration in this country and people should be allow to voice those opinion when that turn into violent disorder as we have see it be not acceptable i know that the police behave in a very professional way they allow protest to take place but they clearly have to keep the king ’s peace as well the father of the house be correct to say that we need a function system where application be deal with swiftly people be not wait for year for application to be decide and those who should not be in this country be remove 
 i think many of we agree with the minister when she say that it be important that we be able to debate immigration and refugee and how we as a country support they and that we recognise when allegation of incredibly serious sexual offence be involve that people be rightly concern peaceful protest play its part but she will be conscious that the police themselves have condemn the mindless thuggery that we have see in epping also there be report that seem quite serious about neo nazi group and their leaflet be circulate in order to protect peaceful protest which many of we seek to do we have to stop the direct targeting of individual with violence what assessment have be make of any co ordination of violence by group in these incident 
 i say again that we absolutely believe that peaceful protest be part of our democratic process unfortunately as my hon friend will know there be always people who will seek to exploit situation and we probably see some of that over the last few day in epping i say again that there be people from the local community who be express genuinely hold view and it be important that we note that however i be also aware that literature be be distribute and that other group be perhaps go to epping to stir up problem the police be aware of that and they be   look at all the information and evidence about what happen and they will obviously keep that under review 
 week ago in epping there be allege sexual assault on school age girl my thought be with the victim their family and their peer these be allegedly link to the bell hotel which have be stand up as an asylum hotel against all advice since then we have have numerous major protest involve hundred of people injury to police officer and damage to police vehicle people quite rightly have the right to peaceful protest but these violent scene be not we they be not eppe and they be not what we stand for i want to thank essex police for all that they be do to keep we safe in these challenging and distressing time for our town follow the protest we have church cancel service business close early and local resident feel like they be barricade in their own home the hotel be in the wrong place it be near a school and there be inadequate safeguarding of the hotel ’s vulnerable resident this be a crisis that be boil over and for the sake of community safety the home secretary and the government must get a grip of the situation they must listen and act now to close this hotel immediately will they now do that 
 the hon gentleman ’s comment on behalf of his constituent be measure and he be absolutely right that our thought should be with those affect by what happen in epping the victim and their family it be important for the house to note that i also want to reiterate that this government be commit to close all asylum hotel by the end of this parliament 
 i welcome the shadow home secretary ’s concern about crime link to the asylum system that be a concern hold across the house why do the minister think the conservatives and reform vote against the border security asylum and immigration bill which allow the tagging of asylum seeker who pose a threat to public safety 
 i have absolutely no idea it be for the shadow home secretary to explain that clearly i would expect all hon and right hon member in the house to want to do everything to keep our community safe 
 i look forward to the swift deportation of anybody who take advantage of our hospitality by break our law and attack woman and young girl in july i warn my constituent not to throw away their future as the far right lynch mob threaten to spread to gloucestershire once again this thuggery have flare up this time in epping what action be the government take to support authority in the prosecution of those who whip up this furore both online and in position of influence 
 the hon gentleman may know that a great deal of work have be undertake since the disorder of last summer to ensure that intelligence be gather from the online space as well as the offline   space and that all the authority be prepared and ready if there be any sign of disorder again just to reiterate all of we in this house would recognise that peaceful protest be an important part of a democratic society but not when it cross over into the disorder and mayhem we see last year when criminal act be perpetrate by individual 
 i agree that it be important that we be able to debate immigration and asylum people across the country know the consequence of the asylum system fail to protect the public community and business we have have experience of that in my own city do the minister agree that public safety must come and that it be indefensible that the tory party and reform oppose measure allow the tagging of high risk individual do she agree that the breadth and depth of this crisis need we all to work together to regain public confidence 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend she put that eloquently again i expect that all member of this house would want to do everything to protect the member of all community in this country
