the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 today be the day that those on the opposition benches always know be come the legacy of the previous government be a prison system on the brink of collapse which leave we with no choice today around offender have have to be release a few week or month early by change their automatic release point from to of their sentence have we not do so we face court unable to hold trial police unable to make arrest and a total breakdown of law and order this be not the long term solution there be more that we must do but it be the necessary step that we have to take follow the disgraceful dereliction of duty of the previous government 
 i refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests way to reduce pressure on number be to treat more offender with drug and alcohol addiction outside the prison estate that reduce prisoner number and reduce reoffending which mean few victim and few people return to prison such a system be operate successfully in many part of the country but it require the high quality treatment it also require probation to work well otherwise magistrate be limit in their choice may i encourage the secretary of state to get hold of dame carol black ’s internal review of treatment and recovery of drug dependent people in the secure estate if she have not already do so i have not see it obviously but i be certain that it will contain many excellent recommendation 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be right good quality work on rehabilitation to reduce reoffende and deal with drug and alcohol issue be critical to deal with not just the rehabilitation of offender but the prison system he will know that nearly of offending be reoffende which be far too high the situation at the moment be that it be impossible   to do good quality rehabilitative work in prison that be more than full with prisoner lock up for hour a day so the step be to address capacity once we have do so we will be able to build on recommendation make by expert in this area to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce reoffende 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer my constituency of wrexham be home to of the uk ’s large prison it be well know that if an offender have fix and secure accommodation to go to they be less likely to reoffend what step be she take to ensure that those release today under sds40 will have accommodation on release include in wrexham 
 we be work closely with colleague from the ministry of housing communities and local government to understand the impact on the housing sector but as be the case any time a prisoner be release probation staff be work hard to prepare release plan include permanent and temporary accommodation if an offender be at risk of homelessness on release they will be house in community accommodation we expect to provide housing for the majority of offender use exist provision but should there not be enough i have authorise probation director to make use of alternative arrangement include budget hotel as a temporary measure for the case that we will see in the next few week 
 during the debate on early prisoner release in july the impact assessment produce suggest that there would be few prison place than plan for because of the need to meet the capital saving that be discuss at the time when i raise that with the secretary of state she say that this matter would be under review can she now confirm that it be the government ’s intention to cut back prison place by over the medium and long term 
 the right hon lady will know that i have commit to publish a year capacity strategy there be also live discussion as part of the budget and spend review process we have commit to deliver the shortfall of place in our prison system which the previous government fail to do that be a commitment that we have give those conversation be live conversation and i will report to the house in due course but we will publish that year capacity strategy before the end of the year 
 can the secretary of state explain why when some foreign criminal be block up space in our jail they be not be remove and deport which would simultaneously save the british taxpayer billion of pound every year and have the support of million of british voter 
 they be be deport and they will continue to be deport nothing will change as far as the deportation of foreign national offender be concern but the inheritance we receive from the previous government mean we have to take additional measure the answer will not come from the deportation of foreign national offender alone but it be very much part of the picture 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 under the early release scheme start today the detail of which be design by the secretary of state how many people will be eligible to be release at the point who have be sentence for example for offence under section grievous bodily harm and section actual bodily harm of the offences against the person act both of which carry a maximum sentence of year but for which more often a sentence will be award that be less than year 
 the shadow lord chancellor will know that we have make important exclusion in the design of the policy and that all those who have commit serious offence and have be sentence to year or more will be exclude from it i will not be able to give detail on the specific mix of offence per offender but those offence that would otherwise be include but that relate to serious violence or sexual offence have be exclude from the policy 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state but i have the statutory instrument and the list of exclusion in the schedule here and those offence be not specifically include in that list of exclusion my fear be and this would be deeply disappointing that many domestic abuser who be convict for those offence but receive few than year may be eligible for early release and be consider for it because her scheme do not explicitly exclude those offence give that the reality be that the government ’s claim that domestic abuser will not be eligible to benefit from the scheme will ring very hollow to victim of domestic abuse and the wide public will n’t it 
 with respect to the shadow lord chancellor what will ring hollow to member of the public be the tory party ’s new find commitment to exclusion for domestic abuse and the sheer hypocrisy of talk about exclusion to this policy when he be a minister in the previous government who bring in the end of custody supervise licence scheme which have no exclusion relate to domestic abuse whatsoever—[interruption he talk about the governor lock from a sedentary position but he know full well that that be an attempt to shift the blame away from ministerial decision making and to place it on governor something i be not sure be much appreciate by those who run our prison we have take every step and every mechanism available to we to exclude offence connect to domestic abuse and crucially to give the probation service time to prepare something the previous government never do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be clear that our prison be at break point the conservative failure to tackle the court backlog have directly contribute to prison overcrowding thank to their neglect and mismanagement the government have be leave with no choice but to take these measure however the lord chancellor say in her statement in july that these measure would be review 
 within month of implementation at the very late in march 2026.”—[official report   july vol c. 
 that be a long time away particularly give the various story we be hear about certain individual be release will the secretary of state once again confirm that no dangerous criminal will be release early 
 we have take every measure available to we to exclude offence from this measure serious violence sexual violence and offence connect to domestic abuse have all be exclude as have terror offence and so on the hon gentleman will know the list of exclusion we will work with our probation service which have do a heroic amount of work over the summer to deliver this policy in the come month we will also work very closely with criminal justice system partner to make sure that the roll out of the scheme be as safe as possible we have take every measure we will continue to keep matter under review and i will keep the house update in due course 
 we need to speed up a little we be only now get to question 
 what step she be take to support the rehabilitation of offender 
 what step she be take to support the rehabilitation of offender 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of reoffende 
 hon member be right to focus on reduce reoffende nearly of offending be reoffende and it have an immense cost to the taxpayer and to community as the lord chancellor say we have inherit a difficult situation in relation to prison capacity which make it hard to address the rehabilitation need of prisoner the house should have no doubt that this government will roll up our sleeve and get on with the job of reduce reoffende 
 my point speak to what the minister just say the lack of prison capacity mean that some people be lock up in their cell for or hour a day and many prison be rank insufficient or poor for deliver purposeful activity such as education and training how do the minister plan to address that while we still have a bulge prison population how will he increase the provision of those purposeful activity 
 we be take the hard decision that be necessary to create space and capacity in the prison service to address that issue the hon member be right that the report from his majesty ’s inspectorate of prisons identify the provision of sufficient purposeful activity as its no issue to address we know that education and employment help to reduce significantly the chance of reoffende and we will work to do that with the prison and probation service 
 rise 
 order you be suppose to sit down minister i know that you be enjoy the dispatch box on your return but please do not over enjoy it i call monica harding 
 as my hon friend   the member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean   mention the chief inspector of prison say this morning that prisoner can sometimes be bang up in their cell for up to hour a day that classroom and workshop be empty and that education and training be simply not give the priority they need do the secretary of state agree that in order to cut reoffende it be time to introduce a proper workable plan to improve the rehabilitation of people leave prison 
 my own example demonstrate that training and education be very important in whatever role take on so i agree wholeheartedly with what the hon member say 
 address literacy in uk prison be crucial for successful rehabilitation improved literacy skill empower inmate with well job prospect aid their reintegration into society education foster personal growth self esteem and decision make ability which be essential for a crime free life invest in prison literacy programme be a vital step towards create safe community and offering inmate a genuine chance what comprehensive strategy be be implement to address that 
 my hon friend be exactly right literacy and numeracy be crucial i be pleased to visit hmp humber recently where i see excellent good practice it be important that those programme be in place that we learn from good practice and that we continue to do our good in that area 
 a key driver of rehabilitation and the prevention of reoffende be sentence policy in our manifesto we promise a review of sentence policy quite properly when be that likely to take place and will it take account of the very interesting recent paper by former lord chief justices on sentence inflation 
 the paper to which my hon friend refer be a significant and i urge all member to look at it the government be commit to a review of sentence policy and it will commence as soon as it can we will report in due time 
 what step her department be take to support victim of rape and sexual violence 
 what step her department be take to support victim of rape and sexual violence

 the government be deeply committed to support victim of rape and sexual violence to do that we will increase the power of the victim commissioner and get victim the information that they need provide free legal advocate to uphold the right of victim of rape and fast track rape case to drive down waiting time for victim of those abhorrent offence 
 last week emmerdale air an upsetting episode deal with the domestic abuse suffer by belle dingle the storyline have show just how difficult it can be for someone to leave an abusive relationship not least because of the psychological control exercise by abuser some victim also need somewhere to go for safety accord to the late available figure scarborough have the high rate of report domestic abuse in north yorkshire but there be still no refuge for victim in the town will my hon friend work with i colleague across government and stakeholder to find the funding to ensure that a refuge finally open in scarborough 
 as an avid emmerdale fan i see that harrowing episode it go to show the importance of tv drama in raise awareness of these vital issue the government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade the ministry of justice be work with department across whitehall include the ministry of housing communities and local government to support local authority to meet their statutory duty include refuge for all victim of domestic abuse who need they we know though that it be not just refuge support that be important wide community base support be important too and the moj provide funding to police and crime commissioner to commission those vital service for victim 
 victim of allege rape in truro and falmouth and across the country be have their trial push back for month if not year often very shortly before those trial be set to begin that lead to severe distress for victim and family and can have unintended consequence such as bail condition become outdate as victim wait so long for their case to come to trial that address change in the meantime will the minister please outline what she be do to prevent or minimise the potential harm cause by such unintended consequence and to bring those long delay case to a speedy conclusion 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the awful state our criminal justice system be leave in by the previous government we be committed to ensure swift delivery of justice for victim at all stage of the criminal justice system and we be work closely with various partner to achieve that aim we know that due to the complexity of their case rape victim often wait disproportionately long period for their trial compare with victim of other offence type reduce wait time for victim be a priority for i and this government which be why we have commit to fast track rape case through the justice system i recently see at hand at bristol crown court how that can be do and how our judge be work tirelessly to make it happen 
 many will be watch with horror the extraordinarily disturbing case unfold in france in which drug be allegedly use to facilitate the abuse of a woman by her husband and over man like many across the house i have receive communication from victim of spike in my town of weston super mare they and i be keen to know what step the minister be take to crack down on the devastating crime of spike here in the uk 
 the case in france be truly shocking and we have all look on in horror as the detail have unfold i commend the victim for her bravery in come forward and make it public so that we can see the full aspect of the trial spike be a despicable crime we have commit to introduce a new criminal offence of spike and we be consider how good to implement it to be clear in england and wales have sex with a person who can not consent be rape and spike with intent to engage in sexual activity be a specific offence with a maximum penalty of year in prison 
 year ago jack and paul sykes age and respectively tragically lose their life at the hand of their abusive father who set their house on fire their mother my constituent claire throssell be a powerful campaigner against presumptive contact a legal principle that allow a know domestic abuser to access jack and paul will the minister meet claire and i to discuss how we can properly protect child from domestic abuse in our family court system 
 i thank my hon friend for that really important question claire ’s tireless campaign for family and child experience domestic abuse be inspirational and my thought be with she and the whole community as the anniversary come close next month 
 both the criminal and family justice system will play an essential role in deliver our commitment to halve violence against woman and girl the family court system must protect child victim of domestic abuse and the new pathfinder court provide more support for domestic abuse agency and ensure that the child ’s welfare and voice be at the centre of proceeding from the outset the government and i take the need to respond robustly to perpetrator within the family court very seriously the previous government be review the presumption of parental involvement we be consider the finding and will respond in due course 
 i draw the minister ’s attention to the work of bradford council and west yorkshire mayor tracy brabin who have launch the safety of woman and girl initiative together with a dedicated woman ’s safety unit within west yorkshire police what support can the government offer to bolster the effort of local authority such as bradford to stamp out violence against woman and girl in our community 
 my hon friend ’s question give i the opportunity to also place on record my thank to mayor tracy brabin for all the incredible work she be do in this field she be an outstanding champion for tackle violence against woman and girl and we should be do more work like her across government 
 as i have say we be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade we be support colleague across whitehall include at the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure close collaboration with local authority in addition the duty to collaborate under the victims and prisoners act will facilitate improved multi agency working and encourage all local commissioner to provide join up work for victim of all crime include violence against woman and girl 
 this time last year the lord chancellor announce her intention to introduce free legal advocate so that victim of rape can enforce their right for example in relation to the use of their personal information in court what progress be the minister make in bring forward that vital new protection for victim 
 in our manifesto this government be clear that we be committed to introduce free independent legal advice for victim and survivor of rape from report to trial i be work with official to develop this new policy and to ensure victim get the support they need to understand and uphold their right as soon as possible i plan to draw on lesson learn from the successful pilot in northumbria as well as from the mayor of london ’s current ila pilot 
 in the last session when the public accounts committee look at the effect of delay in the criminal justice system on serious sexual and rape case it find that some case be take year or more from prosecution to trial and that some of the poor traumatise victim be simply disappear because they could not stand it any long without enter into the blame game what can the minister do to improve that situation 
 the hon member be right that although we do not want to get into the blame game the current status of the criminal justice system be truly appalling rape trial be not get as fast track as they should be and we be work at pace to try to remedy that situation currently of rape victim be pull out of the criminal justice system the attrition rate be far too high and i be work with official to improve that rate and to improve victim experience at court 
 how many prisoner be go to be release today in kent and can the secretary of state guarantee that none of they will be homeless within a month 
 as the lord chancellor have previously say we can not give exact figure for specific area however we be work with other department include the mhclg and with local authority to ensure that those who be be release from prison today under sds40 have the accommodation that they need the probation service have be work around the clock to ensure that 
 order that question push the boundary a little bit i think it should have be mainly about those who be rapist who be be release 
 i thank the minister for her answer but what discussion have she have with education ministers about support victim of rape and sexual assault who be under year of age within our educational institution 
 i thank the hon member for his question he will know that this government have a mission to tackle violence against woman and girl as i have say that vision pull together department across whitehall include the department for education i recently have a meeting with an education minister to discuss exactly that issue i have be clear that sex with anyone who can not consent be a crime and we be work across government to tackle it 
 from my own experience i know that independent sexual violence adviser provide by amazing charity such as survivorsuk be critical guide to help survivor navigate their path to justice and peace could the minister commit to redouble her support for isva and the organisation that make they available to the survivor who need they 
 i know that the hon gentleman be passionate about this field of justice his question give i the opportunity also put on record my thank to isva who do immense work across this field day in and day out support victim of these abhorrent crime the work they do be invaluable this government be commit to introduce independent legal advocate to help victim and survivor get the support they need and we be work with our stakeholder across the sector to ensure that support be available 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of recent disorder on the criminal justice system 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of recent disorder on the criminal justice system 
 the criminal justice system rise to the challenge bring about by the violent disorder we see over the summer as of   august individual have be bring before the court of those have be give a custodial sentence by the crown court 
 as a crown prosecutor for year i know only too well that the court backlog have be worsen by repair issue force court to close what be the secretary of state do to address the repair need to the court estate so that victim in my constituency of amber valley and across the country can get access to justice 
 i thank my hon friend for that question it be of course crucial that court be in a position where the building the infrastructure itself do not prevent they from be able to sit it will be a priority for this government to resolve those issue so that case can be hear and victim can be give the justice that they deserve 
 it be clear that we have come dangerously close to run out of prison place in the last few month which as the prime minister have rightly say be 
 about as fundamental a failure as you can get 
 who do the lord chancellor blame for this failure and do she think we will ever get a word of apology from the conservative party for leave our prison estate on the brink of disaster 
 i would happily give way to anybody on the opposition benches if they would like to take up the invitation to offer an apology but i do not think will be forthcoming i certainly do think that be require give the state of the prison system that we have inherit but it be our job to make sure that that never happen again that be why we will be launch a review into how the current position be allow to come to pass the conservative party ignore all the warning put political gain ahead of the country ’s good interest and it will fall to this government to fix it 
 the government have rightly find prison place for those involve in the recent disorder but they have do that by continue their early release policy will the secretary of state confirm that those guilty of manslaughter be among those able to get early release and will she explain to the house why people guilty of manslaughter should be release early 
 i think the hon member be guilty of wilful ignorance he will know full well that the prison system that we inherit be on the point of collapse the fact that some prison build that be already in course be able to be bring on line a little early to help we get over the crisis of the summer be testament to the people work at the frontline to make sure that those prison space be available but we be still short of prison capacity prison be still at over capacity and that be the legacy leave by his government he will know that we have important exclusion to the sds40 policy and he will know that the offence and the sentence be both take into account i will not give a running commentary on exactly which sentence and which offender be affect but he know what exclusion be in place 
 what step her department be take to improve the experience of victim at court 
 this government be commit to improve the victim experience at court we will work with the judiciary to fast track rape case to ensure timely justice for some of the most vulnerable within the criminal justice system additionally this government commit in our manifesto to introduce free independent legal support for victim of rape from report to trial we have also commit to strengthen the victim code and to increase the victim commissioner ’s power to make sure that victim need be meet 
 for victim give evidence in a court can sometimes be a very difficult and distressing experience which be why they sometimes prefer to give evidence via video link can the minister set out what step the government be take to ensure that more victim can give evidence via video link across our country 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question video link be available in all court to help vulnerable and intimidate witness give evidence we have recently invest £ to transform witness facility and upgrade video link room in crown court pre recorded evidence be also available in all crown court for eligible victim to spare they the trauma of give evidence at a live trial 
 to ensure that victim see justice criminal case need to be hear in a timely manner which rely on a number of court be in place to be able to hear they the future of chichester crown court which be the only crown court in west sussex have be under threat for nearly a decade local campaigner fight to save that provision lead to its reopening to clear the backlog but its future remain uncertain will the minister meet i to ensure the future of chichester crown court 
 we know that courtroom availability be essential to deal with the backlog and i will pass on that message to the court minister the minister of state ministry of justice my hon friend   the member for swindon south heidi alexander 
 what step she plan to take to meet prison officer recruitment target 
 my hon friend be completely right prison officer recruitment target be essential prison officer do a fantastic job we have see how they have go above and beyond over recent week and month so i pay tribute to they nationally we be currently above staffing target but challenge remain in certain site with a high number of vacancy and bespoke intervention be be develop for those site 
 i thank the minister for that answer and i praise the government team for the way they have respond to the complete chaos leave in the wake of year of a conservative government 
 in my previous work i visit young offender institution which have be leave in total chaos by the last government part of their recklessness be to start a botched recruitment process for the graduate recruitment training programme for prison officer it be currently deliver by unlocked graduates which be do fantastic work the government ’s chief inspector of prison have say there be a real risk that that programme ending will add to the recruitment problem that the government face will they restart that procurement process and meet i to discuss its future 
 i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that matter his majesty ’s prison and probation service work to reprocure the next iteration of the graduate scheme with contract for an open procurement exercise although unlocked graduates be identify as the win bidder and be offer the contract it do not confirm its intent to sign the contract the department be now work hard to come up with plan to put a graduate scheme in place for future year 
 what step she be take to tackle the court backlog 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the backlog of case in court 
 it be good to be back mr speaker 
 the government be commit to reduce caseload and bring wait time down for court user across all jurisdiction we continue to keep nightingale courtroom open across venue so that we have more physical capacity to hear case in all jurisdiction we plan to sit more than day in the crown court and more than day in the family court this financial year enable we to work through as many case as possible 
 hartlepool ’s court building have stand empty since after it be mothball by the then conservative government will my hon friend investigate the potential for reopen hartlepool ’s court as part of our effort to expand capacity and clear the backlog and will she meet i to discuss the issue far 
 you might want to reopen chorley court which be also empty 
 i hear you mr speaker 
 i welcome the question from my hon friend he will know that his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service keep the court estate under regular review to ensure that it meet operational requirement i be afraid there be currently no plan to reopen hartlepool magistrate court but i would be happy to meet my hon friend alongside official from hmcts to discuss his concern the reason behind the increase caseload in our criminal court be complex and multifaceted but the number of courtroom available be not the main constraint we currently face 
 torquay magistrate court close in the last decade and therefore justice be serve somewhat distantly from our community in torbay can the minister assure the house that there will be some review to ensure that justice be serve more locally to our community in south devon 
 i may be have another meeting with the hon gentleman as well as look at the court in chorley and i be happy to discuss that matter with he 
 what support her department be provide to victim of domestic abuse 
 this government be deeply committed to support domestic abuse victim and we provide funding to police and crime commissioner who commission community base support service for domestic abuse victim and survivor and independent domestic violence advisor domestic abuse victim be automatically eligible for certain special measure in court such as screen or video link and the pathfinder pilot in family court aim to improve experience and outcome for child and family affect by domestic abuse 
 devon and cornwall base domestic abuse charity light south west and national domestic abuse charity hourglass which work specifically with old victim have highlight to i the challenge that they face with short term funding stream for their work the current year on year funding model result in issue with the recruitment and retention of staff which in turn impact on service provision to victim specialist service be especially vulnerable give the nature of the support they provide will the minister commit to provide sustainable long term funding for frontline domestic abuse service include for specialist service for old victim survivor so as well to support victim in my constituency and across the country 
 the work that hourglass and many other do be outstanding and i place on record my thank to it for champion the right of old victim across the piece the ministry of justice provide police and crime commissioner with annual grant funding to commission local practical emotional and therapeutic support service for victim of all crime type i be hear loud and clear the call from the sector but it would be wrong of i to pre empt the announcement of funding after march we can not agree that before the spending review but the ministry of justice have allocate £ of funding over year to support the training and infrastructure of isva and idva and to support fantastic organisation such as hourglass that do such brilliant work 
 another forum in which domestic violence be litigate be private child ’s case in our family court the secretary of state and ministers will no doubt be aware of the huge delay that family be suffer in have their case hear and   then those case be decide at the heart of that be child wait for a conclusion what step be the government take to try to expedite those case in particular work with other agency across government include the children and family court advisory and support service and local authority 
 the government recognise the importance of support separate family and where appropriate help they to resolve their issue quickly and without the need to come to court this be a complex area my official and i be work closely on it and i would be happy to update my hon friend with a more thorough review soon 
 i call the shadow minister 
 domestic violence at its most severe become murder domestic murder be often the most shocking and brutal with that in mind what assessment have the minister make of the kill women campaign 
 i be aware of the kill women campaign i have liaise closely with it in opposition and now in government its aim be admirable any woman murder by domestic homicide in this country be woman too many we know that sadly woman a week be be murder that be a shocking statistic that this government be hop to tackle 
 i thank the minister for that answer in light of that will she commit to respond to the call of carole gould julie devey and elaine newborough and many other to address the injustice of the discrepancy between the starting point for sentence in domestic murder case versus that for other murder case will she do so in quick time so that she can include appropriate measure in the forthcoming victim court and public protection bill 
 i be meet the woman imminently to discuss this far and the government have commit to a thorough sentencing review 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of the time take for case to progress through the criminal justice system 
 what step she be take to help reduce the time take for criminal case to be hear at court 
 we be committed to ensure the swift delivery of justice for victim at all stage of the criminal justice system and we be work closely with various partner involve to achieve that aim in relation to the court we plan to sit more than working day in the crown court this financial year and we continue to hear criminal case at nightingale court we be also consider other measure to speed up justice for victim and we will make further announcement in due course 
 i thank the minister for her answer after wait year for the grenfell inquiry to report the bereaved family and survivor have now be tell that they must wait or possibly year for a decision on whether and whom to prosecute as martin luther king say 
 justice too long delay be justice deny 
 i understand from the crown prosecution service which i meet recently that much of the delay be for the discovery process where the welter of digital information must be assess can the minister tell i what be be do to address these delay and whether thing such as artificial intelligence be be contemplate 
 as the prime minister make clear those affect by the grenfell tragedy have already wait too long for justice i can assure the hon gentleman that anything in my or my department ’s power that need to be do will be do the government fully support the metropolitan police and the crown prosecution service as they complete their investigation and bring prosecution to trial while respect their operational independence i be sure the use of all form of technology will be consider in that process 
 perhaps too many barrister have become politician but however cause how will the minister address the shortage at the criminal bar 
 i hesitate to answer the right hon gentleman ’s question give that my boss be a former barrister i say that we can not have too many 
 only last week i discuss the adequacy of number of legal professional in the crown court with the chair of the criminal bar association mary prior and i will be work with the profession to ensure not only that we be recruit sufficient barrister to work in the court but that we be retain barrister at the criminal bar 
 our team in newport east be try hard to raise the issue of how long case be take for constituent we inherit those delay from the conservatives but even the cps be take month to answer basic query about where the delay be in case will the minister urge the cps to respond fast 
 i will take that away and do that 
 do the minister agree that a properly fund legal aid scheme both here and in scotland be essential for access to justice and that the decline in this vital public service that both the tories and the snp have preside over be nothing short of disgraceful 
 what we be experience be the very long tail of the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act which have mean that both the civil and criminal legal aid sector have face huge challenge that be vital to people ’s access to justice 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 on take office month ago it be immediately clear that we have inherit a prison system at the point of collapse that be why our emergency action which will see certain offender leave prison a few week or month early have prove necessary the measure take effect today i pay tribute to the work of the prison and probation service which have go above and beyond the call of duty both in respond to the violent disorder in recent week and in prepare for the introduction of those measure this mark the beginning of a rescue effort that will in time allow we to rebuild and reform our justice system in the year ahead 
 after the last government leave our prison on the brink of collapse i welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to build new prison and drive down reoffende i also welcome her commitment to additional transparency do she agree that such transparency be a significant departure from the approach of the previous government who release thousand of prisoner early in secret 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that it be a significant departure from the approach of the previous government who introduce an early release scheme the end of custody supervise licence scheme that operate under a veil of secrecy with no datum ever publish on the number release it take our government to publish the datum show that more than offender be release under that scheme i be pleased to say today that we have end that scheme 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her previous answer on substantive question about accommodation for prisoner release early far to that have the government contract any specific hotel for potential use by early release prisoner 
 i have authorise probation director in area to make appropriate provision if that prove to be need at this point it be not definite that it will be require to ensure that there be no gap in provision for offender be release under the sds40 scheme 
 i think the secretary of state say that none have be contract at this time if they be at any point far to the point make by   the hon member for reading west and mid berkshire olivia bailey will she be open and transparent with the house local authority and the public about how many at what point and in broad term where they will be locate 
 yes i will 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 every second a domestic abuse relate call be make to the police it be positive to see that the number of domestic abuse case refer from the police to the cps have increase but those number be still well below the level see over the past year will the secretary of state address the delay in domestic abuse referral from the police to the cps and acknowledge the unique risk that they pose 
 as i have state this government be elect with a landmark mission to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade to do so we must improve the justice system ’s response to these crime include domestic abuse we must relentlessly target the most prolific and harmful perpetrator well support victim and survivor and ensure timely and effective justice we will put domestic abuse expert in control room and strengthen the use of protection order and we will strengthen the tool available to manage domestic abuse offender 
 over the weekend lord macdonald the former director of public prosecution warn that court backlog and the complexity of any trial that may arise from a cps decision in about the victim of the grenfell fire may far delay justice could the minister give we and the victim reassurance that the criminal justice system will not far delay justice for those victim 
 as i say to   the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler we will do everything we can to ensure swift justice for the victim of grenfell we plan for the crown court to sit for at least day this financial year and we will do more to increase the speed with which case be hear in the crown court 
 the secretary of state have say that she will review her prisoner early release scheme after month but will she go far and commit to end it then and if not to return to this house for a fresh vote on it 
 i have commit to the review because that be the appropriate way and i will not make early promise that might not be keep i have commit to both transparency and a review we will publish all the datum on a quarterly basis and i will return to the house with the result of the review and the approach that we will take at that point 
 the minister will understand that often for very personal reason victim of sexual assault such as my constituent do not always feel comfortable report their attack to the police she then find it extremely difficult to access specialist support service at what be clearly a very distressing time what can we do to improve the accessibility of support service for those victim of sexual assault who do not report it to the police will she meet i to discuss this case far

 the late figure show that the court backlog sit at nearly every of those case mean yet another individual victim or family wait for justice despite that the government plan to cap the number of sit day in our court at a low number than last year lose sitting day which have draw criticism from many include the bar council could the secretary of state tell i why those wait for justice include many in north norfolk be be force to wait even long 
 as i have say the crown court will sit for more than day this financial year an increase of on the year before the pandemic that mean that there be more capacity in the crown court this year than in of the past year we have inherit a criminal justice system on life support as a result of the previous government and we have a broken economy everyone can see the state of the public finance and justice be not immune from that 
 in pembrokeshire we have no local solicitor firm offer pro bono work and the near free legal advice centre be in swansea many of my constituent be therefore unable to access to justice which be particularly distress in the area of family law and care proceeding what step be the minister take to tackle the issue of legal desert in place such as pembrokeshire and west wales

 what happen to mr malkinson be appalling both for he and for the victim of the crime it be vital that lesson be learn as the right hon gentleman will know follow the publication of the henley review of the ccrc ’s handling of mr malkinson ’s case the lord chancellor ’s view be that the current chair be unfit to fulfil her duty as for resource the amount that the ccrc have receive in recent year have rise and we will continue to keep that under review

 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on ukraine but may i reflect on last week ’s dreadful news of the death of royal naval pilot lieutenant rhodri leyshon on behalf of this house i pay tribute to he   he be a consummate professional to his colleague and be dearly love by his family he will be sorely miss by so many and the thought of this house be with they today 
 it have now be day since putin launch his full scale illegal invasion of ukraine—930 day in which ukrainian force have fight heroically while community have endure relentless attack child have be steal to russia and family have see their home destroy yet throughout everything ukraine have stand tall in the face of russian aggression since day when i be the shadow defence secretary and sit in the place now occupy by   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge this house and our country have be unite for ukraine   in opposition labour back every package of military aid every sanction on russia and every scheme to support civilian such as home for ukraine   i know the opposition will continue to work with the government in the same way because this house stand united for ukraine 
 i have be proud of uk leadership on ukraine and i be determined that it will continue i be also determined to work across this house so i will offer opposition leader regular intelligence assessment on the conflict   i will offer mp of all party regular ministry of defence and foreign commonwealth and development office briefing the of which take place in the mod this morning   more than colleague from both side of the house have attend the briefing and the house will receive regular update on the conflict from i 
 ukraine be a order priority for i as defence secretary and for this government   that be why on the day in the job i fly to odesa and join president zelensky and his team for the   afternoon i tell he that the ukrainians courage inspire the world i also tell he that this new government will step up support for ukraine at this critical moment in our week we announce a new package of uk military support include ammunition missile and artillery gun a new commitment to speed up the delivery pledge by the previous government and a promise to spend £ on military support for ukraine this year next year and every year for as long as it take 
 in the week since we have step up support even far we have sign a new £ defence industrial support treaty hit the £ milestone for the international fund for ukraine advance the uk lead maritime and drone capability coalition and agree a new £ contract for artillery shell   at the ukraine defence contact group meeting in ramstein on friday last week i announce a new £ production contract for air defence missile i also announce that the uk ’s operation interflex which have train ukrainian troop since will extend beyond this year and throughout our support be both short term and long term entail   immediate provision and long term production we be train troop today and develop ukrainian force for the future   this approach give the ukrainians the confidence to plan and it send a signal to putin that the uk and our ally will stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 there have be important battlefield development during the past month   in the week of august ukrainian force launch a remarkable offensive across russia ’s border and into the kursk region this expose the vulnerability of putin ’s frontline force and it demonstrate ukraine ’s ability to achieve surprise strategic attack it also help to well defend ukraine and its northern centre by push back against site from which russia can launch deadly attack   around sq km of territory be now hold by ukrainian force in the kursk region and this have put putin under pressure after initial disarray russian force be now deploy to the area in great number 
 but eastern ukraine continue to be russia ’s main focus with tactical advance bring pokrovsk within approximately km of the frontline with russia continue to rely on infantry lead assault its casualty remain high and rise daily casualty have double from this time last year with russia average more than a day kill or wound in july and august alone meanwhile recent russian air bombardment have be some of the most intense since the start of the war president zelensky state on friday in ramstein that missile and drone be fire at ukraine in the last month target critical national infrastructure and attack civilian centre include poltava and lviv in the last week since the impact of this have be that russia have destroy or capture more than of ukraine ’s power generation capacity force ukraine to implement power outage with winter approach 
 meanwhile at sea ukraine have score some significant success include drive russia ’s fleet out of the western black sea to reopen export trading route and destroy or damage russian naval vessel operate in the black sea include a russian kilo class submarine just last month despite these notable achievement russian pressure across the whole of the frontline will continue in the month ahead russian industry remain on a war footing russian artillery be outfire ukraine by at least to and russia be also conscript or recruit additional soldier this year for the come week thing be clear ukrainians need to strengthen their frontline in the east and look to hold the territory in kursk the long they hold kursk the weak putin become the long they hold kursk the well defend ukraine will be 
 this be discuss at the us lead ukraine defence contact group that i attend last friday with other defence ministers and president zelensky this be where military support and unity for ukraine be strengthen among allied nation and where the us defence secretary lloyd austin serve an important reminder to everyone 
 if ukraine be not free the world be not safe 
 this be why the defence of the uk start in ukraine if president putin prevail in ukraine he will not stop at ukraine if big nation redraw international boundary by force the sovereignty and security of all nation be undermine that be why uk support alongside ally be so important military economic industrial and diplomatic support 
 i also want this house to know that we be see clear grow sign of russian aggression beyond ukraine nato ally be report russian drone violate their airspace the head of the uk and us security service have confirm that russian intelligence be conduct a reckless campaign of sabotage across europe and last week the national cyber security centre reveal that russia ’s specialist gru unit be conduct offensive cyber operation direct at government and civilian infrastructure putin be target our security he be target our way of life 
 we face a decade of grow russian aggression but this be a government who will protect our people and our country we will actively deter and defend against russian threat work in partnership with ally that be why as a new government our defence policy will now be nato as we approach day of war this conflict be at a critical moment that be why the uk be step up support because this be not just ukraine ’s struggle it be our struggle too ukraine be fight to regain its sovereign territory but it be also fight to reinforce peace democracy and security in the rest of europe 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for early sight of his statement and for the briefing he have provide to i and all parliamentary colleague i associate myself and my party with the condolence he express regard the tragic death of lieutenant leyshon 
 as we have confirm previously i reiterate without reservation that as labour do when in opposition we will continue to do everything possible to support the government over ukraine we remain steadfast in our total condemnation of both putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine and his conduct of the war during which he have show no regard for human life even it would appear that of his own service personnel with loss now at terrible level on all side indeed this be of the secretary of state ’s most striking point on the operational situation it be an extraordinary testament to the brutal disposition of the putin regime that their strategy continue to rely on the mass sacrifice of infantry personnel 
 that say the secretary of state be surely right to remind we that despite the extraordinary naval success ukraine have enjoy in the black sea and the surprise incursion into kursk that have throw putin ’s regime into confusion russia remain a formidable foe and nothing at all can be take for grant on the contrary it be clear that the uk must continue to do all it can to support ukraine ’s government people and armed force 
 on the conservative benches we be proud of the role our government play in show real leadership in respect of ukraine if ukraine have fall early the world would have be in a precipice situation akin to the late 1930 but we make a huge difference to avoid that outcome by be the nation to train ukrainian troop the to provide main battle tank and in particular the to provide long range weapon in august president zelensky comment that britain ’s support for ukraine have slow down recently what assessment have the secretary of state make of those comment 
 on these benches we recognise that a key part of our leadership have be bring other ally on board which must continue in key operational and logistical decision making nevertheless we have also show leadership as a sovereign nation that believe wholeheartedly in ukraine ’s fight for freedom as such i confirm that we would have no hesitation in support the government in continue that leadership be they to confirm that the ukrainian government have maximum freedom of operation with regard to all the munition we have supply include long range missile 
 on the provision of additional munition and the late news share by the secretary of state i welcome the announcement of £ for air defence missile to be produce of course in belfast that underline the intention we have in government when the late round of support commence to ensure a maximum degree of benefit for the uk defence sector in our support for ukraine will the secretary of state confirm that that remain a top priority and that as we supply ukraine with more and more drone across defence he will ensure that we rapidly learn the lesson of their deployment so that we can build the ecosystem for our own sovereign uncrewed sector 
 we agree that supply ukraine with arm have be the right thing to do but and the public feel this very strongly that must be accompany by the replenishment of our own stockpile and platform inventory a top priority of our fund timetable commitment to be an additional £ to replenish our munition be the secretary of state still commit to that extra £ for munition can he confirm that the delay in set out a clear timetable to will not lead to the deferment of any major munition order either this financial year or next 
 the secretary of state speak of russian artillery outfire ukraine by 3:1 and he know the crucial importance of industrial output that be so do he recognise that we must urgently fire up production across our own defence sector by commit to as soon as possible 
 finally lesson from ukraine be the vital importance of maintain air superiority in battle in relation to our future combat air capability i ask the secretary of state a set of write question on   july   on the generation global combat air programme spending and he have to date answer only the question on historical spend not those on the current financial year will he therefore confirm whether his department will be defer any spending on gcap plan for the current financial year 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his support his tone and his commitment to continue to back further military aid to ukraine include the £ contract for lightweight multi role missile that i announce last week he talk about the mass sacrifice of russian personnel and he be right president putin be a leader who show contempt for the life of his own soldier 
 on uk leadership i have set out to the house my determination to maintain that leadership in the support for ukraine and demonstrate how we step that up in the week in the week that follow and last week at ramstein in term of the lesson for drone their deployment and our work with ukraine we be learn those lesson we need to speed that up give   the hon gentleman ’s previous job he will be well aware of the implication for the way in which we procure and contract for capability both for export and for our stockpile on stockpile we have as he will also know so far spend £ in the uk on replenishment we have plan to build that because we need to boost not just production but the productive capacity of uk industry so that we be capable of demonstrate that it can be scale up in the face of future threat in a way that be not apparent at present 
 the hon gentleman ask about long range missile i have to say that only putin benefit from an open debate about those sensitive issue and i will not comment on operational discussion there have be no change in the uk ’s position we continue to provide military aid to ukraine as i have set out to support its clear right to self defence and in line with the operation of international humanitarian law 
 on the question of we will increase defence spending to of gdp the last time the uk spend of gdp on defence be in when i last stand at this dispatch box as part of the previous labour government in the conservatives cut defence spending they never match in any of their year in office my priority will always be to ensure that this country be well defend in the face of grow threat we will do more to make britain secure at home and strong abroad 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and the commitment to support ukraine as we have see previously i welcome his statement about the investment in lmm defence can he say a bit more about the scope of that 
 i have say that ukraine be my order priority and i be in odessa on my day in the job i have now have the privilege of meet president zelensky time while in post and i have meet his defence minister time like the previous government we consistently try to respond to the need that ukraine say it have for system and ammunition at the moment above all it need new supply of ammunition and strong air defence system capable of take down russian missile and drone at different distance while the us make a commitment at ramstein last week to an extra $ in air defence system we make a commitment of an extra £ through a short range modern air defence system—650 lmms with production under way the of which will be deliver to ukraine before the end of the year we be step up the support that we pledge for ukraine and speed up the support that we deliver to ukraine 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 on behalf of the liberal democrats i wish to add to the tribute that other have pay to lieutenant rhodri leyshon he serve with the commando helicopter force in naval air squadron at yeovilton the royal navy say that rhodri be of their 
 most trusted and highly capable aircraft captain and instructor 
 our thought be with his family 
 i be remind of the saying train hard fight easy it be attribute to the century russian commander field marshal suvorov but the russians be not practise that today send to the front russians who have have as little as week training by contrast the training that have be provide under operation interflex have enable ukrainian troop to hold ground and exploit russian weakness the liberal democrats welcome the announcement last week at the ukraine defence contact group that operation interflex will continue until the end of indeed we have welcome announcement on ukraine from the current government and the previous government and we would not want to see any party political capital seek from the solid british support for ukraine 
 we have see some failure by the british state in recent year to plan for contingency whether post invasion planning for iraq or for a non flu pandemic we have discover that sometimes in the british state there be a little bit of hope for the good 
 on support for ukraine by the united states what contingency planning be be undertake for an uplift in our support for ukraine and by other state in the ukraine defence contact group in the event that a gap open up with a us administration under trump and vance 
 i be sure that lieutenant leyshon ’s family will appreciate the hon gentleman ’s comment 
 the outcome of the us presidential election will be determine by the american people this country have a deep relationship with the us it be our most important security ally and we be its most important intelligence ally the relationship go back decade and have survive the up and down of the political cycle on both side of the atlantic we be determined that it will do so again whatever the result of the election 
 on the question of training i can not match the hon gentleman in cite century military figure but i can say that the mismatch between the level of training that we and ally be try to provide to ukrainian troop be part of the attempt to counter the outmatch in number on the russian side i can confirm to the house that that include not just the ukrainian troop train so far under operation interflex since putin ’s invasion but the f-16 pilot train in english and technical matter as well as fly and almost ukrainian marine train by the uk work with ally that be why i be able to make the announcement last week at ramstein that this important uk training effort link into the new nato arrangement will be part of the way that we equip ukraine force for the future to be well prepared and train than their russian adversary 
 let we be under no illusion in the face of russian aggression and invasion the defence of the uk start in ukraine my right hon friend the defence secretary be right to focus not only on the immediate challenge face ukraine but on the long term imperative do he agree that the uk ukraine friendship be not just for the short term or for as long as it take but must endure in the year and decade to come 
 i do indeed a lot of attention be give to military aid to support ukraine ’s short term need its immediate battlefield requirement but in the long   term we need to reinforce ukraine ’s capacity to produce for itself that be why an important element of the step we have take to step up support for ukraine since the election just month ago have be to sign a defence export treaty which i be privileged to sign with defence minister umerov in no downing street it provide some £ worth of export credit guarantee that will help we do more to get the equipment ukraine need manufacture and export and into ukrainian hand for its fight against putin ’s invasion 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his statement people in ukraine be face great challenge and we can see how much resource russia be throw at the situation most colleague on the government benches feel it be time for storm shadow to be allow to be use with freedom by the ukrainian people will the right hon gentleman set out the legal restriction that be stop that from happen conflicting briefing have be come out of government 
 that be not a matter i be prepared to discuss openly as such a debate would benefit putin the principle upon which this country have give and will continue to give weapon to ukraine be that those weapon support ukraine ’s defence and its right to self defence as a sovereign nation to do so across the board do not preclude ukraine from strike target in russia if that be part of that determination and strategy for self defence and provide it be within the bound of international humanitarian law 
 without wish for to diminish the threat of putin ’s russia or the sacrifice that ukrainians continue to make i note that moscow ’s airport be close by ukrainian drone attack this morning that the russian central bank will raise interest rate to on friday and that half a russian troop have be kill all of that have be inflict by a country that be a of the size of russia do the secretary of state share my frustration that so many people in the west seem to accept the misinformation war putin ’s version of event that this war be go swimmingly for he when any rational assessment of the event of the last and a half year show that they have be an absolute catastrophe for russia 
 my hon friend be right part of the battle that putin be wag be with his own people to control their freedom include take step to assassinate political opponent and their right to freedom of information thing that have put president putin under pressure be that ukraine have take sq km of territory in the kursk region to defend its own city and centre in the north that have bring home to president putin and the russian people the consequence of his aggression and show that this be not a special operation simply confine to ukraine ukraine have the right to self defence in do so ukraine be try to defend itself well by strike target in russia from where the russians be launch the deadly attack from which ukrainian civilian city and power system have suffer for too long 
 what assessment have the defence secretary make of operation renovator and how do he plan to change it 
 the right hon gentleman ask a question with a good deal more information than the rest of the house i will write to he with the detail he seek rather than try to give a superficial answer from the dispatch box 
 i welcome the defence secretary ’s statement especially what he say about the deepen military and industrial strategy between the united kingdom and ukraine there be clearly a grow alliance building between russia and iran unite in undermine democracy and risk further proxy war will the defence secretary give his assessment on how the uk government seek to influence iran 
 my hon friend follow these matter closely and speak with authority in the house on these thing we have be warn in fact the previous government be warn too about the deepening security alliance between iran and russia part of the declaration make alongside international partner at the nato summit in washington warn iran that any transfer not just of drone technology but of ballistic missile technology to russia would be regard as a significant escalation the house can take a broad lesson from my hon friend ’s point iran ’s destabilisation be not a malign influence that be simply feel throughout part of the middle east but have wide repercussion which be why iran be of the most serious threat to this country in the future 
 the secretary of state can look forward to the same support for ukraine ’s defence from the snp that the previous government enjoy he mention increase air defence come from the uk and the united states that will be in ukraine before the end of the year russia will not wait until the end of the year before attack civilian infrastructure particularly energy infrastructure so will the secretary of state advise of any step that have be take to accelerate that increase air defence to the benefit of the people of ukraine 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s continue commitment and support give on behalf of his party to stand with ukraine in this house for some month the ukrainians have be say they want delivery of the pledge of military aid to help with their fight against the illegal full scale invasion they want what have be promise to be in their hand that be why when i meet president zelensky on my day as secretary of state for defence i make a point to not just say to he right this government be willing to step up the support we be offer but to tell he that we recognise that imperative and will speed up the support we offer we will speed up the delivery of the big package of aid announce by the previous government in april and we will try to say to president zelensky where we pledge our support we will give you a guarantee about the delivery time by which it will be in your hand to strengthen your fight for your sovereignty and against this illegal invasion 
 i strongly welcome the confirmation of the extension of operation interflex over this year and next will the secretary of state join i in pay tribute to the hard work and professionalism of the uk troop involve in the operation and the bravery of all the ukrainian troop who be serve to protect their home 
 my hon friend remind the house of a very important point number be thing we can say that the uk have lead the operation interflex nation to train ukrainian troop but more importantly the expertise of british and other ally soldier have help to provide the ukrainian soldier who be step forward to help defend their country with combat medical skill battlefield training and survival technique i have the privilege to join the then leader of the opposition on salisbury plain to witness some of the training and later to talk to ukrainian troop who have finish their training at brize norton as they be poise to fly back to ukraine they be man very much like any in this house lorry driver accountant and public relation executive who be now alongside their civilian colleague fight for the future of their country and the right to decide as a sovereign nation its future in the world i pay tribute to their bravery and to the skill of our armed force in help to train they for that task 
 we have have a quote from suvorov and napoleon famously say that 
 the moral be to the physical as be to 
 after and a half year of a barbaric russian invasion we can not expect the ukrainians to keep resist with hand tie behind their back that mean that while the russians attack power station with long range missile at will with winter come and while they use glide bomb which be brutally effective as tactical weapon on the frontline we have to allow the ukrainians full freedom of action to retaliate not just as a military necessity but to maintain their own morale they must be bolster to keep go we could help they and it be about time that we do that thing 
 the right hon gentleman make his very strong point in his customary way this be about not retaliation but self defence and he be quite right to say that the impact of the moral often outweigh the impact of the physical when i update the house on the physical the sq km of the kursk region that be now in ukrainian hand the moral or morale impact on ukrainian troop and ukrainian citizen have be huge so just as it be put pressure on putin it be also lift the spirit of ukraine after nearly day of a bloody battle against putin ’s invasion 
 the secretary of state spend the last sunday of the election campaign in prestwick near our town ’s world war polish war memorial within day he be in odesa and have step up and speed up the support that the uk be deliver do he agree that we have start as we mean to go on and that this government will stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 yes i do it be a real pleasure to see my hon friend in his place he bring expertise from a very wide field of foreign policy affair i know that he will make a big contribution to this house and if i make a small contribution to his election campaign then i be doubly pleased to see he 
 the secretary of state be a consistent supporter of ukraine in opposition so it be no surprise to hear that positive statement from he today when he go into battle with the chancellor of the exchequer for a good defence budget will he remind she that in the 1980 and the cold war we regularly spend to of gdp on defence will he also assure the house that if america elect a president who do not wish to support ukraine the support for ukraine by the remain european member of nato will intensify not diminish 
 when as a government we declare that we be ready we show that by step up support for ukraine when we say that we will stand with ukraine for as long as it take for it to prevail we mean it whatever the decision of other country may or may not be i do not expect whatever the result of the us election for the us to walk away from ukraine i say in my statement that if big country with authoritarian ruler can redraw international boundary by force the sovereignty and security of all nation be leave weaken 
 on the question of defence spending we be a government who will not be have battle as the right hon member put it but i will go into the discussion that i will inevitably have with the chancellor with a copy of our labour manifesto which at the election say that we be a government who will spend of gdp on defence we will increase spending on defence which be entirely the opposite of what happen when we have the change of government in that be a government who cut defence spending over those year by nearly 
 may i thank the secretary of state for his statement but also the ministers who have provide cross party briefing to colleague it really be appreciate president zelensky have call on partner to ensure that aid package that be announce be deliver to ukrainians as quickly as possible will the secretary of state set out the action that the government be take to ensure that aid to ukraine be speed up 
 my hon friend be quite right step up the pledge of aid be thing but speed up the delivery be another that be why on that day in odesa i make an undertaking to the defence minister and president zelensky that this be a government who would do both i be able to update the defence minister in ukraine of progress on each of the element of the package that we have pledge 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his statement even though he have announce nothing new today i very much welcome that he be keep this matter at the top of his and the nation ’s agenda although he may be able to say little about this will he forgive those of we   who can speak for continue to press for the west to untie the hand of our ukrainian ally so that they can strike back at those who be strike at they illegally and without justification we know that that probably do not apply to this government but will he confirm that there be discussion with our ally about this matter may i wish he every success in help we to deliver the freedom and security of the world by break the stalemate in ukraine that will overwhelm the west if we allow it to continue 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment and for his welcome to i i note the point that he make on the point about my not announce anything new i just say to he that i do so on friday last week this be my opportunity to update the house on the announcement of extra aid not just last week but in the week over the summer recess and indeed the package in our week in office this be the sitting week since the election and i hope that he will be reassure by my personal undertaking to ensure that i update the house on development in ukraine on a regular basis 
 i too welcome the secretary of state ’s statement and his wholehearte commitment of this country to the defence of our ally in its hour of need in the face of putin ’s aggression i be very pleased that my constituency of stevenage be where many of the storm shadow missile be ship to ukraine be manufacture but of course manufacture missile and other armament take time will the secretary of state explain what step he and his department can take to speed up that process 
 i will indeed i be delighted to see my hon friend take his place on the labour benches as part of a labour government speak up for stevenage his constituency be home not just to the production of some of the most important defence equipment but to their development and the technology that go into it 
 we will build on some of the step that   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge   take as minister for defence procurement in the last month of the previous government i recognise that with the nature of warfare change so rapidly exemplify by what we see in ukraine large platform which may take many year to produce risk rapidly become outdate in the technology and system that they cover we have to be able to procure we have to be able to develop as we procure and once in the field we have to be able to update on a regular basis my hon friend must take it from that that this be a question not just of well value for money but of more speed and clear decision making in everything we do that will be a hallmark of the way we develop our procurement reform and our new industrial strategy drive by the need to reinforce growth in this country as part of the success of this government 
 i congratulate the defence secretary and his ministers and welcome they to their place it be right that the uk stand with ukraine to protect the life and freedom of the innocent people and the sovereignty of a free state in addition to the military support provide will the secretary of state update the house on what diplomatic   effort be be make to negotiate an end to the russian aggression a full withdrawal from ukraine and a return to peaceful co existence as soon as possible 
 i will just say to the hon gentleman that it be the ukrainians who be fight not we it be the ukrainians who will make the call about when to stop fight and when to start talk not we our task be to reinforce the ukrainians now to put they in the strong possible position if and when they make that decision and then to put they in the strong possible position if they go into negotiation 
 of the key feature throughout the statement and the discussion today have be the importance of consensus and co operation in build a coalition will the secretary of state give an update on what step he intend to take next to ensure that we be support ukraine with the broad and good coalition possible 
 it be my time at the ramstein meeting on friday last week the such meeting of that coalition lead by the us senior representative of other country participate and all pledge both more military support for ukraine and to reinforce the unity with which we stand with ukraine i hope that that be not just reassurance for ukrainians but a signal to president putin that we remain united we remain resolute and in the end he will not prevail
