the right hon and learn gentleman have the opportunity to condemn the comment of his mayor a mayor who say that there be an equivalence between hamas and israel and he do not do that everyone will see that be the change labour party right there 
 since i become prime minister small boat crossing be down by a that be because we have double national crime agency funding increase enforcement rate closed bank account deport people   and process more claim when it come to border control there be a crucial difference between we the conservatives want secure border the right hon and learn gentleman be happy with open border 
 we now move on to debate clause and before i delve into the detail of the clause however let i briefly set out how they fit into this finance bill 
 the government remain focused on take long term decision to strengthen the economy by drive productivity increase the number of people in high wage high skilled job and boost investment the government be also ensure that the tax system be as competitive as we can make it under very difficult economic circumstance we have some of the most generous investment incentive among major economy include full permanent expensing which the obr have forecast will generate almost £ of additional business investment each year or £ over the next year it have forecast that that additional investment will increase gdp by by the end of the forecast in addition to full expensing we have an internationally competitive corporation tax rate the low headline rate in the g7 which this bill legislate to maintain 
 i will now turn to clause and in more detail clause and set the charge for corporation tax from april this include both the main rate and the small profit rate as well as the threshold at which those rate apply the charge for corporation tax must be set every year it be important to legislate annually in advance as this provide certainty to large and very large company that pay tax in advance on the basis of their estimate tax liability these clause maintain the current main rate of and the small profit rate of as introduce in april tax certainty be of great importance to business i think that be something we can all agree on and clause and ensure that they will continue to benefit from stable and predictable tax rule by maintain the current rate the government have strike the right balance between remain competitive and raise vital revenue 
 clause make change to ensure that the energy profit levy will no long apply if oil and gas price return to historically normal level for a sustained period of time it do so by introduce legislation to give effect to the energy security investment mechanism or esim the epl be introduce in at a time of near record high oil and gas price but it be right that should those price return to historically normal level the additional tax would cease to apply the detail of how the esim operate be set out in the   technical note publish alongside the autumn statement this bill simply put that detail on a legislative footing and provide for secondary legislation to legislate for the administrative detail of how that check be make 
 current oil and gas price be high than normal and obr projection indicate that high price will persist over the next year the esim be a mechanism that switch off the epl if for a period of month the average price of both oil and gas fall below set threshold those threshold be currently $ per barrel for oil and 50p per therm for gas and be base on a year historical average to the end of before high energy price begin and be adjust each april base on the annual change in the precede december ’s consumer price index by provide certainty on the condition under which the levy will be disapplie the government be support investor confidence in the sector and help to protect domestic energy supply the economy and of course job 
 clause and provide certainty to business by maintain the current rate of corporation tax and clause have be welcome by the oil and gas operator and their investor with the esim provide the sector with certainty to support future investment in the uk in job and in our energy security while also ensure fairness to taxpayer i therefore commend these clause to the committee 
 before we begin question i wish to make a short statement about the house ’s sub judice resolution member will be aware of the recent death at hm prison parc include more death overnight a coroner ’s inquest have be open into some of those death these proceeding be now sub judice while the sub judice rule can be waive it be not to be do lightly and for the time be no reference should be make to those proceeding in the house 
 member may ask about related issue to do with the health and safety of prisoner and the security of the prison estate but i urge hon member to exercise caution in what they say and particularly to avoid speculate on the cause of the death of these man 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on the impact of the mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales on road user 
 what recent discussion he have have with the cabinet secretary for north wales and transport on the impact of the mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales on road user 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on the impact of the mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales on road user 
 mr rosindell be not here but will the secretary of state answer his question as it be the lead 
 before i do so mr speaker may i fully support your ruling and send my deep condolence to the relative of all those who have die in prison 
 may i make it absolutely clear that i conservative mp senedd members and councillor be supportive of a mph speed limit in certain area such as outside school hospital old people ’s home or anywhere where there be vulnerable pedestrian but the blanket mph speed limit have have a detrimental effect on road user user of public transport and business across wales and i call on the welsh labour government to think again 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer clearly there be a strong case for mph limit outside school in shopping area and in other area where there be huge pedestrian activity but a blanket ban be outrageous have he any detail as to the cost to the welsh economy of this extremely damaging move and indeed the cost of implement it across wales in such a blanket fashion 
 my understanding be that the vast majority of mph road be now mph i have see a figure suggest that it be around 96%—[interruption mr speaker it be a blanket ban on mph road and that be exactly what the welsh labour government put out there i can give my hon friend an indication of the cost because the welsh government ’s own impact assessment suggest that this would cause a £ hit to the welsh economy and on top of that taxpayer have have to pay £ for mph road sign 
 this be really concern and i note that almost half a people a record number sign a petition on the senedd ’s move because they be so concerned about the impact that the measure will have it cost £ to implement and now it be estimate that an extra £ be need to unwind the change what conversation be my right hon friend have with the welsh government to ensure that we do not see such policy again 
 we certainly do not want policy such as this there be an anti motorist agenda with the welsh labour government that include not only mph speed limit but legislation bring in toll on the m4 and a ban on any major new road project be build we have even have monmouthshire labour council suggest that it might want to campaign to bring back severn bridge toll the lesson be that if people support motorist and support the right to drive a car they should vote conservative at the next general election 
 on this illogical decision to pursue a mph limit do the minister agree that there be a lesson to be learn for a government in wales or elsewhere try to pursue something that the general public quite clearly do not want at all 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question he raise a very good point because this be clearly do against the wish of almost half a people a record number of people who sign a petition on this matter the most recent announcement by the welsh government which raise the possibility of their do a screeching u turn on the policy suggest to i that they might be more interested in deflect national press attention from the scandal involve the welsh labour government in cardiff bay 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 if you will indulge i mr speaker i would like to acknowledge the anniversary this week of welsh devolution deliver by a labour government it have help to nurture a confident modern and outward look wales and labour members be proud of it 
 not a single of the hon member who have raise question on this issue live in wales and the speed limit be not blanket as the secretary of state well know it be a bit like the conservative councillor in sunderland who set up anti-20 mph facebook group while campaign for the limit in his own area meanwhile a mother whose year old son be hit by a car near his school in flintshire say that the mph speed limit likely save his life do the secretary of state agree that her intervention represent an important endorsement of the welsh labour government ’s policy to protect life especially child ’s life 
 i too acknowledge the anniversary of devolution we be promise that it would deliver well school hospital and public standard what we actually have be the long waiting list and the bad educational standard in the united kingdom and a minister who be willing to take a £ donation from a twice convict criminal that be the record of year of labour run government in wales 
 i say straightaway that i be in favour of mph limit outside school hospital and other place where there be vulnerable pedestrian i do not like the blanket ban that have be impose as part of the anti motorist agenda of the welsh labour government 
 it be rich of government members to chunter about donation how much of mr frank hester ’s million be bankroll the conservative general election campaign this be a man who say that a black woman mp in this house should be shoot 
 on road do the secretary of state agree with his own association deputy chairman write in conservativehome this week that politic in wales be a cul de sac for the tory party the welsh public do not like divisive politic and they do not like wales be constantly talk down by the tories be that why they have not win a domestic election in wales for over a century 
 i remind the hon lady that we just get more vote than the labour party in my constituency of monmouth in the police and crime commissioner election what people in wales want be public service waiting list and education standard that match what be be deliver by this conservative government in england and standard in public life that reflect what we expect from member of parliament in the united kingdom that be not what we be get under the welsh labour government 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the biodiversity of welsh river and stream 
 water be a devolved matter in wales and therefore river and stream in wales be the responsibility of the welsh government the uk government recognise that river be an essential part of our natural environment that be why we be work on the uk national biodiversity strategy and action plan 
 will the minister fess up to the fact that the real scandal in wales be that the uk government keep denigrate a good welsh government that in term of biodiversity and so much else be well than the rest of the uk on biodiversity they be time well than england be it not about time that we get a few welsh idea and welsh leader to help we clean up our act and our river 
 that be a good attempt but i simply can not disagree with the hon gentleman more it be this government who force water company to provide £ towards investment in the storm overflow network improve water quality across england in wales the picture could not be more different the average number of sewage spill per outflow be in england it be our record speak for itself 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 thank you mr speaker for clarify the sub judice rule in relation to parc prison mp across south wales be disappoint that the urgent question be decline yesterday but we understand why we will continue to seek answer and to scrutinise ministers over these deeply distressing event and the way the prison be be run 
 thousand of pembrokeshire resident continue to have their life blight by air pollution and fear about water pollution from the withyhedge landfill site give that the ministers in wales who be responsible for oversee the public health and the environmental regulatory response both vote last week to block an independent investigation into the financial dealing between the owner of that site and the minister how on earth can my constituent have confidence that their concern will be address impartially and the problem resolve 
 my right hon friend live this issue on a daily basis and i commend he for highlight the plight of his constituent who have to endure the impact of such devastating environmental pollution any way we look at it this donation stink and it be shameful that the welsh government be evade scrutiny on the issue his constituent can have no confidence that this matter will be investigate there be no independent scrutiny here labour members should explain why they be scared of scrutiny on this question 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in wales 
 the uk government fully recognise the challenge pose by cost of living pressure that have come about as a result of covid and the invasion of ukraine that be why they have commit to the triple lock on pension for this parliament increase the living wage benefit people in wales and put an average £ back into the pocket of a typical worker in wales through national insurance cut 
 the trussell trust say that of people in wales have cut back on or skip meal in the last month what conversation be the secretary of state have with supermarket about hold down the cost of food for customer 
 i know that many supermarket be support food bank within their local area and the uk government have certainly support those with the least by make sure that pension benefit and the minimum wage all go up in line with inflation and make extra payment on top to pensioner those on benefit and household where there be disability however if the hon lady be truly concerned about cost of living pressure in wales perhaps she ought to ask her colleague in the welsh labour government why on this very day welsh labour ministers be support a plan to create dozen of extra senedd members at a cost of £ all money that could be far well spend on support those with the least 
 be the secretary of state aware of a study by citizens advice cymru indicate that more than half a people in wales be struggle to make end meet if he be aware what be he do about it 
 i have already outline the extra payment that be be make to pensioner and those on benefit and disability and the fact that pension benefit and the minimum wage have all go up in line with inflation on top of that the uk government have deliver town fund growth deal round of level up funding investment zone freeport an electric arc furnace in south wales and an electrified rail line in north wales and what be we get from the welsh labour government we be get £ spend on extra senedd members while we level up the economy they want to level up the number of politician in cardiff bay 
 the secretary of state mention ukraine and covid as contribute factor to the cost of living crisis but he forget to mention brexit or be he go to try to argue that brexit have somehow improve thing and make good and service cheap for people in wales 
 i would be only too delighted to mention brexit which be vote for by a majority of the united kingdom and a majority in wales and point out to the hon gentleman that since brexit the uk have grow fast than france and germany i could also mention waste money on scottish embassy all around the world try to build ferry that have not yet be float anywhere raise taxis and try to shut down the oil and gas industry in scotland as measure that be unlikely to help with cost of living pressure in scotland 
 the development bank of wales be suppose to be aid business through cost of living pressure do my right hon friend agree that it be unacceptable that company receive £ from the bank and be then able to give the minister of wales £ 
 my hon friend raise a very interesting point here the development bank of wales which be own ultimately by the welsh taxpayer should be there to support business through cost of living pressure it be able to make a £ loan to a company that be then able to turn round and add £ back into a political donation to enable the minister to win the welsh labour leadership election it be a very good question but it be not a question for i it be that should be answer by those on the shadow front bench on this matter they have be very silent indeed 
 small business particularly those in retail and hospitality be directly affect by cost of living challenge come from covid and the energy price spike from the ukraine conflict the chancellor have therefore introduce a business rate relief scheme in england which be support business in england do my right hon friend the secretary of state share my concern that that funding be not be use to the same degree in wales and that business rate in wales be only be relieve at a rate of so business be pay more in tax 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the uk government make certain that the money for the business rate discount be pass on to the welsh labour government but instead of pass it on to the pub restaurant and small business that be so vital to community in wales they have decide to spend it on other matter such as the they be vote on today as a result the average pub in wales be pay thousand more in business rate than a pub just across the border in england that be absolutely scandalous and i urge the welsh labour government to think about where their priority be 
 i call the shadow minister 
 no contrition then in any of those answer from the secretary of state whose party have by freeze tax threshold pile on £ extra on average to the tax bill of around pensioner in wales the prime minister have now make a totally unfunded £ promise to scrap national insurance will the secretary of state tell we how on earth the government will pay for that and will he rule out raise income tax by 8p or scrap winter fuel payment to do so 
 we have make it clear that we want to keep the triple lock to ensure that pension continue to increase in line with inflation we will be able to afford that by ensure that we get growth in the economy which be why we want to end the double taxation system of make those in work pay extra money through national insurance tax we have also make it clear that we will make tax cut only when we can afford they because on the conservative side of the house we do not believe in make unfunded promise in order to buy vote 
 more than in child in wales live in poverty devolution have the capacity to transform people ’s life but the current minister be distract by question about his integrity delete message and take dodgy donation after year since the start of devolution do the secretary of state agree that government at both end of the m4 need to recommit to integrity and transparency 
 i can absolutely assure the right hon lady that this government and the conservative party be completely commit to integrity—[interruption labour member be laugh but their own minister take £ from a convict criminal who have receive £ from a bank for which the minister be responsible and tell the covid committee that all the message on his phone have be accidentally delete by the it department but now we see a screenshot in which he urge people to delete their message so that they can not be subject to a freedom of information request labour members have the audacity to sit there laugh when people ask question about standard i say that the right hon lady make a very good point let we collapse the coalition and stop support the welsh labour government and then we can get a decent government with decent value run wales 
 my party seek to make a difference to the life of the people of wales but the secretary of state and i be in agreement for once when it come to his judgment in relation to the minister it scream hypocrisy however because the tories in the senedd vote against a plaid cymru motion to set a cap on political donation and his party have still not return a £ donation from a man who make racist and misogynistic remark in that spirit of open democracy will he support a cap on donation to political party 
 i will not sit here and start make policy on the hoof but i say to the right hon lady and i think she would agree that i would not have take hundred of thousand of pound in donation from somebody who have be convict twice of environmental offence if labour member be happy with that it be a matter for they 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the river wye action plan 
 i thank my right hon friend for his work as chair of the environmental audit committee the uk government ’s river wye action plan will halt ongoing decline of the river wye to preserve and restore that treasured river to the rating of favourable condition 
 as the minister have already say the environment be a devolved matter but nobody seem to have tell the river wye which rise in wales and cross the border to merge into the river severn in england i very much welcome the river wye action plan which the department for environment food and rural affairs announce recently have my hon friend see any action take by the welsh government to match the uk government ’s commitment to clean up the polluted river wye 
 in the interest of time i will give my right hon friend a very short answer no the welsh government have fail to come to the table time and time again on this issue which be close to my heart as a constituency mp for the river wye that have be the miss piece of the puzzle and it be why we be see no action in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with the welsh government on nhs waiting time 
 healthcare be devolve to the welsh government who have receive record level of funding to deliver on all their devolved responsibility receive more funding per person than in england 
 so many people in wales be wait long for nhs care than people in england and in a month period people have to go from wales to england for elective care do that not show that labour ’s claim to be well for the nhs be completely false 
 my right hon friend be entirely right the nhs be not safe in labour ’s hand and we have live proof of that in wales it be a great shame that when the secretary of state for health in england offer the support of the nhs in england to alleviate pressure on wait time in wales the welsh health secretary turn that support down that be labour ’s record on the nhs 
 of the problem that a lot of my constituent have raise with i be that when they do get a letter call they for an appointment include for which they have be wait for some time that letter arrive after the appointment date because the royal mail be now deliver such an appalling service be it not time that we have a strong word to make sure that people who be be call for appointment get a chance to turn up to they because they have actually receive their letter on time 
 the hon gentleman make a good point and that i will certainly investigate with colleague but i think the problem lie with the mismanagement of the welsh nhs for which his party must take responsibility 
 what step he be take to help support victim of crime in wales 
 the uk government recognise the importance of victim have access to the support they need to recover from the impact of crime that be why we be quadruple funding for victim service up from £ in 
 as a recent victim of crime i know that impact on victim be that it make you reflect on how many crime remain unsolved the late figure show that in crime in wales go unsolved in the past month so what can the minister say to the victim of the report crime that go uncharged last year 
 may i say how sorry i be to learn that the hon lady have be a victim of crime i know the experience she have go through and i personally send she my huge sympathy 
 this government have a proud record of deliver for victim of crime whether through new piece of legislation or the record headcount of police officer unfortunately it be the welsh government who choose to reduce the number of police community support officer last year which be have an impact on victim of crime 
 do my hon friend agree that we be all victim when senior labour politician make false and misleading statement at public inquiry 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right it be deeply concern that a minister should reveal himself to have act in such a way which appear to be entirely contrary i look forward to welsh labour members call for further scrutiny of that issue 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on a range of subject include steelmaking in wales the government be invest £ to retain steelmaking at port talbot and other tata site include llanwern and shotton protect job and thousand more in the supply chain while increase our economic security at the same time the government have put aside £ for the transition board to spend on support anyone who lose their job in port talbot or in the wide community 
 whether it be the transmission pylon and line need to upgrade our power grid as demand by the winser report or the prospect of build steel base offshore wind platform the welsh steel industry can and should be central to our transition to a net nation when historic investment in green steel be be make by european competitor do the secretary of state recognise that the government ’s lack of ambition for britain have let thousand of skilled worker down 
 the hon gentleman make a good point about the importance of make sure there be a grid connection to enable an electric arc furnace to work properly i have raise this issue with national grid and it have assure i that the grid connection can be make on time 
 the hon gentleman make a reasonable point about the importance of be able to use steel produce in port talbot for float offshore wind turbine that be not the case at the moment because as some of his front benchers seem to be unaware the steel make in port talbot be coil which be too thin to make those turbine however he will be pleased to know that there be discussion go on with major investor to try to ensure that the steel produce from the arc furnace can be make in a way that could support float offshore wind structure 
 the sustainability of domestic automotive manufacturing be vital to the future prosperity of luton ’s local economy so what discussion have the secretary of state have with the uk ’s automotive industry about the effect of lose our sovereign virgin steel production on their supply chain cost 
 i have regular discussion with the automotive industry and i have also have regular discussion with the steel industry across the united kingdom some of the grade that be currently produce by port talbot can be produce use an electric arc furnace and there be work go on to ensure that the other can be 
 may i just remind the hon lady that we actually have a plan for port talbot when tata come to we it be look to close down port talbot and pull out of the united kingdom a move that would have cost job and in the wide supply chain as a result of that the uk conservative government step forward with half a pound of investment to support an electric arc furnace and a furth £ to support retrain worker and infrastructure improvement in port talbot we have have not single penny from the welsh labour government   who instead have decide today to prioritise spending £ on more senedd member more senedd members or support for steelworker i know what my priority be 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may 
 i know the whole house will join i in congratulate john swinney on become scottish national party leader and scottish minister i look forward to work constructively with he to deliver for the people of scotland 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 at last week ’s prime minister ’s question i highlight the shocking rise in the number of teenager try vaping and i ask the prime minister if he would take decisive action to stop vape advertising on football strip he decline to do that since then i have have an exchange with the scottish chief medical officer professor sir gregor smith during a sitting of the tobacco and vapes bill committee and he say 
 where i become very uncomfortable and i be not supportive be where the massive attraction of sport company be use in a way that promote behaviour that be know to be unsafe or unhealthy ”––[official report tobacco and vapes public bill committee   may c. q11 
 can i ask the prime minister again do he still think it be right that vape company should sponsor football kit 
 i be glad the hon lady agree with i and the government that we should do more to tackle youth vaping and that be why we be bring forward measure in the new bill to restrict the availability and appeal of vape to child specifically whether that be flavours or indeed marketing as she know advertising of vape be already heavily restrict by uk regulation include a ban on advertising on television radio and most place online we have see football take positive voluntary action in the past on issue such as this but i will say to the hon lady that the government will respond to her specific amendment in the usual way 
 i declare that my daughter be a serve officer in the armed force 
 in recent week my right hon friend have announce plan to control welfare and get people back to work and to increase defence spending to of gdp and have pass legislation to get flight off to rwanda do he agree with i that these be all issue that real people such as my constituent in south east cornwall care about and that the leader of the opposition should do the right thing and back they 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for her local area and can i also thank her daughter for her service in the armed force my hon friend be right i be not surprised that labour member do not back our plan to stop the boat and i be not surprised they do not back our plan to get people into work and reform welfare but i do think that they should do the right thing when it come to the security of our nation and that be to back our plan to increase defence spending and give our brave armed force personnel the resource they need to keep we safe 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i warmly welcome my hon friend   the new member for blackpool south chris webb after the representation that fine town have have recently it be good to know that it have a proper champion back at last 
 may i also warmly welcome the new labour mp my hon friend   the member for dover mrs elphicke to these bench if week a tory mp who be also a doctor say that the prime minister can not be trust with the nhs and join labour and the next week the tory mp for dover on the frontline of the small boat crisis say that the prime minister can not be trust with our border and join labour what be the point of this fail government stagger on 
 can i join the right hon and learn gentleman in welcome his new mp for blackpool he look a lot happy than the member sit in that spot last week let i also join the right hon and learn gentleman in congratulate all new and pay tribute to all former councillor police and crime commissioner and mayors across the country i hope that his new one do he as proud as i be proud of all of mine include such great leader as andy street they leave behind a strong legacy of more home more job and more investment in sharp contrast to the legacy leave by the last labour government which be a letter joke that there be no money leave 
 in addition to lose tory mp in week the prime minister have be on the receive end of some of the big by election swing in history he have also lose tory councillor half of his party ’s mayors and a leadership election to a lettuce how many more time do the public and his own mps need to reject he before he take the hint 
 this time last year i remind the right hon and learn gentleman of some advice from his own mentor tony blair who say at the time that he 
 can be as cocky as he like about the local election come a general election policy count ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 year on from that advice what have he manage he have £ of tax rise new business regulation u turn and a deputy leader under a police investigation 
 i be surprised that the prime minister bring up a police investigation his record be play lose well actually it be there be the seatbelt as well his record be play lose in relation to police investigation the voter keep tell he that it be not good enough instead of listen he keep tell they that everything be fine if only they would realise his greatness he just do not get it but at least after thursday night he can go to the many place he call home and enjoy the fruit of his success in southampton or downing street he have great labour council at his mansion in richmond he can enjoy a brand new labour mayor of north yorkshire at his pad in kensington he can celebrate a historic term for the mayor of london now that he too can enjoy the benefit of this change labour party be he really still in such a hurry to get back to california 
 i must say that i be surprised to see the right hon and learn gentleman in north yorkshire although probably not as surprised as he be when he realise he could not take the tube there i can tell he that the people of north yorkshire believe in hard work secure border low taxis and straight talk common sense they will not get any of that from a virtue signal lawyer from north london 
 it be great to be in northallerton where they have just vote to reject the prime minister ’s proposition he have finally find something in common with the british public no matter where he call home all his neighbour be back this change labour party they keep reject he because they have susse he out they know there be nothing behind the boast the gimmick and the smug smile he be a dodgy salesman desperate to sell they a dud day ago when he hold a press conference claim victory on rwanda he say 
 the next few week will be about action people want deed not word 
 let we test that how many small boat crossing have there be since he say that day ago 
 actually just before we get on to that the right hon and learn gentleman talk about a change labour party—[interruption this be important he talk about a change labour party he talk about it a lot he also talk about his mayor in london just this morning we learn that the labour mayor in london believe there be an equivalence between the brutal terrorist attack of hamas and israel defend itself let i be crystal clear there be absolutely no equivalence between a terrorist group and democratic state will he take this opportunity to demonstrate that the labour party have change will he condemn those comment from the labour mayor 
 i know that be the last run out before the general election but the prime minister be get ahead of himself in ask i question 
 i notice that the prime minister do not even attempt to answer the question he know the answer since he claim victory day ago there have be a staggering small boat crossing that be a gimmick not a deterrent and those will be add to the tories asylum perma backlog which be forecast to rise to by the end of the year the prime minister pretend that he will remove they all to rwanda but rwanda can take only a few a year at that rate his grand plan would take over year to remove they all there be ten of thousand of people with their claim go unprocessed who will be here for their entire lifetime live in hotel at the taxpayer expense it be absurd to call that anything other than an amnesty hand to they by the tory party be n’t it 
 the right hon and learn gentleman have the opportunity to condemn the comment of his mayor a mayor who say that there be an equivalence between hamas and israel and he do not do that everyone will see that be the change labour party right there 
 since i become prime minister small boat crossing be down by a that be because we have double national crime agency funding increase enforcement rate closed bank account deport people   and process more claims.[official report   may vol c. 4wc correction when it come to border control there be a crucial difference between we the conservatives want secure border the right hon and learn gentleman be happy with open border 
 the whole country know that remove less than of asylum seeker be not stop the boat it be grant an amnesty a tory amnesty if the prime minister think the voter be wrong that his own mp who have join the labour party be wrong and that anyone believe any of the nonsense that he spout why do he not put it to the test and call a general election 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about remove people this be a person who campaign to stop the deportation of foreign national offender that show how out of touch his value be with the british people 
 it be yet another week where we have hear nothing about the right hon and learn gentleman ’s plan to do anything on the issue that matter to the country meanwhile the government be get on with reform welfare and get people into work he oppose it we be control legal and illegal migration he oppose it and as we hear we be boost defence spending to strengthen our country he oppose it that be the difference he snip from the sideline the conservatives be build a bright future 
 when it come to small boat crossing there be a lot of talk of human right but surely the only human right and life that matter be the life of child who be be take across the channel in that respect will the government now do the only thing that will actually be a real deterrent and arrest and detain all those who land illegally on our shore and then offshore they promptly so that once and for all we can save life and end this cruel and callous trade 
 my right hon friend be right that these crossing be incredibly dangerous and risk people ’s life just week ago a year old girl die attempt a crossing that be why as a matter of basic compassion we must do everything we can to break the cycle of the criminal gang 
 that be why we need a deterrent that be what the national crime agency say and that be how we deal with illegal migrant from albania it be only by remove people who should not be here that we remove the reason for they to come in the place that be how we will control our border it be clear that it be only the conservative party that have a plan not only to stop the boat but to stop the tragic loss of life in the channel too 
 i call the scottish national party leader

 i know that my hon friend have be a dedicated campaigner for the ashbourne bypass the government be commit to invest more in the midland and in particular to put every penny of the £ from high speed back into the local area my hon friend be right we will focus on driver and their priority rather than continue the war on motorist that be be wag by the labour mayor in london but also by the labour party in wales with both the ultra low emission zone and mph speed limit it be this party that be unashamedly on the side of the motorist 
 our cross party child of the north all party parliamentary group find that expectant mother   be terminate want pregnancy because they could   not afford another mouth to feed recent figure show that infant and child death rate have increase in the most deprive area and child have die alone in unregulated accommodation be this the prime minister ’s plan for a bright britain in action

 it be more than a month since the parliamentary ombudsman deliver the long await report on pension injustice but woman bear in the 1950 in my constituency and indeed in every constituency across these island be still wait to hear whether the uk government will listen to its recommendation and deliver compensation i be proud to see the scottish parliament support a motion last week call for compensation to be deliver without delay but utterly dismay to see member of both the conservative party and the labour party abstain can the prime minister finally tell we when the women against state pension inequality campaign the waspi woman will receive the compensation that they rightly deserve 
 i understand the strong feeling across the chamber about this topic and the desire for urgency in address they however follow the ombudsman ’s year investigation it be imperative that we take the time to conduct a thorough review of the comprehensive finding that have be publish an update will be give to the house once those finding have be fully consider more broadly we be commit to ensure that pensioner have the dignity and security in retirement that they deserve most recently we increase the state pension by £ a year thank to the triple lock 
 be the prime minister as appal as i be by report of militant civil servant and trade union political activist seek to find way not to implement the rwanda deportation do he agree that if they be not prepared to implement the will of the government and an act of parliament that be pass by both house they should conclude that be in the civil service be perhaps not for they maybe they can look for alternative employment at other left wing organisation that masquerade as   be impartial maybe they could try the bbc or channel news 
 my expectation be that civil servant will continue to be commit to support our priority of stop the boat and will deliver in accordance with the civil service code my hon friend will know that we make specific change to ensure compliance with that code as we push through with our plan more broadly i agree with he that we be the only party that have a plan to stop the boat we will face down all the obstacle in our way to deliver on this crucial priority for the british people whoever stand in our way whether it be the labour party or other we will deliver for this country on this vital issue 
 china have now hack the datum of defence personnel the electoral commission and various other public institution and have target many member of this house yet plan by china ’s large wind turbine manufacturer ming yang smart energy to build its large european facility right here in the uk advance at pace the facility be set to be build in scotland give widely share concern about the involvement of hostile state such as china in the uk ’s critical national energy infrastructure do the prime minister not agree that now be the time for this project to be pause and review by the government on national security ground if not what message do he think that send 
 as i have say repeatedly china be a country with different value from ours and be act in a way that be increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad it be right that we take firm step to protect ourselves against that particularly in the area of economic security this government pass the national security and investment act precisely so that we can screen transaction without comment on individual one of course to protect this country we have use those power not least to block chinese investment in a sensitive semiconductor company but also to ensure that the chinese state nuclear company have no part in the future of our nuclear plan the hon gentleman can rest assure that we be alive to the challenge and have pass law that give we the power to protect against they

 may i extend my sympathy to benedict ’s family it be always tragic to hear about the loss of a child we fully understand the seriousness   of severe allergy and believe that child with medical condition should be properly support to enjoy a full education and be safe at school there be a legal duty on the govern body of school to make arrangement for support pupil include set out what need to be do symptom and treatment but i will ensure that my right hon friend get a meeting with the health secretary to discuss how we could far support pupil with serious allergy 
 yesterday the chancellor confirm that it be government policy to abolish national insurance at a £ annual cost with no indication of where the money will come from can the prime minister rule out far freeze in tax allowance or an 8p increase in income tax to pay for it 
 that be total nonsense and of course i rule that out there be no unfunded policy what we have say be that we have a long term ambition to keep cut national insurance to end the unfairness of the double taxation on work we will make progress towards that goal in the next parliament just as we already have in this by cut national insurance by a in month deliver a £ tax cut at the same time as increase investment in the nhs and increase the state pension it be increasingly clear what this reveal the labour party oppose tax cut for work people

 i care deeply about the future of our community pharmacy and i be pleased to hear about my hon friend ’s success in secure a new for her constituent join the other across the country she be right about the important role that our local pharmacy can play and that be why we be back they with £ of additional funding through pharmacy so that people can now go straight to their pharmacist and receive treatment for of the most common ailment save patient time and ensure that they get the care they need quick and close to home 
 last friday   report major structural deficiency at stepping hill hospital in stockport stepping hill ’s major out patient building the radiology department and the critical care unit have all be condemn in march i meet with senior official at stockport nhs trust and they be clear that a sustained lack of capital investment be the root cause of problem at my local hospital do the prime minister believe that our hospital quite literally crumble be the price worth pay for year of successive conservative failure 
 we fully recognise the need to invest in health infrastructure across the country include at stepping hill hospital that be why we be currently spend around £ a year for trust to spend on necessary maintenance and repair on top of the £ new hospital programme and the additional funding that be put aside to deal with raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete maintenance the hon gentleman talk about a legacy of the nhs all he need to do be look at his party ’s record in wales where people be currently experience the bad a&e performance and the long wait time anywhere in great britain 
 nottingham city council be expect to fall short of its housing target by new home last time this happen rushcliffe as a neighbouring authority be force to take thousand of home on top of its own housing target which lead to huge pressure on our green space and public service can my right hon friend reassure i and my constituent that the change we have make to the planning system will mean that this time we will be protect from labour ’s failure in nottingham 
 my hon friend make an important point while on this side of the house the conservatives believe in build the right home in the right place with local people have a say all that labour would do be impose top down housing target on area decimate our precious countryside in nottinghamshire as she say we can see the difference between the well run conservative county council and the bankrupt nottingham council which have leave resident to pick up the bill for its profligacy 
 untreated sewage be pump into english waterway for more than hour last year and into the sea off sussex beach time in the last hour alone yet since privatisation the water company have be allow to rack up debt of over £ and their shareholder have be allow to pocket £ in dividend the majority of the public include of conservative supporter and of labour supporter want to turf out of the profiteer polluter they want water bring back into public hand when be the prime minister go to listen to they and end the legalised scam of privatisation 
 our plan to tackle this go far than those of any previous government in fact we now monitor of overflow up from just under the labour party we be invest a record £ into our water infrastructure and we have enshrine strict target in law and introduce unlimited fine for water company hold they and their boss to account it be crystal clear the record show that only party have a clear plan to tackle this issue for the environment the conservative party 
 everybody know that stockton be a great place with great people and a great football team my right hon friend recently visit the mighty stockton town to see the incredible work they do in the local community and he hear about their promotion battle i be sure that he will want to join i in congratulate micky dunwell and the mighty anchors on their promotion 
 it be fantastic to visit stockton town football club with my hon friend who be a brilliant champion for his local community which i see at hand on a weekly basis i join he in congratulate   everyone at the club on their well deserve promotion and i hope that some of their good luck rub off on southampton in the come week 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if he will make a statement on the expansion of the end of custody supervise licence scheme 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question 
 protect the public be our no priority so it be right that we take tough and decisive action to keep put the most serious offender behind bar and for long as the public rightly expect we be carry out the big prison expansion programme since the victorian era and we be ramp up removal of foreign national offender 
 we have a duty to ensure that the prison system continue to operate safely and effectively with offender hold in safe and decent condition this mean ensure that no prison exceed a safe maximum operating limit ecsl allow low level offender to be release before their automatic release date in march the lord chancellor state that we will 
 work with the police prison and probation leader to make further adjustment as require ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 this extension be in line with what he say 
 ecsl operate only when absolutely necessary and be keep under constant review i know that many member of this house will be concern about the early release of offender into the community but i make it clear that only offender who would soon be release anyway will be consider for ecsl 
 we have put in place safeguard include that the prison service retain the discretion to prevent the ecsl release of any offender where early release present a high risk than if they be release at their automatic release date there be strict eligibility criterion and anyone convict of a sexual offence a terrorist offence or a serious violence offence be rule out public safety will always be our no priority and all those release will still be subject to probation supervision and stringent licence condition 
 here we go again never in this country have a government be force to release prisoner more than month early this be the price that the public be pay for a justice system in crisis and a government in freefall 
 the early release scheme have now undergo major extension in just month it be quietly start in october when the government begin release prisoner up to day early in march it be slip out that it have be expand from to day and now it have emerge through a medium leak that it have be extend once again this time to day bad of all the government be do all of this in secret they have not respond to any freedom of information request parliamentary question or even the justice committee with any useful detail about this scheme the government be release prisoner but not the fact the strategy be clear for all to see say nothing try to get away with it and get to the other side of the general election it be shameless and frankly a disgrace 
 the public and this house rightly expect the minister to be transparent and honest so let we see whether he will answer these basic and simple question why the increase of early release to day how many offender have be release in the month since the scheme become operational how will they ensure that the probation service have the time and resource to adequately assess risk and protect the public and will he give a guarantee to the house today that this secretive scheme will not be extend again 
 i be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for her question and would gently say a number of thing to she she suggest we be sneak this out in october and march that include statement to this house and be entirely transparent on the hon lady ’s party ’s record it operate an early release scheme for year between and which leave she on rather shaky ground she talk about a media leak this be an operational decision with operational guidance send out to his majesty ’s prison and probation service and prison governor as well as other stakeholder include if i recall correctly the probation union for a minor change that be already reflect in the point make by my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state for justice in march to this house 
 the hon lady talk about datum the secretary of state have be consistently clear that we will publish the datum on an annualise basis in exactly the same way as we do for example for death in custody and supplementary breakdown of the prison population we have be clear that we will always ensure that the prison system have the space for the court to be able to send people to prison we be make an appropriate operational decision to ensure that continue to be the case 
 the hon lady also rightly ask about probation and i suspect that in our exchange the thing on which we might find ourselves in agreement be pay tribute to those who work in our probation service as she will know since we have increase the budget for the service by £ with additional probation officer in training we have work with the leadership of our probation service on this scheme and the probation union be of the body we notify on the change to the operational guidance 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 this be a perfectly rational sensible and pragmatic response to the pressure in our prison and the minister should take credit for it however i do ask he to reconsider the point about the transparency of datum precisely because it be a sensible thing to do there be no reason why we should not release the figure in well time but the underlying problem which all party in this house must face up to be that the pressure in our prison to which the justice committee have repeatedly refer stem from decade of underfunding by government of all party prison cost £ plus per year for each place so it be a very expensive way of deal with people and not always the good mean for handle low level offender may we have a more intelligent debate on sentencing and the purpose of prison and perhaps we could start with the minister commit to bring back the sentencing bill which would enable we to have a more nuanced approach 
 i be grateful to my hon and learn friend for his question he rightly highlight the ongoing capacity challenge and a number of the driver of those be that the average custodial sentence in this country have go up from month to about in addition the remand population have go up from about to some partly as a result of the covid backlog in the court system and partly as a result of the bar strike on the publication of datum i gently and respectfully refer he to the answer i give to his committee and at the dispatch box just now it be important that alongside recognise the pressure the system be under we be take step to increase capacity both by increase the removal of foreign national offender and do it at a fast rate and through have build almost new prison place that be in stark contrast to the record of the labour party which build not of the titan prison place 
 court backlog be sky high prison be dangerously close to capacity which be why this policy have to be implement and the government be claim as the minister have just do to be carry out a big prison expansion programme yet their record be appalling in in response to the taylor review the government commit to build secure school for young offender since then the budget have spiral out of control and not of those school have open do this not all just prove that the conservatives can not be trust with our justice system 
 the hon lady know that i have a huge amount of respect for she but even by lib dem standard that be stretch the bound of credibility a little not least because as she will be aware we have build new prison we also have in construction and that have complete planning and that be subject to a planning appeal as for the secure school she should look forward to its opening in a matter of day 
 will my right hon friend expand a little on the great improvement be make to increase capacity will he tell we a little more about the progress on ensure that more foreign national offender be remove to their own country will he expand a little as this seem to be badly understand by opposition members from all party on quite how much of a prison building programme the government have will he say something on the number of prison and the number of space that that will create and on the consequent prospect for the rehabilitation of offender and in time have few victim of crime 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that and i pay tribute to his work in the justice system not only in this house but prior to his be a member of it i believe i will of course correct this if i be slightly out that about fno have now be remove it be timely that as i say that my right hon friend the home secretary appear in the chamber so that i can pay tribute to he and his department for their work on deliver that on prison place i set out to   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   the progress on the new prison alongside that we have build a vast number of rapid deployment cell and new house block so we be expand our prison   capacity rapidly as i say that stand in stark contrast to the failure to deliver on the titan prison place by the labour party 
 napo have say that 
 the ecsl scheme be an unmitigated failure and have not only be extend without parliamentary scrutiny but represent an increase risk to public safety 
 the secretary of state know that our probation service be in crisis and can not cope without a significant increase in support and resource will the government be provide that 
 i be very grateful to the hon lady as i say to the shadow secretary of state i have great respect for the work do by those in our probation service indeed i have meet the probation union in the past although we do not always agree i have huge respect for the work those union do in represent their member 
 i would make point to say that it be do without scrutiny in this house stretch the bound of credibility there have be statement by the secretary of state and multiple oral parliamentary question session and i have undergo a polite but thorough grilling at the justice committee by its chair i do not think it stack up to say that this have not be subject to scrutiny 
 on the hon lady ’s underlying point i set out early that we be invest in probation there be £ of additional investment a year since and there be more probation officer and staff in training 
 a moment ago the minister set out the significant increase in the number of people be hold on remand i think he say it have increase from to what work be the government do to address court backlog what step be be take to look at other route for monitor people who be on remand who could perhaps serve their remand period in the community under a tagging system 
 to correct myself there be now people on remand in the prison population on court backlog we have increase the investment in our court and the number of sit day and we be see progress obviously court take the decision on whether to remand or bail someone and we can help that process by give the court the information they need we continue to invest in the bail information service which give sentencer reassurance about the information they need to make a judgment call about whether someone be safe to be bail we be increase our investment in the community accommodation service so that when someone be not bail because they do not have a stable address there be an increase opportunity for they to have an address give sentencer the opportunity to bail they 
 as the minister and the chair of the justice committee know i have be in the house long enough to know when something be a stick plaster perhaps the extension be necessary but it be a stick plaster how many queen ’s speeches since have include a thorough look at the justice system with a royal commission   that have never happen we all know that building prison do not solve the crisis we need radical reform of the whole justice system which will need extra resource and real motivation from an incoming labour government do the minister agree with i 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman with whom i have occasionally tussle across the chamber i agree with some of what he say he will not be surprised that i do not agree with his last statement because judge by the track record up to i fear it would be another case of be let down by labour i be grateful for his typically thoughtful comment and his look at the big picture behind the challenge we face 
 it be right that we be put those who commit the most serious crime in prison for long to protect society and ensure they pay their debt to society but it be also important that we look at how we rehabilitate people when they be in prison we all want those who have serve their time to come out and live their life within bound in the community and to be constructive and positive contributor to society that be why we be focus on provide education in prison and get people into employment i be grateful to the minister for schools my right hon friend   the member for east hampshire damian hinds for his work and focus on that area both when he be secretary of state for education and as my predecessor there be currently measure before parliament for example in the sentencing bill that offer the house an opportunity to think about other way to do thing 
 diolch yn fawr iawn mr llefarydd this announcement come after prisoner have recently lose their life in hmp parc in bridgend the ministry of justice say it will not step in a private prison in wales be an unaccountable anomaly that fail everyone victim and prisoner alike while we await the long anticipate devolution of justice will the minister tell i why after year there be still no clarity over which ombudsman be responsible for health in parc 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady we may disagree in our view on the devolution of justice to wales but she raise an important issue about    the death in the past few month in hmp and yoi parc i visit parc recently and speak to the governor and director those in custody and those work at parc i have to be cautious about what i say give that the matter will be before the coroner and the ombudsman i will be appear before the welsh affairs committee next week when i suspect some of the issue will be debate i be happy to have a discussion with the right hon lady but it be right that i do not stray at the dispatch box when these matter be before the coroner and the ombudsman 
 i hope the minister will be happy to have a discussion with the mp whose constituency the prison be in as well 
 i thank the minister for his answer to all the question the scheme be initially design to allow short term early release by a matter of day yet some release be now early by some day do the minister understand why victim of crime be anxious that so call soft crime criminal be get an easy time victim of crime be tell that perpetrator have be release early so the victim can prepare themselves to see those perpetrator down the town or at the local supermarket for example which can be extremely disconcerting even if it be not unexpected 
 mr speaker i reassure you that i be due to be meet the member whose constituency hmp parc be in at this moment in time but i be here at the dispatch box the meeting have be reschedule and there be a date in the diary as i promise at the last oral question that meeting have be arrange 
 the hon member for strangford jim shannon   be right to highlight that point our ecsl protection be significantly more stringent than those use by the labour party when it run its scheme for year unlike its scheme our allow governor to veto the release of any prisoner when they think early release will create a risk to victim there be a number of exemption from the scheme and it allow for rigorous condition to be place on the release licence be it tagging exclusion zone or curfew prisoner will be well aware that if they breach those condition which be put in place to protect victim they will hear the clang of the prison gate and be recall 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement to the house regard measure that his majesty ’s government will take in response to the reckless and dangerous activity of the russian government across europe and now suspect here in the uk 
 as be report on   friday april individual have be charge in connection with an investigation into alleged offence under the national security act as part of a counter terrorism policing investigation the offence relate to what be widely report by the medium as a suspect arson attack on a ukraine link business in the uk the crown prosecution service have confirm that the charge relate to alleged 
 hostile activity in the uk in order to benefit a foreign state namely russia 
 i pay tribute to our law enforcement agency for their quick and professional work to ensure these charge be bring they be the charge to be bring under the new national security act measure that this government bring forward and this house pass be already be use to keep our country safe 
 i thank the emergency service who respond to the fire at a commercial property in london where the suspect activity take place the charge be serious and it be only through good fortune that nobody be hurt i reassure the house that public safety be of the utmost importance which be why the law enforcement response have be quick and decisive 
 as member will appreciate i must not say anything far on this specific case or any related case to avoid prejudice the outcome of ongoing criminal proceeding i ask the house to respect that and to avoid use the debate to add to speculation about the incident it be vital that justice run its course 
 however i wish to highlight to the house a pattern of suspect russian activity that we be see across europe this be not the time that we have uncover malign activity in the uk that be seemingly link to russia in the past year in september bulgarian national be charge with conspire to commit espionage activity in the uk on behalf of russia a individual be later charge and legal proceeding against all be ongoing 
 there be a much broad pattern of russian malign activity across europe these include plan for sabotage activity against military aid for ukraine in germany and in poland espionage in bulgaria and in italy cyber attack and disinformation activity air space violation and gp jam with impact on civil aviation 
 over a number of year we have witness russia and its intelligence service engage in yet more open and brazen attempt to undermine our security harm our people and interfere in our democracy such attempt involve litvinenko georgia crimea salisbury ukraine and activity across europe since the illegal invasion of ukraine the rhetoric threat and accusation from russia have only increase as putin seek to justify the death and destruction that he have bring to the ukrainian   people these activity bear all the hallmark of a deliberate campaign by russia design to to bring the war home across europe and to undermine our collective resolve to support ukraine in its fight it will not work 
 as the prime minister say in poland last month we be at a turning point for european security with our ally we will stand firm in the face of russian threat to the uk and to our way of life it be why after salisbury we take measure with our partner to make europe a hard operating environment for russian intelligence service include the expulsion of undeclared russian intelligence officer from the uk it be also why the uk have announce the big strengthening of the uk ’s national defence in a generation with a fully fund plan to grow the defence budget to of gdp by 
 the uk and our ally will not falter in our support for ukraine because it be existential to the security of europe this be why the prime minister have also announce an uplift in uk military aid to ukraine bring it to £ this year and have commit to that level of support every year until the end of the decade or long if it be sadly still require we have sanction more than individual over of the russian banking sector and more than oligarch and family member with a combine net worth of £ at the time of the invasion 
 as of october over £ worth of russian asset be report frozen as a result of uk sanction these asset can no long be take back to russia to fund putin ’s war machine we consider russia ’s campaign to undermine our support for ukraine as unacceptable and it be destine to fail we must wait for the ongoing criminal case across europe include here in the uk to conclude but give these allegation the government will not wait to take further action to send a strong deterrence message to russia and to far reduce the ability of the russian intelligence service to threaten the uk that be why today in conjunction with my right hon friend the foreign secretary i be announce a package of measure to make it clear to russia that we will not tolerate such apparent escalation 
 i can tell the house that we will expel the russian defence attaché an undeclared military intelligence officer remove diplomatic premise status from several russian own property in the uk include seacox house a russia own property in sussex and the trade and defence section in highgate which we believe have be use for intelligence purpose and impose new restriction on russian diplomatic visa include cap the length of time that russian diplomat can spend in the uk 
 the measure that we and our international partner have take in recent year have already make the uk an extremely challenging operate environment for the russian intelligence service these further measure will serve only to strengthen our resilience to the russian threat 
 our nato ally share our view of russia ’s allege behaviour as see in the north atlantic council statement of last week russia have fail to provide any explanation of these event in the come day we should expect accusation of russophobia conspiracy theory and hysteria from the russian government that be not new and the british people and the british government will not fall for it and will not be take for fool by putin ’s bot troll and lackey 
 russia ’s explanation be totally inadequate our response will be resolute and firm 
 our message to russia be clear stop this illegal war withdraw your troop from ukraine and cease your malign activity i commend this statement to the house 
 as the secretary of state himself note at the beginning of his statement he have refer to a live case this case be sub judice and i ask other member not to refer to it in their question i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of the statement 
 it be the job of any government to keep our country safe from those who wish to do we harm not least those who wish to undermine our democracy and everything that we stand for we pay tribute to the remarkable work of our intelligence and security service and our law enforcement agency at home and abroad which strain every sinew to keep we safe we will always work with the government on those national security issue 
 the arson attack that the home secretary describe be a very serious the charge now lay be important we support the work of law enforcement in this case and it be immensely important that nothing be do to cut across that criminal justice case i simply ask for the home secretary ’s reassurance that a investigation be under way not just into the specific offence but into the wide context and any wide threat to our national security that might be link with this incident 
 the home secretary have be clear in link these charge to russia and we echo his strong condemnation of russian interference and hostile activity here in the uk and throughout europe repeatedly we have see a brazen disregard by russia for the rule of law for the uk for our ally and for our domestic security as my right hon friend the shadow secretaries of state for the foreign commonwealth and development office and for defence have make clear we stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in our support for ukraine any change in government will not change that strong cross party support as we stand with our ally putin must be defeat in ukraine and britain must stand square behind our ukrainian friend 
 russia under putin be a long term generational threat to the security of europe which require a long term response as my right hon friend the shadow defence secretary say just yesterday the defence of the uk start in ukraine but as the home secretary have make clear these challenge be also to our homeland security which be why we support wholeheartedly the measure that the home secretary set out today just as we work on a cross party basis with the government to pass the national security act so we will work closely with they in go far may i ask the home secretary a few further question about these and any further measure that the government may be able to take and ask he whether he expect there to be a diplomatic response from russia 
 as we see in salisbury to an appalling extent there be a willingness of russian sponsor actor to put the safety of british citizen and british resident at risk through cyber threat threat to undermine our democracy and our economy i be concerned that we have know about the scale of these threat for some time and that in some area we have be too slow to respond the home secretary have be too slow to rid the uk of illicit finance he will know that concern have be raise about prohibit import of russian origin oil through country make their way to uk shore can he tell i what action be be take to ensure that sanction be be enforce 
 the home secretary will know that there be real concern that the uk be still too easy for lawyer and accountant and for the laundering of russian money through the uk that potentially aid and abet putin ’s war the us have seize huge amount of russian relate asset as part of the sanction evasion and charge more than individual in that regard can he confirm that no have yet be charge with sanction evasion in the us and set out what be be do to address the issue 
 the government say that in principle they support the seizing of russian asset to fund the reconstruction of ukraine but there have be no proposal to take that forward will the home secretary tell we what be happen there we have also still not have a full account of the scale of risk from golden visa he will know too that there be threat to our democracy the work of the defend democracy taskforce be far too limited while the security minister be work on that what engagement have the home secretary have and have it be discuss at the national security council 
 finally the update to the government ’s integrate review warn in march last year that 
 the transition into a multipolar fragmented and contested world have happen more quickly and definitively than anticipate 
 from the iranian sponsor kidnap and kill threat on uk soil to the repression of hong kong protester outside the chinese consulate in manchester the uk have undergo because of behaviour not just from russia but more widely a fundamental shift in the threat landscape as increasingly aggressive state actor feel emboldened to target the uk often in co operation with serious and organised crime i urge the home secretary to look at the work that be do after the huge shift in the terror threat that we face follow and to draw up the contest strategy we do not have a similar strategy for state actor and state sponsor threat the work be far too fragmented the labour party would like to see a comprehensive equivalent to contest i urge he to look again at that we will work with he on that too 
 i thank the right hon lady for her party ’s commitment to the ongoing support for ukraine ’s self defence she be right to read that into the record there be no doubt about her commitment among government members i reassure she that we do look at the wide threat emanate from russia we liaise closely with our international partner we suspect that other country in the coalition of support for ukraine be be target by russia those country will take discrete domestic action but i draw the house ’s attention to the shared commitment set out in the north atlantic   council statement i do not have the precise quote in front of i but from memory it say that nation will take both individual and collective action 
 our response be calibrate it be design to send a very clear message as well as hamper russia ’s ability to conduct espionage here in the uk we will look closely at russia ’s response and whether it seek to escalate matter we will always ensure that we protect our ability to have line of communication with russia even during these most challenging of time route for de escalation error avoidance and the avoidance of miscalculation be very important we recognise that and i believe that putin ’s regime in moscow recognise that we will seek to maintain line of communication even while we take these decisive action 
 with regard to the extensive sanction we move quickly in concert with our international friend and ally those sanction be have an effect of course russia seek to evade sanction where it can while sanction enforcement be primarily the responsibility of the treasury it be a cross government piece of work all part of government this be very much the case when i be foreign secretary speak with our international counterpart and interlocutor try to close off opportunity for sanction evasion 
 the defend democracy taskforce be incredibly important particularly as we head towards a general election we will of course adapt and seek to work cross party because it be in all our interest that we defend democracy i will continue to ensure that both the security minister and i work closely with the shadow front bench and other opposition party front bench team to protect something that be incredibly valuable 
 i welcome the update from the secretary of state the united kingdom have lead the world in support ukraine militarily economically and diplomatically our key ally the united states have introduce legislation put forward by congressman french hill my counterpart in the british american parliamentary group on seize russian asset and use they to rebuild ukraine i introduce a similar bill in parliament which be due for a reading on   may and i have write to the foreign secretary about that will the home secretary clarify whether the united kingdom will support the measure that the united states have introduce it be crucial that we do everything that we can to cut off putin ’s finance and ensure that he pay for the reconstruction of ukraine
