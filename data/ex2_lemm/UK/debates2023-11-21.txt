 whether he plan to take legislative step to help end violence against woman and girl 
 whether he plan to take legislative step to help end violence against woman and girl 
 whether he plan to take legislative step to help end violence against woman and girl 
 whether he plan to take legislative step to help end violence against woman and girl 
 what reform he be make to the criminal justice system to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 minister welcome 
 thank you mr speaker 
 since this government have transform the legislative landscape on tackle violence against woman we have create new criminal offence of stalk non fatal strangulation and coercive control recognise that the most pernicious abuse be not always physical we have implement comprehensive modern slavery and domestic abuse law and outlaw insidious harm such as revenge porn and the so call rough sex defence to murder we be prosecute more rape case today than in with sentence that be about long but we be go far still in our sentencing bill our criminal justice bill and our victims and prisoners bill 
 i welcome the minister to her place we need to be do much more to tackle the culture of toxic masculinity that sadly still exist we recently have a situation in midlothian where of our councillor face sexual harassment at a public event when they complain and raise the issue the perpetrator ’s colleague simply say but he ’ a good guy we need to do much more to tackle that sort of attitude despite the complaint be make and the complainant be believe no action be ever take what more can this government do to ensure that in these situation action be take so that we protect woman and girl from such unfortunate situation 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i know that he do a lot of work on perpetrator programme through the white ribbon scheme in scotland i be sorry to hear about the experience of of his local councillor and i draw to his attention the protection from sex base harassment in public act which recently receive royal assent it create an offence of intentional harassment carry out because of a person ’s sex it be quite possible that that cover his friend ’s case so i would be grateful if he write to i or come to see i to discuss it far 
 last month sex matters present the prime minister with a letter sign by almost people ask he to 
 take urgent action to halt an escalating campaign of violence and intimidation against woman in the name of trans right 
 it detail how woman and in particular lesbian be be threaten with the loss of their livelihood and with physical violence shout down and intimidate at public event and sometimes even assault for insist on their right to freedom of belief and of expression and for call for sex base protection to be uphold will the minister condemn that violence and intimidation will she urge the prime minister to do so as well and to commit to address it by commission a rapid review of the impact of extreme tran right activism on woman ’s right include the right of lesbian will she also open a call for evidence 
 i thank the hon and learn lady for her question and i certainly condemn the conduct that she have describe even though hold a gender critical belief be protect in law both under section of the equality act and more widely under article of the european convention on human right i be aware of the polarisation and sometimes intimidation that surround this debate i have see the letter that sex matters write to the prime minister and the hon and learn lady should be in no doubt about how seriously this be view i have make reference to the protection from sex base harassment in public act which create an offence of intentional harassment where there be any causal connection even a weak to a person ’s sex under which such conduct may fall she have ask for a rapid review and i would like to meet she to discuss that far and any next step 
 a recent large scale study by the open university on societal attitude and experience of online violence against woman and girl find that in believe that the current legislation be not effective in tackle such violence almost quarter   of woman in scotland and more than half of man there want online violence to be make a crime that be a high level than be find among those survey in england platform have a duty of care to their user so what step be the minister take to ensure that new guidance in the online safety act be effectively enforce and encourage woman and girl to come forward with case of online abuse 
 the hon lady make an excellent point there be no doubt that some of the toxic content include violent pornography have a serious impact on the way that woman and girl be treat and the attitude that certain man have towards they as she will know the online safety act only receive royal assent a month ago and there be an extended implementation period she will also know i hope that of the later amendment to the bill accept by the government place a statutory obligation on ofcom to publish guidance which summarise the measure that all online service need to take to reduce the risk of violence to woman and girl that be not on its own but in consultation with the domestic abuse commissioner the victims commissioner and other expert the act also place an obligation on social medium and pornography provider to prevent child from be expose to harmful content through new and robust age verification exercise 
 order 
 sorry i will come back to the hon lady on that 
 i welcome the minister to her place her former colleague the home secretary think homelessness be a lifestyle choice yet in reality almost a quarter of homelessness among woman and child be due to a violent or abusive relationship the scottish government be pilot £ grant to assist woman who have leave violent relationship to help pay for essential include rent and clothing have she consider that approach instead of take tent off the homeless 
 we place the safety of domestic abuse victim at the heart of the domestic abuse act local authority have be give £ to ensure that all domestic abuse victim receive priority for housing in addition the act place a legal duty on tier local authority to provide a wide range of support include refuge to date the department for levelling up housing and communities have allocate £ for local authority to comply with the duty to provide housing 
 it be vital that victim of serious sexual assault be support through what can often be a lengthy and traumatic process yet we know that many rape victim do not access early mental health support because their therapy note can be request as part of the criminal investigation that happen far too often and treat the wrong person with suspicion do the minister agree that a specialist legal advocate for victim could allow they to challenge invasive request for private information and access the support they need at the time they need it most 
 this be an issue that the law commission be look into and it already appear in our victims and prisoners bill so that such request will never be   more than necessary and proportionate on the subject of whether there should be a dedicated legal adviser i respectfully draw the hon gentleman ’s attention to the fact that since there be now dedicated independent sexual violence adviser who can support victim of rape and serious sexual abuse every step of the way we have quadruple victim fund to ensure that we continue to grow that cohort 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i warmly welcome my hon friend to her place on the treasury bench it be much deserve and she be a distinguished member of the justice committee she will know from that time that much work have already be do follow on from operation soteria to improve investigation conviction and prosecution rate and the victim experience in relation to rape and serious sexual offence will she also bear in mind that there be further opportunity which we highlight as a committee in our scrutiny of the victim element of the victims and prisoners bill to improve the victim experience and ensure that it be consistent across the whole country 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and applaud all the work he do as chair of the justice committee it be undoubtedly true that the victims and prisoners bill play an important role in put the victim code on to a statutory footing and give victim enhance right include a right of review and a right to make an impact statement which we have support i also draw his attention to not just operation soteria but the fact that we be train specialist police officer in rape and serious sexual offence as well as the national roll out of section evidence procedure which enable victim of these hideous crime to give evidence early privately and behind closed door to completely change their experience of the criminal justice system and keep they engage in the process 
 i welcome the minister to her well deserve appointment she will be aware of the case of david fuller who as well as murder woman abuse the corps of over woman and girl in the mortuary of the maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust for these crime he will rightly die in prison however the current legislation be shockingly inadequate on the abuse of dead body it cover only penetrative sexual assault and not other act of sexual assault on dead body will the minister meet i my hon friend   the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch   and other colleague to discuss how we can rectify that in the criminal justice bill which come before the house next week 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question the david fuller case be appalling and i send my deep sympathy to the family of his victim it be unbelievably dispirit that we be even have to talk about these act and of extend the definition of abuse to meet the width and depravity of his crime 
 as my right hon friend will know the offence he be refer to be deal with in section of the sexual offences act as a result of the david fuller case the ministry of justice be now review both the maximum penalty and the scope of the law to ensure that what my   right hon friend describe be adequately capture of course i will have a meeting with both he and my hon friend   the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch   in due course 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i join other in welcome the minister to her place a victim bill have be promise by the conservatives since but while the uk government have dither the scottish government have introduce the victims witness and justice reform scotland bill which seek to put victim and witness at the heart of the justice system it ensure that a range of trauma inform support be available to child victim of violent and sexual abuse crime allow they to give pre recorded evidence without need to go to a police station or a court have the minister and the government consider adopt that approach 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question as he will know our victims and prisoners bill be make its way through parliament as we speak he have talk about victim focus support i draw his attention to thing like operation soteria which be direct at rape victim and have now be roll out on a national basis that place victim right at the heart of the inquiry and focus all the effort on the suspect and their behaviour so to be honest what he have describe be consistent with our current model of police and investigate crime i hope the victims and prisoners bill will conclude its passage through parliament and receive royal assent soon 
 what additional a financial and b practical support the government plan to provide the international criminal court for its war crime investigation 
 the uk be of the major funder of the international criminal court and provide far practical support include sentence enforcement pro bono expertise in victim and witness protection and secondment in june i meet with the prosecutor of the international criminal court karim khan kc and i will remain in contact with the icc to discuss what resource it need to operate effectively 
 it should go without say that the international criminal court need to be able to do its work unimpeded if it be to establish when collateral damage transcend into deliberate slaughter or whether self defence be in fact collective punishment will the government provide a guarantee from the dispatch box that they will not intervene as they do alongside the united states in against any future icc investigation into war crime perpetrate against the people of gaza 
 the hon gentleman ’s original question be about the resource that we provide to the icc we be the large donor after germany and we have provide some additional support this year question about prosecution be matter for independent prosecutor it be not for ministers in this parliament to make that   sort of decision that will be a matter for independent prosecutor whom i would expect to exercise their discretion freely and fairly 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of legal aid for immigration case 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of legal aid for immigration case 
 legal aid be available for asylum case for victim of domestic abuse and modern slavery for separated migrant child and for immigration case where someone be challenge a detention decision through the illegal migration act individual who receive a removal notice under the act will have access to free legal advice in relation to that notice 
 the law society have warn that a propose increase in legal aid rate will not be enough to ensure that sufficient immigration lawyer be available to deal with deportation to rwanda charity support refugee make attempt on average before secure a lawyer while in london charity be only successfully find legal representation for of referral what step be the minister take to ensure that the legal aid sector do not collapse in england and wales due to the poor decision make by his colleague 
 the be agree after a week consultation look at other increase for other specialist work the legal aid agency will always keep provision under review to ensure that cover be provide for those who need it 
 there be approximately people trap in the current asylum backlog many of they live in hotel with no right to support themselves or their family through work instead of unlawful and pointless dog whistle gesture such as the government ’s rwanda policy would it not be well to allow people the opportunity to work and support themselves and to allow the home office and the legal aid system to be resource adequately so that we can deal with our international obligation exactly as we ought to 
 the question about the home office be the hon member may want to raise with home office ministers themselves on access to legal aid i would not say that £ of legal aid mean this be under resource this year alone we have continue to increase level of legal aid across the board and specifically in specialist area such as immigration so i reject the notion that it be underfunde 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the lord chancellor be currently face a judicial review over the failure to ensure that immigration legal aid be available to those who need it for example the south west   have capacity for few than people per year yet the bibby stockholm have capacity for almost be this not an abject failure of the legal aid system it be operate exactly how the government have design it to abandon the most vulnerable to navigate a complex and hostile environment without any recourse to legal representation be this moral bankruptcy or incompetence or be it a combination of both 
 i do not accept that characterisation at all in fact this government be put legal aid in place to support those affect by the illegal migration act and especially the uplift in fee to ensure that qualified legal advice be available to people whether physically or through telephone advice access to justice and access to legal aid be there 
 what progress he have make on improve employment opportunity for ex offender 
 i be pleased to say that the proportion of prison leaver in employment month after their release have more than double in the year to march we have deliver significant reform in this area among which be prison employment lead to match prisoner to job on release and business lead employment advisory board that partner prisoner with industry to benefit from their expertise while this be very significant progress there be always more to do and we be determined to continue to see that figure climb higher 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer we know that ex offender be at high risk of homelessness particularly immediately on release we also know that be in work significantly reduce that risk so the link between the probation service and jobcentre plus in support ex offender into work be of critical importance will the minister do everything possible across government to ensure that ex offender leave custody with the good possible chance of get a job 
 may i take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor as prison and probation minister my right hon friend   the member for east hampshire damian hinds for his work in this space 
 my hon friend as always be absolutely spot on that secure employment and prevent homelessness be essential to tackle reoffende those in work be nearly less likely to reoffend we work closely with the department for work and pensions to ensure that prison leaver have effective support to prepare for employment on release for example prisoner can meet a dwp prison work coach from week before release to provide advice on benefit and employment include day access to dwp employment programme and we continue to foster those strong link 
 i thank the minister for his response veteran very often fall on hard time find themselves in prison and then become ex offender have the minister have any opportunity to work alongside   the minister for veterans affair to ensure that priority can be give to help veteran get over the bad time and to re engage in society again they have offer so much during their time in the service and they can do so again if give the opportunity 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman who be absolutely right to highlight just how much veteran even when they have get themselves into bother can offer the community through rehabilitation and through work although i have not yet have the opportunity to engage with my right hon friend the minister for veterans affair i intend to do so a whole range of opportunity can work for veteran just this weekend i see the ex jockey ryan hatch on itv racing talk about his work highlight equine job opportunity which be often appropriate for veteran in prison i look forward to work with my right hon friend and indeed with the hon gentleman if he wish on this issue 
 what step he be take to increase the number of prison place 
 what step he be take to increase prison capacity 
 this government have embark on the big prison building programme since the victorian era to create modern secure rehabilitative place to date we have already deliver place a prison at hmp millsike be under construction and last week we secure outline planning permission for our prison near the exist hmp gartree in leicestershire 
 i welcome the delivery of additional prison place as well as plan to deport some foreign criminal rather than jail they here in the uk that will free up space and deliver considerable saving to the taxpayer what step be the secretary of state take to work with the home office to mitigate the risk of legal challenge as we seek to deport some of those who may pose a risk to the public 
 my hon friend make an important point between january and march foreign national offender be serve with deportation order and remove as he have indicate we have expand the early removal scheme to allow for the removal of fno up to month before the end of the custodial element of their sentence so that we can bring forward the deportation of criminal who should not be here on his specific point we work closely with the home office to ensure that the right people and process be in place to resist legal challenge 
 i welcome the measure that my right hon and learn friend have outline to increase prison capacity to its large ever but he will recognise that capacity in prison need to come with capacity in staffing in order to make it a reality will he update the house on the progress make so far particularly in the midland and birmingham 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who be such a champion on this issue he be right and to increase the number of staff we have increase pay accept the recommendation of the independent pay review body in full that mean an increase of for band to band officer which be wing officer up to custodial manager we be also back our officer with the roll out of body wear video for every officer on shift as well as pava spray in the adult estate the net result be that the resignation rate be down significantly that mean more people remain on the wing improve the quantity and quality of our prison place overall 
 may i welcome the under secretary of state for justice   the hon member for newbury laura farris to her well deserve place on the treasury bench as well as expand prison capacity have the secretary of state look at the possibility of invest in woman ’s centre that be part of the government ’s female offender strategy but it also have a prove track record in cut reoffende 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word about my hon friend yes absolutely where the court determine that an alternative disposal be appropriate we be keen for non custodial option to be available that be why we be invest heavily in alternative there be case where woman offender must go to jail but where that be not necessary we want to ensure that alternative remain so that rehabilitation can take place in the community 
 now that the government have leave themselves with no choice but to send few people to prison and let more out early because there be simply no space for they how many convict criminal be currently on bail await sentence compare with this time last year when do the government expect normal service to resume 
 i be proud of the fact that unlike the previous government we be roll out a prison expansion programme something that entirely defeat the labour party when it be in office labour say it be go to roll out titan prison how many do it produce absolutely none on bail it be the case that the number of those await trial be high and up by compare with the pre covid period that be why this government be expand capacity on the estate we have more judge we be increase the amount of legal aid and we be ensure that when people come to be sentence unlike under the labour government they be go to prison for long 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state ’s emergency early release scheme be mean to tackle a capacity crisis that be entirely of this government ’s making and it exclude only serious violence surely domestic abuse and stalking be serious offence yet they be not exclude from early release what kind of signal do that give to victim the public and indeed perpetrator of violence against woman and girl 
 we be proud that under this government sentence for offence such as rape have go up by a we have a situation in which charge be up the conviction rate be high and sentence be long and   unlike under the labour government people be spend a high proportion of those sentence in custody we think that be the right thing to do to the hon member ’s point the exclusion in place go beyond what he indicate so he be factually incorrect they also include sex offence and terrorist offence here be a really important point where the custodial authority be satisfied that there be a specific risk there be an opportunity to ensure that release be block that be important because we will always stand up for victim of crime 
 argument weak go long and do not answer the question the classic response from this government the truth be that without any government announcement of a start date prison begin release offender over a month ago these man be already walk our street but the government will not tell we how many or why they be behind bar in the place why do the government not believe that the public deserve to know who be be release back into the community when a court decide that they should be in prison 
 we will make whatever appropriate announcement in due course we will not demur from that we will also not apologise for have under this government a high custodial population than before we be take robust step to ensure that the public be protect which mean unashamedly that those who commit the most serious offence those such as murder in the context of sexual or sadistic conduct go to prison for the rest of their life will the hon member support that i wonder we be also use the evidence so that those capable of rehabilitation be rehabilitate thing that we will not ever put at risk be the threat to woman and girl as the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for newbury laura farris indicate we have take step to ensure that victim of domestic abuse will be properly protect under the government 
 here be a man who will go short i call sir desmond swayne 
 whether he be take step to increase level of public confidence in non custodial sentence 
 to earn public confidence non custodial sentence must self evidently be punitive so that the british people can see that offender be be punish for their crime they must also be enforceable so that judge and magistrate can be confident that those who step out of line risk be bring back before the court and sentence to immediate custody that be why we be double the number of the late gps tag available to the court so that offender can be strictly monitor and we have increase funding for the probation service by £ a year 
 it be essential that every advantage be have from the late monitoring technology be n’t it 
 pithy and perfect my right hon friend be absolutely right under the old technology all that the so call radio frequency tag could tell the probation    service be whether that individual have leave the premise to which he have be bail or curfewe the modern gps tag be far more effective because they can indicate where that person have go keep they under a tight rein we have additional tag include alcohol monitor tag to allow the court and probation service also to monitor alcohol where that be the root cause of the offending 
 be the evidence not clear that short prison sentence do not work and that woman ’s centre which deal with drug and alcohol abuse mental health issue and so on can be effective it would make a lot of sense to roll that out for the male population it be cheap and it be well 
 i be delighted to hear that from the hon gentleman we have to follow the evidence which show that short sentence of immediate custody lead to a high reoffending rate than those where the sentence be suspend albeit on tight condition which might include curfew an unpaid work order and potentially a rehabilitation requirement why because if the offender fail to comply the probation service can find they in breach and bring they back before the court where they will then likely hear the clang of the prison gate we will follow the evidence we make no apology for use our custodial estate to lock up the most dangerous offender for long and take they out of circulation but protect the public also mean ensure that those who would otherwise reoffend get off the conveyor belt of crime 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the condition in the prison estate for the rehabilitation of offender 
 by the end of the spending review period we will have invest nearly £ to deliver an additional modern prison place and ensure that the right condition be in place to rehabilitate prisoner cut crime and protect the public the key to effective rehabilitation be the provision of education and skill training to increase a prisoner ’s employability and ensure that they can access employment upon release alongside provide support for substance misuse treatment and so on we be also invest to improve rehabilitative space in prison have deliver our employment hub where prisoner can access job vacancy we will renovate prison workshop through our hmp academy programme 
 no glass just bar at the window mouse and rat faece in the gravy and sewage overflow regularly in his cell this be not the start of a victorian novel but the disgrace experience by my young constituent who be lock in his share cell for and a half hour a day have never receive the vital specialist mental health support that he need when can we expect such draconian condition at hmp hull to end what appropriate step will the minister take to ensure that people in prison experience rehabilitation not the condition that my constituent face 
 if the hon lady would like to write to i i will be happy to look into that specific case but in broad term in the last financial year this government invest £ in capital and maintenance spending up from £ in that include since deliver £ of capital maintenance project across yorkshire security be not a dirty word in this context but be vital to create condition in which people can be safe and rehabilitate we continue to work closely with the nhs on improve thing such as mental health support for those in prison but i be happy to engage with she on this issue 
 if the government will make an assessment of the potential merit of extend the unduly lenient sentence scheme to include additional offence 
 in we expand the unduly lenient sentence scheme to include new offence include further child sexual offence and coercive or control behaviour we have no immediate plan to extend the scheme far but we keep it under constant review 
 i welcome the new minister to his place his be an excellent appointment and i wish he every success the fact that malicious wounding actual bodily harm burglary and even rape when deal with in the youth court do not come under the unduly lenient sentence scheme be plain wrong will he please review that situation which time and again let down the victim of those serious crime 
 the unduly lenient sentence scheme be intend for use in serious case for offender sentence in the crown court the attorney general have the power to refer a sentence to the court of appeal for review if they believe it be unduly lenient a youth court can sentence a child to up to year of detention only where a child ’s offence be likely to attract a sentence of more than year the case must be pass to the crown court for sentencing where the scheme therefore apply 
 stiffening unduly lenient crown court sentence be all very well but there will still be delay in the system if there be backlog in prosecute in the court up to of criminal barrister have leave the profession over the past year so what action be the government take to address the exodus of criminal barrister 
 in recent year the government have invest an extra £ in criminal legal aid which should expedite a solution to the situation 
 if he will make an assessment of the impact of change in sentence guideline on cause death by dangerous driving on the length of sentence 
 the police crime sentencing and courts act increase the maximum penalty for cause death by dangerous driving from year to life imprisonment in june the independent sentencing council publish revised sentencing guideline for motor offence include for cause death by dangerous driving it be too early to assess the outcome of those change but we regularly publish sentencing statistic on gov.uk the sentencing council also monitor all guideline in accordance with its statutory duty 
 i welcome my hon friend to his position it be over a year since parliament legislate to increase the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving to life imprisonment however member of my constituent summer mace ’s family be kill in a horrific incident and in june the offender get only and a half year that be totally inadequate as roadpeace have show far too many sentence be too short will my hon friend meet i to discuss those sentencing guideline so that we can ensure that they reflect what parliament actually legislate for 
 i be very sorry to hear of the death of paul carter lisa carter and jade mace in january in a collision cause by aurelijus cielevicius and the devastating consequence for their family and friend i know that my hon friend have campaign hard on this issue and i read his adjournment debate early this month sentencing be entirely a matter for our independent court base on the fact of each case in july after cielevicius be sentence the revised sentencing council guideline for cause death by dangerous driving come into force follow the increase of the maximum penalty introduce by the pcsc act i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far should that be helpful 
 the man who be convict of cause death by careless driving when he kill my young constituent gregg be sentence to only month in prison however because he be charge with cause death by careless driving not dangerous driving gregg ’s family have no right to appeal under the attorney general ’s unduly lenient sentence scheme will the minister agree to discuss this with the attorney general and look into revise the scheme to include cause death by careless driving 
 i be very sorry to hear the detail of that particular case i will of course be very happy to raise it with the attorney general 
 what step he be take to improve the provision of education for child in custody 
 we work closely with education provider to drive up standard of teaching and improve academic outcome the curriculum offer to child in custody be need lead and determine by individual aspiration literacy and numeracy level interest and sentence   length where education provision be inadequate we will hold provider to account to ensure that child receive the education they need to turn away from crime 
 early this year i visit feltham young offender institution and witness at hand the very challenging condition in which dedicated professional work with young people who have commit the most serious crime and have a very difficult start in life back in the charlie taylor review recommend that we move away from young offender institution to secure school the government fully accept his vision yet year on not a single secure school have open have be build but it have not admit any pupil if the government be serious about rehabilitate young offender and cut reoffending when will they finally roll out secure school for those pupil 
 in a previous life as a minister as it be i have youth justice in my portfolio back in and i have the opportunity to visit feltham at that time i work with charlie taylor on deliver those recommendation into practice i be pleased to tell the hon lady that we anticipate the secure school opening in 
 i welcome the new shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker education be vital to reduce violence especially on the youth estate however violence on the youth estate be skyrocket since last year assault on staff have increase by that put prison staff at risk in their workplace and increase the trauma experience by child and young people it can also prolong their rehabilitation how will the minister use education and other method available to he to reduce that violence 
 it be nice to be take question from the hon lady in her new role as shadow minister rather than when she use to question i in the justice committee she be absolutely right to highlight the challenge of violence across the youth estate which have be too high for too long and we continue to work hard across all site to address it among the measure put in place we be ensure that each child receive a full need assessment cover education psychology resettlement health and behavioural support education and skill play a vital part in help child and young people to get their life back on course but that must be in the context of a secure environment because security have to be the premise on which all those other benefit can be deliver 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the suspension of short sentence on the probation service 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the suspension of short sentence on the probation service 
 to expand probation capacity we have increase funding by £ a year to deliver effective supervision of offender in the community in    we recruit an additional trainee officer more in the following year and more in the year after that this mean that offender who pose the high risk to community will receive robust supervision 
 successive conservative ministers have allow the criminal justice system to fall into its current parlous state make many community include in cambridge less safe now they propose to shift the burden from an over press prison service to an over press probation service can the secretary of state guarantee that the money that should have be available to prison will be move to the probation service to allow it to keep our community safe 
 the point be not right since the overall level of crime have fall by as for the point reoffending have drop from about to about the point on probation be with respect a well as we move towards suspend sentence order it be right for they to be robust and enforceable so that if people step out of line they can expect to hear the clang of the prison gate and that be why i be engage with the leadership of the probation service yesterday i also meet frontline probation officer because i want to hear from they how we can ensure that their workload be manageable and they have the resource that they need to keep our community safe 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 i echo the concern of the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the british independent retailers association which fear that the scrapping of short sentence will only embolden retail criminal the secretary of state will know that far too many shop worker face be attack in shop across the uk particularly as we approach the festive period accord to the police there have be a increase in shoplifting in the past year can the secretary of state assure we that the probation service can cope with the expect surge in retail crime and ensure that those who work in shop will be protect and anyone who attack they will face the full force of the law 
 those who behave in such an appalling way should expect to feel exactly that the full force of the law let i be crystal clear those who pose a particular threat to individual can expect to hear the clang of the prison gate those who commit offence while subject to an order be it for instance a community order a stalk prevention order or a domestic abuse protection order can also expect to be outwith the presumption through the use of tag we can ensure that people who do not abide by stringent requirement which by the way could include not go to a particular shopping precinct can expect outcome and outcome only prison 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in response to the question from my hon friend   the member for cambridge daniel zeichner the secretary of state say that he have recruit additional probation officer but in fact that recruitment campaign have result in few probation officer between   march last year and march this year owe to the excessive workload staff be leave in drove the propose new presumption in favour of extended sentence and the extension of electronic monitoring will simply offload more pressure from prison on to the probation service will it not what be the government do to address these issue of excessive workload and the loss of probation staff 
 on a point of detail as of   september   the increase on the previous year be for band probation officer for band officer and for senior probation officer the so call attrition rate or resignation rate be also down there be more probation officer and more of they be remain in place the reason that matter be the fact that experience count this be an extremely difficult job and make good judgment require wisdom and experience we be invest in the probation service so that its officer can do their job on behalf of our community 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last justice question we have introduce a criminal justice bill which respond rapidly and robustly to the late criminal threat it will include strengthen law to criminalise those who breach trust by take intimate image without consent broaden the offence of encourage and assist self harm give judge the power to order offender to attend sentencing hearing and enable the probation service to polygraph test more terrorist and sex offender meanwhile the new sentencing bill have public protection at its core make the severe punishment available for the most dangerous offender such as murderer who kill with sexual or sadistic conduct to take they out of circulation forever it will protect the public by break the cycle of reoffende to reduce crime 
 we have also welcome my hon friend the members for newbury laura farris and for orpington gareth bacon to the front bench as i think the house have already observe they will make a formidable contribution to public life 
 the prime minister and certain other senior government figure have suggest that the european convention on human right should be disapplie in some asylum case and the deputy chairman of the conservative party   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson have say that the government should simply ignore last week ’s supreme court ruling do the justice secretary agree 
 the government be confident that we can deliver on the priority of the british people while remain within the corner of our international legal obligation make no mistake we be determined to ensure that our border be secure this be a rule of law issue it should not be the case that those who try to jump the queue and arrive illegally should derive some sort of advantage from that we understand that clearly on the government benches and we will do everything we can to stop the boat 
 of the primary reason for adjournment and reliste in magistrate court be a lack of train probation officer to carry out pre sentence stand down report could the minister outline what step he be take to address this so that court can get through caseload more speedily 
 my hon friend speak with great authority as a magistrate and i know from my own experience as a practitioner how important stand down report be they provide the bench with information about the offender their relationship situation their record of previous conviction their mental health problem and so on so that the court can tailor a disposal that punish the offender but also progress their rehabilitation we be work closely with the probation service to ensure that that resource be properly allocate so that we can have more stand down report to ensure well justice on the fact of each case 
 i call the shadow minister alex cunningham 
 contrary to the claim of ministers at every question time that they be get the court backlog sort out they be not and the pain just drag on for victim the crown court backlog reach a record case at the end of june nearly of they have be wait for year and case have defendant on bail why be thing still get bad 
 i have to say mr speaker that god love a trier yes the backlog have go up the hon gentleman will know that post covid and post the criminal bar association strike the backlog do increase on top of that this government have crack down on crime with more police officer and that have mean more people be charge and appear in court we be address this with unlimited sitting day we recruit judge across all jurisdiction last year and we be do the same this year we have invest in the court estate to improve resilience and we have extend nightingale court to ensure that we have capacity 
 come on now we know that the statistic tell a very different story the crown court remain in crisis and what about the civil court the quarterly civil justice statistic from april to june show that the average time take for small claim and multi fast track claim to go to trial be week and week respectively be it the same excuse for the crisis in the civil court 
 since the government have increase the amount of money spend on the children and family court advisory and support service we have recruit judge across the jurisdiction to help in the civil court increase the number of day that fee pay judge can do from day to day a year introduce regional virtual pilot to support london and the south east and invest in mediation all of this be ensure that people have access to justice in a court system that be deal with high number of case than ever before 
 the minister will be aware that approximately £ of taxpayer money be spend include through legal aid on finally deport the vile sex offender yaqub ahmed whose crime be just unimaginable will the secretary of state and the minister ensure that legal aid process be review and importantly dust off the previous plan to introduce waste cost order in immigration case so that lawyer who pursue these spurious case be prevent from do so 
 as my right hon friend will appreciate i can not comment on individual case but i can reassure she that the payment of wasted or unreasonable cost can already be order by the tribunal if it consider it appropriate give the issue that she have raise however i would be more than happy to meet she to ensure that her concern be convey firmly to those responsible for the review 
 court have so far be name as contain reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete raac and of they be closed the government will not say which prison be affect but will they guarantee that funding for raac removal will not come at the expense of exist maintenance scheme give the huge backlog of repair in court and prison 
 the hon gentleman be right about the court building but that be in the context of an estate of over building it be important to note however that we have massively increase the budget for the court estate and that enable we to do thing we can take on more project and also plan they because we have guarantee this over year mean that we can plan in a more efficient and effective way the issue so far as prison be concern be that separate consideration apply because the building be use for a whole range of different purpose there be the prison itself but there be plenty of ancillary building this be all be inspect in the normal way and the budget be certainly there to effect remediation if require 
 last week i visit my local co op store in hartburn where i meet staff and union of shop distributive and allied workers rep as part of respect for shopworkers week there be around assault on shop worker not each month not each week but every single day we can not go on like this will my right hon and learn friend look again at what we can do to tackle this issue and deliver justice for shop worker 
 my hon friend be absolutely right those people be on the frontline of society act effectively in public to do an incredibly important public service we have already move to ensure that the court can treat assault on shop worker as an aggravate factor when it come to sentencing to be clear this mean that in appropriate case the fact that a person have assault a retail worker can mean the difference between a non custodial penalty and a custodial penalty which be absolutely right those who behave in such a cowardly way should expect all consequence 
 the rule of law be sacrosanct be n’t it 
 yes 
 do my right hon and learn friend agree that the judiciary must not make incendiary comment about israel at walsall magistrate court a district judge recently acquit defendant who have vandalise a factory believe it to be supply israel and be report to have tell they their action be 
 proportionate in comparison to the crime against humanity which they be act to stop 
 do he agree that judge be suppose to uphold the law not encourage its breach this bring our legal system into ill repute so will he take this from i as a complaint to the judicial conduct investigations office 
 order we be not mean to criticise the court and i know that such a learn gentleman will know well i be sure we can avoid any criticism 
 i simply note the question plainly i make no comment on the specific i have hear my right hon and learn friend ’s point and i will happily take it up with he subsequently 
 the ministry of justice have release its late quarterly statistic on death and self harm in the england and wales prison estate the rate of self harm incident among female prisoner go up by a stark compare with the same quarter last year and there be an overall increase in self inflict death what assessment have the secretary of state make of the impact of the moj ’s policy on these increase across the prison estate 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight this as every death in custody be a tragedy we continue to do all we can to improve the safety of prisoner both in that respect and in respect of reduce instance of self harm we be continue to deliver on our safety commitment outline in the prison strategy white paper include by introduce more ligature resistant cell fund a study to understand the extent of death and roll out an emotional resilience and peer support programme in prison of course our staff be vital to this and i take the opportunity to pay tribute to they we be invest to support they to continue to do that work 
 in the summer the government make a welcome announcement on ban zombie knife and machete and double the sentence for supply a knife to an under-18 and for possess a knife with intent to cause harm now we be in a new session will the secretary of state set out the timeline for bring forward legislation to make this happen 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend who be a passionate and principled campaigner on the issue of public safety these measure will find their way into the criminal justice bill i look forward to her support which i know will be forthcoming let we hope that hon member right across the house will put public protection as of their priority 
 new figure release by the co op group show that a staggering incident of shoplifting abuse violence and antisocial behaviour in co op store have be report this year alone surely the good way to stop violence against shop worker be to make it a stand alone offence as request by the labour party the co op party and the usdaw trade union 
 it be important to establish what be already available to the police section on common assault section on assault occasion actual bodily harm and heaven forbid section and which relate to more serious case of grievous bodily harm plus if an individual be convict on any of those ground the court can indeed ought to consider assault on a retail worker as an aggravating factor as i have indicate that can mean the difference between a non custodial and a custodial penalty 
 we will keep these matter under review but the central point be that before someone can go before the court they have to be arrest that be why i be delighted that we have more police officer than at any time in our history ready to take the fight to those who assault shop worker 
 my right hon and learn friend have a terrific record on deal with slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation so he will understand how greedy lawyer encourage their billionaire client to crush their opponent by extend court case drag they out and multiply they what have not be take on board be that that also cost the taxpayer million of pound i think those lawyer should have to meet those cost with that in mind will he publish the cost incur by slapp case 
 no in this house have do more than my right hon friend to clamp down on this iniquitous behaviour and i be pleased that we have be able to make some progress he make a really important point every day that be spend in court pursue ill found and abusive litigation be time that could be spend on other matter in the public interest i will certainly look into the interesting suggestion he make about publish the cost of that behaviour 
 after the supreme court ruling on rwanda the hon member for ashfield lee anderson say that the government should ignore the law and put plane in the air anyway the prime minister have fail to distance himself from those comment do that disappoint the justice secretary 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the answer i give a few moment ago there be understandable righteous indignation about the situation that exist we believe that we can comply and deliver our policy within the corner of international law that be our approach however those who arrive illegally threaten to corrode the rule of law because that of itself send out a poor subliminal message that those who do so can act with impunity that do not strengthen the rule   of law 
 the justice secretary will know of the hard work undertake in this parliament to bring the desecration of war memorials bill into law element of that bill be subsume into the police crime sentencing and courts act but will he now undertake to complete the job 
 my hon friend be of hon member who have fight hard on this issue and he do so from the position of have serve his country it be completely iniquitous that people should seek to act in a way that desecrate war memorial his specific point seem utterly compelling and i be happy to discuss it with he hereafter 
 the justice secretary be an experienced lawyer for whom i have a great deal of respect will he explain to the prime minister that follow the supreme court ’s judgment on rwanda merely to legislate that the fact on the ground in rwanda be the opposite of what the supreme court find they to be will make no difference to the problem the supreme court have identify and will simply make the government a laugh stock 
 i thank the hon and learn lady for her point at the risk of harm her political career the respect be entirely mutual in a rule of law country people can disagree with the decision of a court but they must respect it we respect the ruling and of course we will abide by court order but it be also right that we carefully consider what the supreme court say and seek to adjust appropriately we will do what we properly and lawfully can do to stop the boat that be our mission and the mission of the british people and we will deliver on it 
 i welcome my right hon and learn friend ’s commitment to increase the use of tagging where appropriate to reduce the amount of reoffende in do so what plan do he have to include high risk domestic abuser and potentially in the future those who be illegal drug user 
 not for the or last time my hon and learn friend have get absolutely to the point we have deliberately construct the policy so that if an individual present a significant threat to a particular individual often a spouse or a partner the presumption would not apply that be critically important and i be happy to discuss that point with woman ’s aid and other relevant body we be on the side of victim of domestic abuse and violence and nothing that we do will cut across that important principle 
 support offender in practise their faith be regularly cite as play a key role in their rehabilitation in prison however as the minister will know from my frequent correspondence with the chief executive of his majesty ’s prison service many prison either do not provide the facility require or actively hinder offender in practise   their religion hmp full sutton have be bring to my attention as such example give its importance will the minister assure i that a full review of faith provision across the prison estate will be conduct and guarantee that no will be deny the ability to freely practise their religion 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question he be absolutely right to highlight not only the right of people to practise their religion but the important role that that can play for those individual in cop with prison life rehabilitation and get on the straight and narrow when they come out i be happy to engage with he directly on any specific case that he wish to bring up and it be an issue that i be happy to look at 
 i thank the courts minister for his recent letter on recruitment and retention of legal adviser in essex and the impact that that be have on court listing although i know that he and i agree about the independence of the judiciary regard individual case will he meet i to discuss what more might be do to fill the vacancy for legal adviser in essex 
 i be always happy to meet my right hon friend 
 the secretary of state have allude to the continue reduction in reoffende rate among those leave prison do he agree that central to maintain confidence in the wide community be that the reoffende rate go down far still 
 the hon gentleman make a simple but incredibly important point we want to follow the evidence so that we protect the public we will do so on the hand by lock up the most serious offender for long and take they out of circulation and on the other by cut offending few crime mean a well protect public that be the approach that we will take 
 yesterday i meet former prisoner lj flanders who while serve his sentence devise a fitness regime that can be conduct in a cell with no special gym equipment with the support of bucks association for the care of offenders he have just run a week training programme in hmp aylesbury to train other prisoner to provide coaching and mentoring of a similar style will my right hon friend please encourage everybody in his majesty ’s prison and probation service particularly governor to facilitate such course to reduce reoffende 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who know about what he speak i pay tribute to he for his work in the criminal justice system he highlight an example that sound extremely interesting i would be happy to meet he to hear more about it and to see where we can take thing from there 
 mr deputy speaker since my statement to the house on   july the government have consult extensively to secure evidence and idea on international development that will transform our world i pay tribute to the team of official who have work night and day and most of their weekend for nearly month on this under the leadership of nick dyer and annabel gerry and to geraldine bedell and the richard curtis team who have help with the shorten version of the international development white paper 
 we draw on the sharp and most expert mind from non governmental organisation academia business nearly government around the world and all political party in the house i particularly wish to thank colleague across the house for their contribution to shape this white paper this be an area of policy that do not belong either to the conservative party or to labour it be a british policy and commitment 
 as the whole house know development have help transform the life of billion of people the uk can be immensely proud of our distinct contribution to this incredible success story century ago quarter of the world live in extreme poverty when i be bear around half still do by when the world meet the millennium development goal the proportion of a much large global population have fall to just evidence show that development work but it also show that we now need to think about how we do development 
 after decade of hard won but persistent progress we live in a world face a daunting set of challenge a world that be see rise poverty where progress be in retreat a world where the un sustainable development goal be nearly all off track for a world where faith in multilateral institution be fade despite co operation be desperately need a world face a climate crisis grow conflict and the prospect of further pandemic a contested world where unity and solidarity be increasingly important yet ever more difficult to achieve this white paper set out a road map to chart the path the uk must take to galvanise global attention and lead by example in the fight to end extreme poverty tackle climate change and address biodiversity loss 
 when it come to international development finance matter the government have be clear on our intention to return to of gni when the fiscal circumstance permit but the white paper also make it clear that we will not achieve the sustainable development goal through business as usual official development assistance funding we need a quantum leap in financing and investing which only the private sector can provide the private sector be an essential engine of development give community the building block for economic independence self sufficiency be development ’s essential purpose and our work with the uk private sector deliver back for taxpayer many time over 
 british investment international formerly know as cdc be already a core part of the government ’s offer on international development it have an impressive track   record and now will go far and fast invest in the hard place as be suggest by the international development committee to whom i pay tribute bii will aim to make more than half of its investment in the poor and most fragile country by while also enhance its transparency cement its place as a world leader 
 the white paper present our vision for much need reform of the international financial system mobilise great finance from the private sector and scale up the lending capacity of the international financial institution the uk have pioneer the use of climate resilient debt clause enable vulnerable country to hold off on debt repayment follow an extreme weather event together with prime minister mia mottley and other supporter of the bridgetown initiative we be drive reform of the multilateral development bank so that they can scale up financing for low and middle income country we will also work with institutional investor such as pension fund to plug the sdg ’s $ annual financing gap 
 international development and climate action be inseparable climate change and nature loss be be feel everywhere and their impact will only intensify over the next decade it will be most acute in develop country reverse fragile development gain increase food price and compound insecurity and instability to meet that challenge we must mobilise more and more reliable finance we will deliver on our pledge to provide £ in international climate finance in the year up to we will ensure a balance between adaptation and mitigation financing and provide at least £ to protect and restore nature 
 britain ’s work on woman and girl be paramount we can not understand development unless we see it through the eye of girl and woman increase access to education empower woman so that they can decide for themselves whether and when they have child and end sexual violence be central to economic opportunity and growth those right be universal and should be non negotiable the white paper extend and reinvigorate that work we will use research and diplomacy to end the preventable death of mother baby and child we will deploy policy and investment to defend and advance sexual and reproductive health and right 
 effective development be root in respectful partnership of equal but the government will continue to stand up for our value we know that individual right the rule of law and strong institution be essential to achieve sustainable development take for example the work of the westminster foundation for democracy to which members of parliament make such a substantial contribution it be the uk ’s lead champion of democracy globally we be increase our support for its work so that we can support fair more inclusive and more accountable democratic system around the world 
 we must also find well way to anticipate and prevent humanitarian crisis and the conflict that often drive they conflict and instability be on the rise and hold back development by up to third of the world ’s poor will live in fragile and conflict affect contexts humanitarian need be at their high since with twice as many people need assistance compare with year ago the result devastation be spread across affected region as see at present in the sahel and the middle east the tragic event in israel   and gaza bring home the humanitarian cost of conflict and violence with woman and child most directly affect 
 i be therefore pleased to announce today that we will create a fund dedicate up to of our bilateral humanitarian spend to support resilience and adaptation alongside our delivery of humanitarian relief which we expect to amount to £ next year when i visit family in east africa suffer the bad drought in year it be clear that the current focus on immediate relief come at the cost of early thinking and building in resilience and adaptation for the future the new fund will respond directly to that specific challenge 
 innovation be at the heart of our effort to transform life through sustainable growth the wondrous creativity of science and technology can address problem that money alone will never solve only by share research and innovate together can we make the breakthrough that our world need the world have never be so intimately connect nor our fate so closely entwine although we can rightly be proud of all we have do to deliver international development the uk and our global partner must redouble our effort give the challenge that we face to achieve those goal 
 we ask in the white paper what the uk could do we be tell to make a new development offer base on mutual respect power by finance at scale and support by a more responsive international system we have listen that be what the white paper will deliver the prime minister have launch the white paper to do development more effectively and differently and yesterday ’s global food security summit be an example of that i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the minister for his statement for advance sight of the white paper and for our frequent conversation about it since i be appoint to my post 
 the catastrophe in gaza be a strong reminder not just of the need for humanitarian assistance and expertise but of the heavy responsibility that we all face to play our part in the world through the painstaking hard yard of diplomacy and of the crucial role of development in provide the hope that breathe life into any peace process i thank the minister for his personal effort to bring some energy and direction to this agenda again in fact i would go as far as say that i do not believe that the house would be in a position to consider a new white paper be he not in post a view that i think be share by many on the opposition benches 
 however to have an honest conversation about where we be head we need a frank assessment of where we have be there be the mindless vandalism of the decision to take of our most respect influential contribution to the world the partnership think leadership and innovation and trash the lot to deflect from a domestic crisis there be the former prime minister who sham by a young footballer into abandon his decision to allow child to go hungry in a pandemic pull the rug out from under the poor people in the poor country make no mistake that cost life but it also cost britain its reputation as a gold standard leader in the field as the minister say then it be 
 a strategic mistake with deadly consequence ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 he know that i admire his determination to speak out against those decision and i know that he do not shy away from acknowledge the damage that they have do 
 although the former prime minister may be go his in command whose signature be scrawl across those document now sit in no his short word at the start of the white paper leave i in no doubt that although his posture have change his position have not frankly ask the man who sign off the devastation of this vital agenda only to breathe new life into it again be like call out the arsonist to put out the fire for much of the agenda that the minister set out today he will have our support the question be whether he will have that of his prime minister 
 the minister be right to recognise that the major obstacle to eliminate extreme poverty be the grow challenge of climate change and debt but the key be how to resolve it the multilateral system be strained much of the world ’s debt be owe to private creditor and over recent decade china ’s influence have grow so we strongly welcome the recognition in the white paper that britain ’s approach to development must sit in a multipolar world however multilateral aid will fall to just of aid spending by although the commitment in this white paper be welcome the minister be prioritise multilateralism while his department prioritise bilateralism which be it we have a strategy at odd with the ambition 
 the problem be that to make the strategy work the minister will need to convince the world that britain be a long term reliable partner with serious commitment at the high level of government yet his own white paper be silent on protect the overseas development assistance budget from raid from other departments after have be raid in the past year by the home office alone to pay for spiral hotel bill and the cost of this government ’s chaos what chance do he have of convince the world that this area be a priority for the government if he can not convince his colleague around the cabinet table i suspect that on the central issue the need to deal with debt and finance constraint that block action on climate he and i have more in common than he do with most of they 
 there be much to welcome in the white paper but access to finance for many of the most heavily indebted country be ultimately unachievable he be embrace some of the new idea on finance but when it come to the central issue of debt where be the fresh thinking the outsized role of the city of london compel we to do more now be the time not to cling to exist strategy but to leave no stone unturned 
 the problem of climate finance and debt for middle income country enable we to focus on low income country and the core task of eliminate extreme poverty but there be far too little in the white paper about how that can be achieve we welcome the focus on conflict but the route out of poverty lie not just in access to finance and in function economy but in self sustain health education and welfare system design and run by the people in those country what can he do to reassure the house that that be not a order issue 
 finally the minister and i have discuss the central importance of woman and girl many time they have be among the big loser of the decision of recent decade empower they be the big untapped driver of growth in the global economy and there be no way of meet the sustainable development goal without close that shameful gap that be why they must run like a thread through the whole agenda not just in addition to it and not a few page in a document every single decision that come across his desk must consider whether it do more to empower and enable woman and girl to succeed or less 
 i welcome and support the minister ’s commitment to this agenda but without the political backing without the budget and without the priority in government he will not succeed he be far more alive to the scale and nature of the problem that britain and the world face than most of his colleague but the challenge of this era demand an end to old way of thinking and an embracing of the new i know he be open to it but be his government 
 i thank the hon lady for her co operation and her kind personal remark she will know that in order to get buy in from our friend and expert around the world and from the civil service the white paper need to run to in the unlikely event that my party be not in government after the next election any other government would i hope build on it to make it a huge success 
 i note the hon lady ’s remark about the merger of dfid into the foreign office my task which the prime minister give i be to try to make the merger work that mean there need to be an ability within government to focus on global public good and deliver they into the 2030s that be what i be try to do she rightly ask how we get the balance right between multilateralism and bilateral funding the answer be that we use either depend on what deliver for our taxpayer and what deliver result on the ground that be the yardstick there be no ideology we go with what work and what be good 
 the hon lady point out the increase in spending in other departments of oda money and the development budget it be true that that have go up but every penny be spend within the rule lay down by the oecd development assistance committee we bring in the innovation of the oda star chamber in whitehall co chair by the development minister and the chief secretary to the treasury there be already clear evidence of that ratchet up the quality of oda as the hon lady would wish 
 the hon lady talk about access to finance for poor country which be incredibly important mitigation project in middle income country be easy by contrast when it come to poor country and adaptation it be much more difficult she will see the emphasis in the white paper on accept the advice from the select committee on increase the amount that british international investment do in poor country she will notice too the emphasis on social protection and the fact that of the budget will now be spend in fragile and conflict state 
 finally the hon lady ask about debt where she be right that we need to do far more it be absurd that a country such as ghana can borrow only for or year yet our child can get mortgage for year ghana borrow at and our child borrow at that be clearly completely wrong but there be a lot of new thinking she will have see the climate resilient debt clause launch by britain and the work we be do on the g20 common framework to increase access for country it be also important to ensure that the private sector be bind into debt settlement when they affect sovereign state 
 i welcome the white paper and its focus on use oda to leverage private sector investment in the way that my right hon friend have describe whether the mentari programme for energy transition in indonesia or the guarantee that the uk provide to the african development bank on climate finance do he agree that it be the combination of aid and british business that be a real force multipli in this area 
 my right hon friend know a great deal about this area from his past ministerial post and he be absolutely right the key trick be to secure the status money whether provide by the multilateral bank or the development finance institution and to marry it with the private sector and the $ of pension fund out there if we can marry the de risk through use that status money and show pension manager what the real risk and the scale of the return be we can achieve the holy grail of get enormous amount of more money into climate finance mitigation and adaptation which be what the bridgetown agenda be all about 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the minister have consult widely and he truly have a refreshingly collaborative cross party approach we in the snp broadly welcome the tone of it and some of the detail around mutual respect listen to local partner the recognition of civil society and the potential role of diaspora community however the minister will not be surprised that we want he to go far and i will list a few of the thing i would like to hear more about snp colleague will have more to add on that 
 the and probably the most important thing be the fact that there be no concrete recommitment to as recommend by the international development committee in the entire document of page there be mention of where the white paper state that the government will recommit to it 
 once the fiscal situation allow 
 if the fiscal situation currently allow for tax cut i would say that that moment have arrive the new foreign secretary be instrumental in get we to in the place so i hope that he and the minister will expedite that intention 
 secondly there be no recommitment to the restoration of programme that have be cut since include in yemen syria somalia and south sudan all of which have cut of more than take several   pound of their support away those nation be all suffer significant repercussion from the climate crisis and the fallout from conflict 
 although i be pleased that woman and girl and gender equality be to be put at the centre of bilateral funding stakeholder have say to i this morning that it be short of the transformative approach espouse by other include the scottish government let we not forget that the cut i just mention extend to girl education programme which be estimate to have result in few girl receive an education that be of the great scandal of our lifetime 
 finally i be surprised that there be nothing in the white paper about public perception of international aid and how we can challenge and change it i have my own thought on that but if most right think people understand the role that their government and their predecessor have play in some of these country over century and the ongoing legacy of that they would understand that we have moral obligation i know the minister agree so i would appreciate his assurance that the omission of that point be simply an oversight i look forward to continue with the collaborative approach that he have bring to the role 
 i thank the hon lady for her party ’s collaboration and for the tone and content of what she say she mention that the figure do not feature extensively in the white paper but the white paper be about do development in a different way we be ratchet in through these new mechanism billion and billion of pound which make a huge difference in many way it dwarf the difference between the or that we be spend at the moment and the she will have see at the time of the autumn statement last year that the treasury estimate of when the fiscal test would be satisfied be in march it be all of we hope that the test will be satisfied as soon as possible as far as i be aware there be no difference between the policy of the government and that of the official opposition on the restoration of the target she talk about cut in programme but the white paper explain how many of the programme will be increase she specifically mention south sudan as the budget be now in much well shape next year the bilateral programme spending in south sudan will increase from £ to £ which be an increase of the kenyan bilateral programme spending will increase by and the jordanian will increase by so we be now able to do more through our bilateral programme she ask in which area we would be specifically restore funding where cut have be make she will see in the white paper that the international citizen service be set to return and our aid match will increase as for the humanitarian work we will do next year we expect to spend £ on humanitarian relief plus we have the new resilience and adaptation fund which will produce an extra on that the white paper be long and to many of we it be a most exciting read a short form be available i have a copy here as i mention thank to the richard curtis team it be also an excellent read she chide i for not have make the point about civil society and the platform but i be delighted to tell she that although i do not mention it in the statement it be in there ukdev uk international    development be a platform to achieve precisely what she say need to be achieve in that bridge between civil society and government and state work 
 may i push back gently on what be say by   the hon member for wigan lisa nandy because many conservative members be passionate about this issue have be supportive of the minister through thick and thin and really welcome this white paper we be hop that it will be a stepping stone to oda spend do my right hon friend agree that there be a symbiotic relationship between our economy and our security and that our security be dependent on stability abroad when we step back from help fragile state that void be too often fill by authoritarian regime pursue a very different agenda 
 my right hon friend be right on that and of course he be of the conservative members who vote not to cut the i hope that he will be energise by the alternative mean we have find the multiplier to ratchet in enormous amount of money he be right in what he say about the link between defence development and diplomacy when he get a moment to read to read this white paper he will be enthuse by the line it be take 
 the right hon gentleman my constituency neighbour know that i admire much about the mission he have set out in this white paper but chapter need to say a lot more about the money he could have say more about double the fraction of the special drawing right we share as japan be do which would have provide an extra £ of development assistance he could have say more about use the money we get back from the european investment bank to invest in build a big world bank in order to unlock $ of concessional lending over the decade ahead he could have say more about lead a global initiative to keep the interest rate on special drawing right down so that the international monetary fund remain as lender of last resort rather than china those be practical step that we could work on together otherwise we end up with all mission and no model which will not help the world ’s poor 
 if the right hon gentleman read with care the chapter to which he refer he will see that it be of the most brilliant chapter in it that be my biased opinion the reason for that be that we have in washington an extraordinary team of young and brilliant official who have enormous influence in the world bank and he be a considerable expert on this area as for the multiplier and make sure that we sweat the balance sheet of these multilateral bank to ratchet in huge amount of more money he will see a great deal to please he if these reform be implement as i believe they will be drive hard by britain through the multilateral sector we will see a vast increase in funding as for what he say about the sdr use they creatively be something we be keen to do he will recall that at the spring meeting the chancellor of the exchequer announce that britain would use its sdr to the tune of £ to elevate the imf fund that directly deal with poverty and international development 
 people planet prosperity be sum up entirely in this document and i commend my right hon friend on the white paper particularly chapter which i be passionate about build on chapter it be vital that we accelerate the transition and support the bridgetown initiative country be get terribly frustrated that although the talk be do and the uk be exceptional there be a need to make sure that bank be get the money to the people so that the project can deliver for people prosperity and planet 
 i thank my right hon friend for the tremendous contribution she have make on the matter she be address chapter directly address tackle climate change and biodiversity loss and deliver economic transformation and i be glad it have her approval chapter deal with mobilise the money and what i describe in my response to my right hon friend   the member for esher and walton dominic raab the former deputy prime minister as the multiplier and how we ratchet in private sector money those will make a fantastic difference and we also have to make sure that this money reach the poor people in the world britain ’s role in the g7 in these international organisation have always be to focus on the poor people in the world we be proud of do that and the house would expect we to do it this white paper amplify that mission 
 i call the chairperson of the select committee on international development 
 let i start by give my huge congratulation to the minister i hope that the whole house have recognise his personal involvement and the tenacity with which he have get this document out hon member hear hear i also congratulate our civil servant who for the past year have be do an amazing job in challenging circumstance i really hope that this white paper re establish our position on the international stage i particularly welcome the embedding of localism more money to the poor debt relief and the focus on atrocity prevention the white paper outline several initiative aim at increase the amount of climate finance available for vulnerable country such as small island development state which be welcome the minister reference biodiversity loss a couple of time in his statement but will he explain why no specific mention be make in the white paper of the loss and damage fund which i predict will be at the centre of cop28 in the come week 
 i thank the chair of the international development committee and through she all of its member who bring their expertise and enthusiasm to this subject with eloquence and skill she mention the importance of debt relief and localism and she be absolutely right on that she also mention the work on atrocity prevention which we have particularly be do in sudan since the crisis emerge there that work be very important and we be find new way of amplify it what she say about biodiversity may well be true the white paper run to page if she and i have our way it would have be long but we have to draw a line somewhere and i yield to no on   the importance of the point she make about biodiversity she will know that there have be argument about loss and damage and a hold position have now be secure ahead of the cop that be very important but loss and damage must do thing it must get a broad spectrum of where the money be come from otherwise we will just be reorient it within the international development budget and that will be rob peter to pay paul there be no sense in do that the other thing be that it must bring in a wide group of country not just the narrow oecd one that account for aid it must be wide than that those thing be require to make loss and damage work 
 i very much welcome this white paper which reiterate the importance of eliminate gender base violence last week i work with parliamentarian from across the commonwealth thank to the commonwealth parliamentary association and my right hon friend ’s department and we resolve that there be a real need for international leadership to effectively challenge what be still call cultural norm thing such as force marriage female genital mutilation and rape will he join our call for eliminate gender base violence to be at the heart of the commonwealth heads of government meeting in samoa next year 
 my right hon friend make a very interesting point about the commonwealth heads of government meeting in samoa next year i will take that away and see what we can do on the matter gender base violence for the reason she have often say be central to what we be do we can not understand all these matter unless we see international development through the eye of girl and woman so she be absolutely right about that on gender base violence she will be well aware of the work lead by my noble friend lord ahmad in the other place which he continue to do with great vigour and success 
 i welcome the white paper but i want to put on record very clearly that it be lukewarm and tepid it show how much wreckage have be do in the last year i welcome the minister move it forward but we be not move forward enough 
 i have short question the minister refer to the prime minister ask he to try to make the merger work we all know it have be a disaster it be in the press last week that there be no rationale or reason for it to have happen in the place i would like to know why there be no thought put behind restore that separate department because it be world class and the world look to it for leadership 
 secondly the minister talk about oda be legal it might be legal but of the budget over £ be be spend on domestic issue of asylum seeker not on extreme poverty which he just say be a priority 
 lastly to reiterate the point make by the chair of the international development committee   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion loss and damage be not mention year ago in scotland we be world lead with the pledge make by the scottish government when i be at cop27 last year the uk   government ask i to go and speak to partner on this i be happy to do that when i be at cop28 in week time
