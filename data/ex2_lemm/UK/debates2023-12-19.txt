 before i start question may i wish all member and their family the good for christmas and a peaceful new year i thank all staff within the house of commons those in security catering clerks you name it for all they do it be appreciate it have be another hard year and i just hope we can have a peaceful world peace in the middle east and certainly peace in europe 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of introduce landfill tax relief for local authority who be responsible for hazardous waste after company go into liquidation 
 a very merry christmas to you and your staff mr speaker landfill tax provide an economic incentive to manage waste more sustainably which have contribute to a reduction in local authority waste send to landfill in england since however it be not intend to act as a barrier to the remediation and redevelopment of contaminate land in the autumn statement the government announce the land remediation pathfinder fund which will provide £ of target support to local and mayoral authority 
 happy christmas mr speaker for week now the old supa skips site in lancaster have be burn and it look as if lancaster city council will be leave to pick up the tab for the clean up some of that money have to be spend on landfill tax will the minister meet i and lancaster city council to discuss what option be open to my local council to ensure that local ratepayer be not leave foot the bill for rogue company that walk away from site such as supa skips 
 as i mention in my previous answer the landfill tax have be hugely successful but it be never intend to act as a barrier to remediation the fund that be announce in the autumn statement will be open for bid in early and i encourage the hon lady ’s local authority to apply through the normal way secondly there be an ongoing review into the landfill tax and reform of current exemption be within scope of that review our belief be that the fund may offer more target support in the way that she desire 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the potential impact of anglesey freeport on the economy in north wales 
 merry christmas mr speaker today be the funeral of former chancellor lord darling and if i may i will make some comment about that in my topical statement anglesey freeport will be a national and international hub for trade innovation and commerce regenerate community by attract new business and spread job investment and opportunity 
 nadolig llawen pawb i be delighted that the chancellor extend freeport tax relief in england in his autumn statement do he agree that if those extension be realise in wales it will give company the confidence to invest and help deliver the £ investment and thousand of job forecast for our anglesey freeport will he join i in thank all those at the isle of anglesey county council and stena line who work so hard recently to submit the outline business case

 i call jim shannon oh sorry andrew bridgen 
 thank you very much for do the funny mr speaker 
 freeport can certainly be a catalyst of economic growth and prosperity in north wales and the east midland but they must be in the right place put a freeport in north west leicestershire which already enjoy some of the high economic growth in the country have low unemployment and be capable of fill its industrial site without incentive make little sense will the chancellor agree to meet i to discuss well alternative for the east midland than the diseworth freeport site 
 i would be happy to ask of my colleague to meet the hon gentleman to discuss why freeport be not appropriate in his part of leicestershire 
 what recent discussion he have have with his scottish counterpart on farm budget for the financial year 
 a very merry christmas mr speaker the government guarantee to maintain the £ annual budget for farmer across the uk for every year of this parliament   as agriculture be devolve it be ultimately for the scottish government to decide how to allocate that money to farm in scotland 
 the minister will be aware of the frustration that be feel by many farmer and crofter in scotland that the £ that be give to the scottish government for a specific purpose as part of the bew review have be defer hitherto what will she do in future to ensure that where money be give for the express purpose of support scottish agriculture it be in fact use for that purpose 
 the right hon member raise an excellent question the snp government be yet to clarify when this ringfenced money will be return i hope they will do so this afternoon at the budget 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 may i echo your comment mr speaker with christmas wish for all the house staff your staff and member the uk government ’s attempt to overhaul the eu subsidy scheme have leave english farmer bad off in cash term than in while the scottish government have seek to protect our farmer payment can the minister guarantee that the uk government will not try to undermine their payment and devolution by back door use of the united kingdom internal market act 
 i note that the hon member do not answer my question nor that of   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   about when the ringfenced money will be return 
 order question be normally to the minister not the other way around 
 very good point but i still maintain that the hon member need to clarify that matter it be up to the scottish government if they would like at any point to top up the amount that go to scottish farming i encourage they to do so this afternoon at the budget 
 i do not think any scottish farmer will be reassure by what the minister have just say i just say that the scottish government be protect those farmer payment while english farmer be lose out as we know what we do not have from the uk government be detail on what they will be do after if we have remain in the european union we would know that figure for farming subsidy so that the scottish government could make plan to help farmer plan ahead can the minister apologise for that situation and guarantee that in the early month of next year we will have clarity on farming payment 
 the uk government have lay out plan for the agriculture transition in england that go beyond the current spending review give farmer increase certainty over policy and spending intent for year to come the scottish government could decide to provide farmer in scotland with similar certainty if they choose to do so 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 a very jolly christmas to you and all mr speaker 
 small and medium sized enterprise be the backbone of the economy and we support they to thrive use lever across government our small business rate relief mean that of business property in england already pay no business rate we provide tax relief benefit sme such as annual investment allowance and employment allowance we support investment in sme through the british business bank programme and we fund the scheme offer sme training and advice 
 merry christmas to you and your mr speaker the autumn statement be a huge success for small business across the country with the federation of small businesses describe it as a game changer will my hon friend outline to the house how the autumn statement package will benefit those small business in my constituency on which my town and village rely 
 i thank my hon friend for his continue support for small business in his constituency measure in the autumn statement to help they include extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief for another year which will support around property in england that tax cut be worth nearly £ meanwhile by freeze the small business multipli for a consecutive year we will be protect more than a property from a multipli increase other announcement that could benefit his constituent include the help to grow management and make smarter programme and move to tackle late payment 
 the new day payment rule will apply to only a few company contract by the government yet microbusinesse which do not typically have government contract wait on average day for payment those business make up the majority of small business across our country why will the government not back the micro business alliance ’s pay in day campaign 
 as i mention we be well aware of the issue of late payment and we be in constant dialogue with the key stakeholder in this area as well as colleague at the department for business and trade we will always keep an eye on the measure but the move we have already make to tackle late payment as announce recently will make a big difference 
 what step his department be take to reduce taxis 
 what step his department be take to reduce taxis 
 what step his department be take to reduce taxis 
 thank to the difficult decision the government have take on inflation and debt the autumn statement this year be able to deliver the big package of tax cut to be score since 
 i very much welcome the tax cut recently announce by the chancellor and hope to see more announce soon especially a rise in the high rate threshold as the conservatives look to reduce the tax burden on work people do the chancellor share my concern that £ a year unfunded spending commitment would likely see taxis rise and lead to high interest rate if labour be ever in government 
 it be not just i but paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies who when talk about labour ’s plan have say that 
 additional borrowing drive up interest rate 
 which be of course a back door tax rise on family with mortgage but as it be christmas perhaps i could explain it this way if santa borrow £ he might have more toy to give out this year but he would also have debt interest to pay and few toy to give out next year 
 record funding be go in to support the cost of childcare to allow more parent to stay in the workforce this be very welcome but the tax burden on single earner household put the choice to be a stay at home parent beyond the reach of too many raise the young generation must count as a top investment so may i ask my right hon friend the chancellor what recent analysis have be undertake on the transferable allowance at up to £ per annum it be currently not design to facilitate that choice 
 i thank my hon friend for her question as she know the marriage allowance be currently £ per year and it have be fix at of the personal allowance since it be introduce in on this side of the house we believe it should be a woman ’s choice and we want to make that choice as real as possible for every family for that reason we think the good thing we can do be to bring down the taxis pay by work people to put more money into the family budget and we be happy to make a start on that in the autumn statement 
 like many of we in this place i be a big supporter of small business saturday and it be important to remember that small business be the backbone of local community all year round many be unlikely to be able to take advantage of the chancellor ’s very generous and welcome expensing package so what additional measure will he continue to consider to support all business great and small include perhaps even corporation tax reduction 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question she will know that of trading business only pay the low corporation tax rate of that cover the vast majority of small business i use to run my own business i run it for year before i come into parliament i could not agree with her more small   business be the backbone of the british economy which be why we be tackle the scourge of low payment and we roll over the discount on retail hospitality and leisure business rate in the autumn statement 
 will the chancellor confirm how much high the tax burden be forecast to be at the end compare with at the start of this parliament 
 what i can confirm be that as a result of the measure i take in the autumn statement it will be low at the end of the scorecard period than it would otherwise have be and a lot low than it would be under any labour government 
 may i ask the chancellor how many middle income taxpayer have be pay the high rate of tax since 
 i be happy to write to the hon gentleman with the exact number but for people on low income people be pay the low legally payable wage their post tax real income have go up by since because the conservative party believe in make work pay 
 why be the fiscal situation strong enough to cut national insurance but not strong enough to return the overseas aid budget to of gni 
 because the way we return the overseas aid budget to be to grow the economy by cut national insurance we put nearly more people into the national workforce fill nearly in vacancy in company up and down the country 
 what recent step he have take to help ensure people have access to banking service 
 the government believe that all customer should have appropriate access to banking service which be why we have legislate to protect access to cash we also support the fca ’s bank branch closure guidance as well as industry initiative to provide in person access include share banking hub at post office and access via digital mean 
 more than bank branch have close since sadly the lloyds bank in withington village will join the many more branch close in the come month and leave withington without a bank branch but by the end of the year the industry will have deliver only share banking hub do the minister think that the pace and scale of that roll out be good enough 
 it be worth state that as the hon gentleman know the decision on whether to open or close branch be commercial one and the government do not interfere with that however we have legislate to protect access for cash the bank need to abide by the financial conduct authority ’s guidance with the late guidance publish only last    week in relation to share banking hub we should indeed increase the pace at which they be roll out and i be talk with the industry about how to do that 
 it be pretty clear that most legacy bank do not give a stuff about their customer and just want to screw as much money out of people as possible after the scandal of coutts ’s debanking of nigel farage the government act swiftly to try to make that much more difficult for other customer but many business face the same problem what will the government do to stop business be debanke in the same way as individual 
 i be not sure that i quite accept my hon friend ’s characterisation of the banking industry but i be happy to meet he and discuss the problem he outline in relation to specific business and access to bank account 
 i call the shadow minister 
 before i ask my question i want to convey the apology of the shadow chancellor my right hon friend   the member for leeds west rachel reeves she be deliver the eulogy at alistair darling ’s funeral today 
 i want to say a few word about alistair darling i be sure you will agree mr speaker a dedicated public servant who be respect across both houses he lead the country ’s economic response to the global financial crisis with integrity honesty and sound judgment and we will all miss he hon member hear hear 
 as my hon friend   the member for manchester withington jeff smith   just say nearly bank branch have close since and only banking hub be up and fully run that have leave countless people financially exclude and affect lot of small business i ask the minister once again will he accelerate the roll out of banking hub properly why be his government not do anything to reverse the decline of the great british high street 
 i agree with the hon lady ’s word about lord darling and echo the word of my right hon friend the chancellor 
 on bank branch i will repeat my position it be important that the government do not decide when a branch open and when it close but it be a concern when community be leave without appropriate access to cash that be why we be the government to legislate for access to cash as we do early this year and that be why i believe we should speed up the roll out of banking hub i be work with the industry on way in which we can do that 
 if the minister be serious about protect the future of the great british high street will he back labour ’s pledge which have be welcome by cash access uk and the wide sector to guarantee face to face banking in every community and give the fca the power it need to roll out hundred of banking hub across the country 
 as the hon lady know the industry lead the roll out of banking hub we be support it i say this again to speed that up as much as possible i have not see the labour pledge i suspect   that i will not support it but it be important that the industry hear the view of constituent and member from across the house and that we speed up the roll out of banking hub in community that need they 
 what step his department be take to incentivise pension scheme to invest in the uk 
 at the autumn statement we set out a series of measure to improve pension saver return increase opportunity for investment and boost the uk ’s capital market and high growth company 
 merry christmas mr speaker and to all those in the house the uk ’s pension fund lag behind their counterpart in the usa scandinavia and australia for invest in technology firm can my hon friend continue his work on reform and ensure that more pension fund investment stay in the uk to boost our tech sector 
 under the industry lead mansion house compact of the uk ’s large define contribution pension scheme have sign up to the objective of allocate at least of their fund to unlisted equity by we believe that could unlock £ of investment in high growth company and should help increase return to saver 
 the minister will appreciate that the great investment that anyone can make be in themselves and their own country northern ireland and all the united kingdom what step can be take to ensure uk wide investment by pension scheme in cut edge business such as wrightbus and thales 
 there be a couple of thing that we need to do we need to ensure that the industry abide by its commitment to the target work with the exchequer secretary my hon friend   the member for grantham and stamford gareth davies we must present the right investment opportunity so that the capital go into the uk in the right way 
 whether his department be take fiscal step to reduce difference in the level of taxation between long and short term   let 
 the government provide a different income tax regime for short term let compare with long term let if they qualify as furnish holiday let for which there be stringent condition as with all aspect of the tax system the government keep the tax treatment of property landlord under review any decision on future change will be take by the chancellor in the context of wide public finance 
 the change to landlord tax relief which fully come in during the pandemic exclude holiday let that have contribute to a significant decline in residential landlord in tourist area like north devon the lack of affordable rental property have price out   worker particularly in the hospitality sector result in business reduce their opening hour and therefore their tax contribution to the treasury can my hon friend provide any hope of level the tax playing field to encourage long term landlord back to the market 
 i thank my hon friend for her continued interest in this area on behalf of her constituent the government want to ensure a diverse and sustainable visitor accommodation offer while protect local community include ensure the availability of affordable housing to rent or to buy that be why we be introduce a registration scheme for short term let in england which will be a vital step towards achieve that aim the government keep the tax treatment of property landlord under review but i would be happy to meet she to discuss these issue far 
 throughout westmorland and lonsdale we see people particularly in social care hospitality and tourism eject from their community because of the collapse in the long term rental market into a short term rental market principally through airbnb will the minister go far on fiscal control to make sure that we keep home available for local people to live in will he put pressure on ministerial colleague to change planning law to make short term let a separate category of planning use so that community in the lake and the dale can prevent the collapse of their community into place only for those who can afford to visit 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment we have talk about this topic in my previous role over many year he be aware that the department for levelling up housing and communities have publish a consultation on the introduction of a planning use class for short term let he will also be aware that through the levelling up and regeneration act the government have introduce a new power to allow council to apply a council tax premium on home there be progress in this area but we be always open to new idea 
 what recent discussion he have have with the financial conduct authority on how creditor contact customer in debt 
 i be pleased to speak at the launch of the money and mental health policy institute ’s report on this subject last week alongside the fca it be worth say that i use to be on the advisory board of that institute the government and the fca will continue to work closely to ensure that consumer protection be fit for purpose include through our upcoming reform of the consumer credit act 
 a constituent who be a victim of domestic abuse and whose ex husband fraudulently take out a loan in her name be constantly harass by creditor as she try to clear the debt and accord to a recent report by the organisation that the minister   mention that be an experience share by other will ministers discuss with the fca impose legal limit on arrear communication in case such as this as other country have do 
 let i say thing i pay tribute to the former financial secretary now the health secretary my right hon friend   the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins who do a great deal of work in relation to economic abuse i be committed to continue that work with the treasury to ensure that we limit the circumstance in which the incident describe by the hon lady can occur as for the broad question of what the regulator do in such case we have put a record level of funding to the tune of some £ into work with regulator on debt advice i shall be happy to discuss with the hon lady the detail of how we can help her constituent in the way that she suggest 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate over the course of this parliament on household income 
 as the hon lady know the path to lower interest rate be through low inflation and the independent bank of england have the government ’s full support as it take action to return inflation to target the government ’s mortgage charter broker by my right hon friend the chancellor early in the year be available to of borrower real disposable income per person be about £ high than the office for budget responsibility predict in its march forecast 
 the expiry of fix rate mortgage deal next year will mean even more people pay sky high cost it come at a time when many be suffer increase financial hardship and personal debt which be have an impact on their mental and physical health do the minister think it fair that family be pay hundred of pound more each month to cover the cost of the government ’s mini budget disaster 
 mortgage cost and interest rate have go up throughout the world and we be in more or less the middle of the pack they be high in the united states for example but what will definitely make thing hard for the hon lady ’s constituent and indeed all our constituent be borrow an extra £ that will only serve to increase inflation and keep rate high for long 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the obr ’s growth forecast on living standard 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the obr ’s growth forecast on living standard 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the obr ’s growth forecast on living standard 
 the obr revise up its growth figure after datum revision by the office for national statistics indicate the economy have recover more fully from the pandemic than have be expect which mean that the current level of real gdp be nearly high than be predict in march forecast 
 the government put a positive spin on the provisional local government finance settlement yesterday but the local government association say that it do not provide enough funding to meet the severe cost and demand pressure on council and assume that all council would increase their tax bill by the maximum allow next year what will that do for my constituent living standard 
 as the hon lady will know we put billion of pound into council this year and the provisional settlement be above what be expect to be the inflation rate next year if she have specific issue with her local council i shall be happy to take that up with she 
 we have see of the great fall in living standard in a generation and the chancellor have callously remove the household support fund from council in brighton the fund pay for free school meal voucher in the holiday the warmth and wellbeing scheme career centre family hub and food bank such as the in whitehawk where my constituency office have its surgery will the minister think again about scrap the household support fund so that council can support the very bad off 
 i want to reassure the hon gentleman no decision have be make about the household support fund more broadly however we have pull in an average of £ per household this year to help people with exactly what we be talk about this government be on the side of people during what be a very difficult time 
 accord to the low pay commission in people who should be receive the national minimum wage do not even get that this be a huge failure of enforcement how can we have increase living standard if people do not even receive the legal minimum to which they be entitle 
 if the hon gentleman can give individual example i ask he please to let we know it be obviously extremely important that we enforce this but i should point out that we will increase the level by next year which will make a significant difference to household up and down the country 
 be not the more fundamental problem with the question pose by opposition members the fact that the obr ’s forecast be never right 
 all i can say be that they have definitely go in the right direction because the economy next year will be billion of pound big than we think it be go to be in march 
 what step he be take to ensure value for money in public spending 
 value for money be at the heart of government spending and it be of the key consideration for any decision involve the use of public fund across government as chief secretary i be committed to tackle waste and promote productivity across the public sector 
 last year government official admit that they be pay company to burn and destroy pallet of unusable personal protective equipment each month do the treasury have any idea how much waste ppe have go up in smoke this year 
 during the pandemic our priority be absolutely clear to get ppe to the frontline as quickly as possible there be an unprecedented global increase in demand for ppe during the emergency response to the pandemic and item be procure at pace the department of health and social care continue to seek to recover fraud loss to ensure that public fund be protect 
 i call the shadow minister 
 throughout the pandemic people across the country make extraordinary and heart wrench sacrifice yet as they do so a small minority be instead make million of pound by rip off the taxpayer with conflict of interest defective good and exorbitant profit margin it have be greedy and grubby and this conservative government have enable it all as taxpayer we want our money back so labour will create a covid corruption commissioner to chase down every pound we can do the minister have any idea just how angry people be that our country have be take for a ride 
 the hypocrisy be absolutely astonishing during the pandemic the shadow chancellor write that the strategy of turn to big name uk manufacturer be not deliver the supply that be need yes we procure thing very fast we need to do that to get thing to the frontline and we be try to get back every single penny that be lose to fraud but we make no apology for do whatever we could to get ppe to the frontline as quickly as possible 
 the minister ’s response really do not reflect the seriousness of the situation this be not just bad apple this be a rotten culture that go to the very top with £ lose on waste ppe and £ lose to covid fraud that be £ of public money go at a time when people and public service be struggle can the minister remind the house who be chancellor at the time that all of this be sign off 
 i do not know what more i can add to my last answer this be do very quickly at pace because we be desperate to get ppe to the frontline as quickly as possible we have set up initiative to recoup money from fraudulent activity include the public sector fraud authority which have already save taxpayer £ in the year of operation 
 if he will make mandatory the recommendation on reporting of the taskforce on nature relate financial disclosure 
 this government have be of the large donor to the global market lead taskforce on nature relate financial disclosure tnfd initiative we will consider how good the tnfd ’s recommendation should be incorporate into policy and legislative architecture in a manner that be coherent with global sustainability reporting 
 merry christmas to you mr speaker and to the officer clerks and staff of the house i be encourage by my hon friend ’s answer it be a year ago today that the global biodiversity framework be agree in montreal and it be absolutely necessary to restore biodiversity loss the tnfd initiative be launch by the uk g7 presidency in and it feature in the green finance strategy that my right hon friend the chancellor and i do the ministerial foreword to early this year he will be aware of the recommendation that be launch in september i be conscious that there be a lot of support from the treasury previously and that we should try to accelerate the international sustainability standards board standard so that we can bring in this initiative just as successfully as we have do for the tcfd the taskforce on climate relate financial disclosure 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question she mention the treasury ’s green finance strategy which contain plan to bring forward the sustainability disclosure requirement build on the global commitment we have already implement the climate relate financial disclosure and we be look very carefully at the nature relate financial disclosure we hope to update the house in due course 
 what step his department be take to help increase the level of business investment 
 in the autumn statement the chancellor announce an ambitious growth package that will boost business investment by make full expensing permanent by remove barrier to business investment by reform our inefficient planning system by speed up electricity grid connection time and by make £ available for strategic manufacturing sector over the next year among other measure 
 i thank the minister for that response it be very welcome to see full expensing which will help business to invest in the plant and machinery and the technology that be need it would also help the ceramics sector in particular if it be exempt from the emission trading scheme will my hon friend speak to the chancellor about the possibility of exempt the ceramics sector from the ets which would help to give the sector the breathing space to invest in productivity and energy efficiency gain 
 i can think of few great champion for stoke ’s ceramic sector than my hon friend we recognise that carbon leakage be a significant risk for the ceramics sector so i can offer he piece of information we provide free allowance to the ceramics sector under the ets secondly just yesterday we announce that ceramic will be include in the uk ’s carbon border adjustment mechanism 
 if he will make an estimate of the potential impact of a carbon border adjustment mechanism in the form recommend by the commission for carbon competitiveness on fuel duty 
 the government have announce that they will implement a cbam from january the uk cbam will place a carbon price on some of the most emission intensive industrial good import to the uk and will ensure that the uk ’s decarbonisation effort lead to a true reduction in global emission rather than simply displace carbon emission overseas the delivery of a cbam will be the subject of further consultation in 
 i congratulate the minister a cbam be the cheap and most future proof way to save the planet and uk manufacturing job at the same time but some of the detail look troubling why have some manufacturing industry be leave out entirely why be other arrive late so they will be vulnerable to dumping and how will he ensure that this be not just a tax and price rise for already hard press family and business 
 i recognise and thank my hon friend for his work as chair of the commission for carbon competitiveness i will directly address his main question on speed implementation by at the late will allow the government to engage with business to ensure that they be well prepared but next year ’s consultation will provide more information on timing we have identify sector that have the great exposure to carbon leakage from both a trade and an emission perspective 
 what progress he have make on the introduction of investment zone 
 since the spring budget the government have announce of the english investment zone and confirm the location of place eligible to    host investment zone in scotland and wales the government be commit to ensure that funding and tax site go live in the financial year 
 i welcome the investment zone in nottinghamshire and derbyshire will the minister confirm that some of the benefit of these zone be not only available in the small number of large site but be available to any business across the whole zone to apply for 
 my hon friend be right to recognise the east midland investment zone which will bring significant benefit across the region in the advanced manufacturing and green industry sector i be pleased to tell he that it start with a £ anchor investment and over time will leverage some £ in private investment support job overall 
 what step he be take to reduce inflation 
 inflation have now halve from in october to in october deliver on the prime minister ’s pledge this have happen not by accident but as a result of difficult decision make by the government and the bank of england government decision that be oppose every step of the way by the labour party 
 thank you for call i to ask a question while i catch my breath mr speaker 
 a major component of inflation over this past year have of course be the energy price shock what be the government do to ensure the continue expansion of renewable energy so that we have great energy security and so that we be more resilient in the face of energy price shock from overseas 
 my right hon friend be right and she nail the delivery of her question while out of breath 
 at the autumn statement the chancellor announce measure that demonstrate the government ’s ongoing commitment to renewable energy as a priority growth sector essential to our energy security and net ambition the announcement make include a new investment exemption from the electricity generator levy and a £ green industry growth accelerator 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 today be the funeral of lord darling who will be greatly miss by many in this house as well as by maggie and his family civil servant be know for be good at conceal their private feeling about more challenging minister but that be never necessary with alistair darling he be chief secretary to the treasury and then chancellor during the global financial crisis and despite the many stress and strain of that period he be uniformly admire and much love for his kindness    decency and dry sense of humour he take decision in that period that have stand the test of time and put he on the small list of chancellors whom history will remember for wise decision making in an unprecedented crisis we will always remember he 
 finally mr speaker may i wish you and all the staff in the house a merry and peaceful christmas 
 i too send my full sympathy i also wish everyone across the house a merry christmas 
 industry have fully support the prime minister ’s vision of the uk become a cryptocurrency hub but many licensed company be still find it difficult to open bank account here so will the chancellor meet the all party group on crypto and digital asset to discuss what progress can be make on digital britain 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for ask that question because the uk and london in particular have become the global crypto hub to make sure that the market can really take off in the way that be intend in a responsible way we need to regulate it which be why we have introduce regulation on stablecoin and on the promotion of crypto service my hon friend the economic secretary to the treasury would be more than happy to meet she 
 i call the shadow minister 
 merry christmas to you and to the house mr speaker let i start by thank the chancellor for his kind word about the late lord darling which i think show the gratitude of member from across the house for his lifetime of public service 
 the public have a right to know why so many billion of pound of their taxis have be waste by this government baroness mone have claim today that conservative ministers know about her personal connection to the company ppe medpro from the very beginning so why do the government not correct the record when a misleading picture be be paint in the medium about baroness mone ’s personal connection to ppe medpro in the place 
 i be not go to comment on allegation by baroness mone or indeed on the individual case but let i say this we put together a taskforce of more than people that open investigation and so far have make more arrest so we will stop at nothing to tackle fraud and bring to justice anyone who be responsible for wrongdoing but what we do in a moment of extreme crisis be to make sure that we get personal protective equipment to the frontline as quickly as we could and have we not do so many more life would have be lose 
 we all know that baroness mone ’s enrichment via ppe medpro be subject to an investigation but that do not allow ministers to refuse to answer question here in the house today so let i ask another baroness mone ’s husband doug barrowman allege that in november he be approach by a government official ask if they would 
 pay more for the other matter to go away 
 be that specific and incredibly serious claim now be investigate and if so by whom 
 if the hon gentleman have any evidence of people behave improperly or illegally he should tell the police and he will get the full support of this government and the whole house in bring the matter to justice but let i just say to he that any responsible opposition should understand that in a crisis there be a trade off between speed and take long to prevent fraud and we take the right decision to save as many life as possible 
 i be hear from a concern number of small business in my constituency that they be slow down as they approach the vat threshold rather than do what the whole economy need they to do and go for growth ahead of the spring budget will my right hon friend look at substantially shift the vat threshold upwards 
 my hon friend be a great advocate for small business the government recognise that account for vat can be a burden on business but that be why at £ the uk have a high vat registration threshold than any eu member state and the high in the oecd keep the majority of uk business out of vat altogether in the autumn statement it be announce that the vat threshold would be maintain at its current level until   march as always the government keep taxis under review 
 i echo the chancellor ’s generous and well judge tribute to alistair darling 
 at the autumn statement the chancellor say mistakenly as it turn out that the household support fund be be extend into the next financial year the chief secretary to the treasury clarify the position a few moment ago do the chancellor recognise that there be a compelling case for he to announce exactly that extension in the budget so that council can continue to provide the last resort safety net that have be such a valuable feature of the household support fund over the last year 
 i recognise the important role the household support fund have play as my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury say early no decision have be make about what will happen go forward there be a lot of anti poverty measure in the autumn statement include increase benefit next year by double the rate of inflation increase the full time national living wage by £ a year and increase the local housing allowance provide an average of an extra £ to household

 the hon lady will have hear my answer to a previous question where i state that we have put billion of pound of extra money into local government this year to cover pressure we recognise that those pressure be real which be why the provisional settlement propose an above inflation rise for next year

 the life science sector be worth £ to the northern ireland economy what step have be take with counterpart in the northern ireland assembly to increase funding for employment within this worthy sector 
 the hon gentleman be quite right that life science be of the key growth industry for this country i would be happy to meet he to discuss all the thing we be do for the sector particularly in northern ireland 
 our economy continue to be impact by the war in ukraine and denial across the black sea and we now must brace ourselves for further economic shock as global shipping avoid the red sea do the minister agree that we should be protect these shipping lane our navy be now too small by half to protect our maritime interest so will he now look at invest in our surface fleet to protect our economy 
 as my right hon friend know i have long believe in the importance of invest in our armed force but that ultimately depend on a strong economy that will pay for sustained investment and that be what be happen under this government 
 will the chancellor update the house on how he plan to move forward with some of the key recommendation from lord harrington ’s review into foreign direct investment in the uk 
 i be happy to do that in fact i host a reception for lord harrington and the people responsible for that review last week we will start by increase the budget of the office for investment so that it can give a more bespoke service to potential overseas investor 
 we be all mindful of the need to control public finance and slim the civil service but can my right hon friend reassure my constituent that the darlington economic campus will receive the job that be promise and will he give consideration to my proposal to name their permanent home of dec william mcmullen house in recognition of the sacrifice william make for people of darlington 
 my hon friend be a brilliant advocate for his constituency i hear what he have to say and i be happy to meet he to talk about it 
 my right hon friend be well aware of the threat to thousand of job at scunthorpe steelwork and many more in the supply chain that support it all of which would have a devastating effect on the economy of northern lincolnshire can he and his colleague in the department for business and trade bring a speedy conclusion to the negotiation and lift the cloud over scunthorpe 
 i thank my hon friend for his campaigning on that issue and reassure he that we in the treasury completely understand how vital steel be to the future of his area and to his constituent we will continue to do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible 
 urgent question to ask the minister if he will make a statement on the situation in israel and gaza 
 the whole house will be gravely concern about the desperate situation in gaza it can not continue and we be deploy all our diplomatic resource include in the united nations to help find a viable solution i be grateful to the hon lady for her urgent question and for the private message from gaza that she have make available to i and i look forward to meet she in the foreign office tomorrow 
 the scale of civilian death and displacement in gaza be shocking i be particularly disturb to hear about the situation of civilian trap in the holy family church complex in gaza city the lack of water and food and report of sniper fire cause civilian death inside the complex although israel have the right to defend itself against terror restore its security and bring the hostage home it must abide by international law and take all possible measure to protect civilian 
 no want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than necessary we recognise the sheer scale of the suffering and be appal at the impact on civilian we urgently need more humanitarian pause to get all the hostage out and lifesave aid in we welcome the recent opening of the kerem shalom cross to help achieve that but it be not enough our immediate priority be to secure the release of british hostage to show solidarity with israel in defend itself against hamas while comply with international humanitarian law and to call for such pause both at the un and directly with israel to ensure that emergency aid can be distribute in gaza include fuel water and medicine 
 the foreign secretary will discuss the situation in gaza with regional leader this week in his visit to egypt and jordan the government have recently announce an additional £ of british aid triple the uk aid budget for the occupied palestinian territories this financial year to date we have deliver tonne of aid but there be still more to do casualty number be far too high and we be call on hamas to release each and every kidnap hostage we be also actively explore other route for aid into gaza include maritime option 
 of course as both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have say ultimately this must end we of course want to see an end to the fighting but it must be a sustainable ceasefire mean that hamas must stop launch rocket into israel and must release the hostage more than hostage be still unaccounted for they must be release immediately and return to their family to achieve long term peace in the middle east a viable state solution be need leave hamas in power in gaza would be a permanent roadblock on the path to that no can be expect to live alongside a terrorist organisation commit to their destruction and dedicate to repeat those attack 
 i be extremely grateful to you mr speaker for grant the urgent question and i thank the minister for his response let i begin by point member towards my entry in the register of members financial interests i be an unpaid adviser to international centre of justice for palestinians 
 i have speak before in the house about my extended family who be in the holy family parish church in zeitoun gaza the situation have be desperate for week but be now descend far there be tank outside the gate and soldier and sniper point into the complex and shoot at anyone who venture out and the convent be bomb on saturday woman be shoot they be simply try to get to the toilet there be no electricity or clean water and the update that i have last night be that they be down to their last can of corn i be tell that after pressure food have be deliver but they have not see it 
 when this begin a week ago the israel defence forces soldier order those civilian to evacuate against their will can the government confirm that they see the forcible displacement of civilian as unacceptable the people in the church be civilian they have nothing to do with hamas they be nun orphan and disabled people they be a small christian community and they know everyone as the pope have say and as my family can confirm it be categorically untrue to say that hamas be operate from there the situation have be condemn by many will the government condemn it 
 it be important to stress that the suffering be not confine to just that church just last week we see the utterly tragic death of israeli hostage other be report to have be murder by hamas and be still in captivity that be also unacceptable day on in this conflict the death toll be only rise it be time for the international community to say that this violence be now make peace hard not easy 
 the uk government talk now of a sustainable ceasefire and although i and the liberal democrats welcome the change in tone it be unclear whether that be in fact a change in position will the government demand an immediate bilateral ceasefire will they change how they vote at the un security council as a result when will the prime minister accept that the only route to peace be political not military that there be way to get rid of hamas and end the humanitarian catastrophe and it be not this when will the united kingdom fulfil its historical obligation to the region and recognise palestine as a step towards deliver the state which be the only way to guarantee security and dignity for israelis and palestinians 
 i thank the hon lady for her comment i understand how deeply distress this be for she with her family catch up in the holy family church complex as i say in my response i be grateful to she for the harrowing update she be able to give i direct from the holy family church i be very pleased to hear that she think food have be deliver we will follow up on that point directly after this urgent question 
 the hon lady talk about the protection of civilian the british government make absolutely clear that international humanitarian law must be abide by she also mention humanitarian aid we understand that yesterday truck enter the gaza strip through rafah and through kerem shalom which be a new   avenue that we very much welcome finally on the point she make about the united nations we be work with partner on a resolution and i expect there will be a vote at pm today uk time that be what we be work towards and while the position be not yet clear we be hop to support that resolution 
 while walk to parliament yesterday i politely challenge a driver who have selfishly park his car in the bus lane lead on to chelsea bridge so that he could buy a coffee at the nearby kiosk when i suggest he move it give the traffic chaos it be cause he blankly refuse begin swear at i threaten to throw my phone in the river if i take a photo of he and then call i a racist and a zionist sadly that illustrate how hate and intolerance here in the uk be be fuel by event in the middle east this conflict be now in its month with no end in sight no clarity from israel as to how long the occupation will last and the death toll be mount do the minister agree that without concerted international intervention the conflict will escalate 
 i be appalled to hear about the way in which my right hon friend be treat on his way into the house of commons we be stress the importance of a more surgical approach by the israeli defence forces and be work towards a more sustainable cessation of hostility we recognise that there be too many casualty and we be press forward on what be the policy of both the government and the opposition more extensive humanitarian pause so that aid can get into gaza 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i be grateful to   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for secure this very important urgent question may i say how deeply sorry i be to hear of the terrifying experience face her family in gaza i be sure the whole house be with she and her relative at what must be an incredibly difficult time 
 the report from the holy family catholic church be shocking an innocent mother and daughter kill in the ground of a church with other too scar to leave and now run out of food once again in this conflict a place of sanctuary and peace have become a scene of fear and death it be example of the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe confront civilian across gaza and a reminder of the urgent imperative to address this crisis and help bring about the condition for a sustainable ceasefire it come at a moment of grow concern that this conflict could escalate with hezbollah in the north more violence in the west bank and houthi threat in the red sea we support effort to maintain regional security and labour welcome the uk ’s participation in the new maritime security effort we thank our armed force personnel for their service and professionalism 
 today the united nations security council be vote once again on a resolution this be a crucial chance to address the urgent and catastrophic situation in gaza let i be clear labour want a resolution to pass that can protect civilian life that demand that hostage be release and that can act as a stepping stone towards a sustainable ceasefire and provide renew   impetus towards a state solution the time have come for the united kingdom to support our international ally at this critical moment 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for his comment we be as he know very committed to try to make sure that there be no escalation i thank he for his welcome for the us lead work to secure maritime security and i also thank he for his comment particularly at this time of year about our armed force i have already comment on the un security council resolution which i hope will be vote on this afternoon like he i hope that agreement can be reach 
 on the issue of the humanitarian catastrophe to which the shadow foreign secretary refer i can tell he that there be some movement this week there be world food programme truck ready at allenby bridge to travel through israel to kerem shalom and if sign off that will provide a new route through to gaza we have make available some money to the world food programme it be available today to enhance that route if it open 
 all of we abhor the loss of innocent civilian life in israel and gaza but talk of a sustainable ceasefire be unhelpful all it do be give succour to israel ’s enemy at the time of its great need this be a country that fall to its knee just a few week ago and suffer the bad tragedy since the holocaust now it be try to eliminate hamas and to free the hostage some of whom be british citizen let it finish the job let it protect israeli security and in do so let israel protect our security as well 
 while it be true that weapon have be discover in incubator in a hospital in gaza nevertheless i do not agree with my right hon friend we be work towards a sustainable ceasefire we be not there yet but we should all of we be work towards that in the meanwhile on the pathway to a sustainable ceasefire we need urgently to get these humanitarian pause so that humanitarian relief can enter gaza 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i too send my very good wish to the family of   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran 
 as we know later today the government ’s call for a sustainable ceasefire will be test at the un security council if the government again decide to abdicate their responsibility to humanity and abstain they will be give netanyahu the political cover he need to prosecute a war in which ten of thousand have already be kill and in which at the weekend accord to the latin patriarch of jerusalem 
 a sniper of the idf murder woman inside the holy family parish in gaza 
 if the uk be unable to support a ceasefire now when will it what have to happen before this government say enough be enough and that the indiscriminate killing of innocent the blanket bombing of civilian infrastructure and the killing of journalist have to stop now how many more breach of international humanitarian law will it take for this government to find the moral courage to say this have to stop and it have to stop now 
 i do not think this be an issue of moral courage the government with the support of those on the opposition front bench be do what we believe to be right we have be very clear that israel have a right to defend itself but it must do more to diminish and minimise the number of civilian casualty on the point the hon member make about the united nations resolution which we hope will be pass this afternoon as i have say skilled british diplomat in new york be engage in talk throughout the united nations to try to make sure that that resolution land in the way both he and i want 
 i welcome the call from the foreign secretary for a sustainable ceasefire and i welcome my right hon friend ’s word from the dispatch box today over the weekend the foreign secretary receive letter from back benchers on this side of the house and another from a group of foreign policy expert call for a permanent ceasefire the last truce result in over hostage be release and hundred of life be save do my right hon friend accept that a permanent ceasefire would reap similar result 
 it be true that the foreign secretary receive a letter over the weekend sign by colleague which state 
 it be widely accept across the world that last security for israel peace for the palestinians an end to the killing and the defeat of hamas can only be achieve through politic and diplomacy and the establishment of state 
 that be very much the view of the government as well 
 the minster have clearly see the communiqué from the latin patriarch of jerusalem point out the atrocity commit in the ground of the holy family church with people murder and at least wound that show a shocking lack of fire control discipline by the israeli force will the minister raise with the israeli force my grave concern and those of many colleague across the house that that be not acceptable 
 there be no need for i to raise it with the israeli force because they be themselves conduct an inquiry into the matter 
 at gaza ’s kamal adwan hospital last weekend approximately hamas fighter be arrest some of whom take part in the   october   massacre weaponry hamas intelligence and military and technological equipment be recover and report suggest that hospital staff direct the israel defence forces to weapon that hamas have store inside incubator for premature baby will my right hon friend join i in condemn hamas for those appalling war crime and do he agree that that incident underline hamas ’s disregard for civilian human life in gaza 
 my hon friend be right to point to those report as i mention early there have be report of weapon find in incubator in particular in kamal adwan hospital i be sure that every member of this house condemn without qualification the appalling event perpetrate by hamas start on   october 
 do the minister agree with cardinal vincent nichols ’s version of event that take place in the compound of the holy family church 
 the right hon lady will understand that i be not in a position to make that judgment but i have hear with great respect what the cardinal archbishop of westminster have say 
 all of we be deeply sympathetic to the plight of our jewish brother after the october pogrom and most of we accept the argument that an immediate ceasefire would have play into the hand of hamas but i think on these bench the mood be change frankly what israel be do be totally unacceptable this be indiscriminate bombing of vast civilian population leave aside the outrage at the holy family church it be simply not in the long term interest of israel that it radicalise whole generation of arab youth it be not in our interest either to be involve in any way on the side of israel do that we must up the rhetoric and condemn that unequivocally 
 my right hon friend will have see the article co author by the foreign secretary and his german counterpart he be right to refer to the pogrom that be instigate in october and also to the importance of a sustainable ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law in my view the answer to his final point be that the moment there be an opportunity to advance a political track it must be seize by the region and britain will do everything it can to support that 
 we should all thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for her steadfastness and for secure this urgent question people have now die across the gaza strip and israel be use food water and medicine as weapon of war against a civilian population there be miss people under the rubble as she say a political solution be require not a military can the minister assure the house that the vote today will bring about a ceasefire and that it will stop the escalation of the war into the red sea and the mediterranean and start to address the underlying issue which be of course israel ’s occupation of the west bank the refugee all around the world and the continued siege of gaza which have go on for decade we must have the start of a long term process that bring about real justice for the palestinian people or we will be back here again with more war crime more death more destruction and the horror for decade to come 
 the right hon gentleman be entirely right to focus on the united nations security council resolution which we hope will be pass this afternoon that be the way we move the situation forward towards the political track that both he and i want to see as rapidly as possible 
 we all welcome the humanitarian pause that see the release of a number of hostage and aid deliver into gaza on   december the day pause collapse follow the firing of rocket into israel from gaza hamas also fail to provide a daily list of hostage to be release by am in   a further violation of the truce will the minister join i in criticise hamas for violate the truce agreement once again prove that they be no partner for a last peace between israelis and palestinians 
 the house will note what the hon gentleman have say i assure he that we be do everything we can to get humanitarian support into gaza include focus specifically on any maritime opportunity the royal fleet auxiliary lyme bay be load with supply in cyprus and be ready to sail once we can be assure that the support can be receive and deliver 
 with almost death in gaza my constituent in bolton be ask when be enough enough with country vote for a ceasefire when be a sustainable ceasefire a ceasefire that happen now member of noorul islam mosque in bolton recently visit egypt to try to get aid across the border into gaza will the minister meet i to discuss way that we can work with the egyptian government and other partner to ensure that aid can get from bolton into gaza 
 i thank my hon friend for what he have say today and for the information and work from his community in bolton that he be make available to the foreign office of course i shall be pleased to see he at a mutually convenient time 
 last week i attend a briefing with professor ghassan abu sitta a heroic british palestinian doctor who have just return from gaza because the israeli siege prevent medical supply from enter gaza he tell we he have to use vinegar and wash up liquid to sterilise wound even on the night when he perform amputation on child he recount their scream and the desperation of their parent i pay tribute to professor ghassan but it will forever shame this house that the dying and the wound who he treat be bomb and maim by israel with the approval of this place will the government finally listen to the grow global call and demand an immediate ceasefire 
 the hon lady ’s eloquent intervention underline the importance of achieve a sustainable ceasefire in the way set out by the foreign secretary in his article at the weekend 
 over the weekend the israelis uncover the large ever hamas tunnel at mile long the brother of hamas ’s leader have be see drive through the tunnel as he hide beneath gaza ’s civilian population the minister have already speak about hamas fighter surrender at a hospital where there be firearm in incubator for premature baby do he agree that those be important reminder of hamas ’s appalling use of human shield of why hamas must no long brutalise gaza ’s population and terrorise israelis and of why the uk would be completely wrong to call for a ceasefire before the threat of hamas be remove 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his comment i suspect that on both side of the house there be no need for a reminder of the horrific event that hamas have perpetrate on   october   and   since as he will understand we be try to ensure that the hostage be release as swiftly as possible that the rocket stop and that we be able to move to a political process as soon as feasible 
 hundred of british palestinians have see multiple generation of their relative kill their family home destroy and their future in gaza decimate i put on record my thank to   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   and my hon friend   the member for bradford east imran hussain   for organise the move event with professor ghassan abu sitta it be a packed room and not a single eye be dry as we listen to he speak about the horrific situation in the hospital have either the prime minister the foreign secretary or the minister meet any british palestinian family include those who have recently return from gaza to witness how they have be affect by israel ’s indiscriminate strike 
 my understanding be that both the foreign secretary and the prime minister have have access to that information the hon gentleman make a plea for those difficulty to end and i hope he will accept that the government be do everything we can to fulfil what he want to see and what we want to see 
 there be nothing morally courageous about argue for the people who commit the atrocity on   october the rapist and murderer who cross into israel on that day to remain in power which be what those who be demand a ceasefire with hamas be ask for that be the reality i fear sometimes listen to what be say here that some people hope israel do not succeed in achieve its aim of wipe out this horrendous terrorist cult while there may be a letter from some colleague that barely reach double figure very many of we on the government benches have be proud of the strong stand and moral clarity that the government have have in support israel after what happen on   october and i hope that continue 
 my hon friend make a good point we be determined that we will end up with a situation where the palestinians can run their own territory where the arab state be heavily involve and where a political initiative be regionally lead lot of international work support and help be require but we have to get to a point where we can see that political track take shape 
 ahead of today ’s un security council vote a group of foreign policy and military expert include the former chief of the uk armed force general richards have call for the foreign secretary to support an immediate ceasefire at the un security council many have long argue for that but it can be achieve at the un security council only if the us stop vetoing resolution i welcome what the minister have say about hop that the uk will support such a resolution but can he say more about what our government be do in the next hour to convince the us at the minimum to abstain on the resolution to allow it through or to support it 
 the hon lady will know that britain always take a lead role in the drafting and execution of these resolution i can tell she that skilled british diplomat be use this time to try to secure an agreement on the security council resolution which i hope may be pass tonight i can give she no guarantee of that but i can give she a guarantee that british diplomat be work flat out to achieve it 
 i thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for her important urgent question i hope that food will be take to the holy family church shortly i thank the minister for his comment the united nations relief and works agency be look after people in its camp which be more than half the population of gaza on my visit to palestine in may we hear that unrwa be struggle to find funding can we ensure that unrwa be receive the money and aid it need to provide humanitarian assistance to the palestinians now and in the future 
 we be clear that unrwa be play a critical role in gaza we be very careful to ensure that the british taxpayer money we spend to support unrwa be spend in the right way we have significantly increase our support to unrwa and the americans have re engage in support unrwa 
 give the release of the late hamas video of elderly male civilian hostage do the minister agree that in all the distress be experience about event in gaza it be important that these innocent hostage do not become the forget element of the conflict will the government continue to do all they can to ensure that their safe release be part of any negotiation design to bring an end to the violence 
 i can give the hon gentleman those assurance he will understand why it be unhelpful across the floor of the house to discuss the detail of the negotiation in respect of the hostage but he may rest assure that we be act in precisely the way he have set out 
 there be horrific account of sexual violence be perpetrate against hostage in this conflict include the gang rape of woman and genital mutilation will the government stand firmly with the survivor of sexual violence which should never be use as a tool of conflict and do all possible to strengthen their access to justice 
 my hon friend will know that this government have make a particular and important intervention to try to stop gender base violence and in particular the use of sexual crime in warfare i can tell she that her view be well hear and well respect and we will continue to do just that 
 can the minister assure the house that should a vote on a ceasefire be bring forward today at the un security council the government will   not abdicate their responsibility to innocent child woman and man and will vote for that ceasefire and not abstain 
 i can reassure the hon gentleman that the government certainly will not abdicate our responsibility but how the government exercise our vote on the security council will depend on the text that be agree 
 the entire bibas family include month old kfir bibas be kidnap on   october do the minister agree that precondition for a ceasefire must include both the military defeat of hamas and the return of all the hostage 
 yes 
 the challenge in secure a sustainable ceasefire many of we have be call for a ceasefire for some time be not just the immediate military concern but the allegation of war crime just in the past week alone the minister will have see houthi force attack shipping in the red sea he will have see the situation outline so powerfully by our colleague   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran in the holy family church on   december when i ask the minister about this issue he tell the house that the government be continue 
 to identify and look for mechanism for ensure that there can be no impunity”—[official report   december vol c. 
 for anybody who commit a war crime can he update we on whether he have identify such a mechanism and what that might be 
 the word i use be absolutely precise the government have no tolerance of impunity for those who commit war crime there be legal mechanism and other mechanism that be available and that we see every day in our paper and the government of course support those process to ensure that there be not impunity for war crime 
 and hostage be still in captivity at the hand of the terrorist group hamas despite diplomatic effort the international red cross have still not be give access to they all we see be video come out at the same time the hamas leadership be meet in turkey with other terrorist group plan what they will do next irrespective of what the united nations say call for a ceasefire just enable hamas to regroup and set about their evil doing once again 
 my hon friend make a very good point that be why it be the policy of the government and as i understand it the opposition not to call for an immediate ceasefire hamas have make it clear that they will not respect or accept a ceasefire indeed they want to repeat what happen on   october israel have an absolute right of self defence to go after the people who perpetrate those terrible event on   october 
 human rights watch have warn that the israeli government be use the starvation of civilian as a method of warfare in gaza let we be clear that be a war crime amnesty   have similarly warn of war crime as have the un high commissioner for human rights surely the government should not be stand by while israel commit war crime but should be call for an immediate ceasefire that could swiftly help prevent further such crime do the failure to do so not risk complicity in those war crime 
 the government have hear the word of president herzog that israel will respect international humanitarian law and the government expect israel to abide by the word of the president 
 my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman   refer to a meeting of hamas official include its deputy chairman and former leader in turkey recently where hamas set out their intent to carry on their brutal act far to the   october   massacre what assessment have my right hon friend the minister make of turkey ’s role in facilitate hamas ’s continue war crime and how will he pursue accountability for suppose nato ally and strategic partner 
 the government make it clear to all country where we stand on this we do not think that a ceasefire at this time be possible or practical we be seek humanitarian pause that be as long as possible to get aid in we be in favour when it be conceivably possible of a sustainable ceasefire and we hope that time will come as soon as possible 
 be the real reason why there be so many civilian casualty in gaza not that hamas have cruelly deliberately and wilfully use the civilian population as cover whether by operate from hospital fire from school store weapon in people ’s house or hide among the civilian population be that not the reason why we must not allow this terrorist group to continue to have a base from which to try to eliminate israel and why a ceasefire at present would stop the israeli military fulfil its obligation to protect its people in the long run by eliminate hamas 
 the right hon gentleman make a very good point while israel use its military force to defend its civilian population hamas use their civilian population to defend hamas 
 last week ’s comment from the israeli ambassador which effectively rule out a state solution serve as further evidence of the difference that exist between our aspiration for the region and those of both the israeli government and of course hamas give the chasm that exist between those conflict objective be it not time to urgently press for a permanent ceasefire to enable the diplomatic measure necessary to bring about consensus on a lasting peace 
 in respect of the comment make by the israeli ambassador to the uk the hon gentleman will have see the response of the british government and in particular the response of the foreign secretary on the part of the hon gentleman ’s question in respect of a permanent ceasefire he will have hear not only what the government have say but what those on the opposition front bench have say 
 will the united kingdom government urge the government of israel to ratify the rome statute and thus become a state party to the international criminal court 
 the right hon gentleman will know that britain be a signatory to the international criminal court because we think that it be a vital piece of the international architecture but it be for all country to make their own decision in that respect he will know that a number of country include america have so far decline to join 
 shot and kill for go to the toilet the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   have describe just example of what palestinians in gaza be go through our heart go out to she and her family but also to all the civilian in gaza who be affect by such appalling treatment at the moment many israeli leader have openly push for the expulsion of palestinians from the gaza strip and call for the nakba in gaza will the minister reassure the house that the british government oppose any such attempt to forcibly expel and displace palestinians from gaza 
 yes 
 with such death devastation and destruction which we have all see unfold in real time constituent be ask whether there be any british fingerprint or funding to be find behind the bullet and bomb use in the horror show of gaza and the west bank the minister talk of a state solution but as have be point out the netanyahu regime and its ambassador to the uk have reject this how can we allow the present tactic to go on unabated when there be no clear picture on how and when this will end 
 the hon lady ’s point underline the vital importance of move to a political track as soon as it be possible to do so 
 britain must maintain that international law be follow on the international stage specifically the protection of civilian include innocent child do the minister agree that although the humanitarian pause be an important step test the negotiation and mediation of intermediary and of course the release of hostage only a last ceasefire will bring about the condition for peace do he also agree we have hear it here in the chamber today that the israeli government have to accept that for they to have statehood and live in peace they must want the same for their neighbour too 
 that be why the government be work towards a sustainable ceasefire in the meantime we be anxious to secure the necessary pause so that aid can get into gaza as speedily as possible 
 i thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   for secure this urgent question and you mr speaker for grant it my heart go out to her family and everybody else catch up in this dreadful conflict 
 i welcome the word of the foreign secretary call for a sustainable ceasefire which must see all the hostage release and fight on both side end we need to get the aid in will the minister say more about how we will permanently end this cycle of violence how do we get a state solution 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment he be right that we be not call for a ceasefire and hop that somehow it become more permanent what we be do be call for a sustainable ceasefire that allow we to move towards the political track which will then deliver what he be call for 
 i thank   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran as we all get ready to celebrate christmas with our family she will be think desperately about her family and i think about all the family who will not be together this christmas 
 pause be not enough to allow the rehabilitation of vital infrastructure due to repeat shutdown of communication and internet service gaza be now in danger of become an information vacuum transparency be absolutely essential for hold military force to account and prevent further humanitarian atrocity will the minister please update the house on how   the uk be work to ensure that the power and communication infrastructure be restore so that we can get help and clarity for those in desperate need 
 we be work to get to that point but we be not there at the moment we need to do everything we can to reconnect vital infrastructure that have be destroy it be not just about people suffer the effect of kinetic activity it be also about the effect of the lack of food and grow disease the hon lady may rest assure that in respect of the infrastructure to which she refer we will do everything we can when we get the opportunity 
 i would like to be able to welcome the incremental move in the foreign secretary ’s joint statement at the weekend but give the desperate event in gaza and the position of the vast majority of the rest of the world these be just weasel word the government and those on the labour front bench be rightly quick to condemn the heinous war crime commit against civilian in ukraine and by hamas on   october the minister have repeatedly say that israel need to abide by international law but he know that israel be not do so be the cold blooded killing of civilian woman seek sanctuary in a church a war crime yes or no 
 in order to give an answer to the hon gentleman ’s question i need to know the full fact and i very much hope that the full fact will become available before too long
