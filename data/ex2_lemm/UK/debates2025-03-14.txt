the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 we all know someone who have suffer from a rare cancer a brain tumour childhood cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer or of the other cancer on a long list that be unfortunately all too familiar each of they may statistically be consider rare but collectively they be anything but rare blood cancer uk state that rare and less common cancer account for of all uk cancer diagnosis a staggering a year the irony of the bill ’s title be that so call rare cancer be not rare common cancer deserve attention but so too do rare cancer 
 i want to share an example of a family in my constituency who be confront with a rare cancer tilly ’s symptom be leg pain and loss of appetite this be in september when face to face gp consultation be not possible on visit a&e she be give ibuprofen it be think that she might have a virus week later she return to a&e and be transfer to the cancer ward where she be diagnose with stage neuroblastoma on diagnosis she be give a chance of survival despite undergo over a dozen round of chemotherapy and an operation she sadly pass away about a year after her symptom appear tilly be just year old her father jonathan a headteacher in my constituency be in the gallery he reach out to i after read about the bill he explain his frustration that the development of new treatment for neuroblastoma have be move at a glacial pace for too long the same be true for many other rare cancer this slow pace of change be not respect by these cancer and it mean that tilly miss her birthday yesterday 
 i thank jonathan for share tilly ’s story and wish he all the good as he move to northern ireland with tilly ’s mum and big sister emily to start a new job i thank livingston ’s team jak for their ongoing support for tilly ’s family and many other neither jonathan nor i want to suggest that the bill would have save tilly but we hope that it will improve survival rate for   other and take they beyond the rate give to tilly that be why jonathan be here today and why i be here today 
 nobody tell i that the most amazing thing about be an mp would be the people we meet almost daily who want to make their community our country or even the world a well place that be particularly true of the people i have be humble to meet on my journey to speak about the bill today include cancer patient survivor the bereaved and campaigner all of whom want just thing justice although the healthcare system in the uk be found on the notion of equality fairness and justice they believe that rare cancer patient be be overlook their demand for justice cover point 
 the be that beat a rare cancer should not be less likely than beat other cancer i have say that of all uk cancer diagnosis each year be of rare and less common type these patient already have the card stack against they as they be less likely to survive an injustice cause by the relative lack of research and development in this field over many year 
 secondly have a rare cancer should not mean be less likely to benefit from a medical breakthrough accord to cancer52 in an astonishing of patient with rare and less common cancer be not offer a clinical trial and so be deny access to potentially lifesave treatment often that be because such trial do not even exist because there have be so little progress and when they do exist they be not always easy for patient to access 
 let i give an example there be a remarkable young woman in my constituency know as kira the machine kira have be live with neuroblastoma since she be she have be through it all a prognosis of inoperability round of chemotherapy and relapse she and her mum aud be fundraise legend locally i do not know a school or workplace in edinburgh that do not help when they be give just week to raise £ for lifesave specialist treatment in the usa now and fundraise for other cancer sufferer kira be an example to we all she owe her life to a lung cancer drug not typically provide to treat neuroblastoma and not yet generally available in the uk for that purpose although i understand that solving kid cancer be work on that 
 kira appear on my social medium so much and be really well know in edinburgh because of the fantastic campaign that she and her mum run she be a bit of a celebrity if i can use that word she come into my office recently to talk about the bill it be really humble to meet she and because she have that celebrity status in my mind i be also quite starstruck i tell she that it be like taylor swift enter my office i resist the temptation to exchange friendship bracelet with she but she give i a solving kids cancer badge which i be proud to wear today 
 kira ’s story be important because it remind we that repurpose exist drug can unlock great benefit but those benefit can be deliver at scale only through additional medical research effort and clinical trial 
 the nhs have a drug repurposing office to date it have repurpose drug and that be for breast cancer do my hon friend think that be good enough 
 i welcome that intervention i think that be a leading question of course it be not good enough i do not think that anybody here think that it be good enough include the minister unfortunately at present there be very few clinical trial in this country for rare cancer treatment family such as kira ’s should not need to crowdfund for treatment overseas we should be build the capacity here in the uk 
 thirdly have a rare cancer should not mean that a diagnosis be delay when compare with diagnosis of other cancer rare cancer sufferer tell i that their symptom be often less likely to be recognise as doctor be less familiar with they 
 i thank my hon friend for the powerful way he be introduce his bill my constituent steph be just year old and be a mam to little girl she be diagnose with grade glioblastoma know as astrocytoma on her birthday last year for month prior to her diagnosis she be treat for migraine by her gp steph know that she be not suffer from migraine yet she be rudely dismiss by an a&e doctor and feel nobody be listen to she steph have since have brain surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy my hon friend know that early diagnosis and treatment be vital can he assure steph and her family and i that the bill will help to raise awareness across the medical profession of rare brain cancer 
 absolutely last week i attend a reception for the eve appeal i be really strike by the fact that early diagnosis be a big feature of what the charity be talk about and i will come on to that in just a 
 as a consequence of the lack of recognition of the symptom of rare cancer too many people be diagnose too late last week at an event host by the brain tumour charity i meet gabrielle and her wife and child gabrielle tell i how the neurologist to whom she be initially refer do not recognise her brain tumour symptom and tell she instead to go home breathe into a paper bag and get some counselling if only cure brain tumour be so easy reflect on the comment make by my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck an observation that i have make on this journey be that so many of the people who have talk about late diagnosis have be woman that be purely anecdotal but it seem to be the case when i be at the eve appeal reception the point be make that so many woman be turn away the gp tell they that they be hormonal premenstrual or premenopausal 
 my hon friend be make an incredibly important point with which many across the chamber will agree the statistic be particularly stark for woman from black asian and minority ethnic background they be even more likely to be dismiss 
 i thank my hon friend and office neighbour for make that point which be also make by eve appeal i can not remember the statistic but there be a stark difference i talk about this issue when i meet the minister yesterday and she gently point out to i that it be not just in healthcare where woman be dismiss as hormonal premenstrual and so on i thank she for remind i of that in the gentle possible way 
 it be a cruel irony that rare cancer such as gabrielle ’s tumour be typically less survivable make early diagnosis even more important rare cancer patient require early not later diagnosis i have speak about poor outcome lack of progress in develop treatment and late diagnosis my bill focus on the point but i want to acknowledge the need to improve diagnosis because of comment that have already be make i be sure that will feature in the cancer plan 
 i be the to admit that when i be successful in the private member ’s bill ballot i find it daunt as a new mp i think i have some really good idea for a bill but as soon as my ping pong ball be pick from the goldfish bowl i be inundate with call from constituent charity and lobbyist each tell i that their cause be well than any i could think of i consider many worthwhile cause over the follow day but while have a coffee in colinton mains tesco in edinburgh south west i receive email from member of the public who support the campaign of my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh just last week i meet oriana of the people who email i it be incredibly move to meet she it take i right back to the start of this journey i post on my facebook page about meet she and straight away somebody say that they know she and that she have help they when their family have be face with glioblastoma that be a reminder that so many people affect by these condition turn their loss into something really positive and help other people 
 my hon friend ’s campaign relate to glioblastoma a type of tumour that take my father in law i feel that the star have align for i i really do mean that i really do get that feeling i want to pay tribute to my hon friend hon member hear hear more more i know she to be a formidable woman who in this context be drive by glioblastoma take her sister margaret i do not know her sister at all which be my loss but i do know that she shape my party and she help change our country for the well and i know above all that she be love by her sister 
 glioblastoma be typical of so many rare cancer and it start i on this journey so i want to talk about it far my father in law ivor hutchison be a dignified man but glioblastoma do not respect that he be a technical teacher at bell baxter high school in fife he be married to sylvia and they have daughter denise iona my lovely wife audrey who be in the gallery i have just embarrass she and sarah in time ivor and sylvia have grandchild andrew our daughter ruth hannah matthew our son ben rory and sophie ivor be not a passive grandfather he work hard to ensure his grandchild flourish 
 in september ivor begin have problem with his speech my wife audrey an nhs nurse be concerned that it might be a sign of dementia we all hop that that be not the case follow an mri scan in the november we receive the devastating news that ivor have glioblastoma at christmas he be still very much himself and enjoy the festivity ivor never have a pound of fat on he but when it come to christmas time he really do hoover up the food and enjoy the christmas meal it be great to see he that christmas but we do feel that it would be his last once we enter the new year he begin to lose his mobility and eventually   he be admit to adamson hospital in cupar in surround by his wife and daughter ivor die peacefully month after his symptom he have a good life and his daughter be a fantastic legacy to he as well as all the pupil he teach at school 
 however as a physically fit man ivor should have live long he should have live to see his birthday last weekend and if he have do so he would not have miss of his grandchild get marry and his great grandchild fraya be bear in december last year i assume that he have be unlucky with glioblastoma it be not until i meet my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden that i learn that only of glioblastoma patient live beyond month after diagnosis and only in survive beyond year despite that awful prognosis as for other rare cancer the drug to treat glioblastoma have not change in decade that be why i know in my heart that i need to introduce a bill that would help equip those work hard to fight against glioblastoma and all rare cancer with the tool they need to further their effort and ultimately save life 
 over the past year thank to the dedicated work of charity survivor and researcher we have see a rise in survival rate for those diagnose with cancer globally new treatment be be develop and roll out to patient improve outcome and save life in our nhs every single day however rare cancer patient be be leave behind and i need to explain why it be not due to a lack of effort by charity or those affect by the disease in fact in the gallery today be member of some incredible charity who be fight against rare cancer in what be often an uphill battle i thank they for their hard work in help i to develop the bill they really have help i which aim to address the injustice face by rare cancer patient and their family for all the people i have meet from the charity their work be much more than a job for they it be about make a difference to people ’s life improve survivability and support family 
 the reason for the uphill battle be that research into rare cancer be much less appealing to pharmaceutical company when compare with more common condition with small patient population there be an increase logistical challenge in bring patient together currently we be lack a sufficient development strategy and there be no single source of patient datum mean company must undertake the costly endeavour of find patient and verify eligibility even if they succeed in run a clinical trial and a drug prove to be an effective treatment company face the challenge of sell a drug develop at great expense to a small market ultimately these company exist to return a profit for their shareholder give a choice between investment in potential treatment for a rare cancer or a more a common too often rare cancer patient lose out 
 have set out the challenge face by those diagnose with rare cancer let i now address what the bill aim to accomplish i will list key measure and explain their impact appoint a name responsible lead for the delivery of rare cancer research create a single registry of rare cancer trial create a single registry of rare cancer patient available for trial and define an evidence base for repurpose new cancer treatment let i explain in turn why these be important 
 the bill would place a duty on the secretary of state to facilitate and promote research relate to rare cancer patient the appointment of a national specialty lead for rare cancer in the national institute of health and care research would provide the secretary of state with advice on the design and planning of research to facilitate collaboration between relevant party that will ensure co ordination and accountability for the delivery of new cancer research in the uk 
 secondly the bill would increase access to clinical trial via a service tailor to rare cancer patient through the secretary of state ’s new duty that would be accomplish as part of the exist be part of research registry ensure that all trial be register in a single place 
 thirdly charity and clinician tell i that more trial would be attract to the uk if we have easy access to patient cohort establish a single database of willing patient would remove a significant burden on researcher in find and verify eligible people for clinical trial 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on introduce a bill on this important subject he mention research can he explain why the extent of clause and be limit to england and wales what be happen in scotland in relation to the research issue 
 the challenge be devolution i be a huge fan of devolution but often the uk be at its good when it work together particularly on healthcare i hope that in time we will see progress and the nation will work together i do not want to overstate this but there have be discussion across the uk about how we could work together on the issue so perhaps the answer be watch this space 
 the bill ’s measure be to trigger a review by the government of the orphan drug regulation to examine how they can be reform to well incentivise pharmaceutical company to invest in clinical trial for rare cancer specifically it will consider how incentive could be provide to pharmaceutical company to trial the repurposing of new cancer treatment we often hear about how drug development for cancer can be use to defeat another that be what kira rely on right now my bill aim to build a foundation for industrialise that approach via incentive the eu have a similar system for incentivise the testing of drug for paediatric use that have already be approve for adult use so the approach have be try and test 
 together these measure will ensure that we have leadership in government and will remove the barrier to run new clinical trial that researcher and pharmaceutical company face 
 i thank my hon friend for the powerful way in which he be introduce the bill will he recognise the work of pioneer team such as the at charing cross hospital under imperial college healthcare nhs trust where professor michael seckl be lead the way in groundbreake treatment for and research on gestational trophoblastic disease and germ cell tumour do he agree that those centre need support to expand and share their research finding with the rest of the nhs 
 absolutely there be fantastic expertise in our university across the uk as i say that i have to refer hon member to my register interest because of my connection with the university sector there be much more that we can do to attract the good researcher to the uk and build capacity in uk university 
 the bill will provide great accountability for the delivery of new research but please do not just take my word for it brain tumour research have describe it as 
 essential for a brain tumour cure 
 i do not feel any pressure at all when i read that quote no it be quite daunt to be honest the less survivable cancers taskforce say that the bill 
 could be a truly transformative moment in the uk ’s approach to research for rare and less common cancer 
 my friend at the brain tumour charity say that the bill 
 be a framework for tangible impactful change 
 at this point i have to mention my daughter ’s connection with the brain tumour charity she be run a marathon in may to raise funding for it and i wish she well hon member hear hear thank you 
 let i list some of the other group that support the bill they include pancreatic cancer uk which have be absolutely fantastic in its support for what we be do cancer52 an organisation that represent more than group the angel mums the grace kelly childhood cancer trust and the inflammatory breast cancer network uk inflammatory breast cancer account for of breast cancer diagnosis in the uk each year but of the death 
 the bill be also support by target ovarian cancer brainstrust ammf the cholangiocarcinoma charity the urology foundation the tessa jowell brain cancer mission action kidney cancer and sarcoma uk which i meet this week i have a friend with that cancer and it be a fantastic organisation that i hope to work more with in the future 
 it be support by maggie ’s shine cancer support solving kids cancer the british liver trust blood cancer uk radiotherapy uk leukaemia uk cclg the children and young people ’s cancer association cll support neuroblastoma uk salivary gland cancer uk neuroendocrine cancer uk melanoma focus myeloma uk hope for tomorrow alike yorkshire cancer research young live vs cancer the tessa jowell foundation the uk mastocytosis support group the bone cancer research trust the neurosciences foundation and the eve appeal 
 the eve appeal have a fantastic reception last week and when i go along to it have its support feel like a real tipping point in the progress we be make in build support for the bill it be great to see the minister as well and i have to say this be not a trivial point that the cake there be absolutely fantastic i do not doubt that when i get back to my office and check my email more organisation will have get in touch to say that they want to support what we be do today 
 i know that many member in the chamber today will have deeply personal story to tell on their own behalf and on behalf of their constituent i look forward to hear those testimony as we debate this bill because it be so important to give those people a voice i will conclude by say that the bill we be debate    today have a real chance of make a difference for too long rare cancer patient have be leave on the sideline without significant advancement this can not go on tilly and ivor deserve a well chance of beat the cancer inside they and those who be yet to be diagnose deserve a well chance of a full life let we pass this bill today and work across the uk to take the fight to rare cancer and save life i commend this bill to the house 
 rise 
 before i call the speaker i be aware that this be a very personal debate for some member so please feel free to leave the chamber if you need to let ’s look after each other today 
 i congratulate   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur both on his good fortune in be draw in the private member ’s bill ballot and on his wisdom in pick this very important issue to take forward have be similarly lucky in be draw in that ballot a few week after i be elect nearly a decade ago i know the barrage of call and email that suddenly come your way the very sudden and slightly fleeting popularity that come from come towards the top of the private member ’s bill ballot and the very many very worthy cause and campaign that come your way for you to choose between the hon gentleman could not have pick a well cause than the represent by this bill and if he be never again quite as popular as he be in the few hour after the publication of the ballot result i know that he would willingly exchange all of that popularity in an instant for the difference that this legislation can make to so many life across the country if and when it be pass and implement as we hope it will be 
 i stand today not just as a member of this house but as a friend who be deeply move by the pain of see someone i care about someone who have become like family struggle against an insidious disease this bill be not just another piece of legislation it be a cry for help it be a plea for those who be fight for their life a lifeline for family who be watch their love one slip away bit by bit and day after day too often those diagnose with rare cancer be leave strand in a system that do not have the answer they need 
 we know the wonder that pharmaceutical company can do in drug development but the horrible truth be that few people be able or willing to invest the enormous amount of money need to take forward drug development know that about in drug candidate make it to market for condition that will require that drug or time a year at most 
 do the hon gentleman agree that there be a whole range of new modern immunotherapy drug that could be use on these cancer they already exist they be use to treat other people but they be simply not try the cost of those trial be not overwhelming and we can do they and the nhs repurposing project should be do they 
 the hon lady be obviously right and i know that she approach this subject with tragically a huge amount of personal experience we have already see drug in some case long market drug be apply for new purpose and new condition without those costly clinical trial they will not be license or approve for prescription and that be why the bill be so important clinical trial be sadly a distant hope for far too many currently and many patient be leave with the crush gut wrench word there be nothing more we can do those word can be a death sentence but they do not have to be not if we act 
 many members and house staff will know my senior parliamentary assistant and dear friend dan horrocks he be well know as the owner of bella his therapy shih tzu who he have while he be be treat for his brain tumour and who be often see roam around the palace and parliament street dan have work for i since i be elect in but he be not just my senior parliamentary assistant he have become like family he be a father a husband and a time cancer survivor for year he have fight this monster each time feel the ground slip more from under he as his option narrow leave he and his family with ever reduce hope we have see he face unimaginable pain i have watch he endure brain surgery and radiotherapy and see the fear in his eye each time the disease come back and he hear his doctor tell he that they do not know how much more his body can take and whether he can be put through that next course of radiotherapy 
 dan ’s journey start with something as simple as headache as the hon member for edinburgh south west refer to in another case that no thought be serious at the time as a teenager gps all misdiagnose that tumour and for unknown reason the gps do not want to send dan for a scan a simple scan to check that there be no malign cause would have identify those tumour month early it be a free voucher for an eye test that save dan ’s life because it be not until by sheer luck an optician notice something wrong in his eye that anyone realise the nightmare he be live that optician save his life 
 what follow have be nothing short of a nightmare brain tumour surgery radiotherapy and the heart wrench hope that every treatment might be the last only for the disease to rear its ugly head again now the cancer have spread to his spine his doctor and consultant have no answer his option be dwindle yet dan ’s fight be far from over because dan be not just fight for himself but for his year old son elijah who deserve to grow up with his father by his side cheer he on at his football match and guide he through life ’s milestone 
 dan dream of walk his son to school every day and of be there for every moment that really matter whether it be his graduation or his wedding the moment that every parent should have the chance to see he be fight with his wife sonia who have be his rock through all of this sonia have stay by his side through every hospital visit through every sleepless night and through every moment of doubt and fear together they have dream of a life grow old together of watch their child grow up and of building memory that will last forever but that future be slip away that be why we be here today to ensure that no parent no family   no child have to face the horror of rare cancer without hope this bill be not just about change law or regulation it be about give family like dan ’s a fighting chance it mandate a review of the orphan drug regulation to ensure that rare cancer get the investment they so desperately need create the national specialty lead to drive research and innovation and establish a registry service to help to connect patient to the clinical trial that really could save their life 
 this bill give hope a real chance for family who be face the unimaginable i stand here today with a heart full of hope but also with a heavy heart because i know that time be not on their side dan do not have the luxury of wait his family do not have the luxury of wait no diagnose with rare cancer have that luxury that be why this bill be so very urgent we spend a lot of time in this chamber talk about politic but this be not about politic it be about real people like dan who desperately need our help 
 cancer do not care about politic it do not care what background we come from our age or gender or what party we belong to it strike indiscriminately it take what it want and it leave devastation in its wake that be why we must respond with urgency with compassion and most importantly with action i strongly support this bill and i urge all hon member here today to stand with we to stand with the family cling to the hope that there be something more we can do and to stand with those like dan who be fight for more time for more moment for more chance to hold their love one close the cost of inaction be measure not just in money but in precious life lose let we pass this bill let we give people like dan and his family the hope they so desperately need let we give they a future a future that be still within reach 
 i rise to speak about a bill that will increase research funding focus on more effective treatment for rare form of cancer i thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for introduce the bill 
 like many in this house i rise today because i have lose a family member to a rare cancer and i also rise as a member of the health and social care committee in the last parliament the committee conduct a future cancer inquiry which recommend that 
 the uk should be lead on drive up international action to tackle the poor outcome for the least survivable and least common cancer 
 this bill will do that but as i say my reason for speak in this debate be much more personal on   january   this year my brother alex english pass away from high grade acinic cell carcinoma a form of salivary gland cancer i tell his story to highlight what we can win because this bill can give family the gift of more time with the special people they love 
 increasingly more common cancer be treatable or be illness that people can live with but on rare cancer we still have a way to go and without focus we will not get any far there be more than diagnosis of various form of salivary gland cancer each year but my search for related term in hansard find only mention in this chamber in the past year my hon   friend have just make the of those mention be from i follow my brother ’s death that be why we need more focus 
 in evidence to that select committee inquiry cancer52 note that while they represent of diagnosis of less common cancer rare cancer account for of death member across this house have our own cancer journey ourselves our friend or our loved one and i want to talk about my brother ’s journey not all cancer journey have the outcome that we want and even with this bill we will still lose some people but more investment into research for rare cancer can give we something crucial time i would do anything for more time with my brother 
 if you will indulge i madam deputy speaker i would like to talk for a minute about the person who alex be   the most important thing about alex be not how he die it be how he live and the mark he leave on the world he fit a lot into year a lot of we think that our eld sibling be rock star but in my brother ’s case that be literally true the band he join at university call pure tour with band like soundgarden and reach the top in japan 
 i have always be tremendously proud to call he my brother i be proud of the horse draw narrowboat company he run in hebden bridge which form part of many people ’s happy childhood memory and of his subsequent time at the national trust where he help property to become profitable work to restore nature and work with local authority his last major project be create woodland near lunt in liverpool but most of all i be proud of the person he be he be always funny he have a surreal wit he be unfailingly kind and the sort of non toxic model of masculinity that the world need more of i remember the humour and love in the good man ’s speech he give for i and i will never not be sorry that i have write eulogy for my brother but never a good man ’s speech 
 while prepare for christmas in i get a call from alex and he ask if i have a minute to talk which be unlike he because he would not generally be over serious he say he have a lump on the side of his face that be in his word unsightly but not overly concern it might have be cancer but there be a number of other thing that it could have be and if it be cancer it be likely to be a very treatable form he instruct i to be aware of it but not make a big deal of it because typically he do not want to worry our mum later it transpire that it be acinic cell carcinoma but the prognosis be good and they be go to operate the cancer continue to grow his operation take hour the thing about alex ’s tumour be that the version of the illness he have be high grade which mean that it mutate fast it be something that have only be identify in about case and which no doubt could have be identify early have we know more about cancer like his 
 last spring in my mum ’s garden during a hush conversation with a different family member to the side they tell i that alex might only have month to live i hug my year old son who be play in the garden unaware because i be try not to make a big deal of it but sometimes you need to hug someone    every update get bad until i take a day off during the election campaign to visit he at the christie hospital because his lung have collapse 
 then because it be never a straight line his health improve he get to sit up there in the gallery to watch my maiden speech in parliament we go to a pixies concert together at the piece hall in halifax then he get bad madam deputy speaker and on christmas eve last year he be hospitalise again when he return home we know he be come home to die i can not say enough about his wonderful friend particularly matt and sarah and my incredible family who care for he at the end all of we would have spend more time at his bedside if we could because time with people you love be a privilege 
 that be what this bill be about give people more time with those they love perhaps even a full lifetime together in case where the cancer be bad and it can not be treat or cure it be about give people more time well health and an understanding of the journey that they be on it be about give people more special moment be it a pixies concert or read a story to a child alex read the good story and time to organise what you leave behind people who develop cancer that be rare still matter and they still deserve more time the work to help people like alex in the future must start today 
 the government have a renew emphasis on tackle rare cancer in memory of the sister of my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   and of tessa jowell and for countless other campaigner include those in the gallery what we need be focus and determination to respond quickly i thank the house for indulge i today let we be that world leader that be so desperately need in tackle rare cancer let we give family special time with those they love the most let we pass this bill 
 i thank   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for bring the bill before the house and pay tribute to he and to the hon member who have already speak so movingly on this subject include   the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn i also pay tribute to   the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   for her tireless advocacy 
 the many form of cancer categorise as rare accord to the bill might each strike a small number of people but take together rare cancer make up almost in of all cancer diagnosis each incident each diagnosis each prognosis have the same devastating impact on family throughout the country my own be no exception my brother in law group captain pip harding who be be diagnose with stage glioblastoma this time last year at the time he be serve in the royal air force with the us indo pacific command of his many tour include in afghanistan and iraq he be give to month to live for his wife claire and his child the news change everything 
 in september i join pip his family and over other love one at raf benson in oxfordshire for what be call a dining out or farewell ceremony an event to allow everyone to be together with pip potentially for last time you can imagine how difficult yet how   move that be a few week later pip be lucky enough to come across the pioneer brain surgeon dr paul mulholland who have be trialle a treatment call oncothermia this employ radio frequency to target and heat malignant cancer tumour cell while avoid healthy cell oncothermia be not currently available on the nhs and each hour treatment cost £ a tumour like pip ’s require session 
 for most people indeed for almost all of we that kind of money and consequently that course of care be out of reach but the friend and family who attend pip ’s farewell dinner set up a gofundme page which be now cover the cost of the treatment we love pip which be why we all put in as much as we could to fund it cancer like this with a brutal and bleak prognosis bring people together to fight it i want the government to share that resolve since start the monthly oncothermia session in december the mri scan show that pip ’s brain tumour have reduce in size from cm to cm pip be thank god still alive and watch today european study now suggest that oncothermia can extend life for to year for pip ’s child that time be everything 
 but that be not the whole of my experience with glioblastoma in my husband john ’s good friend ian die from the disease his widow nicola be in the gallery almost unbelievably nicola ’s sister karen who have do so much to help nicola through the loss of ian be herself diagnose with a stage glioblastoma last year and die a few month later 
 i know that other in the chamber and in the gallery have have their life touch by glioblastoma too i be sure they will agree that in the past decade there have be an unacceptable lack of progress make on this disease a lack of progress in develop new treatment make they widely accessible and keep those diagnose with glioblastoma here with their love one in the past year cancer survival rate in the uk have double whereas in the 1970 only of those diagnose be expect to live year today over half do that be a record of staggering success and represent countless life extend make rich and full and even save when it come to glioblastoma however there be far less to celebrate the chance of live a decade with the disease be in the gain in life expectancy over recent decade can be measure in month precious yes but not nearly enough 
 glioblastoma be a rare cancer but also an exceptionally lethal brain tumour be the big cancer killer of child and of adult under the age of yet in recent year glioblastoma have be apportion only around to of uk cancer funding in to honour dame tessa jowell the government announce a doubling of funding for research into brain tumour but year later it be widely report that less than half of the pledge £ have actually be spend during each of those year as funding be be delay and sluggishly deploy more than people in the uk be diagnose with glioblastoma will the government update the house on how the remain fund have be and be be spend will the minister assure i that as the national cancer plan be develop alongside the nhs year plan deliberate and specific consideration will be give to glioblastomas 
 the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency incentivise research on orphan drug grant exclusivity for manufacturer and make it cheap to bring drug to market once they be develop but clearly when it come to glioblastomas it have not have adequate success 
 i have be to see the mhra numerous time and have ask about repurpose drug many pharmaceutical company be worried about repurpose drug the fear be that if glioblastoma research be to affect the main cause for have the drug that might make the drug less successful we have beseech the mhra to treat glioblastoma separately would the hon lady support such a move 
 i would of course support such a move and i urge the government to listen and take action 
 get it right on glioblastoma be vital despite minor breakthrough exciting innovation and apparently promise research lead for this disease there have simply not be the improvement in survival rate that most cancer have have to put it bluntly glioblastoma remain a death sentence an increasingly common in the uk cancer diagnosis have increase but although there be some worrying sub theme this trend be largely due to increase life expectancy however that be not the case with glioblastoma in the past year rate in the uk have more than double there have be far more of an uptick than be attributable to we all live long more people be develop this disease yet we have fail to make meaningful stride on treatment and cure or even on give those with glioblastoma a little more time with those dearest to they now be the moment to do something about that 
 i welcome the bill i welcome its emphasis on improve research i have already touch on drug development and the provision to facilitate clinical trial because the grim reality be that for glioblastoma those trial be hard to conduct there be too few patient and frequently their life expectancy be too limited anything that can be do to connect eligible patient with researcher fast and with less friction be valuable 
 i emphasise that there be great opportunity in front of we for accelerate research and make broad advance in the battle against rare cancer along with almost half my parliamentary colleague i be proud to have pledge my support for the lobular moon shot project which advocate a boost of around £ over year for research on the basic biology of invasive lobular breast cancer with a view to develop new treatment despite be the most common form of breast cancer lobular breast cancer be in many way treat like a rare cancer it be under research difficult to diagnose through the standard screening mammogram and often present few symptom than invasive ductal carcinoma which make up the overwhelming majority of breast cancer incident 
 as the hon lady be explain very well invasive lobular breast cancer be not class as a rare cancer i be concerned that it would not come within the scope of this bill so i   gently ask if it could be widen at the next stage as she say lobular breast cancer have many characteristic of a rare cancer 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that intervention yes lobular breast cancer be treat in many way like a rare disease 
 i recently meet my constituent kate who be diagnose with lobular breast cancer in she explain to i that because almost all breast cancer research be base on the ductal variant woman like she be diagnose later and often receive treatment orient towards a cancer with a different biology from lobular cancer those factor result in high recurrence and low survival rate kate have be in remission for more than a year and have become an advocate for research on her behalf i ask the minister whether she have meet with the lobular moon shot campaigner what step be the government take to increase research into the cancer what consideration have she give to update guideline for the national institute for health and care excellence to encourage the use of mri to diagnose lobular breast cancer early 
 the moon shot idea be the right in fight cancer we should set ambitious goal and we should innovate until we meet they moreover as the apollo project show research into seemingly narrow thing often have spillover effect produce vast unanticipated benefit that be often true when it come to orphan drug to take just example gleevec have change the game and not just for rare form of leukaemia it be now use to treat a range of other cancer and condition 
 the british pharmaceutical development sector be exceptionally strong and now be a moment of potential on genome mapping artificial intelligence biotech immunotherapy and cancer vaccine the uk be in a position to transform and save life i recognise the limited scope of the bill but i believe it to be vital this house must take a keen interest in accelerate and incentivise research into rare cancer include glioblastoma this legislation meaningfully advance that goal 
 i will speak briefly about young people and child and specifically a lovely girl call maddie cowey at the age of maddie be diagnose with an alveolar soft part sarcoma sarcoma be an uncommon cancer that can occur anywhere in the body all cancer in someone of maddie ’s age be consider rare but in her case the classification be ultra rare partly in consequence it take month for she to receive a diagnosis maddie have just start university she recall that at the time it 
 feel like my life be fall apart in many way it be and it do it be a very lonely place 
 maddie be diagnose almost year ago now there be no approve treatment for maddie ’s type of rare cancer and she be undergo a clinical trial it be likely that she will remain on treatment for life maddie be amazing she be brave and she will not let cancer define she i bring up her story because cancer in young people be so uncommon that often it be diagnose later neither medical professional nor young people expect it but the later a diagnosis come the more likely the   cancer be to be lethal what step be the government take to ensure that the rare cancer afflict young people be catch early 
 finally i be remind of something that emily dickinson once write about hope 
 i ’ve hear it in the chill land and on the strange sea 
 we must get this right we must give sufferer hope we owe that to pip ’s family his wife claire and his child and to nicola in the gallery and she and ian ’s son adam and oliver and to so many other who have suffer and who be here with we i believe that we can 
 through you madam deputy speaker i want to apologise to the young black man on the northern line tube from colliers wood this morning for have to spend his journey look at i sob my heart out it must have be a very odd experience i want to say to he i be not just sad i be angry i be angry at the nhs i be angry at the mhra i be angry beyond belief at the national institute for health research it should be rename the national institute for something that do not do very much at great public expense 
 all these institution be bedevil by the desire to carry on do what they have always do it do not get they sack as the former home secretary john reid lord reid constantly tell i siobhan nobody ever get sack for continue to do the same thing you be only sack if you do something different my god have this morning not tell we that we need to do something different we have the tool to do something different but the people in position of power and responsibility choose not to we have the good health system in the world for potential drug trial a uniform system with well train doctor great scientist great university and great hospital but do we do they no do we fail people every single day yes do we threaten those doctor who try to do something different let i tell the house groundbreake oncologist be look over their shoulder wait for the regulator to come and get they when of their colleague grass they up that be the atmosphere in our intellectual and health service institution 
 i could feel sorry for myself and for my loss but i do not want that i want thing to change all of we from all party need to run fast and break thing and provide a challenge to the people run our system we have a drug repurposing project in the most universal health system in the world so why be we not repurpose drug for people with rare cancer why be that not be do for glioblastoma why be it that in may we will open a drug trial at university college london and university college london hospitals trust in margaret ’s memory to trial such drug that have be in the system for year we organise a dinner with former prime minister tony blair some run marathon and other sell cake and scone in beautiful cornwall village do those thing give we a great deal but why under our system do we have to do they 
 why be it that the trial in may under the amazing paul mulholland will be base in only trust it be because if we have negotiate with all the other hospital trust that be expert in this field it would have take   we year to get start why be we outstrip by israel spain america and any number of country it be because we can not get our act together to start a trial as each hospital trust be argue about and seek to renegotiate every trial and every plan 
 this be not new the issue be raise by lord o’shaughnessy in his great report on clinical trial that report be year old but we have make no progress we make no progress under the former conservative government and we have make no progress under our government the £ give to the national institute for health and care research in for glioblastoma and brain cancer drug trial have not be spend can any member of the house explain to i how that be humanly possible do we not have drug that we could trial yes of course we do trial be not that complicated we can do they if we choose to we have the doctor to do they we need to want to change 
 i apologise to the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for west lancashire ashley dalton because when she come to talk to i in the tea room this morning she get this at a very fast pace i have now meet wonderful cancer minister conservative and labour they have all be dedicate and all want to sort this out but we can not do this by edict or by hop and wish unless we change thing and unless i dare say some people be remove it will never happen all the institution i mention continue to exist because they do not do thing differently 
 someone diagnose with a glioblastoma will get the same treatment that they would have get year ago they will have their tumour remove they will be delighted that it be go but it be not go it be come back they will be give week radiotherapy it be brutal it will help they for a while but the tumour will come back then they get give chemotherapy the drug be temozolomide which be approve at the beginning of the 2000s it will help but the tumour will come back they have to be able to withstand that drug themselves 
 margaret could not do that by march month on from her diagnosis she could not take it her kidney collapse what happen then we have money and good friend at this point i would like publicly to thank lord waheed alli for the kindness and friendship he show we through margaret ’s journey the treatment that he have experience from the press be absolutely appalling he help we on our way but what about somebody with no money who can not fundraise their life end at the chemotherapy there be nothing on the nhs but those lucky enough to have the money can find a way 
 i be really grateful that the brother in law of   the hon member for esher and walton monica harding   be on the oncotherapy machine my sister fundraise for that machine because we have to go to dusseldorf to have it so we bring it here it be great that he be receive much benefit from it i know that many other people be too 
 why be the nhs which be so risk averse that it will not allow slightly alternative therapy for cancer happy for people who be really ill to get on a plane and go to a different country be it because it do not see what happen in another country so that be okay i have tell    the story of hold my sister ’s head as she be sick in a bucket in terminal at heathrow airport of carry she on to a plane in the hope that the air stewardess would not see how she be of lie next to she overnight hop that she would be alive in the morning because what be i go to do in a hotel in germany where i could not speak that language that be my experience but i be only of thousand and thousand of people who do this every year include child because our system will not allow the use of novel treatment 
 why why can not we change thing why do n’t we get up every single day and want to cure something i do not know about other hon member but since i join the labour party and since i become an mp in i have get up every day and hop that we could make thing well in some way i do not understand why our system do not want to do the same thing i want to understand but it be beyond i if there be drug that could cure or give long life to people with glioblastoma why do n’t we trial they that be not beyond our ability we have the money to do it if we do not have the money we will raise it we just need the opportunity 
 i do not know why we do not have that wish to achieve i be give some hope yesterday by the propose abolition of nhs england because something need to change i do not know whether that be the right or wrong thing to do but we need to liberate people to do thing let we face it in the end only people who be well motivated and willing to take a risk can change thing beyond that people will continue to die will continue have to go to other country will continue have to spend large amount of money people not lucky enough to be in that position will just die prematurely 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for introduce the bill and for the courtesy he have always show i which must have be difficult at time as i sit shout at he in portcullis house about how everything be useless and hopeless in my calm moment i understand that progress begin with small step i be frustrate that those step be too small i be delighted that there will be database for trial but if there be no trial the database do not get we very far 
 we will have a report on the orphan drug act in month time in that period over people will have be diagnose with a glioblastoma and many of they will have die why be it go to take we month why can not we change thing now why in spite of the huge support we have have for the bill from the secretary of state for health could we not get something much more fierce in it it be not a criticism it be an observation i know progress begin slowly and i be grateful for my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west take up the bill and for have the calm demeanour that i lack because i do not think the whips would have accept anything that i would have come up with as a private member ’s bill 
 we need a revolutionary attitude we either see and harness progress or we come back next year the year after and the year after that to ask why there have be no progress all of we individually and communally need to dedicate ourselves to that progress and to keep ask the question be angry and simply refuse to accept that nothing can be do 
 i thank the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton because i have enjoy work with they on the bill we all have our own story i should state my personal interest my sister georgie be sit in the gallery she be diagnose with a gbm glioblastoma multiforme nearly year ago i would like to say that she be alive and well but let i just say that she be alive and she be do well she have be brave determined and an inspiration to we all it be particularly painful as she be a mother of a wife a daughter and a sister we have a lot to focus on and it be on we collectively 
 i will not rehash too much and i will try to resist have a cry f but it might be difficult our action and what we do as a team be what we will be judge on i be go to throw it over to the labour side a little because they be in government now and they have more power than we do in opposition when we leave the chamber today i ask each government mp to ask okay what be we actually go to do the talk in this chamber be nice but it be the action that count 
 i will pick up on point the be the trial register we have hand experience with georgie of try to find what trial be out there obviously there be not enough trial we know that and that be something we need to fix also match patient with trial be not rocket science that be a basic thing i would also encourage the government rather than just start from scratch and take month to reinvent the wheel to find out what be go on in the private sector and what trial and register of people seek trial be already out there and to build on that if there be a partnership with some company that be fine but let we move quickly because speed really count 
 the point be about orphan drug regulation a key trigger for i get into politic be brexit i think it be a disastrous idea and i still do i struggle to find any possible gain from brexit but there be thing that we could do the eu have regulation on orphan drug our could be more generous we could pull research into the uk by give patent for a few extra year which would encourage people to dig into the research in these critical area i live in hope of that potential gain 
 even if product be obtain reimbursement have to be accessible on the nhs which be far from certain ensure that there be a robust timely and accessible route to make these drug available on the nhs for patient really count it be critical that that do not fall off the radar also we be really fall behind in the number of clinical researcher active in the uk today if we want to get this research move we must think about what we be do to get clinical researcher work hard in this space and in other because we be not do a good enough job on that 
 that be all i will say let i just return to my point we need action it be good to have those in the gallery here today 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for bring the bill to the house and join   he in pay tribute to our hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   for her campaigning and for her powerful speech call for a revolution in attitude i also thank my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   for his very moving speech as somebody who lose a brother much too young i be deeply move by his word 
 i have come here today to speak on behalf of my constituent katie swinburne she be a much love school teacher in fact she be the school teacher of of my staff and a mother of who be diagnose with invasive lobular breast cancer as be mention a moment ago lobular breast cancer be not class as a rare cancer in fact it be the most common type of breast cancer in the world with diagnosis annually in the uk alone but it share many characteristic of rare cancer in the sense that it be very difficult to detect in katie ’s case as in many other it do not initially form as a lump in the breast for example it have distinct genetic so be not detectable in genetic test and it be very easily miss in mammogram and ultrasound 
 as a consequence many of the woman who get this form of cancer will not be diagnose until long after it have already spread i be also tell thankfully katie be watch today i receive a whatsapp message from she a moment before speak that a key point that i should make to the minister be that because lobular breast cancer present differently from other form of breast cancer and be not separate out in clinical trial there be very little trial datum on it i meet recently on zoom with katie and other who have be campaign for the moonshot this be not a lot of money it be simply £ of funding that the university of manchester could use to well understand the biological architecture of this type of cancer that would lead to the possibility of develop the right treatment because it currently have no specific treatment this be a gentle request really that in the next stage of the bill lobular breast cancer be consider alongside the rare cancer for which it already provide 
 i finish by pay tribute to katie and all the many brave individual i have meet i can not imagine what it be like to be young and have parenting responsibility and be diagnose with an advanced stage of cancer many of those campaign know that they might not live to see the day when the well drug and treatment be available but they be bravely take up this cause on behalf of those who come after they 
 katie be bravely do a mile a day sponsor walk my predecessor in this place join she on of those mile and although we disagree about many thing politically we have already see today that this be a cause that unite because there be little in fact there be nothing more precious in life for any of we than time spend with the people we love money can not buy that nothing can buy that and as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden make clear the decision we make in this place can have a real impact in the life of other 
 i have to say madam deputy speaker that as i be wait to speak i be very pleased that you do not call i after   the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   because   i do not think i would have be able to get through part of my speech so shortly after listen to his story he do really well 
 i be diagnose with breast cancer in which be relatively unusual for a man and the hard thing i ever have to do be tell my daughter who be and at the time about my diagnosis it be an experience that leave i wonder if our family of be about to become a family of i have to explain to all of they that i would have an operation to remove a tumour and i might need another as thing turn out my cancer have spread and i do need to have another operation i also have to say that i would need chemotherapy and radiotherapy and that that be go to take month out of our life not just mine but the life of my immediate family my wide family and our friend 
 i consider myself very lucky that my treatment pathway be relatively clear but that be not the case for many rare cancer the reach of cancer be an evil that be grow across our society with nearly in of we project to get cancer in our lifetime mean we all know someone close to we whether family or friend who will begin what can be a very traumatic journey it be a fight that cause your life to be take completely out of your hand and that leave family force to hear rarely use term like malignant or metastasise as if they be common expression cloud the horror of medical jargon 
 it be with these word that i be proud to associate myself with   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur and i congratulate he on his campaign that demand well for cancer patient and especially on bring forward the rare cancers bill because it be a powerful and necessary step forward to end the experience that i describe at the beginning of my speech 
 rare cancer be often under research and the regulatory environment simply fail to cope with they they have small patient population which make research and investment less appealing and an evidence base hard to achieve where clinical trial be take place patient often do not know very much about they a cancer52 survey of rare cancer patient find that cite not know about trial as the main barrier to access the trial in the place the bill seek to rectify those flaw in our system and i would like to highlight the power it contain to ensure that patient can get well access and find relevant clinical trial as be highlight in the teenage cancer trust ’s improve young people ’s access to cancer clinical trials report it be also difficult for the clinical trial lead themselves to find the necessary patient mean that they struggle to recruit both patient and researcher want to be in those clinical trial but the system do not allow for that common sense join up 
 i hope that as a result of the change make by the bill people in my constituency of wokingham and across england will begin to see a shift towards prioritise rare cancer because such a shift be long overdue last week i meet a constituent to discuss his wife ’s cancer she have leiomyosarcoma which have an incidence rate of case per people annually in the uk he explain to i that of the potential treatment option for his wife be exploit fault in the brca2 gene through parp inhibitor however with an estimate new case of leiomyosarcoma every year and only   with the brca2 mutation there be too few patient to allow for a sufficient clinical trial and therefore nice do not license those drug for that particular cancer 
 what be the minister ’s view on effort within the european union ’s life science industry to develop clear guidance to make cross border clinical trial easy if that be to happen it would address of the major problem with rare cancer such as leiomyosarcoma individual nation may not have a sufficient pool of patient to conduct a clinical trial but multiple nation work together could do the minister see cross nation trial as have great potential for development in oncology if the eu be to advance easy cross border co operation would that be something that the united kingdom could potentially negotiate its way into this be no time for a government to be isolationist 
 my constituent also highlight that parp inhibitor be available in the united states what effort be the minister make to ask that if drug be approve by the united states food and drug administration nice have the opportunity to take the us evidence into account when consider whether to approve licence for drug in the uk 
 sarcoma be just tumour type that have poor survival outcome and limited treatment option despite the investment by charity such as sarcoma uk to fund research into new treatment we do not know enough about the disease because so few people be affect other constituent have write in to share their experience of lose love one to brain tumour such as glioblastomas and to blood cancer all have express hope that this bill will create a world in which we can well encourage pharmaceutical company to run trial on rare cancer in order to create innovative new treatment so that the pain they go through will not be a fate that other must endure in future 
 before i conclude it would be a miss opportunity if i do not ask the minister about the national cancer strategy which will be so important in ensure that a long term plan be in place to deliver well service for patient with rare and less common cancer the nhs need to be prepare for the innovation of the future by prepare for an increase in demand for companion diagnostic the turnaround time for exist test be already cause delay in optimal treatment what step be the minister take to ensure that there be enough capacity for the ever increase demand for diagnostic test 
 the national cancer strategy need to be thoroughly scrutinise before its final draft be publish to ensure that the measure demand by cancer charity and patient group and idea from by the life science sector be properly cover nhs performance must be measure regularly over the lifetime of the strategy to see if improvement be actually be make will the minister explain what accountability mechanism be be consider for the national cancer strategy 
 i thank the hon member for edinburgh south west once again for bring the bill to the house 
 i rise to support my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur i know he have put a huge amount of effort into bring   the bill before the house in collaboration with many other include patient family professional and charity i send my condolence to he his wife and family on the death of his father in law and to tilly ’s family to lose a child be unbearable and against the natural order of thing 
 the bill be much need and i welcome the opportunity to make some observation about it before i do so i refer to my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   and his brother i live in the area of lunt that he refer to where there be go to be a remarkable legacy for his brother the area have be rewilde and there will be a forest there in due course which be absolutely fantastic i invite he and his family to come down i will show they around and they can see the legacy that his brother have leave we 
 i also want to refer to comment make by the chief executive officer of the brain tumour charity dr michele afif about the context of the bill and why it be before the house in an online article last month she write 
 during my clinical career i be frequently move by the courage and determination of my patient and their family 
 it behove all of we to support the endeavour of my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west to help those people who do not have a voice as dr afif say by give our unambiguous backing to what she call a bill of hope 
 we must ensure that that hope be turn into reality that be the job of every member in the chamber we owe it to those affect by rare cancer to champion their need treatment and life the propose legislation would be a starting point a base it will enable and facilitate the promotion of research into rare cancer and well access to clinical trial as have be say and initiate a review of marketing authorisation for so call orphan product which i will explore in more detail 
 it be devastating to have a cancer diagnosis we all know family member who have be diagnose with form or another the shock and trauma that come with such news be hard to take in as   the hon member for wokingham clive jones   say but then to find out subsequently that the spectrum of intervention with medicine or other ally intervention be limited because of the rare nature of a particular cancer surely add to that distress and worry as   the hon member for esher and walton monica harding   and my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   say with glioblastoma question inevitably sweep through the mind of those affect as to whether an appropriate medicinal intervention be available or even on the horizon 
 orphan product be those drug that be use to treat not only rare cancer but other rare disease the pharmaceutical industry be reluctant to develop the drug because of the cost time and effort when they will not be commercially productive give the number of people who will use they the fact that these potentially lifesaving or life change drug be not produce leave a significant lacuna in the treatment option for those with rare cancer although there be a public health need of that there be absolutely no doubt there be no resource to enable that lacuna to be fill that resource should be make available 
 i be therefore pleased that clause of the bill will place a duty on the secretary of state for health and social care to undertake a review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for potential orphan medicine i note that the bill will require an assessment of regulatory approach in other country which be also welcome that be an excellent and much need step in the right direction link in with the other requirement in the bill relate to research programme and initiative it send a clear and unambiguous message to those affect and those who will be affect that could be anybody in this chamber and as we have hear it be some people in this chamber that the government have hear what they have say and be not only listen to that message and that plea but be take practical action to put it into effect which be more than welcome 
 other country have introduce similar legislation in this respect the provision in clause 1(2 will help to form a more progressive informed approach and its requirement will enable information practice and protocol from other jurisdiction to be harvest for example genetic alliance uk point out that there be as many as rare disease possibly more affect in people with approve treatment available for only in rare disease more generally although those be not significant cohort of people per se in a particular disease category collectively million of people be affect in fashion or another by a rare disease include rare cancer and it be no less the case for rare cancer a disease be a disease and those affect by it whether it be rare or not be entitle to equity of care and intervention 
 in this case such potential intervention can not simply be leave to market arrangement that be why it be important to facilitate a more comprehensive approach to the development of orphan medicine which must be set against the context of for example a survey of orphan medicine that receive eu approval between and of those orphan medicine be make available in england compare with in germany in italy in france and in spain while those medicine do not specifically relate to cancer that help to contextualise the difference in number for orphan medicine 
 a research programme between and at the university of sheffield fund by the wellcome trust indicate 
 furthermore only a of eu authorise orphan drug be recommend by nice thus the medical need of uk rare disease patient be potentially underserve compare to both the usa and eu 
 indeed the programme be call the orphanisation project clearly as the university put it there be a 
 major international debate currently ongoing about how we might improve patient access to orphan drug raise important question about how to value these medicine and the ethic of resource allocation 
 the project set out a path for be creative in progress the relatively new concept of orphanisation 
 as a way of understand contemporary change in the biopharmaceutical sector specifically the project examine the extent to which orphanisation occur in the eu uk and usa 
 and seek to understand how it be inform by 
 different technology institution and actor address the implication for industry health policy and patient 
 i look forward to the progress that it will make   i believe that the proposal in the bill will help they follow through systemically and consistently to change that scenario for the well international exploration and comparison be method to inform decision maker about how they can be more proactive in facilitate access to medicine for those most in need of they especially when the size and extent of the available medicinal range be limited that be often the case with the rare cancer we be talk about and rare disease more generally 
 once again i thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west for enable the house to debate this issue and for the opportunity to tease out many of the issue affect our constituent and as i refer to early to discuss crucial lifesaving and life enhance treatment for disease more generally 
 i again pay tribute to all those colleague who have bring their story and their experience to we today include my hon friend the members for calder valley and for mitcham and morden the hon member for wokingham and for witney charlie maynard and other they deserve our admiration and thank but more importantly they need our support to get the job do that point have be make by so many such exposition however painful for the members concern bring home the real need for this house to act on this issue which be literally a matter of life and death finally i look forward to see the bill progress through the house in the come week as no doubt do many other i thank you madam deputy speaker for your indulgence 
 i be here today to support the rare cancers bill a vital piece of legislation introduce by our hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur i begin by pay tribute to his father in law and all those who have share their story here today 
 my hon friend ’s story like so many be a stark reminder of how aggressive and under research cancer can be leave patient with little or no hope it be assume that rare cancer as have be mention today affect a low number of people but that be not the case cancer research uk say that rare and less common cancer account for of all uk cancer diagnosis and of all cancer relate death some of rare cancer patient be never even consult about join a clinical trial that mean that while each individual rare cancer may affect relatively few people together they make up almost half of cancer case yet the funding and research remain disproportionately low 
 i will briefly mention charlie shrager of my constituent in gravesham like so many she be fight cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer it be a supposedly rare but devastating form of liver cancer and there be rise incidence in out of people be diagnose with it in it be some of these patient be diagnose at stage or stage mean that their likelihood of survival be limited histotripsy be a non invasive treatment that use sonic beam therapy it be incredible the problem be that we do not have a machine in the uk they cost £ and let we   get here because for people face this disease or pancreatic cancer it be a lifesaver and they desperately need it as charlie put it 
 i be lucky enough to afford treatment abroad but i know many who be n’t they do not have that option why should their chance depend on their bank balance 
 we must recognise that rare do not mean insignificant people across the uk be battle cancer that remain underfunded under research and underserve by clinical trial which be criminal it be a pattern that be repeat again and again with bile duct cancer glioblastoma leiomyosarcoma a rare soft tissue cancer that demand personalise medicine pancreatic cancer and blood cancer each of these cancer devastate live we have discuss what the bill can do appoint a national specialty lead for rare cancer review and improve the uk ’s orphan drug regulation and improve data sharing 
 as a research scientist in biochemistry i work on neglect infectious disease and come across the drug for neglected diseases initiative it be launch year ago to co ordinate research outcome negotiate with big pharma and test drug that have be develop for other neglect disease and it be now eliminate disease across the globe it can be do we have the blueprint so i urge the minister to reach out to that initiative to see what we can learn and implement here 
 for too long rare and neglect cancer have mean a rare chance of survival and that must change give the strength of feeling among everybody here there be the will to bring about change i look forward to see the bill go forward and to see that people be not leave behind and that we find a cure for everybody 
 we have already hear so much move and powerful testimony in this debate but despite the tragic impact that rare cancer have on people across the uk they garner too little attention be under research and lack investment in their treatment though cancer survival rate rise by nearly between and rare cancer still have some of the low survival rate leave too many people without hope 
 i thank   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for introduce this bill i will argue in favour of it today use example the story of a constituent suffering from a rare cancer secondly the importance of this bill for extremely rare cancer and lastly its importance for future research 
 there be many rare form of cancer that individual suffer often without specialised treatment or public awareness but every rare cancer patient have a name and a story take that of a constituent i recently meet in parliament at an event for world cancer day who suffer from t cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia although the year survival rate for leukaemia currently stand at the figure for acute myeloid leukaemia a rare and aggressive form be of the low of all cancer it have a survival rate beyond year after diagnosis this mean that sadly nearly of those diagnose with aml today will not survive until the end of this parliament surgery be not a viable treatment option for those diagnose with leukaemia so such patient often depend on the discovery of new and innovative treatment to survive the disease 
 though every cancer have a name and a story some be so rare that there be little representation of they even in debate like this that bring i to my example composite hemangioendothelioma or che it be medically identify in only and by have few than case report in english language literature because of its rarity it be hard to treat and garner little attention from company that could develop treatment however those affect by che have name family and story hopefully my mention che in this debate may in a small way help raise awareness of its existence this bill will assist we in this matter as it will result in the appointment of a name person who be responsible for oversee the delivery of research into rare cancer treatment that will facilitate some political accountability for rare cancer research and encourage an ecosystem that can hopefully lead to future treatment for or at least more attention to even some of the rare cancer such as che 
 talk of treatment early this week i meet a constituent who be a researcher at the university of glasgow she be in parliament for the stem for britain exhibition we discuss her research on a novel approach to treat osteosarcoma although it be the most common primary bone cancer only people be diagnose with osteosarcoma each year in the uk few than people in every of the population make it a rare cancer under the bill current treatment lack specificity in target the tumour and often have unwanted side effect my constituent ’s research look at the potential use of small molecule to create a more effective and non invasive treatment for osteosarcoma the bill ’s support for information sharing in the research registry system will help researcher like my constituent it will help with research and clinical trial by give researcher great access to the patient population with rare cancer like osteosarcoma a patient survey in find that of those with a rare or less common cancer be not offer a clinical trial that be why the bill be important 
 the bill will help to foster an environment in which there can be more research and clinical trial on rare cancer such as osteosarcoma for patient like my constituent suffering from t cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia for those diagnose with the least understand cancer and for the researcher try to find new treatment the bill represent a commitment to the fight against rare cancer i therefore urge the house to support my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west and the bill today 
 those of we who have lose a friend or a family member to cancer will no doubt have hear they describe often i think somewhat unhelpfully as courageous but this morning we witness the most courageous exposition i have ever hear in my life from my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn i thank he for the privilege of allow we to listen to his love tribute to his brother we also hear from a number of member include the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood and for witney charlie maynard and most forcefully my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain   mcdonagh about the pressure of time and the urgent need to do something to find a cure or treatment for rare cancer we have hear a number of move speech this morning but i will allow hon member to relax and recharge their emotional battery a little bit because i will address the issue of time and the practical consideration of how we can turn drug discovery into treatment as speedily as possible to do that i will lift the lid on our drug supply chain and set out the vital role that the nhs can play in it 
 there be lesson we can learn from the covid pandemic when it come to the drug supply chain we very quickly develop a vaccine in the uk in oxford but we see quite quickly that the vaccine be worth nothing until it be in the arm of the population get that do require a big effort include in industry as we hear from my hon friend   the member for gravesham dr sullivan industry be also important the fujifilm factory in billingham in my constituency manufacture of the covid vaccine and it will shortly turn billingham into the large biopharmaceutical manufacturing centre in the uk when it be make the vaccine it find that it have a big problem this bring into play another town just up the river tees from billingham in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth member may have hear of it it become famous for a particular reason during the pandemic but they may not be sight on the reason why i will talk about it which have more to do with glass than glass barnard castle be home to glaxosmithkline which bottle the vaccine there be at the time a global shortage of bottle for vaccine and in the uk we have only glass manufacturer capable of do that job although soon there will be another in st helens 
 hopefully after that little overview member can sense that there be a big industrial supply chain issue that we need to address before we can get treatment to the people who need they most in fact there be a number of researcher work on this area i be sure that when we think of research into rare cancer we think of people in white coat and laboratory in place like oxford cambridge and imperial but i urge we to also think about the process operator in billingham the bottle filler in barnard castle and the furnace operator in place like glass futures in st helens who be also work hard on research project to deliver those treatment 
 the issue that i would like we to consider be the role that the nhs can and must play i want to see a transformatively different approach from the nhs in this area a month ago in parliament i meet representative of pancreatic cancer uk which i know support the bill they talk to i about pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy which be a treatment for pancreatic cancer and about the difficulty in source sufficient quantity of treatment we all know from our constituency surgery that there be the same issue with common drug people suffer with other condition and people who have child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so on be struggle to get the drug that they need 
 part of the issue be that we rely so much on import we could be manufacture these product in the uk the nhs be the single big purchaser of drug in the world it have the market power to demand that production    be centre in the uk that would bring clear economic benefit to the uk but it would also shorten cycle time for innovation because the researcher and the manufacturer would be close to another and it would ensure security of supply in the uk it would mean that we could be proud of manufacture drug that help to treat people around the world it would also fit in with our industrial strategy my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care be talk only yesterday about the importance of life science to our industrial strategy and about their create british job in research and in factory 
 i very much thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for introduce the bill he describe his father in law as a dignified man my hon friend give an incredibly dignified speech and i be sure that his father in law will be very proud we look forward to the day when people who suffer from rare cancer be not offer such treatment as breathe into a brown paper bag as my hon friend describe or take a paracetamol as my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck   describe instead we should use the power of our nhs and the efficiency of our uk supply chain to turn discovery into drug and trial into lifesave treatment 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for introduce the bill 
 i remember the day my dad be diagnose with terminal cancer i remember my mum and dad pick i up off the floor i be suppose to be support they but that do not happen that day dr lau at blackpool victoria hospital explain that my dad ’s cancer be terminal my dad be initially give chemotherapy to try to shrink the tumour and give we more time later he be ask to take part in a trial use immunotherapy it be explain that the immune system do not recognise cancer as alien and as a threat immunotherapy teach the immune system to recognise cancer and enable the body ’s immune system to fight back 
 my dad be a fighter and he be willing to try anything his body struggle with chemotherapy and after we nearly lose he twice in month it be stop but the immunotherapy continue he finish the course without any complication once my dad start the treatment the cancer there be many never move to this day we do not know whether the treatment cure he and he be leave with just scar tissue or whether the cancer lie dormant what i can tell the house be that my dad do not die of cancer it be something else that take he from we 
 my family believe that we be give an extra year of love and be love by my lovely dad because of immunotherapy we will always be grateful for the christmas day the birthday the celebration and sometimes the tear that we be all able to share with my wonderful care dad
