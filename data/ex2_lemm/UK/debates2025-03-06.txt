my hon friend be also a so i congratulate she on that and yes i absolutely agree with she on that point 
 on average we will all live to see christmas the thing be what be we go to do with they some people in the world be act like they will live forever god i hope we do not and i know that that will not be the case but some pass through the world leave it just as they find it our job in parliament be to change the world for the well we need to leave an indelible footprint by ensure that the world protect all woman not just straight white woman we should start with the gay woman the black woman and the disabled woman if we protect those we will protect all woman and the world will be a well place

 i want to end with a cold reality check in malcolm gladwell ’s brilliant book the tipping point and in his follow up book revenge of the tipping point he talk about the law of the very few the overstory and the counterfactual line what would have happen if we be slowly win the war on highlight violence against woman and girl highlight injustice and highlight discrimination but we do not appreciate the honest conversation that we need to have around how epidemic work or appreciate the power of group proportion 
 we be fool ourselves if we think that we bear no responsibility for this epidemic of violence against woman and girl epidemic have rule and they have boundary they be subject to overstorie and we in society be in a position of power to create those overstorie these overstorie change in size and shape when they reach a tipping point and it be possible to know when we be reach that tipping point we be currently at that tipping point when it come to violence against woman and girl 
 the opioid crisis in the us be a lesson for we all most of the medical profession act professionally but a tiny fraction just a few do not and that be enough to fuel an opioid epidemic in the us that tiny fraction be drive by a certain class of people and those people can be identify the tool need to control an epidemic be right in front of we they be sit on the table and we can either grab those tool or let the unscrupulous people grab they if we grab they we can build a well world 
 we need to take action and have an honest conversation we need to ensure that organisation that believe in fair pay get the procurement contract we need to be mindful about the social medium platform that we use and we need to elect people who care for many people not just the by do that we will accelerate action which be the theme of international women ’s day this year

 the cabinet secretary may be ask by the prime minister to advise on any matter support the smooth running of government include ministerial appointment there be no write or publish guidance on such matter 
 we have strengthen the ministerial code but we do not need to take any advice from the conservatives what we have see from this prime minister be decisive action to uphold ministerial standard compare that with the record of the previous government where the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel be find guilty of bullying but be allow to keep she post where the government whip their mp to block the suspension of former minister owen paterson who break lobbying rule and where the former prime minister boris johnson lie about be tell of allegation of sexual misconduct by his deputy chief whip

 the threat of flooding be ever present in carlisle and although i and other local resident regularly receive flood alert they do not necessarily distinguish between a threat to life and a regular flood alert could the minister please explain at what point flood alert be update to reflect the seriousness of an emergency alert 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue the environment agency be responsible for issue flood warning for location cover by severe flood warning the environment agency may ask for an emergency alert to be activate where there be an immediate threat to life in order to support the response in the local area 
 i thank the minister for her response it be good that we have this system right across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and that all our constituent can respond to it it have a very clear role how quickly can there be a response to thing such as domestic abuse flood warning or whatever secondly my understanding be that council have a role to play if so perhaps the minister could remind we of their role

 we have be absolutely clear that there be huge opportunity for ai to support the public sector to well personalise service and save money but we have to keep up with the speed of innovation in how we buy i have hear from sme specialise in ai and digital transformation that the way we be do procurement be too slow and too inflexible to keep up with that pace that be why i be work with the minister for ai and digital government my hon friend   the member for enfield north feryal clark to set up a new digital commercial centre for excellence to make sure that that change and that we have the good innovation from my hon friend ’s constituency and across the country in government

 as soon as i see my hon friend ’s name on the order paper i know that he would mention bus because he have never miss an opportunity to raise this critical issue with i the government be absolutely committed to support the uk ’s domestic bus manufacturing industry and ensure that the procurement system recognise the high standard and quality of uk manufacturer the new national procurement policy statement align with our industrial strategy and push we to maximise spend with sme as a result contract authority across the country must now consider how their procurement strategy can support the industrial strategy include the bus manufacturing strategy

 the new npps specifically ask contract authority to maximise spend with voluntary sector organisation and we will be introduce target for government on spend with voluntary sector organisation and social enterprise the government have listen to concern from local authority and be work to implement change to allow they to reserve competition for low value contract for local organisation

 i very much welcome these question i could happily speak about procurement all day because it be absolutely critical for deliver the government ’s mission the procurement act remove some of these challenge but we need to do more that be why we be set ambitious and stretch target for direct spend on sme and have ask official to review our framework contract in particular to ensure that they be more accessible to sme the challenge raise by business in my hon friend ’s constituency be the same as those i have hear describe by sme across the country our procurement be too complex and too slow and it need to change we need to get that £ into real job and sme in our community

 i welcome the minister ’s progress in this area i visit ibca on   january   and be impress by the professionalism of the team since then the minister have make himself accessible so that i can give he feedback issue that have come up be the need for recipient of payment to sign non disclosure agreement or term i be anxious that misunderstanding do not arise as a consequence of that can the minister   use his good office to implore ibca to explain why that happen if ibca can not do that perhaps he can explain to the house why such agreement might be necessary 
 i be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his work as paymaster general indeed i be pleased to facilitate his recent visit to ibca and be grateful to he for the constructive approach that he continue to take on the specific issue that he raise around the contract that ibca have enter into i can say that i entirely agree with he about the need for transparency and that be something that i be re emphasise to ibca

 palmerston say that this country have no eternal ally and no perpetual enemy only interest which be eternal and perpetual do the minister agree that it be in our eternal interest for there to be security in europe and a sovereign ukraine will he congratulate the prime minister on his statesmanship and leadership at this dangerous moment

 last week i be in ukraine where follow trump ’s betrayal the need for european solidarity to defend our democracy have never be more evident the unintended consequence of brexit for our economy and our security be certainly very real it be increasingly obvious that the uk can not afford the luxury of splendid isolation in the spirit of nothing be off the table will the minister ’s department start a discussion in government about the uk move to customs union and single market membership the close and the quick we align with our european partner the safe we will all be 
 i always think the snp ’s policy be of splendid isolation but that be certainly not the uk government ’s policy indeed we be work very closely with our european partner that be precisely the leadership that the prime minister have be show in the past week

 we appear regrettably to be witness the start of a global trade war over the past week the united states have place tariff on some of its major trading partner and they have retaliate in kind the president have say that he intend to place tariff of on eu good soon should that happen it be highly likely that the eu will respond 
 even if the united kingdom be to avoid tariff the consequence for northern ireland could be particularly complex what conversation have the paymaster general have with his european counterpart to ensure that northern ireland be not catch in the crossfire of a trade war 
 we have a strong and proud tradition over century of free trade here in the united kingdom and we will continue to make the case for that with regard to our specific trading relationship with the united states the hon gentleman will have see that after conversation between the prime minister and the president in the oval office last thursday we wish to deepen our trading relationship with the united states specifically on northern ireland i completely understand his point and we will continue to monitor the impact of any such policy on northern ireland 
 i be grateful to the paymaster general for his response but it sound as though he have not yet have any conversation with his eu counterpart on the issue i appreciate that he have a meeting on   may but i be sure he will understand that tariff may come much soon than that that be the case will he undertake to talk to his european counterpart and secondly to come and give a statement to this house as soon as he have do so so that we can understand that the government be prepare for such an eventuality can he also make it clear to our friend in europe that should trade and manufacturing be disrupt in northern ireland we will not hesitate to use our power under article of the windsor framework to protect business there 
 to reassure the hon gentleman the windsor framework taskforce be base in the cabinet office and i regularly discuss issue on northern ireland with my european counterpart i can assure he that i will speak to maroš šefčovič on a number of occasion prior to   may i hope the hon gentleman will take that reassurance he should also be reassure that we will of course always act in the good interest of the people of northern ireland

 the position of the government be unchanged we have no plan for a youth mobility scheme we will of course always listen to sensible proposal from the eu but they have to be within our red line of no return to freedom of movement no return to the single market and no return to the custom union

 my hon friend be absolutely right the additional resource for the nhs be only make possible by the budget propose by my right hon friend the chancellor back in october my hon friend be also right to say that as more money go into the nhs there be a duty to ensure that that be match by reform the year health plan will set out how we will deliver an nhs by create a reformed and modern health service to ensure that the extra investment result in fast and more convenient treatment for patient because that be what we all want to see 
 over the last year my camborne redruth and hayle constituency have see child poverty rise a of secondary school child be now persistently absent from school educational attainment be below the national average and life expectancy have actually fall those be year of abject failure for which my constituent will never forgive the conservative party do the minister agree that the true test of success of our plan for change and a decade of renewal should be measure in the positive change to the life of our poor community

 we have strengthen the ministerial code but we do not need to take any advice from the conservatives what we have see from this prime minister be decisive action to uphold ministerial standard compare that with the record of the previous government where the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel be find guilty of bullying but be allow to keep she post where the government whip their mp to block the suspension of former minister owen paterson who break lobbying rule and where the former prime minister boris johnson lie about be tell of allegation of sexual misconduct by his deputy chief whip

 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last cabinet office question new procurement rule have come into force which will help to deliver growth drive value for money and crucially give small business great access to the nearly £ of government procurement they also include strong new power to exclude and debar supplier on national security and performance ground we be also seek out and reduce wasteful spending include by use artificial intelligence to go through departmental spending line by line because it be important that taxpayer fund be use for good public service outcome we be see the initial fruit of that in the reduction in nhs waiting list for year

 name official include special adviser 
 this government promise great transparency why be they break another promise 
 special adviser be appoint by the minister whom they advise and the line of accountability be through ministers to parliament that be why the prime minister take question every week at this dispatch box the national security adviser be an adviser to the prime minister and as i say i be also very happy as be other ministers i imagine to appear before the committee at a convenient time

 the right hon gentleman have great experience in this area and i respect his judgment very much he will also have see the world rapidly change before our eye in recent week the leadership task when the world be change so fast be to understand the change respond to it and explain it i believe that in the decision the prime minister have take in this area in recent week he have fulfil those obligation in full and in a way that this house be proud of 
 follow the recent announcement that the smedley hydro government site in my constituency will close in the year to come will the minister work with i to ensure that the hundred of job currently base there be relocate at a new site also in the constituency 
 i know how hard my hon friend work for his constituency and i very much understand his concern my understanding be that there be no change expect at the smedley hydro site in the instance the government property agency be actively work with the home office and nhs digital to understand the future workforce requirement but i would welcome a conversation to discuss that far 
 we have already hear about the cyber attack on public body across this country will the cabinet office ensure that full guideline be give to every government department about the procurement of software and the need for security software to be keep up to date the people who attack we be rapidly improve their capability and we must be on top of it 
 the hon member be absolutely right the people who be attack we be try constantly to probe our defence and as i have say a few time in the past hour this be therefore a constant challenge it be a combination of hardware software and good practice and that apply to central government local government public body and crucially business it be a national effort to protect the business that we do and the process that we take for grant every day

 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for read my speech so closely but what he have misunderstood be that the team be on the ground and the process be to learn every week i be glad to report that i have already visit a couple of those area and good work be under way the whole point be that this will develop it will adapt and perhaps it will be different from the record of the conservative party which see a growth of public official over the last

 the york central development site be pivotal in drive forward york and north yorkshire ’s economy and at the heart of that site will be a government hub will the minister meet i to ensure that that hub be not separate from the rest of the site but integrate in the economic vision that we have for york 
 it be critical that government property and government asset support economic growth in constituency include that of my hon friend and i would be delighted to meet she to discuss that far

 local people across my constituency have say how much they value and welcome the vast investment that we have see in our public service from our nhs to our school and beyond will the minister please set out what step be also be take to reform our public service work with other cabinet colleague 
 as i have say a few time this morning reform be important particularly when the taxpayer be be ask to put in extra investment that be true in school as well as in the nhs because we want to ensure that teacher can do what they want to do which be teach child in the classroom that be also why the good start in life be of the target in the government ’s plan for change which be publish in december 
 during their month in government what assessment have the ministerial team make of the productivity of the civil service what measure be they put in place to improve it and will the minister report back to the house 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for the work that he do on public sector productivity it be probably essential give that in the year between and the previous government employ    an extra civil servant so it be quite right that we look at the productivity for the extra employment sanction by the last government 
 do the minister have an appetite for a policy of like for like retaliation when a cyber attack by a hostile state be confirm 
 i have both appetite and full faith in our excellent intelligence and security service who protect we every day 
 that complete question after jim shannon 
 the good be always last 
 what assessment have the minister make of the volume of apprenticeship offer within the cyber security industry specifically in relation to digital software and hack prevention online

 mr speaker may i associate myself very strongly with your kind remark about peter hipkins and his service to this house 
 we join all colleague in celebration of international women ’s day this saturday i be sure the whole house will also share my deep concern at the late news in relation to ukraine and will wish to send all of our good wish to the prime minister and other european leader in do everything they can to support that country 
 it be now month or so since i become shadow leader of the house and i be sad to say that these joyous thursday morning session seem to have fall into a little bit of a rut interruption no no i hear you cry business question be still as fresh lively and engaging as they ever be if not more so but sadly i fear that be not true it be our function on the   opposition benches to press public concern and raise question about the government indeed as his majesty ’s loyal opposition it be not only our function but our constitutional duty to do so it be the government ’s job to respond to those question and concern and in   so do to make the case publicly for the policy choice and decision they have make and to say whether they have an underlie strategy 
 unfortunately as you will have notice mr speaker the government be not do that in our session in fact the leader of the house rarely if ever respond to the important public question and concern that i raise instead i be sorry to say that we get the same endlessly reheat mishmash of standard party political line personal jibe and irrelevant comment 
 hon member will recall that i raise this issue at business question on   december when i highlight a series of occasion on which the leader have be unwilling to answer or even address some obvious example of government economic incompetence as i point out 
 many different response be open to she she could have say i agree with you official report   december vol c. 
 she could have say the shadow leader be wrong for the follow reason or even i do n’t know if she do not want to respond at that time she could have say as so many other ministers do i will look into it i will reply to you or i will ask a colleague to investigate and respond we just hear the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say those thing 
 in fact on none of those occasion do the leader of the house bother to give any kind of proper answer at all instead her approach be to change the subject and attack the previous government rather than to defend the record of her own government which be after all the whole point of these exchange more troubling still be that she herself have so often call for transparency from ministers and that a failure to be accountable   be itself a breach of the rule of this house of the nolan principle and of the ministerial code of conduct 
 i wish i could report that anything have change since december if anything however i be afraid that matter have get bad a recent low point be at business question on   february when i raise important issue relate to the government ’s approach to the rule of law include the potential clash between domestic and international law the level of risk that the government seek to take and their attitude towards judicial review i be sorry to say that the leader of the house do not bother to respond to any of those question instead we have yet another series of irrelevant political attack 
 we need a well way to track and monitor those evasion so in the spirit of openness and transparency i propose a new approach which we can call leader ’s bingo colleague get a point every time the leader of the house blame the previous government attack member of the opposition change the subject or use the word gently remind take no lecture or similar in her response i would not for suggest that colleague shout bingo in the chamber but there may be other way in which they can indicate when they have fill their card 
 that be a light hearted suggestion but it have a serious purpose i know how strongly you mr speaker feel about the importance of parliamentary accountability transparency and the proper scrutiny of government decision i ask the leader of the house again if she will reaffirm her commitment to those value and engage properly with the question i ask in the future 
 i join you mr speaker in pass on our condolence to the family of peter hipkins who give long service in this house 
 i also wish peace and blessing to those observe ramadan and those mark lent today be also world book day a day to celebrate our favourite book and author and i have to say every work parent ’s bad nightmare because of have to find a last minute costume i see that the shadow leader of the house have come as his favourite author himself for those who have not read the thrill historical novel the winding stair it be still available in all good bookshop he can give i some royalty later 
 saturday mark international women ’s day i thank you mr speaker for allow we to come together in this chamber and take a historic photograph to mark the most female mps ever be elect to this house it be a reminder that the gender pay gap in this country be still and woman work for free on average week a year although perhaps the shadow leader of the house be work for free most of the time 
 i thank the shadow leader of the house for his comment on ukraine it have be really important to this country ’s international role and in support the prime minister that the house of commons have once again show such unity and such backing for ukraine and for the prime minister ’s leadership in recent week as the shadow leader of the house know we be focus on make sure that ukraine be in the strong possible position to achieve long term last peace through strength as we have do in recent week we will make sure that the house be keep constantly update on these matter 
 that be kind of where it end today mr speaker the shadow leader of the house have again use his slot to ask i not a single question he say that i have not give he any answer in any of the week that we have be stand at the dispatch box but if he really want i to tell he again today where he have go wrong i be happy to give he some advice i be happy to tell he that yes his government do get many thing wrong and we be get many thing right if the shadow leader of the house want to play business question bingo perhaps we can start by say bingo every time he actually ask i a question because we do not hear much of that today 
 there be lot of people in the chamber for business question today so i will not detain the house for much long but i notice that the shadow leader of the house do not ask i about some of the really good thing that the government have be do here at home as well as abroad as there be a lot of people here today i remind the house that we have confirm the school that will receive free breakfast club because we do not want any child to start school hungry we be end the am scramble in our gp surgery with more appointment and well access we have launch our fantastic commonhold white paper which be another step towards finally end the feudal leasehold system and we be deal with the court backlog that the shadow leader of the house ’s government leave we with another shameful reminder of their shocking record on criminal justice we have also announce our plan for neighbourhood with another £ to help restore pride in our community that be on top of the additional amendment to our employment rights bill 
 unlike the shadow leader of the house ’s vacuous contribution today this government be get on with deliver for the country whether at home or abroad 
 flooding have cause heartache for family and community in my constituency in order to be protect from extreme flooding they desperately need sheffield city council ’s excellent proposal for the upper don flood alleviation scheme include work on the clough dike culvert and whitley brook improvement despite widespread local support and the importance of that scheme the conservatives never actually allocate funding to it will the leader of the house allow time to debate flood alleviation scheme to ensure that the appropriate funding be allocate in the forthcoming spending review

 it have be draw to my attention this week that there be a continue problem in this country with a reserved matter the supply of drug a year old constituent of mine who be an elite athlete and unfortunately have inoperable brain tumour come to i to say that drug inhibitor that would help he be currently on open access trial in this country unfortunately the health board in my constituency be not take part so drug that could save his life and allow he to continue with his ambition be available but he can not access they would the leader of the house either consider have a debate on how we make access to drug on trial universal across the uk or set up a meeting for i with the relevant minister to discuss this issue 
 i be really sorry to hear about the hon lady ’s constituent and i be very familiar with these issue unfortunately my gorgeous cousin recently die of a brain tumour and it be a terrible illness it be something that i have personally speak to the health secretary about there be drug that could be make more available and there be trial the health secretary be commit to do that and my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   have be campaign on these issue for a number of year i will absolutely ensure that the hon lady get a meeting with the relevant minister

 absolutely my hon friend can hear from the cheer across the house that this would make a very popular and important debate it would be a reminder that our armed service have go to many country around the world in support of our ally over many year and sacrifice their life and we should always remember their bravery and their contribution 
 i assume that the leader of the house share my constituent alarm that a court find that a convict   drug dealer who be here illegally could not be deport because he be too westernised that prolific offender include domestic abuser be as i understand it go to be offer anger management course rather than be incarcerate and most of all that the new sentencing guideline suggest that judge should look at felon ethnicity and religion before sentencing will she allow a debate on criminal justice to enable we to expose the huge gulf between the liberal bourgeoisie ’s prejudice and those of our constituent who want people catch capture convict and punish regardless of whether they be black brown white or any other colour 
 i think the right hon member be talk about deport criminal when they should be deport he will be aware or should be aware that nearly foreign criminal have be deport since the election which be an increase of more than compare with situation under the last government however he be right to point out that there be still gap in that system which be why we have bring in the border security asylum and immigration bill the bill will strengthen power to tackle illegal migration and the small boat and enable the government to pick up the pace even far on return those who have no right to be here 
 in a series of hard hit article in the herald and the evening times recently the current condition of my home city of glasgow be review and issue as diverse as pothole in partick and poverty in drumchapel as well as the state of the public realm be raise after year of the tories in westminster of the snp at holyrood and of an snp green administration in glasgow the city be in need of a new vision do the leader of the house agree that join a city pact as suggest by andy burnham be a sensible suggestion and how do she think the government could support that ambition and the ambition of all of we who have the good interest of glaswegians and glasgow at heart 
 i be sure my hon friend can appreciate that i as a mancunian agree with all of andy burnham ’s suggestion nearly all of the time anyway and this sound like a very good however she make the big point that the scottish government along with the previous conservative government here in westminster have fail the scottish people that be why people vote overwhelmingly for a fresh start with labour at the general election and i be sure that will continue 
 woman be be force to face significant risk in order to be inclusive man must not be allow access to woman only space regardless of whether they believe themselves to be a woman they be not we must prioritise safety over inclusivity dignity over wokery reality over ideology will the leader of the house commit to a debate in government time on protect woman only space and woman only service 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question the equality act which be bring in by a labour government be absolutely clear on the provision of woman only space and that they be to be   protect especially where they be need we be proud to have bring in the act and we stand by it i be sure he would have want to say in his question that the labour party have do more to support woman to close the gender gap to reduce inequality and to tackle violence against woman and girl than perhaps his party or the conservative party 
 the b23 postcode in my constituency have experience a troubling surge in knife relate offence the west midland violence reduction unit have be instrumental in address the issue engage with over young people and contribute to a reduction in youth violence involve knife between april and september however the violence reduction unit depend on short term annual funding which restrict its capacity for long term strategic planning will the leader of the house schedule a debate in this chamber to discuss the incredible work of violence reduction unit and explore the long term funding arrangement for these organisation 
 absolutely my hon friend raise a really important issue the government be determined to tackle knife crime she be right that this be a long term strategy it be about prevention and support organisation like the she mention and establish organisation such as young futures and the coalition to tackle knife crime which the prime minister bring together as well as take the step we be already take to ban the sale of knife and to pass other measure that be in the forthcoming crime and policing bill she will note that there be a debate on this matter in week time in the chamber 
 last week i attend the thrive youth café hold at all saints church in huntingdon the café run on mondays and fridays after school richard and ruth who run the space say that it provide a safe space and a listen ear as well as pool table tennis and a playstation crucially it provide opportunity for young people to access support from local youth worker funding for the thrive youth café be precarious with grant allow the project to exist only in monthly cycle and it desperately need long term funding guarantee will the leader of the house make time in the schedule to celebrate the value that such provision bring to teenager and young people and can i invite she to the youth café to try of its now infamous oreo milkshake
