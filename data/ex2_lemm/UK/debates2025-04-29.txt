as another member of this house who vote in to recognise the state of palestine in a motion that this house pass i will say that progress on this matter be long overdue i hope the minister have hear loud and clear the message from many of we that continue to delay that be problematic 
 the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne   might be surprised that i agree with he there be a concern about what will be leave of the state of palestine despite the existence of theogenic technology israeli force be now burn to the ground the agricultural field in northern gaza in apparent pursuit of the tunnel that hamas be use for their terrorist attack we know that nearly child in gaza have be diagnose as suffer from acute malnutrition we all desperately want to see aid resume to palestine because we know that there be no future for any state if people be starve to death will the minister update we on the practical detail he discuss last night with the palestinian authority about how we will get food back into gaza and get movement in this process 
 just for the record in case hansard do not pick that up that be jenny the dog cross the floor not a member of parliament 
 i be sure   the hon member for torbay steve darling   be grateful to you for that clarification madam deputy speaker even if i be not as jenny would always be most welcome on this side of the house 
 i hope that i have reassure the hon gentleman that we do have the legislation require to act 
 i would be very happy to report to the house on the reason why we would not do that i be sure the hon lady will allow i to write to she separately to set out how i intend for we to do that it seem to be a reasonable request 
 return to my original point the current drafting would mean that dwp can compel information of that kind from private landlord or estate agent but not from housing association there be an inequity there that we be seek to address with the amendment clarify the drafting and continue to protect the personal information of service user of crisis support or advocacy service 
 the bill also bring forward new information gather power that govern how dwp authorise officer can compel information to support an investigation into fraud it also set out where information must not be compel for example to protect the long stand principle of legal professional privilege separately the bill bring forward power of entry search and seizure for dwp authorise investigator those task with investigate the most serious case of fraud it do that by bring those authorise investigator under the remit of the police and criminal evidence act in england and wales and by create similar power in   scotland for dwp authorise investigator that ensure that those investigator be govern by a similar legal framework to other law enforcement body that be grant access to use those type of power 
 government amendment seek to ensure that the exemption to information that dwp authorise officer can compel be not applicable to authorised investigator when use power of entry search and seizure government amendment mirror that provision for the psfa those amendment will support effective fraud investigation as without access crucial evidence might remain out of reach slow down our response to fraud those exemption be important but the police and criminal evidence act which apply in england and wales already provide such restriction and safeguard by only enable that information to be compel with the approval of the court couple with similar convention that apply for scotland the amendment ensure that there be no duplication the power in the bill remain in line with exist convention as set out in pace and correctly reflect the norm of the scottish legal system 
 turn to government amendment to paragraph of schedule 3zd currently refer to definition within pace in relation to special procedure material confidential professional material exclude material and item subject to legal privilege 
 government amendment and set out specific definition to avoid link provision that relate solely to scotland with exist legislation that apply to england and wales this also ensure that legal privilege and item subject to legal privilege reference contain in the schedule be correctly define for scotland government amendment and be consequential to amendment 
 government amendment and ensure that the power for the dwp under pace take by the bill in schedule be align with those of the police and other government departments such as hmrc and provide a clear legal framework for what evidence can be seize and how it should be handle government amendment and mean that dwp authorise investigator such as the police can seize item that   be reasonably believe to be evidence of an offence   not just dwp relate offence when undertake entry search and seizure activity in england and wales this will mean that potential evidence of any other offence if discover in the course of a search can be preserve and may be seize where it be consider necessary to prevent it from be destroy or move the amendment ensure that the law be clear on how it must be handle and transfer to the most appropriate law enforcement agency in england and wales government amendment and make similar provision for authorised investigator in scotland to those i have just describe for england and wales 
 government amendment and clarify how authorised investigator can prevent access to seize evidence from any offence if it may prejudice criminal proceeding in scotland by amend the definition of offence in schedule 3zd insert by schedule of this act this mirror the same provision that be already in the bill as it apply to england and wales 
 government amendment and be all minor and technical amendment to correct inconsistency in terminology government amendment be a minor   and technical amendment to provide the correct reference to power in the social security administration act to ensure that the power in scotland align with those in england and wales government amendment amend the period of time in which a warrant must be exercise to scotland from month to month this correct the bill to ensure that it be consistent with the usual practice in scotland 
 government amendment ensure that the court have the power to order a person have be disqualify to provide their ni or eu driving licence as be already the case for those hold a gb licence under the new debt recovery power the bill as draft would allow a dwp debtor who evade payment and hold an ni or eu licence to be disqualify from drive however it inadvertently limit the court ’s ability to order that person to produce their licence unless it be issue in great britain undermine the power and cause administrative difficulty for the court and the driver and vehicle licensing agency government amendment correct this and ensure parity between gb ni and eu drive licence under the power in schedule 
 government amendment and ensure that the application and limitation period in clause follow the policy intention that the psfa can investigate fraud and recover debt in england and wales government amendment also ensure that the dwp ’s debt recovery power in this bill be not limited in scotland to the usual year time limit in the prescription and limitation scotland act this make it clear that the long year recovery period in scotland apply to such provision introduce or amend by this bill as i have set out the intent behind these amendment be to ensure the delivery of the intended policy intent or to ensure the correct territorial application of the bill 
 motion make that the bill be now read a time 
 object 
 bill to be read a time on   tuesday may 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his department ’s policy of recent trend in level of stand charge for electricity bill 
 we know that consumer be frustrate by stand charge which be why we be commit to lower they ofgem have be consult on introduce a stand charge tariff that would shift the cost on to unit rate the consultation have now close and we will be work with ofgem to take this forward 
 have the department assess whether the rise standing charge be discourage resident in our constituency from switch to heat pump and electric vehicle because they be concerned about the fix cost that will come with they 
 there be fix cost within standing charge relate to for instance the cost of maintain and upgrade network which we have to cover but we recognise the imbalance between the price that people be pay for electricity and the price that they be pay for gas we be committed to deal with that imbalance because we think it right that consumer can transition to clean heat that be the way in which we reduce the amount of energy we use and critically that be the way in which we reduce bill 
 what step he be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector 
 what step he be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector 
 since the last oral question in march the government have consent to the rampion offshore wind farm create job reach the final investment decision on the hynet carbon capture utilisation and storage cluster create job invest £ through great british energy in uk clean energy supply chain shortlist hydrogen company for hydrogen allocation round and create a new £ fusion investment fund this government be build the clean energy future in britain 
 the reason i be here on that saturday when parliament be recall be because some of the mighty structure in the north sea be make from british steel at the nigg yard on the question of renewable may i ask the secretary of state what we be do about get out the skill to fabricate float offshore wind structure in the united kingdom 
 that be very much part of our plan as the hon gentleman will know in march we announce the provision of more than £ for the expansion of port of cromarty firth to create offshore wind supply chain in this country and last week along with gb energy we announce that investment of £ in supply chain we be determined not just to generate offshore wind in britain but to take advantage of the huge economic opportunity that it represent 
 i hear what the secretary of state be say but scotland ’s decline oil and gas industry have lose of their job in the past decade and today grangemouth have warn that it may have to pause important project involve a switch to greener and more sustainable form of energy because of what it describe as soar energy bill and the pressure of income tax we know that grangemouth need investment but it also need more than the government be do at the moment what intervention be they plan to protect job and the community that could be hollow out if grangemouth be not save 
 as the hon lady will know we inherit this situation from the last government but we set aside £ to build the future in grangemouth and we be work closely with the scottish government on precisely that in a government to government collaboration as for the hon lady ’s wide question about industrial energy price we should obviously look at what different sector be say 
 a lot of nonsense be be talk about steel uk steel have say categorically that the difference between our price and those of continental europe be a result of our reliance on natural gas power generation interruption opposition member say rubbish but that be what uk steel have say and that be why our clean power mission be right for family and right for business 
 today mark the end of more than a century of refining at grangemouth scotland be once again a victim of   industrial vandalism and devastation and i do not want anyone in this chamber to dare mention a just transition because we all know that the conservatives when they be in power and the scottish national party currently in holyrood have do nothing to avert this catastrophic decision i put it to the secretary of state that during the general election campaign the labour leadership say that they would step in and save the job at the refinery what have change and why have we not do the sensible thing for scotland ’s energy security 
 my hon friend be talk about a very important issue and grangemouth have a very important role in scotland what i will say to he and to other be that as soon as this government see the situation that they have inherit they put money in to help the worker and they have make that huge investment commitment of £ work hand in hand with the scottish government so that we can build the future in grangemouth we be absolutely committed to build the future for grangemouth community and we look forward to work with my hon friend and other member on both side of the house to do that 
 yesterday be international workers memorial day at a service this weekend in falkirk a grangemouth refinery worker rightly call for oil and gas worker skill not to be consider obsolete but utterly essential for the just transition what consideration have minister give to the urgent policy recommendation in project willow to provide accelerated investment in clean energy infrastructure and the job it promise for grangemouth 
 my hon friend who be also a really powerful advocate for his constituent be absolutely right project willow be leave on the shelf by the previous government we put the money in to take project willow forward and we be now go to implement it absolutely crucial to that be ensure the skill of oil and gas worker be properly use in the future include with the skill passport which also lie dormant under the previous government and which we be power ahead with 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 through my work on the select committee i have hear repeat concern from industry leader that exist worker in their 50 and 60 see no point in retraining because they believe they will see out their career support old technology that have a knock on impact on young entrant to the workforce who have traditionally learn their skill from more experienced worker will the secretary of state outline what step he be take to incentivise retrain to support growth in the renewable energy sector 
 the hon lady raise a really important point that be why we be work with the department for education to make sure we do not just have a clean power plan that will help to create hundred of thousand of job across the country and invest in supply chain which i talk about early but crucially offer opportunity   for young worker and inspire they about the possibility that be available and create opportunity for old worker too all that work be ongoing in government 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the uk ’s priority for the un climate change conference 
 we be work closely with the brazilian presidency to support a high ambition outcome at cop30 in belém which reflect the scale of the challenge and our share ° goal that include ambitious new nationally determined contribution and the effective implementation of the global stocktake commitment as well as action on issue such as tackle deforestation and methane emission 
 it be encouraging to see the prime minister ’s commitment to go far and fast towards net at the international energy summit last week because not take action on climate change will cost we much more do the minister agree that clean energy be not only good for the planet but can give my constituent in bedford and kempston energy security and low bill 
 my hon friend be right other country be look to we the conference last week be a good example of we be back in the business of global leadership whether it be through the global clean power alliance or our national mission to be a clean energy superpower we be spearhead the transition because it be cheap clean and more secure his constituent will benefit from that too 
 i welcome the announcement make only a few day ago that the government will adopt the amendment to the great british energy bill to prevent slave make good mean that they will not be balance their environmental conscience on the back of some of the world ’s most endanger and troubled individual in the uyghur population in xinjiang will the government extend that to the private sector to make sure no slave make good be come into the uk in new ash green and ridley in my constituency a solar panel farm be be put in that not only threaten the environment but threaten to bring in slave make good into the united kingdom 
 i would dispute that it be threaten the environment but we will be look at the wide issue the right hon gentleman raise through the solar industry taskforce 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the overwhelming majority of those at the international energy summit last week say that the transition to low carbon energy be crucial to energy security do my hon friend agree that those in this chamber and beyond who do not support the transition to low carbon energy be play fast and loose with this country ’s energy security 
 that be absolutely the case it be hearten to see so many country and so many representative from business come together at the conference last week we be show global leadership on this issue we know it be the way forward in term of our energy security and not put we at the mercy of dictator and petrostate i thank my hon friend for his support 
 give the sheer scale of the outage in portugal and spain over the past few day be it likely that the conference will consider and possibly conclude that there be some correlation between the obsession with net and what happen in portugal and spain 
 of all i be sure the whole house will want to send support to spain and portugal follow the incident yesterday there be no effect in the uk but we will continue to closely monitor the situation and any lesson learn from this event i be not go to speculate as to its cause but we do need to ensure that our own system be as resilient as possible 
 what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change 
 what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change 
 international leadership on climate change be critical for this government which be why we announce a world lead nationally determine contribution at cop29 and be at the heart of negotiation during the summit i have be work extensively with international counterpart to ensure maximum ambition from country around the world at cop30 and look forward to further engagement 
 i recently receive letter from year child at ss peter and paul primary school express concern over the impact of climate change on their future mention the extreme weather and the destruction of our natural habitat for our wildlife the uk ’s warm year on record have all occur since and be the uk ’s hot year with temperature exceed ° for the time despite be to year old they give suggestion for how the government could help by provide clean source of energy such as make solar panel more affordable will the secretary of state reassure i and those pupil that we be do everything we can to be a world leader in tackle climate change and to sustain the future for our child 
 i be glad to hear that the child at ss peter and paul primary school be take such an interest in this issue i can assure they that we be do all we can to make britain a clean energy superpower such as lift the onshore wind ban and set up great british energy and we be protect nature too   we be also commit to engage more with young people and i will make sure my hon friend be keep inform of our plan 
 it be welcome indeed to see the government now play a lead role internationally on climate action through the global clean power alliance especially after a decade of failure that leave we expose to soar gas price it be also great to see the secretary of state stand up to climate denier in this house whose hostility to net would keep bill high and cost area like mine the job and investment that they need 
 area where we need strong leadership be on fund climate action fairly in the come day i will be introduce a bill to make the big polluter pay for the action we need both at home and abroad i do not expect the minister or the secretary of state to comment on a bill they have not see but will the secretary of state commit to a meeting between his department and a broad group of charity and non governmental organisation work to ensure fair and just climate financing 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s support for the government ’s climate leadership we be do all we can to mobilise climate financing in support of the new collective goal agree at cop29 i would be more than happy to meet he and campaigner to discuss his bill when he be ready to do so 
 area where we could show significant leadership be in the sphere of float solar which come with huge benefit my constituency have acre of raise reservoir where we keep half of london ’s drinking water you can not see the top of they mr speaker float solar be twice as efficient as land base system and come with none of the opportunity cost of put solar panel on grade a agricultural land in fact float solar panel actually improve the water quality underneath so that thames water would have to use less filtration downstream i hear however that the government ’s solar road map have disappointingly little about float solar would the secretary of state agree to meet i to discuss this far prior to publication 
 as i understand it the solar road map have not yet be publish so watch this space i have be have conversation in the past couple of week with international counterpart who be interested in float solar and i would be happy to get the hon gentleman a more detailed response on our plan on that front 
 as the minister know global leadership be about adaptation and mitigation do she expect the climate change committee ’s report on adaptation which be due out tomorrow to say that the government be do enough in this regard furthermore will she show real leadership by require local authority and major infrastructure provider to carry out climate risk assessment so that statutorily they will have to ensure that climate resilience and preparedness form a part of their plan 
 i can not pre empt what be in the report we will wait for it to come out and then respond in due course on local leadership the hon lady and i share a local authority and i would be very happy to discuss with it what more we can do to set an example as bristol have do so many time in the past on how thing can be do at a local level 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we have see in portugal and spain renewable energy can sometimes be unreliable give the dominant role that china play in our renewable energy infrastructure will the minister set out for the house the full detail of the deal that the secretary of state sign in secret with the chinese government 
 my right hon friend the secretary of state assure i that the deal be not sign he will keep the house inform as and when it be appropriate to do so 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the transparency of domestic energy bill costing 
 under ofgem ’s current rule supplier must provide complete and accurate billing information critically bill be require to be display in plain and accessible language we will work with the regulator to ensure that supplier abide by that however it be worth say that we recognise that many consumer feel let down by a broken energy system that be not work on their behalf that be why we be review the role of ofgem to ensure that it have the power necessary to be an effective consumer champion 
 when it come to bill the public understand what unit cost be but not what standing charge be when i raise this with the previous government and ofcom they say that it be a complex matter but what i be ask for be transparency so that people understand how the charge be make up and can then make a judgment on what it look like will the government commit to ask ofgem to ensure that that information be include in the billing so that we can see the breakdown of cost how much be go on human resource and how much be go on the actual infrastructure and wire so we know exactly what be go on in the energy market 
 we support transparency ofgem publish the breakdown of all cost within bill but there be more that we need to do to ensure that consumer understand what be go on critically for we we know that consumer be very frustrated about the standing charge which be why we be commit to lower they as i have say a consultation be under way around what we do with standing charge which include introduce a stand charge tariff within that we will be consider option to increase transparency 
 many household in rural and coastal area include in south east cornwall be not connect to the gas grid and rely on alternative fuel which often cost they more what step be the minister take to ensure that unlike under the previous government these resident be not leave behind in future support scheme 
 we be very clear that every part of the country must benefit from this transition so whether it be through our warm home scheme or the work that we be do locally through great british energy we be make sure that there be a solution for every single part of the country in my department i be do a lot of work to make sure that we have a set of proposition for household in rural area so that they can upgrade their home and have bill that be cheap and home that be warm which be the central plank of our warm home scheme 
 i call the shadow minister 
 several time now i have ask ministers to rule out align the british carbon price with the european and each time they have refuse to do so they have already abandon their promise to cut energy bill by £ a year but alignment would increase wholesale cost and therefore increase bill for every family in the country can the minister at last be straight with the public and tell we whether the government plan to match the european carbon price yes or no 
 we be engage with industry on this matter the confederation of british industry and energy uk be clear that they should support alignment but we be look at that ultimately we be do everything that we can to bear down on energy cost in this country that be why we be sprint to clean power we inherit an absolutely atrocious legacy from the conservative party which allow business and consumer to bear the price of a broken system we will not make the same mistake which be why we be crack on with the job 
 i think we be get close to the government admit their secret plan as soon as the local election be do labour be go to sell out to europe and the result will be high bill for british family but there be more the eu be expand carbon pricing to include transport and heating emission so alignment with the expand scheme would mean extra taxis on every british family for drive their car and heat their home will the minister rule out align at least with the expand scheme and say no to new taxis on everyday life yes or no 
 i be absolutely disappointed by the conservatives i should expect more but maybe i need to get use to be disappoint we see the press release a week ago and it have have no publicity because it be a conservative party scare story it be absolute nonsense the government be serious about bear down on the cost of energy for business and we be get on with the serious work of do that i suggest that the conservatives get a grip and join we in that task 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the clean energy transition on worker 
 we firmly believe that the clean energy transition be the economic opportunity of the century in recent week we have secure thousand of new job in carbon capture offshore wind and british supply chain as we transform the way we power our country we be determined to ensure that community across our country benefit from good job and good wage that be what our clean energy mission be all about 
 i thank the minister for her response but could she go far in set out the government ’s assessment of how in the clean energy transition new job can be create here in the uk in the manufacturing of component for offshore wind and other green energy project 
 i be delighted that last week the government be able to announce an initial £ through great british energy to invest in supply chain for domestic offshore wind the fund will boost domestic job mobilise additional private investment and secure manufacturing facility for critical clean energy supply chain we be publish our industrial strategy in the spring which will set out our approach to the high growth drive sector include clean energy industry 
 there be more good news last week for carbon capture usage and storage worker in england with £ in supply chain contract for the liverpool bay hynet project which will even benefit north wales now that be on top of the £ that benefit teesside and merseyside i have check and those place be not the centre of the uk ’s energy industry for the last year why have the government not allocate a single penny to the acorn project in scotland where the clock be tick and where investor be very concerned that this government be not serious about it 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s support for government policy and for our investment in ccus as he know acorn be a matter for the spending review i talk to many industry in scotland and everyone be supportive of the scheme we support the scheme and be work closely with industry but it be a matter for the spending review 
 what step he be take to help improve the energy efficiency of home 
 what step he be take to help improve the energy efficiency of home 
 in alone we will upgrade up to home through the warm home plan and    other measure that be more than double the number of home upgrade last year later this year we will set out more detail of our warm home plan to upgrade up to home with energy efficient technology such as heat pump solar and insulation in order to deliver warm home and low bill 
 i recognise that there be very good scheme for those on low income and that heating home be really important for many old property and property in conservation area as fast as we heat the home the heat just go out the window in my area where there be lot of old home and home in conservation area it be near impossible to get permission to apply double or triple glazing can the secretary of state sort out this tension between have warm home and old home particularly when he be try so hard to ensure that home meet the c grade rating for energy performance certificate by this need to be sort out with planning department 
 the hon lady raise a really important point i be constantly on the look out for small measure and large in the planning system that can obstruct the sensible energy efficiency measure such as solar panel that will make all the difference i say to she and other members of the house that if they have specific example of barrier or interpretation of guideline that be get in the way sometimes be not about the rule but about local council interpretation of they please bring they to our attention because we be constantly try to make it easy to make such upgrade happen 
 earl a social housing tenant from glastonbury be disabled and have face multiple barrier that have prevent he from self fund improvement to the sustainability and energy efficiency of his home in order to help he reduce his energy poverty and improve his health what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that social housing tenant receive energy upgrade in their home and in particular those live in old housing stock where upgrade might be more complex to achieve 
 it sound as though the hon lady be raise an individual case and if she want to draw it to our attention she can do so on the more general point i believe that her local authority have receive £ as part of the warm home local grant so it would be worth talk to it about this again i be sure that i speak for the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh on this where there be specific issue about how particular scheme be work please do draw they to our attention and we will seek to act on they 
 royal shrewsbury hospital in my constituency be delighted to receive a £ investment for solar panel which will see our local trust save more than £ by reduce its energy bill in the lifetime of the project will the secretary of state join i in celebrate this excellent start to our nationalise great british energy company and update the house on the next step to get we towards that mission 
 i do join my hon friend in that i say to all opposition members who vote against gb energy that many of they will now be get solar panel on school and hospital in their constituency let all their constituent know that those be local mp who oppose cut bill for school and hospital in their own constituency 
 i welcome the £ of government funding for norwich ’s labour lead city council to improve energy efficiency in home which will help tackle fuel poverty and provide much more comfort will the secretary of state welcome norwich labour ’s leadership on this issue and set out how we will provide more funding to local council so that they can go far fast 
 my hon friend raise a really important point about the crucial role of local authority in relation to these issue of the thing that my right hon friend the deputy prime minister have do be devolve more funding to combined authority on this we want to go far include in relation to local authority because it be local authority include my hon friend ’s which i congratulate who know good the particular need of their own locality and they be a key part of the answer to the energy efficiency upgrade that we need 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community 
 great british energy will support the creation of thousand of high quality well pay job right across the country and help rebuild the uk ’s industrial heartland just last week the prime minister announce £ for great british energy to kick start supply chain here in the uk once the great british energy bill finish its final stage in parliament we will come forward with more exciting plan for our domestic clean energy champion 
 i welcome the £ of investment for gb energy announce last week i think we all recognise the opportunity of the green energy transition but what opportunity be there for my harlow constituent to be part of that publicly own energy company 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to point out that with great british energy and our clean power mission we be try to create the job that will deliver that transition here in the uk which be something that the conservatives fail on for many year we expect that funding and much more that will come from great british energy to mobilise more than £ in private investment in domestic supply chain drive forward manufacturing and industry here in the uk and the good job that go with it 
 what assessment have the minister make of the number of job that great british energy will create in the people ’s republic of china 
 i think the right hon gentleman give the game away there although the conservative party do not particularly care where the supply chain be we in the labour party be commit to deliver good well pay job in this country if he be so concerned about invest in british supply chain he might have bother to vote for great british energy in the place 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when gb energy be propose we be tell it would employ people and create job fast forward to february this year and that number have be revise down to to with a vague commitment to at some point in the next year as the general secretary of the gmb say yesterday 
 they be go to open a shiny new office on a high street full of charity shop because they be close 
 the city of aberdeen down gb energy be a white elephant if the gmb can see it why can not the minister surely he agree that the way to deliver job growth and energy security and to protect community such as aberdeen be to lift the ban on licence replace the energy profit levy as soon as possible and declare the north sea open for business 
 i be not quite sure which of the variety of part in that speech the hon gentleman would like i to respond to as usual he steamroll through his question fast than he run the marathon i congratulate he on that he happen to be the only person in aberdeenshire who be against investment in his community when labour member vote to deliver investment through great british energy not through job in the headquarters but through the investment it make in supply chain and innovation in his city he vote against it and he will have to answer to his constituent for that 
 what step he be take to support the nuclear power sector 
 nuclear power be a critical part of our clean power ambition we be make strong progress on sizewell c and great british nuclear be drive forward its small modular reactor competition we have also see the nuclear regulatory taskforce set up by the prime minister and we be end the legacy of no new nuclear be complete in the long year when the conservatives be in power 
 the transition to net be a chance to create decent high skilled job for the future that include the next generation of small nuclear reactor which could revolutionise our energy market and deliver clean affordable energy the snp have veto nuclear energy project in scotland for almost   year determine to leave scotland behind be   scotland miss out on the economic opportunity that nuclear offer 
 planning matter include the siting of new nuclear be devolve to the scottish parliament so it be rightly for it to decide however i agree that scotland be miss out on the huge potential of new nuclear if the ideological block introduce by the snp be lift billion of pound could be invest in scotland with the countless skilled job that go with that that could well be deliver next year if a scottish government be elect that take the industry and opportunity of scotland seriously and deliver those well pay skilled job that would come by elect a scottish labour government 
 datum from the last year show that ynys môn see a drop of in job link to the nuclear industry the bad figure for a   uk constituency despite wylfa be recognise as the good site for new nuclear in europe we see no development from the last government will the secretary of state and the minister give we the recognition and acknowledgment that wylfa need new nuclear and that that will be see in the near future 
 the hon lady have raise with i that point and the wide question of energy job in her constituency a number of time and i thank she for that and for the way she have do so wylfa be an important site and continue to be that the government be consider we will take forward those decision in due course as i have say to she on a number of previous occasion we be commit to deliver the job that go with that and wylfa remain an important site 
 what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price 
 industrial energy price double under the previous government and industry suffer as do consumer when wholesale price rocket at the start of the ukraine war the good way to secure bill for the long term for industry as well as for consumer be to deliver clean power by the truth be that the tories run down our energy infrastructure just as they run down our road and rail infrastructure and our public service we be rebuild that infrastructure make it more secure for the long term and less reliant on foreign dictator thus give we energy independence good job and cheap bill 
 grow the economy will need cheap energy but ineos ’s chief executive have warn that labour ’s crippling carbon taxis and other levy threaten uk manufacturing and make we more reliant on import when will minister start listen and realise that their dogma drive energy policy be cost job and investment and when will they actually act to make our electricity price more competitive 
 as uk steel say recently the main driver of the price disparity be the wholesale electricity cost which be drive by the uk ’s reliance on natural gas the good way to secure bill for the long term be to deliver clean power by and that be what we be do 
 green job be great job and i welcome the £ of private investment in clean energy since the election of this labour government in order to bring down our industrial energy price far what step will the government take to get we on to clean energy that we control and off the fossil fuel that be in the control of dictator 
 my hon friend be right to point out the huge amount of private sector investment that be come in with clean energy this be why in the industrial strategy clean energy be of the growth drive sector where we have see growth in the economy we be also see hundred of thousand of job which the conservative now seem determined to oppose we will introduce the clean energy of the future and that be why we be push for clean energy by that will bring down bill give we energy security and create really good quality job 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the resilience of the national grid against the potential disruption of offshore energy infrastructure 
 before i answer the hon lady ’s substantive question i want to offer she my huge congratulation on smash to smithereen on sunday the previous record hold by a female mp in the london marathon 
 great britain have a highly resilient energy network with diverse source of supply the national energy system operator can balance the system in a wide range of scenario include potential disruption to offshore infrastructure 
 the uk currently have about gw of offshore wind capacity which supply about of our energy in order to reach the government ’s target this will have to increase by time to to gw in just year and to achieve that we will have to rely on chinese wind infrastructure and technology what specific risk assessment have the government carry out into the impact of this expose vulnerability and reliance on china for what will be a significant amount of our energy supply 
 i will not comment on individual investment case but in every single case the government make an assessment and we look at the national security implication seriously just as the conservatives do when they be in government i would just gently say that the reason the supply chain in this country be as weak as they be be that they be underfunde and under invest for year by the conservatives there could have be a decision at the point when they take ambitious step to move towards clean power to build the supply chain here but they choose not to do so they choose to tow thing into our water instead we be reverse that but it can not happen overnight 
 what step he be take to ensure that local authority have adequate resource for energy efficiency upgrade for council leaseholder and   social   home 
 at the autumn budget £ be allocate to local authority and social housing provider support they to deliver warm and more energy efficient home across the country target low income household in particular this go alongside our plan to raise standard in rent property to ensure that no social or private renter have to live in a cold draughty home 
 i be pleased to see the government ’s commitment to provide thousand of low income household with energy efficient upgrade this could not have come too soon for my vulnerable constituent who be live on housing estate with outdated energy system that sometimes leave they without hot water and heating for month on end camden council which i know the minister know well have plan to upgrade the energy efficiency of those estate but in many case it just do not have the resource to replace the heating system with heat pump which would lower bill and carbon emission even far what assurance can the minister give i that local authority will be give   the support necessary to deliver the energy upgrade to the high possible level 
 my hon friend make an important point local authority will have a critical role to play in our warm home plan under our warm home scheme we be offer substantial support to enable low income household to transition to clean heat for example our warm home social housing fund allow grant recipient to receive an additional £ clean heat upgrade and under our warm home local grant £ be be provide on top of the baseline to enable all household particularly low income household to benefit from clean heat 
 i know how on top of her brief the minister be so will she confirm that few than a of council home have an energy performance certificate c rating in compare with over by last year less than of home in the uk have decent insulation in when labour last leave office and when   the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband who be chuntere from a sedentary position be in power and more than do by the time we leave office will she commit to a fast rate of improvement under this government than we ever see under the previous labour government 
 i welcome the right hon member ’s commitment to our plan to upgrade home however he be try to rewrite history because when we look at the record of the previous government we see many failure but the most abject and egregious be the failure to insulate enough home to ensure that household be protect from price rise that be the conservative   legacy and it be we be determined to turn around that be why we be committed to upgrade million of home across the country 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the opportunity for industry through the national wealth fund 
 the national wealth fund have a critical role to play alongside great british energy in drive investment and job into clean energy industry the fund be already make great progress include participate in the late round by geopura a uk base green hydrogen pioneer as well as support critical mineral in cornwall as part of our mission for clean power by 
 our labour government be drive economic growth in luton and bedfordshire through our support for the sustainable expansion of luton airport and the exciting new universal studios do the minister agree that we need to match those positive development with incentivise investment in renewable energy to ensure that the pursuit of growth contribute to meet our climate commitment 
 the government welcome the plan to invest in and around luton include the expansion of luton airport and the incredibly exciting universal theme park which be on the perfect site as its president say it also have perfect mp these project along with the mass clean power investment we be deliver will grow the economy and deliver direct benefit to the community that host this vital clean power infrastructure which will take all of we off the fossil fuel market rollercoaster 
 the domestic user of electricity pay 24p per kilowatt the domestic user of main gas pay 6p people who live in urban britain buy their energy for a quarter of the price pay by people in rural britain this be a massive problem and i wonder whether the minister could explain how the government will address it 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question though it be not quite about the national wealth fund he be right to highlight electricity price this be a challenge for industry and we inherit from the previous government the good way to bring those bill down be to secure clean power by but he be right to highlight the challenge and that be what we be try to fix 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 last week government and more than global business gather in london for the global summit on the future of energy security with the international energy agency i hear from country after country the hard headed case for clean energy ’s role in deliver energy security to free we from   the global fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator i also hear from many clean energy business that britain be the place where they want to invest because of the clarity and speed of this government ’s mission 
 home in rural area experience some of the high rate of fuel poverty in the uk rural property be less energy efficient than the national average and many be simply hard to insulate will the minister confirm that my constituent in penrith and solway will see the additional challenge of rurality reflect in the government ’s ambitious warm home plan 
 per cent my hon friend be absolutely right about that the minister for energy consumers and i often discuss how we have to ensure that our warm home plan take account of the particular need and challenge face rural area 
 i call the shadow minister 
 voter 
 feel they ’re be ask to make financial sacrifice when they know that their impact on global emission be minimal present policy solution be inadequate and therefore unworkable the current approach be n’t work any strategy base on either phase out fossil fuel in the short term or limit consumption be a strategy doom to fail 
 do the secretary of state agree with his former boss tony blair 
 the shadow minister talk about the tony blair institute report i agree with a lot of what it say it say that we should move ahead on carbon capture and storage which the government be do it say that we should move ahead on the role of artificial intelligence which the government be do it say that we should move ahead on nuclear which the government be do the shadow minister say only week ago after his party drop its net policy this will surprise people mr speaker 
 order no secretary of state this be topical question i do not need a full statement 
 to be honest i be look forward to hear what i say a few week ago mr speaker it be okay for the secretary of state to admit when he be wrong as tony blair say yesterday this strategy be doom to fail why can the secretary of state not see what the gmb and tony blair see which be that clean power be doom to fail and it be time for a change of approach 
 that be not what the report say the shadow minister be talk absolute nonsense the point i be go to make be that he say 
 look nobody ’s say that net be a mistake net in the round be the eminently sensible thing to do 
 those be not my word but his some people say that the tory party have only policy actually it have it be against net and through the shadow minister it be for net 
 north west leicestershire have be at the forefront of industry for generation now lead global company such as abb be invest locally and our focus on energy efficiency be lead the way to net apprenticeship be a core part of that how will our government encourage apprenticeship in that sector in order to meet our net target and support young people into the good quality job of the future 
 the office for clean energy jobs be focus on develop a skilled workforce in core energy and net sector that be critical to meet our mission to make the uk a clean energy superpower my right hon friend the secretary of state and i be work with skills england to assess skill need and engage with the department for education on apprenticeship and the wide growth and skill offer 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 follow the publication of the severn estuary commission report on tidal power will the government produce a national policy statement to support tidal range energy and will they publish a review of the available opportunity 
 i have have a number of meeting on this issue since come into post clearly tidal could play an important part in an energy mix we have be clear that we be supportive of it in principle but question about its cost benefit and value for money must be answer we be happy to continue look at it in future as project develop and more detail come forward 
 i welcome the government ’s view that nuclear power be essential to our clean power goal what step be the department take to ensure that new nuclear can be build wherever that be possible across the country include in my constituency 
 my hon friend ask an important question new nuclear be absolutely part of the energy mix that be why we announce important reform to the national policy statement the previous such substantive reform be base on the i publish as energy secretary in we have update the statement in order to enable new nuclear to be build right across the country include in his constituency 
 the power outage across spain portugal and the south of france be a stark reminder of how energy security be key to national security it be vital that any government be alive to the risk to our national resilience what step have the government take to ensure that robust plan be in place in the event of power outage 
 the hon lady ask an important question i be in touch with the national energy system operator yesterday follow the event in spain and portugal the uk be not affect neso and my department take this incredibly seriously i would also add give that   there have be some comment on this that we should not jump to conclusion about what happen let we see what happen and the reason for it and then learn the lesson 
 last month be a fantastic opportunity to welcome the secretary of state to the vaillant factory in derby and to learn about great british nuclear ’s incredible investment of £ in solar panel we know that do right the clean energy transition will support community across the uk and thousand of new job what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that derby be at the heart of that opportunity 
 my hon friend be right this clean energy transition be about create job i be delighted to open the factory which be create job and be a £ investment manufacturing cylinder for heat pump this be an opportunity that this government be go to seize for britain 
 this secretary of state think it be a good idea to fill our field with solar panel at a cost of billion of pound to the british taxpayer i hate to break it to he but solar panel rely on sunshine so why be he now support a project to block out the sunshine 
 the hon gentleman never cease to amaze i and not in a good way reform have make its decision i be not sure what the conservatives position be cheap clean home grow power be the answer for britain because it give we energy security and free we from the petrostate and dictator we be in favour of it reform be against it goodness know where the conservative party be 
 electric vehicle sale growth be at risk of slow down many private car and fleet owner would transition to evs but patchy provision of public charging for those unable to charge at home and inadequate power capacity for rapid charging on our strategic road network for long distance driver be key reason for reluctance to buy ev what discussion be desnz minister have with power network charge provider and the department for transport to address this 
 order i have a lot of member i need to get in these be topical question they be mean to be short and punchy 
 my hon friend be right to point out that public charging point be critical that be why the regulator ofgem allocate £ over the next year to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure i have have a number of meeting with network operator about this question and i work closely with my colleague in the department for transport to ensure we be roll out more point 
 my constituent continue to face high electricity bill among the high in the country at approximately £ per year of my local hairdresser tell i that their electricity have go up from £ to £ a month will   the government commit to bolder policy by ease restriction on solar and wind power and drive investment in renewable to help struggle business 
 the hon lady be right clean home grow power be the answer so that be an unequivocal yes 
 industrial community such as st austell and the clay country have be stifle in recent year by soar energy cost what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that industry such as the proud china clay industry be internationally competitive 
 my hon friend be right there be a long stand issue around industrial energy price the key be get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel market because just as family finance be ruin in the cost of living crisis it be the same in relation to business finance and public finance it be an essential part of the answer 
 in my constituency many elderly and disabled people face very high energy bill due to essential medical equipment and heating need what support be the government provide to ensure that these household be protect from the high cost of electricity 
 we know that consumer be under pressure with energy bill that be why last winter £ of support be provide to help vulnerable customer through our warm home discount and through industry that be why we be extend the warm home discount from household to household and do ongoing work to ensure we be support the most vulnerable household with bill 
 next week i will be visit the site of a propose project in my constituency that will create the only new interconnector between great britain and france which can be build and operational by to help deliver the government ’s clean power mission ahead of the propose uk france summit this summer will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how to expedite conversation with our french counterpart so that we can move forward with this important project 
 my hon friend raise a really important issue about interconnector it be something i have be talk to the regulator about particularly in relation to france and indeed to my french counterpart marc ferracci who be in london for our international energy summit i be happy for the department to engage with she and tell she about the work we be do on that issue 
 during the general election the secretary of state repeatedly promise my constituent that if they vote labour their energy price would be reduce by £ not by up to £ will the secretary of state repeat that promise at the dispatch box 
 we say we would cut bill by up to £ and that be absolutely what we be determined to do 
 they have go up 
 the hon gentleman say that bill have go up but let i give he a little basic lesson they have go up because we be expose to fossil fuel price the only way to bring they down be by have source of clean home grow power that we control 
 the pimlico district heating undertaking be build in the ever district heating network in the uk it use to be cut edge but it be in desperate need of replacement so that my constituent can have heating and hot water will the government work with local authority such as labour westminster city council to make sure that all the cost of replacement do not necessarily fall just on resident 
 westminster city council own the network and we know that it be consider option for refurbishing and potentially decarbonise it in the round we be commit to work with district network to do thing to increase technical standard so that they be more efficient and critically to properly regulate they so that we protect consumer from unfair price 
 when will the government decide whether to support the uk morocco power project 
 i know the right hon gentleman have an important interest in this project we continue to have discussion with xlink and obviously we be happy to brief he on those discussion 
 unlike conservative members i really welcome the £ investment last week it will be integral to create the good job of the future in constituency that be develop key technology for offshore wind like my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village with that in mind will the minister and the secretary of state visit my constituency to see ge vernova and the hard work that it be do there 
 yes be the answer i look forward to it my hon friend be right this be about the job of the future conservative members might want to turn their back on they we will not 
 as we need some oil and gas while on the road to a clean energy economy do it not make sense to produce our own rather than import it from other country and thus increase the global carbon footprint 
 a consultation have just close on the future of north sea energy we have be very clear that our manifesto commitment be to not issue new licence for explore new field but we will manage exist field for the entirety of their lifespan 
 mp across the humber region be unite in support for the vike carbon capture usage and storage project can the government give an update on any progress with track programme 
 as with acorn we think viking be a really important project i be very proud of the progress we make on track and we be obviously look at both viking and acorn in the spending review 
 will the secretary of state ensure that gb energy have a focused plan to deliver and to help the farmer in my constituency to tap the latent energy in their beck and river so that we can support farming as well as the battle against climate change 
 the hon gentleman make a very important point about the role that local community energy can play i think that be what he be allude to we be committed to ensure that great british energy local have already make some announcement in this space include on local energy funding in england we will have much more to say in due course but we want to ensure a partnership so if the hon gentleman write to i i will make sure that what he say get to gb energy 
 the scottish national party celebrate the closure and demolition of longannet coal power station in my constituency without have a plan for its future the former minister press the button on the charge herself what conversation do ministers plan to have with the site owner scottish power about the future of the site and what role might there be for the uk government in bring investment and job to my constituency 
 my hon friend be right to make the point about longannet we have conversation with scottish power on a number of issue include this he again emphasise the important role that nuclear could play in scotland in the future it could obviously be an important site for a range of us but if the ideological ban on nuclear by the snp be lift we could look at other opportunity for such site 
 when i be at the scotland office i be regularly lobby by retire senior executive from the electricity industry who want to state their concern about how long it would take to reboot the network in scotland if there be a major outage obviously i seek the necessary assurance from those run the network but in the light of what have happen in spain and portugal i would be reassure if ministers seek those assurance again 
 my under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks and i regularly discuss this issue which relate to of the duty of government i reassure the right hon gentleman that not only be this a focus for government but we will look at what happen in spain and portugal to see if there be any lesson to be learn about our resilience 
 as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on fusion energy i know that fusion technology not only have the potential to create thousand of job but could also be the answer to our long term clean energy security need do the minister agree with i that support fusion be a good example of the government ’s crowding in private sector investment create job and win investment for place like the east midland 
 my hon friend be a real champion for his constituency and for the benefit that the development of fusion will bring we continue to invest and to have discussion with international counterpart there be a very bright future for fusion and for his constituent as a result 
 the minister will be aware of the switch on of moray west offshore wind farm at buckie in my constituency last week create job deliver clean energy and help our nation to achieve net do the minister accept that the current transmission charge regime pose significant and immediate threat to investment in offshore wind in scotland will he meet i and industry representative to explore that matter far 
 we be delighted to switch on the wind farm the secretary of state for scotland be there to push the button last week it be a fantastic example of the potential of offshore wind of course i be happy to meet the hon gentleman i have already meet he and have a very enjoyable conversation and i be very happy to talk about the issue the review of the electricity market arrangement that we be go through will look at the issue of transmission charge it be an important conversation to have and i be happy to speak to he on the subject 
 the united kingdom be particularly susceptible to change in international gas price during the energy crisis and bill and price soar as a result under this government gb energy be instal solar panel in hospital in my camborne redruth and hayle constituency but will the minister remind we which party preside over the bad cost of live crisis in memory 
 order mr moon please you will not get call again if you carry on like that i be sure the minister will know the answer 
 i be delighted to remind the house that it be the conservative party that leave we with energy insecurity and we be never go to leave this country vulnerable in the way that it do 
 as my hon friend   the member for ashfield lee anderson   say the government seem to have a point plan point be to cover farmland in solar panel and point be to block out the sun what be point 
 what be the point of the hon gentleman ’s party 
 i have be contact by several constituent who have experience fail eco4 scheme installation what support be there for constituent when installation go wrong be rogue installer get pay for work that be not complete properly what step be be take to address such failure 
 we be aware of issue that we have have with eco4 and the great british insulation scheme if constituent have be affect they should have receive a letter from ofgem they should be able to contact their installer who be oblige to fix the work and there be a clear redress mechanism there be a wide point we know that the system for quality assurance and consumer redress be not fit for purpose and we be determined to overhaul it 
 in the 1970 global warmist want to put black dust on the arctic to block the sun now the minister want to put black dust on cloud to block the sun again be his plan not bonker £ of taxpayer ’s money have be spend which will only put up energy price even far 
 this be like conspiracy theory go mad i feel like we have enter a whacky world let we keep our eye on the prize as a country we be vulnerable because of our exposure to fossil fuel this government have mission alone to get clean home grow power so that we take back control 
 urgent question will the minister make a statement on the killing of people in pahalgam in kashmir and the increase tension between india and pakistan 
 the horrific terrorist attack in pahalgam in indian administer jammu and kashmir on   april   be devastating interruption 
 order member must sit down because the minister be on his foot reply 
 our thought be with those affect their love one and of course the people of india this attack leave people dead most of whom we understand be tourist travel to the region follow the attack india have announce a number of diplomatic measure against pakistan and pakistan have reciprocate the official uk travel advice for indian administer kashmir continue to advise against all travel to jammu and kashmir except for travel by air to the city of jammu travel within the city and travel within the union territory of ladakh 
 this be a very sensitive situation with real risk to regional and wide stability understandably there have be huge interest within uk community kashmir have be a flashpoint for conflict between india and pakistan many time over previous decade the prime minister speak to prime minister modi on   april   to express his condolence on behalf of the british people the uk condemn all form of terrorism and the extremism that sustain it wherever it occur the foreign secretary speak to india ’s external affairs minister jaishankar on   april   to pass on the uk ’s condolence and to express the uk government ’s support to the indian people at this difficult time the foreign secretary have also speak over the weekend to pakistan ’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister ishaq dar 
 heighten tension between india and pakistan inevitably raise concern about escalation effective channel of engagement to safeguard stability in the region be essential the uk support the un security council press statement on   april which condemn the attack and reaffirm that act of terrorism be criminal and unjustifiable the long stand position of the uk be that it be for india and pakistan to find a last resolution to the situation in kashmir take into account the wish of the kashmiri people it be not for the uk to prescribe a solution we will continue to monitor the situation closely through our high commissioner in new delhi and islamabad 
 i thank you mr speaker for allow this question and i thank the minister for his statement i have further point 
 this be a terrorist attack of the utmost barbarity and it deserve to be condemn by all my thought be with the family of those kill the killing take place in a popular tourist location and most victim be tourist among the victim be a man marry only the week before who be honeymoon with his    wife the manner of the selection of the victim be particularly horrific with the killer actively seek out non muslims before kill they in cold blood the minister will be aware that the kashmir region have be the scene of previous terrorist attack that have claim many innocent life include in chittisinghpura where sikhs be kill in what support can the uk provide to ensure that the terrorist be find and bring to justice and to ensure that their network of support be dismantle 
 secondly there have be a significant escalation of tension between india and pakistan include the measure that the minister have outline india and pakistan have engage in large scale military hostility in the past in the region and there be a real risk that the nation could revert to a military conflict again what can the uk do to encourage a de escalation of tension while ensure the eradication of the terrorist organisation and their support network wherever they exist 
 finally the minister will be aware that there have be protest in the uk outside india and pakistan ’s high commission those protest have be characterise by provocative language and gesture include what appear to be a throat slit motion by an allege pakistan official windows have be smash at pakistan ’s high commission in london and an individual have be arrest and charge do the minister recognise the importance of proactive work with community across the uk to ensure that we do not see a downturn in community relation here 
 i thank my hon friend for his engagement on these question i be sure that the whole house share his horror at the detail of this incident the targeting of the victim and the way in which it be carry out 
 i will address the scene on uk street we be aware of report of the video that my hon friend refer to the metropolitan police be investigate so i will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident but it be obviously concern we take seriously our responsibility for the security of all embassy and high commission under the vienna convention so both the pakistani and indian high commission will receive all the support of the uk state to ensure that they stay safe as my hon friend have say and as i know many in this house feel these issue have long be discuss with passion on british street we call on all side all community leader and all involve to call for calm at a time of tension in the region 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i thank   the hon member for smethwick gurinder singh josan   for secure the question and my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman who also request a question on this topic today for the support he have give to india 
 my condolence thought and prayer be with all those affect by the murderous violent terrorism that have take place in pahalgam i recognise that for india and the diaspora community those in the uk in particular this have be a really difficult week this be an act of terrorism and we should call it out for exactly what it be it be part of a long stand pattern of   attack on civilian visitor to the region and minority community and the uk must always stand with our friend during time of this nature 
 we have a series of long stand security and counter terrorism partnership with india go back to the new delhi declaration in and include the india uk strategic partnership in the comprehensive strategic partnership announce in and the uk india road map agree under the last government under those partnership security issue have be absolutely watertight which be why we must always be in lockstep with our friend in india 
 can the minister tell we what information the uk government have on those responsible for carry out these terrorist attack do the government believe that lashkar e taiba the terrorist group proscribe in the uk bear responsibility be the government aware of any cross border link to pakistan among the perpetrator of this terrorist act give that attack seem to take place at the same time as high profile us politician visit india this be not the time do the government have a view on whether this be a coincidence or whether it demonstrate a pattern of target and deliberately time attack 
 we know that the prime minister speak to prime minister narendra modi last week but have the uk provide any specific support in response to this terror attack or take any practical step to assist our friend in india have the government undertake an assessment of the security implication of this attack for the uk if lashkar e taiba or a front link to they be responsible it should be note that disturbing report be emerge that this terrorist group may have have engagement with hamas have the government make an assessment of the relationship between group cause terror and destabilisation in kashmir and those pursue violence and terrorism that threaten our interest and global peace and security 
 finally can the minister give an update on the action be take to prevent tension from escalate among community in the uk include protection for the high commission which have already be mention and will the uk leverage its influence to ease tension between india and pakistan 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question india be a friend to the uk and we have be clear about the depth of our friendship in our response to this incident she would not expect i to comment in detail on intelligence and security matter in relation to this attack but i assure she that we be look at it very closely she be right that wherever terrorism be find it be a threat to global peace and security include in the uk i will not comment far from this dispatch box on link between some of the group that the right hon lady have mention but i assure she that our security agency take these matter very seriously as she would expect 
 the right hon lady ask important question about the indian high commission as i say in my early answer we will offer our full support there be enhance protection outside the high commission and it will be a top priority for the government to ensure that no harm come to any indian diplomat or indeed any other diplomat here in the uk 
 we be play our role to try to ensure that tension do not escalate many of we in this house be familiar with the tense and storied history between the country we be friend to they both and we do not want to see an uncontrolled escalation in tension 
 may i pay my respect to those who have lose love one in the horrific terrorist attack in indian administer jammu and kashmir my thought be with they at this devastating time many of my constituent have write to i about the escalation of hostility here in the uk can the minister say what conversation he be have with indian and pakistani counterpart to address this situation 
 this escalation be unsettling for community within the uk british pakistanis and british indians be value part of our community but we look to all community and faith leader to spread the message that now be the time for come together across religious and ethnic difference not to play out the tension between state on the street of the uk and we will continue to send that message 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i associate myself with the comment that have already make reflect on the grief of the community tear apart last week tuesday ’s horrific murder be utterly devastating and those responsible must face the full weight of the law the escalation of tension between india and pakistan be alarming as be report of incident of fire be exchange by soldier at the border and it threaten to destabilise the entire region it be vital that leader in both country commit to an open dialogue and wide effort to de escalate we hope that that include india commit to reinstate the indus water treaty the suspension of which threaten water access for pakistanis and pakistan reopen its airspace to indian own airline 
 the uk must engage with both government and encourage a return to dialogue and a retreat from retaliatory action to ensure that decision take in the wake of tuesday ’s horrific attack do not endanger more life can the minister confirm what conversation he have have with official in new delhi on reinstate the indus water treaty and with official in islamabad on reopen its airspace 
 it be vital that effective channel of engagement to safeguard stability in the region exist and we be encourage both party to that effect there have be a lot of speculation about the diplomatic measure that have be announce so far as we understand it international agreement have be put in abeyance rather than be rescind in the long term the proper functioning of water management in the indus water catchment area be vital for both side of the line 
 the whole house be unite in its condemnation of the horrific attack that kill people in pahalgam kashmir it have rightly be condemn by all in the region and we must now see a full and independent investigation where   those responsible be bring to justice the response from the indian government have be somewhat concern with unilateral action take to revoke the indus water treaty risk the life and livelihood of million in pakistan we be now hear report of crackdown in kashmir with people round up by the police and bulldozer tactic use on household hard line group have issue statement promise reprisal attack death threat and action against every muslim in india kashmir continue to be a flashpoint between the nuclear neighbour so do the minister agree that the international community must now seriously focus on de escalation and long term peace in the region can he also set out what the government be do to ensure that kashmiris do not face further persecution or oppression 
 this be clearly a time of heighten tension which inevitably invite concern both in the region and here in the uk we be as i say engage with both state to try to find the most effective way to prevent these terrible incident from ever be repeat but also to ensure continue stability in the region 
 i ask at business question last week for a statement on this issue this week so i be grateful to you mr speaker for make sure that we have that statement through this urgent question 
 the reality of this terrorist attack which be well organised and well co ordinated be that despite the minister ’s word these man who be murder systematically by be shoot in the head be either hindu or christian this be a deliberate islamist attack on those tourist who be just go about their business in a peaceful manner these terrorist be well equip and they be well co ordinated 
 the sad reality be that while the government may offer expression of condolence and support to the people of india the terrorist basis that exist along the line of control in the part of kashmir illegally occupy by pakistan continue to operate across that line of control will the government commit to full support for india in apprehend the terrorist responsible and bring the backer of those terrorist to justice will the government take all step to support the erosion and elimination of terrorism in jammu and kashmir 
 the hon gentleman have come to have an argument but i be not sure which part of the statement he do not like until the investigation be conclude we should not speculate on the nature of the attack i say to he that will do everything we can to ensure that those who commit this horrific attack be bring to justice and india will have our support in that 
 i share in the comment make in this house we be horrify by this terrorist attack and my thought be with the family the victim and those in india we have see worrying scene play out in london as my hon friend   the member for smethwick gurinder singh josan   mention we can not let the situation escalate on to uk shore we all bear a responsibility to help de escalate tension what step be the uk take to support international body especially the united nations in their call for a de escalation in tension 
 as i have say we have speak at the senior level to both state and we have make clear the importance of maintain stability in the region at this time 
 i echo the word of condemnation over the horrific terror attack in pahalgam which take the life of innocent tourist i express my heartfelt condolence to all those who have be affect the rapid escalation of event follow this tragedy have be deeply worrying india ’s unfounded claim against pakistan be a dangerous and irresponsible reaction to the tragedy suffer in kashmir the unilateral and illegal decision to suspend the indus water treaty threaten to cut the lifeline of people in pakistan and it can not stand will the minister join i in express concern over the knife edge position that these nation be in and call for adherence to the guidance set under international body of law will he make a plea to calm the situation if it be exacerbate it will have severe consequence that spread much far than that region alone 
 i think i have set out our view on the importance of stability in the region already this afternoon i agree with the hon member that it be critical for all actor and international partner to ensure the long term sustainability of the indus river system 
 i welcome the statement from the minister today in light of the awful terror attack in indian administer kashmir what work be the government undertaking to consult the kashmiri diaspora here in the uk and identify their concern 
 both the foreign office and other uk government departments engage regularly with the british kashmiri community who be an important part of so many community across the united kingdom and will continue to do so 
 i be sure the government recognise that the strategic aim of this sort of terrorist atrocity be to provoke indiscriminate retaliation and undermine peaceful relation between neighbouring country between which there may be some history of hostility will the minister impress on the indian government the necessity of focus on the actual perpetrator and not on the wide community and will he impress on the pakistani government the importance in good faith of track down those responsible 
 too often in the region for which i be responsible and indeed in this country we have see terrorist attack design to have exactly the effect that the right hon gentleman have describe namely to provoke tension intercommunal hostility and a breakdown of law and order as he say a proper law enforcement lead response base on a focus on the actual perpetrator be important in this area as it be throughout the world 
 may i send my condolence thought and prayer to all the victim of this heinous terrorist attack in occupy kashmir 
 there be a large kashmiri diaspora in my constituency and many of my constituent have reach out to i express deep concern a number of they have mention the indus water treaty pakistan have already be suffer from the effect of flood in past year from which it have not recover at time of escalation and trouble such as this it seem to be community at large be they in india or pakistan who suffer what message can the minister give my constituent to reassure they that the uk be do all it can to de escalate bring thing back to normal and hold the perpetrator to account 
 we be focus on hold the perpetrator to account i be familiar with the issue face pakistan in relation to acute natural disaster i be there during the disastrous flood in and i recognise the importance of the indus river system in both india and pakistan and of co operation between the state to manage that vital system there be a great deal of speculation about what have be decide and what have be agree but we understand that diplomatic treaty be be hold in abeyance and that there be still space for a long term answer to some of these question 
 as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on british hindus and with a constituency that contain a considerable indian and pakistani community i be especially shock and sadden by the news of the horrific murder of people last tuesday and i have receive many email from constituent raise their own concern of particular concern be report of the targeting of hindus and christians such race base terror be unacceptable anywhere in the world what step be the government take to encourage both india and pakistan to investigate these terrible crime and to ensure that line of communication be keep open to avoid a further escalation of the conflict 
 we be encourage direct line of communication and we be of course encourage pakistan to provide all possible assistance with the investigation of these horrific crime 
 may i associate myself with the comment of the minister and other member who have condemn the killing of innocent people 
 give that tension between india and pakistan be run high and result in arrest do the minister agree with i and with other who have raise the point that we must not let this issue boil over into our street if anything we should be work to convey a message of peace and hope to that part of the world in the light of the tit for tat action be undertake by pakistan and india do the minister also agree that we need to encourage the holding of an open independent inquiry to establish the fact ensure accountability and help to restore calm that would be far well for the world than india and pakistan nuclear power go to war 
 my hon friend be of course right peace and calm be vital for community here and across the world the state be talk to each   other which be welcome india ’s concern for its own security be understandable in the light of such a horrific incident it be clearly take step to try to establish the fact as well it can and it will have british support to do so 
 at a time of such tragedy language be incredibly important all of we in all part of the house condemn this terrorist incident but a number of my constituent have be particularly concerned about the bbc ’s describe it as militance rather than as what it be a terrorist attack will the minister use his position to make representation to the bbc to ensure that it understand the importance of the language it use 
 i resist call for ministers to police the bbc ’s language too much but let i be clear this be a horrific terrorist attack and that be the view of the british government 
 we have see the kargil incursion the chittisinghpura attack the hijacking of air india flight the attack on gandhinagar the attack on the lok sabah itself the attack on the taj hotel in mumbai and the suicide bomb attack at pulwama that kill people and now tourist have be murder at pahalgam that be just a short list of the activity of pakistan base terror organisation such as jaish e mohammad lashkar e taiba and its derivative include the resistance front that have take place since you and i be elect to the house mr speaker they destabilise international security between nuclear state and cause unwarranted tension in community relation here be it not time to make the support that we give to pakistan conditional on its finally deal with and close down the terrorist training camp that it harbour 
 we expect all our friend to work closely on the share international scourge of terrorism pakistan itself have face a series of deeply damaging terrorist attack in recent month and year and we press pakistan as we press all our ally in the region to take the step that be necessary to investigate not only the terrorist threat that face it but those that face its neighbour
