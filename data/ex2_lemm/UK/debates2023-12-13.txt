the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 if she will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the government ’s kinship care policy on carer and child with protect characteristic 
 we comply with the public sector equality duty in consider how our policy decision impact on individual with protect characteristic and we have comply with that obligation in draft and develop the kinship strategy 
 the annual survey of the kinship charity show that the majority of kinship carer be woman typically grandmother many of whom be affect by the gender pay gap and a rise retirement age yet they be often force to give up or reduce work to take on kinship care responsibility what progress have the minister make with the department for business and trade in finally secure pay leave for kinship carer so that they be not force out of the labour force 
 as the hon lady know we be commit to publish the ever strategy for kinship carer before the end of the year she will not have long to wait 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle inequality for disabled people 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle inequality for disabled people 
 in july the government set out our long term vision in the national disability strategy over the summer we consult on the disability action plan which will set out the immediate action that the government be take in together with other relevant reform be take forward by my cabinet colleague those measure seek to tackle inequality and improve the daily life of disabled people 
 the neuro drop in centre in lancaster provide a unique support network for those affect by neurological condition but my constituent who travel there by bus from bowerham to torrisholme be a wheelchair user and if there be already be a wheelchair user on the bus he can not board do the minister think that that be fair 
 that do not sound terribly fair at all i be very interested in what the hon lady share with the house of course we have a transport minister answer question today so i be very happy for we to look at that issue for she if she write to i i will see that the matter be look at 
 sense have find that because of the tory cost of living crisis a large proportion of disabled people will not be see family buy present or even celebrate christmas this year yet the government be plough ahead with change that will ramp up sanction and that could remove nhs prescription and access to legal aid for disabled people why at every single opportunity do the government hit people with disability the hard 
 i apologise mr speaker because the transport minister i mention be not come today they might be on the bus i will pick up the issue raise by   the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith   in further response 
 the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck   will know that we be make cost of living payment once again to support people in need in fact that support total over £ if she be concerned for her constituent and rightly so she should definitely direct they to help for households the benefit calculator on gov.uk and the help to claim process there be also the household support fund which be about £ this year i hope she be satisfied that we be absolutely support the most vulnerable 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the disability pay gap have rise under the conservatives from in to in labour will act to close the gap and to support disabled people by introduce disability pay gap reporting for large employer that be good for disabled people good for business and good for our economy so why will the government not follow suit 
 we be absolutely committed to support disabled people frankly we be very proud of our record we have support more than disabled people into work hit the target year early and we be rewire our benefit system to give a renew focus on what people can do rather than what they can not so that there be opportunity for people to improve their life and get the pay that they want through their employment 
 disabled people be also be hit hard by the conservative cost of living crisis that my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck   refer to on average the extra cost of disability be equivalent to of household income before housing cost i would ask the minister what discussion she have have with the minister for disabled people about this important issue but there be no minister for disabled people will she tell the house when will be appoint 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that point as she have rightly say we should all aim to reduce the disability employment gap and that remain our goal to answer her question i be the lead on those matter for equalities oral question i be disappointed that i be not enough for she today but i do lead on those matter for the department all department for work and pensions ministers take responsibility across our portfolio for remove barrier to progress and update to ministerial appointment will be make under the usual process 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i reassure my hon friend that she be more than enough for i there be a really worrying article in the times a few day ago that talk about the invisibility of disabled people when make employment application we know that disabled people be less likely to be in work and to take up opportunity for entrepreneurship perhaps my hon friend could highlight the important work she be do as the minister for social mobility to make sure that across government there be a real drive to help disabled people get the good opportunity to work 
 i thank my right hon friend and other hon member for their interest in this area as the minister responsible for social mobility i be take direct leadership on access to employment particularly in respect of application and recruitment that suit disable people to get into work because if we do not get they into work they can not progress that be why we have billion of pound in our back to work plan and why we be support vulnerable people by uprating benefit by in april equally 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the effectiveness of the disability action plan 
 the disability action plan ’s accessible week consultation close on   october since then official have be carefully consider all the consultation response and work closely with other government departments we have lead discussion with the cross government ministerial disability champion before we publish the final disability action plan 
 some people live with a disability they be statistically less likely to have a job or any qualification or to own their own home and sadly their child be twice as likely to become victim of crime will the minister ensure that the disability action plan address all those issue 
 i thank my hon friend for his typical care in this area i assure he and the house that significant work be take place across government in those area where disabled people have tell we that their outcome must be a priority whether that be in education employment or care we be focus on that and the disability action plan will complement that work we   be use the insight from the week consultation to deliver improvement in all the area that matter most to disabled people in order to improve their daily life 
 some people in the uk be live with a brain injury will the minister make sure that the final version of the plan lay out precisely what the government intend to do in relation to people who have have a brain injury the good news be that with really good neurorehabilitation people can be give back not just their life but a real quality of life we owe that to they do n’t we 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that issue my father live with a brain injury for over year and my annual christmas card this year come from headway sussex through its art therapy work so i assure he that at the dwp i think about the impact of brain injury on a daily basis 
 if she will have discussion with the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs on the government ’s response to report of gender base violence by hamas since october 
 it be crucial that the international community recognise the atrocity commit by hamas and that hamas be hold to account for their barbarism that be why we be engage with partner include the un to ensure that perpetrator be hold to account for their depravity 
 the uk remain a global leader in eradicate sex base violence our prevent sexual violence in conflict initiative have £ in funding to combat conflict relate sexual violence and ensure that survivor access redress and support on   november we announce a furth £ to support grassroots woman ’s right organisation tackle sex base violence 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer hostage who have be release have report hamas atrocity such as be subject to physical and sexual violence in captivity the israeli health service also report that hostage have be drug to make they look happy on video will my right hon friend join i in condemn hamas for do that and in demand that the international committee of the red cross have access to every single of the hostage immediately 
 i share my hon friend ’s horror it be extremely distressing to hear all those report and i do unequivocally condemn the sexual violence that be be report we continue to engage regularly with partner include the un i will pick up the point that he raise directly with the foreign office to see whether we can do what he ask it do sound like something that need the involvement of the red cross but we will make sure that we co ordinate across government for a dedicated response on this issue 
 will the uk use its seat on the un human rights council to raise the use of gender base violence   on   october and to secure a clear condemnation from its member of the rape murder and torture perpetrate against woman by hamas on   october 
 i thank the hon lady for her question yes we will we have raise the report of sexual violence attack on   october   with un women and with the office of the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict i will make sure that we continue to do this and to impress upon international organisation that the whole world need to respond to this 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential for bias in artificial intelligence technology in relation to people with protect characteristic 
 we be have cross governmental discussion about ai and we be very clear that ai system should not undermine people ’s right or discriminate unfairly this be a key topic of discussion at the ai safety summit and it remain a priority for the government fairness be a core principle of our ai regulatory framework and uk regulator be already take action to address ai relate bias and discrimination 
 in that case be the minister aware of the finding of the institute for the future of work that the use of artificial intelligence 
 present risk to equality potentially embed bias and discrimination 
 and that auditing ai tool use in recruitment 
 be often inadequate in ensure compliance with uk equality law good governance and good practice 
 what step be be take across the whole of government to ensure that appropriate assessment be make of the equality impact of the use of ai in the workplace 
 that be exactly why we have the ai safety summit at which more than country plus the eu sign up to the bletchley declaration in march we publish the ai regulation white paper which set out our step towards establish a regulatory framework for ai i repeat that ai system should not undermine people ’s right or discriminate unfairly and that be of the core principle set out in the white paper 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the risk of perpetuate inequality and the problem that arise from solely automate decision making be well accept both in recruitment and as we hear early in the challenge for disabled people in access employment but also in other context such as immigration and welfare benefit however the uk government ’s data protection and digital information bill be liberalise the use of artificial intelligence in decision making and reduce the right of people to appeal those decision do the minister understand that it be increasingly important to make sure that we mitigate risk such as encode bias what be the specific plan to do that 
 i do not recognise the hon member ’s assessment but let i say this context matter the risk of bias will vary depend on the specific way in which ai be use that be why we be let the regulator describe and illustrate what fairness mean within their sector because they will be able to apply great context to their discussion the risk of discrimination should be assess in context and guidance should be issue that be specific to the sector that be why we be prepare and publish guidance to support the regulator we will then encourage and support they to develop joint guidance we will be work with the equality and human rights commission the information commissioner ’s office and the employment agency standards inspectorate 
 what step the government be take to help ensure socioeconomic equality 
 what step the government be take to help ensure socioeconomic equality 
 the government be commit to boost economic growth across the uk and ensure opportunity be spread as widely as possible education be the most significant lever to create opportunity and reduce inequality and i be pleased that conservative reform have see child in school in england excel in the pisa programme for international student assessment score england significantly outperform the average rise from for mathematic in to this year and from for read in to this year 
 when it come to economic equality physical mobility be critical as the minister may know i be joint chair of the all party parliamentary group for leave behind neighbourhood and our recent report talk about how limited public transport connectivity frustrate access to education and employment i have constituent in place such as trimdon and fishburn who can not get to the job in aycliffe which be only mile away do the minister agree it be imperative that when fund for local transport be determine the opportunity to enhance social mobility be see as critical 
 i agree with my hon friend who raise an important point about how connectivity create access and generate social mobility the department for transport be work to put the need of current and potential user at the heart of the operation of the transport system and network north our new £ plan will improve our country ’s transport perhaps my hon friend will write to i about the specific issue because some of those duty will fall to his local council and i want to know what it be do with the money we be give it to improve access 
 this conservative government have do more for the people of blyth valley than any other government—[laughter and they have bring much need investment in employment opportunity for my constituents—[interruption 
 order please i can not hear the question obviously there must have be something funny but i do not hear it 
 thank you mr speaker this conservative government have do more for the people of blyth valley than any other government and have bring much need investment in employment opportunity for my constituent follow decade of labour neglect will my right hon friend please assure i that continue to close the gap between the north and the south remain the government ’s high priority 
 i be delighted to assure my hon friend of that he be an effective advocate for his constituency and he know that this government have be invest in blyth valley we have give an £ boost to regenerate housing £ for new high tech training equipment £ for extended cctv provision and a furth £ for our long term plan for town our investment in blyth show that only the conservatives can deliver there and level up and close the gap be a priority for this government 
 some of child in newcastle upon tyne central be grow up in poverty of household be in fuel poverty and a of adult be estimate to be in problematic debt do the minister agree that a government who can not deliver economic prosperity for work people in the north east be a government who can not deliver on socioeconomic equality 
 this government be deliver of course we recognise that there be people who be in need and that be why we be do everything across all departments to deliver for they for example our support family programme have fund local area to help almost family with multiple and complex need to make significant positive change to their life the programme be work and evaluation find that the proportion of child on the programme go into care reduce by a and the number of adult receive custodial sentence decrease by a quarter there be so much we can say i know we be run out of time mr speaker so perhaps the hon lady would like i to write to she 
 thing that can militate against socioeconomic equality particularly for the elderly and most vulnerable be access to care staff the rate of remuneration be 61p per mile go down to 25p per mile after the mile and those figure have not be revise upwards since it mean that wonderful people in my constituency be very often lose money travel about and that do not do much for recruitment either will the minister agree to talk to the treasury and the scottish government about do something about that 
 i be sure that colleague in the appropriate department will have hear the hon gentleman ’s question and will be able to provide a more detailed response 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 in my last topical statement i speak about the unacceptable rise in antisemitism and hostility towards the jewish community since   october and i be update the house on what further action i can take to promote social cohesion the equality act be a shield against discrimination and the public sector equality duty be part of that shield it be particularly important that all public authority take the duty seriously to ensure that they understand how to comply with the duty i will be publish update guidance shortly i will then write to leader of public authority that have a key role in promote social cohesion to show how they can foster good relation promote equality of opportunity and eliminate unlawful discrimination 
 i thank the minister for that answer as the women ’s budget group have rightly point out woman be more reliant on benefit due to care give role and they have be disproportionately impact by regressive social security change since what consideration have the minister give to the abolition of the poverty induce benefit cap and the hat child limit to prevent further poverty and destitution among woman and child and will she raise that matter with her cabinet colleague 
 the hon gentleman will know that we disagree with the proposition that he have set out and we have say so time and again at this dispatch box we believe that the child policy be important we know that there be a cost of living crisis cause by rise energy cost and the war in ukraine which be cause by russia the government be do everything we can to limit the impact on household 
 a museum of london report have bizarrely conclude that black people be more likely to die from medieval plague will the minister for women and equalities ensure that such sensationalist research finding and wake archaeology have no impact at all on current health and pandemic policy 
 i do agree i be not even sure whether we can call it just sensationalist or wake the research apparently be base on phrenology which be a completely discredit type of science i agree with my hon friend that this type of research be damaging to trust to social cohesion and even to trust in health service i have write to the director of the museum of london to express my concern 
 i call the opposition spokesperson 
 in woman ’s life expectancy in the poor part of the uk be almost year short than those in the most affluent year ago labour introduce a socioeconomic duty in the equality act to make the nhs and other public body tackle this gap why have ministers fail to implement it 
 the hon lady be right that the socioeconomic duty she reference be not commence in england it be in scotland however and the figure be bad there which show that the duty be not the solution to the problem she raise 
 my north devon constituency be in the low quartile for social mobility what step be my right hon friend take to improve social mobility outcome for remote rural and coastal community 
 i agree with my hon friend that the circumstance of a person ’s birth or where they live should not be a barrier to social mobility that be why we have establish thing such as the social mobility pledge consortium with business and have sign up there be community renewal fund project serve her constituency and the wide area and £ from the share prosperity fund to achieve those aim 
 the etherton review be publish month ago and we be due to have a statement later today may i seek assurance from the minister that the department will work with the ministry of defence to ensure that its recommendation be publish at pace 
 i completely agree with the hon lady it be a very important review and i be glad that my right hon friend the prime minister make an apology at the dispatch box there will be a statement later and i suggest that she ask the defence minister a question at that point 
 every year woman pass through immigration detention include centre such as yarl ’s wood in my constituency many of those woman have be traffic or be victim of sexual abuse i be work with a group women for refugee women to provide a snapshot of the background of these woman will the minister agree to meet we to analyse the result of their finding 
 i would of course be happy to meet my hon friend woman who have survive trafficking or sexual abuse be detain only when the evidence of vulnerability in their individual case be outweigh by immigration removal consideration victim of torture have their case consider by a single specialist team autonomous of general caseworker and victim of modern slavery undergo a need assessment to identify recovery need 
 gender bias play a key role in the misdiagnosis and under diagnosis of condition such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism in woman and girl what action be the government take to ensure that every girl with special educational need receive support from their school or college as she be entitle to by law 
 we be work with more than integrate care board across the country to improve the timeline for diagnosis of autism and adhd some icb be do particularly well but other need a lot more help and support 
 many people with impaired mobility condition depend on their car for the freedom to live the life they want to lead will the government therefore crack down on labour ’s anti car policy in local government such as the expansion of the ultra low emission zone and low traffic network and the building over of station car park 
 this government be clear in our condemnation of labour ’s attack on motorist whether it be in london or wales that be why in the summer   the prime minister order a review of low traffic neighbourhood which be make some part of london inaccessible for disabled people whether they be use public transport or car 
 keep prisons single sex have disclose that police force be still fail to adequately record the sex of offender at birth and sometimes record self identification this can have a considerable effect on criminal justice datum will the minister take any step to ensure that the correct datum be give so that appropriate analysis can be give and we do not have skewed information 
 that be something that my department be work on the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we need to ensure that datum be accurate that people understand what be be record and that this do not have an impact on how public service be deliver if he have any further information that he would like to share i would very much like to see if there be specific constituency circumstance we can look into

 this be an appalling tragedy and my thought remain with all those concern i absolutely understand the strength of feeling on this it be this government who set up the inquiry which i participate in and we fully understand the need for action the government crucially have already accept the moral case for compensation and acknowledge that justice need to be deliver for the victim my right hon friend the minister for the cabinet office will update the house on our next step on the infected blood inquiry shortly 
 the tax cut in the autumn statement be extremely welcome but in order to go far and get the tax burden as low as possible accurate and robust economic modelling be require the office for budget responsibility have be habitually wrong and we have the spectacle last week of the head of the obr say that his late forecast might be £ out will my right hon friend the prime minister commit to find a well system of financial modelling so that we can get taxis low 
 as my hon friend know the obr have bring great transparency and independence to the forecasting on which government policy be base but he be right it be require to produce an assessment of the accuracy of its fiscal and economic forecast at least once a year but crucially as he acknowledge thank to our management of the economy and the fact that we have halve inflation and control borrowing we have now deliver the large tax cut in a generation and they will benefit family up and down the country from january 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 yesterday we hear of the tragic death of a young man on the bibby stockholm i know that the whole house will want to send our deep condolence to his family and friend we must never let this happen again 
 i would also like to mark the retirement of my colleague and friend mark drakeford the minister of wales mark commit his life to public service and live his value every day quietly and patiently mark have be a titan of labour and welsh politic we thank he for his service and wish he well 
 christmas be a time of peace on earth and good will to all have anyone tell the tory party 
 well christmas be also a time for family and under the conservatives we do have a record number of they at the beginning of the year i set out some priority that this government would deliver for the british people and over the course of the year we have inflation halve the economy grow debt fall action on the long waiter the boat down by a and crucially as we hear from my hon friend   the member for buckingham greg smith tax cut come to help work family in the new year 
 the prime minister can spin it all he like but the whole country can see that yet again the tory party be in meltdown and everyone else be pay the price he have kick the can down the road but in   the last week his mp have say of he that he be not capable enough he be inexperienced he be arrogant and he be a really bad politician”—[interruption government member be shout but this be what they say come on who be it who say he be a really bad politician hand up interruption they be shout well what about inexperienced”—who be that or there have to be some hand for this—“he ’s get to go interruption they be shy 
 apparently the prime minister be hold a christmas party next week—[interruption 
 order it be christmas—[hon member hear hear!”]—but you might not want the christmas present that i could give you 
 apparently the prime minister be hold a christmas party next week how be the invite list look 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for all the comment but he should hear what they have to say about he interruption 
 order do you want to be the it be christmas and i be go to hear this my constituent be go to have a christmas like everyone else and they want to know whether their christmas be go to be affect so i want less of it from all side 
 government members have obviously find the donkey for their nativity the search for wise man might take a little long while they fight among themselves there be a country out here that be not be govern where more than people be pay hundred more a month on their mortgage energy bill be go back up in january the economy be shrink again nhs waiting list be at an all time high do the prime minister not think that the government would be well off fix the mess they have already make rather than scramble to create new one 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about governing but he spend his question talk about political tittle tattle what a joke let we get on to the substance he mention those thing what be the news we have just hear in the last week what be the most important thing the most important thing be education because that be how we spread opportunity in our country what have we learn where be the school perform well in the united kingdom it be in england thank to the reform of this conservative government they be rise up the league table give our kid the start they need where be they plummet it be in labour run wales 
 the prime minister talk about child nearly child be go to be homeless this christmas more than ever before that be a shocking state of affair and it should shame the government instead of more social housing house building be set to collapse instead of ban no fault eviction thousand of family be at risk of homelessness rather than indulge his back benchers swanne around in their   faction and their star chamber pretend to be member of the mafia when will he get a grip and focus on the country 
 let we just look at the fact rough sleep in this country be down by since its peak thank to the effort of this government there be hundred of thousand few child in poverty today thank to this government and when it come to home building again what do we do we have have the datum just this last week in the last year an almost record number of new home be deliver more than in any year under the last labour government 
 and child homeless this christmas and the prime minister be utterly tone deaf the rise in homelessness show how these tory crisis merge and grow and damage the country family like the bradys in wiltshire both parent work full time with young child force out of their home of year by a no fault eviction now live in their van or year old liam walker homeless this christmas he write a letter to santa say please can i have a forever home i do not want any new toy i just want all my old toy out of storage i just want we to be happy again if there be anything that could shame this government into put the country then it be surely this little boy 
 if the right hon and learn gentleman really care about build homes—[interruption no if he really care about build home when there be an opportunity in this house to back our plan to reform defective eu law to unlock new home what do he do he go in front of the camera and say thing and then he come in here and block it typical shameless opportunism 
 be that really the prime minister ’s christmas message to liam cocoon in his party management breakfast he just can not see the 
 order mr cleverly please it be christmas i want a little bit of silence and i be go to get it way or another that apply to each side 
 cocoon in his party management breakfast the prime minister just can not see the country in front of he and what they have do 
 i will finish by thank hard work family across britain who keep our country go it have be an impossibly difficult year for so many i want to pay special tribute to our key worker particularly those in emergency service and those serve abroad in our force who even at this time of year be do the vital work of protect their country i wish everyone include member on the conservative benches a very happy and peaceful new year will the prime minister join i 
 i think the right hon and learn gentleman miss that i pay tribute to our emergency worker at the beginning of the session but let we see because i think it be important he talk about work family of course i want to make sure that we support work family and that be what we be actually deliver all he have to offer they be borrow £ a year all that will do be push up their mortgage rate   and push up their taxis meanwhile what have we do we have deliver tax cut for million of work family boost the national living wage recruit more nurse and more police officer improve our school cut the cost of net for work family cut the boat crossing by a and halve inflation that be the difference we be get on and deliver for work britain 
 as the world struggle to agree the future of the ° commitment in wimbledon we be keen to do our bit to help my campaign to make electric vehicle charge access more widespread can i ask my right hon friend for early christmas present will he speak to our right hon friend the chancellor to ask he to look again at the unfair differential rate of vat on public and private charging point will he ask our right hon friend the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to look at the byelaw that stop local council make on street parking and charge more accessible 
 i be happy to tell my hon friend that the chancellor have already authorise more than £ of investment to support our transition to emission vehicle and that we be well on track to reach our target of charge point by i can also tell he that we will consult on amend the national planning policy framework to ensure that it prioritise the roll out of charge point on top the funding of almost £ to support local authority to spread they out so that all our family have access to they when they need it 
 i call the scottish national party leader 
 will the prime minister please share his christmas message for child be bomb in gaza this winter 
 nobody want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than necessary we urgently need more humanitarian pause to get all the hostage out and to get life save aid into gaza to alleviate the suffering of the palestinian people we have be consistent in support a sustainable ceasefire which mean that hamas must stop launch rocket into israel and release all the hostage 
 if the current action of the israeli government continue it be estimate that almost more child will die between now and christmas day in the united nations last night our friend and ally in france ireland canada spain and australia join other nation to vote with courage care and compassion for a ceasefire the uk shamefully abstain how can the prime minister possibly explain why nation be wrong yet westminster be right 
 as i have say consistently we be deeply concerned about the devastating impact of the fighting in gaza on the civilian population too many people have lose their life already that be something that we have stress and something that i stress personally to prime minister netanyahu just last week what we be do practically be to get more aid into   gaza and the foreign secretary be appoint a uk humanitarian co ordinator in my conversation last week with prime minister netanyahu i press he on open up the kerem shalom cross so that more aid can flow in and we be actively explore the opportunity for maritime corridor something on which the uk be well place to lead i can give the hon gentleman my assurance that we will work night and day to get more aid to those who desperately need it 
 we expect our young folk to remain in education or training until they be but many lack transport to get there along with the amazing headteacher of alston moor federation gill jackson i secure fund from the council to get her student to college and press the council for a half a pound bursary scheme to extend youth travel more widely but we should not have to do this to secure equality of opportunity and true levelling up will the prime minister look to mandate and support council to provide post-16 transport so that all our young people in town city and rural area can reach their next stage in life 
 my hon friend and the headteacher of alston moor federation gill jackson have do a fantastic job in secure more funding i wish she well for what i believe be her upcoming retirement 
 as my hon friend know our school travel policy ensure that no child be prevent from access education by a lack of transport not only do we have home to school travel policy but the to bursary fund can be use to support young people with transport cost and more generally we be take action to keep bus fare cap at £ however i will happily ensure that my hon friend secure a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss his proposal far 
 the prime minister will be aware of unionist concern about the need to remove the irish sea border create by the protocol which disrupt the uk ’s internal market will he bring forward legislation to amend the united kingdom internal market act and both guarantee and future proof northern ireland ’s unfettered access to the uk ’s internal market in all scenario 
 i thank my right hon friend i recognise the need to do more in this area and i can confirm to he that the government do stand ready to legislate to protect northern ireland ’s integral place in the united kingdom and the uk internal market alongside an agreement to restore the executive we can do this apace and i know that my right hon friend and his colleague be work hard to achieve that our nhs our police officer and the most vulnerable in northern ireland need devolve government urgently and i think it be incumbent on all of we to work to work day and night to help to achieve that 
 mr speaker mp from across the house sign   my open letter to supermarket ask to have a buy british button online i be pleased to announce that last week morrison be the supermarket to implement a buy british tab this give consumer the choice to have home grow produce and also   support our farmer will the prime minister join my call to other supermarket to have the courage to make the change and follow suit 
 this government will always back our farmer and i welcome the work of my hon friend and the national farmers union on this issue we absolutely support call for industry lead action on this topic and i welcome the news of the buy british button at morrisons we will continue to encourage all retailer to do all they can to showcase the incredible food produce right here in the united kingdom 
 the marriage plan of thousand of couple be dash last week by the sudden announcement of a big increase in the salary requirement for a spouse visa can the prime minister give any reassurance to those with well advanced marriage plan that now appear to have be scupper and to family already in the uk who need to extend their stay but who will not comply with the new rule can he at least offer some transitional help for family or do his party ’s support for the family now apply only to the highly pay 
 we have a long stand principle that anyone bring dependant to the uk must be able to support they financially we should not expect this to be do at the taxpayer ’s expense the threshold have not be raise in over a decade and it be right that we have now bring it in line with the median salary the family immigration route do contain provision for exceptional circumstance as the right hon gentleman know but more generally it be also right to look at transitional arrangement to ensure that they be fair and i can tell he that the home office be actively look at this and will set out further information shortly

 the prime minister be rightly focus on take long term decision to improve the life of people in this country so can i make a suggestion our mental health legislation be year old and we make a manifesto commitment in and to reform the mental health act because people with learn disability and autism who be section under the act be be keep in inappropriate accommodation for long period people section under the act be not receive the compassionate care they deserve and be in a sense criminalise they have their mental health condition re stigmatise by the act of section 
 in the absence of a bill in the king ’s speech will the prime minister agree to meet i and other like minded colleague to discuss how we might take forward the reform of the mental health act because it simply be not fit for the century

 the most pressing issue face family be the cost of living that be why this government have deliver what we say which be to halve inflation and not only that we be supplement it with significant tax cut which will benefit work family from january—£450 for a typical person in work demonstrate that we be absolutely on the side of hard work family this government be cut their taxis

 while the home secretary be in rwanda sign his new treaty his department put out a contract to manage small boat arrival until at a cost of £ to the taxpayer do that not show that even the home office do not think the minister ’s plan will work 
 that be a total mischaracterisation of what be put out which be an advert not a commitment i be glad that the hon lady now care about this issue not something we have see previously from labour our track record be clear we have get the number of small boat arrival down this year by over a that be what we be do about it the labour party be vote against every measure that we have take 
 i chair the caucus of conservative members of parliament who have britain ’s long river flow through their constituency and we have present a business case to the chancellor for £ to try to manage the river holistically our constituency be now face flooding every year cause damage to our business and our community this evening i have an adjournment debate on flooding of the river severn will the prime minister take an interest because the business case show a gross value add uplift for the west midland of more than £ if we can manage and tame britain ’s long river 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that i recall that he and i speak about it when i be chancellor and i praise he for his work and    leadership on this issue in his local area i will make sure that the chancellor do look at the business case my hon friend will know that we have significantly increase funding for flood defence to over £ protect hundred of thousand more home but if it be an interesting opportunity for the chancellor i be sure he will take that up 
 what be bad lose your whatsapp message as a tech bro lose £ to fraud as chancellor preside over the big fall in living standard in our history or desperately cling on to power when you have become even more unpopular than boris johnson 
 what matter to i be deliver for the british people and that be exactly what we be do 
 for the final question i call theresa villiers 
 give the appalling report of sexual violence commit by hamas on   october   and the risk that hostage could have that treatment inflict on they as well will the prime minister raise this issue in international forum so   that the international community demand strongly humanitarian access to hostage in gaza 
 the report of sexual violence perpetrate by hamas be deeply shocking we have raise our concern with the united nations a fortnight or so ago and we be engage with the israeli government to consider what far support we can provide more broadly we continue to do everything we can to ensure that all hostage can return safely to their family include the british hostage and those with link to the uk my right hon friend can rest assure that the foreign secretary and i be work tirelessly to bring about their safe return 
 with permission i would like to set out the government ’s formal response to lord etherton ’s lgbt veteran independent review 
 the treatment of those armed force personnel perceive to be lgbt between and have long be a stain on the conscience of the nation last year this government ask lord etherton to conduct a review into the impact of the historic ban on homosexuality in defence follow the call for evidence the inquiry receive response from those who be dismiss or discharge because of their sexual orientation from those who feel compel to resign purchase their release from service or curtail their contract because of the ban and from those who while not part of the lgbt community witness the trauma of such antediluvian rule as family member colleague or friend etherton paint an unflinche picture of the most shocking treatment of gay member of our defence community by an institutionally homophobic organisation 
 out of the blue when apply to be a reservist in i be ask if i be gay even then that strike i as hugely inappropriate but that strong sense of impropriety which have stay with i for year pale into insignificance against the wall of hurt experience by lgbt people in the course of their defence journey much of it evidence by terence etherton 
 different member of the community have be impact differently yet for each and every the repercussion be enduring with the tentacle reach into all dimension of their life since sadly we can not turn back the clock but we can apologise for decade of hurt that be what the prime minister do after lord etherton publish his report in july and what the defence secretary and chief of service have do in their turn however apology alone be not enough 
 etherton demand more and we agree that be why the government take step to right historic wrong even before the report be publish in we begin hand back medal to anyone who have have they withhold or remove because of their sexuality medal matter they should never have be snatch away in december we remove the barrier that prevent those live with hiv from join the military and back in june the home office extend its disregard and pardon scheme wipe historic conviction for same sex sexual activity the extension be especially important for veteran because it broaden the eligibility to include any same sex conviction that would not be a crime today thereby cover service disciplinary offence 
 in addition we publish guidance help to make lgbt veteran aware of thing to which they might not have feel they be entitle that include information on mental and physical health support as well as benefit that all veteran be able to receive not to mention the armed force veteran badge which i hand out to a number of veteran at this year ’s pride event in london 
 however today we go far still i can announce we be accept the intent behind all of lord etherton ’s recommendation in fact to date we have already implement almost half of they we have establish a legacy website to host the review the government   response and information collect by the review include testimony through op courage we be ensure a focus on the non combat mental health impact of the ban 
 significantly in some instance we have go above and beyond the review recommendation for example etherton advise make certain restorative measure available for the next of kin of deceased veteran but we have create a broad definition of next of kin namely person of sufficient interest recognise the impact the ban may have have on lgbt veteran relationship and ensure that those they would have nominate as next of kin be see as such next year will see the expand roll out of the armed force veteran card to all veteran who serve in the uk armed force before and plan for a veteran memorial at the national memorial arboretum be also now under way 
 today we be throw open the front door to our lgbt veteran today we ask they to apply or register an interest for restorative measure that be relevant to they include individual apology letter return of beret and cap badge amendment to veteran service history and additional personal testimony to evidence collect by the review that testimony will eventually become part of the historic record in the national 
 archives signal that our lgbt veteran will never be forget and that year of national shame will never be expunge and affirm and celebrate the part that those veteran play in our country ’s history i strongly urge colleague across the house to encourage lgbt constituent to come forward read the online guide and complete the application form for restorative measure importantly the form will also allow veteran to indicate their interest in apply for a financial award when eligibility be confirm and that scheme go live 
 lord etherton recommend that an appropriate award should be make to affected veteran with the government ’s overall exposure cap at £ we have agree to that in full but in order to develop the scheme we will need to gain a much well understanding of what the affected cohort look like hence we be call for veteran to indicate their interest on the form that go live today that datum will help official and the community work together to design a fair and equitable scheme for distribute the fund that lord etherton have call for and that we accept there will be an opportunity for a full debate in the new year once the financial award scheme be mature and we have the benefit of the datum capture through the front door that i be open today 
 once again i place on record my gratitude to lord etherton and his team for their outstanding work compile a comprehensive and deeply affect report i thank fight with pride and our working group include trust stakeholder and independent lgbt veteran who not only make sure that their voice be hear but help steer our response throughout they will not seek it but may i mark out craig jones and caroline paige in particular for their part in bring we to where we be today above all i pay tribute to all those who come forward in the place those veteran show tremendous courage in chronicle traumatic experience which for many have be suppress cause grief and groundless silent shame for decade 
 today ’s defence have come a long way since we can not change the past but we can make the future well in accept lord etherton ’s recommendation we salute a slight generation and ensure that its successor can hold their head high in a place that want they value they and honour they i be today place a copy of the government ’s response in the library and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the minister for early sight of his statement 
 with due respect to the right hon gentleman who be a diligent minister this statement should have be make by the defence secretary the last be this no show from the defence secretary downgrade the importance that the government give in july to back up the prime minister ’s apology to lgbt+ veteran crucially it undermine the confidence that lgbt veteran will have in the government be serious about fully implement the etherton review and fully right the injustice arise from the ban on lgbt people serve in our armed force until 
 this be unfinished business for labour we lift the ban in we argue for the etherton review in the armed forces bill we welcome its publication and recommendation we again thank lord etherton for his review and the inclusive way in which he conduct it 
 at the heart of the review be the statement of those who be victim of the overt often brutal homophobic policy we pay tribute to they for share their experience and give their testimony like the minister i also pay tribute to group such as fight with pride which have campaign for justice along with backing from wide veteran organisation such as the royal british legion and help for hero this be a cause that unite the house 
 the previous defence secretary   the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace say in a powerful and move statement in july that he have 
 decide specifically that a debate in the house should take place 
 in order to 
 make sure that the house properly debate the report and the government ’s response to it 
 and not just the compensation scheme as the minister have imply will the government honour that promise to the house in full when will that debate take place to be clear the debate be of profound importance to veteran it should be a watershed moment for defence to move beyond the long shameful shadow of the past and to say in the future we be deeply proud of our lgbt veteran we honour your service to our nation you be part of we 
 the previous defence secretary also say 
 we will be very happy to work with the opposition to discuss our thinking on the recommendation ”—[official report   july vol c. 
 that have not happen the minister confirm today that the government 
 be accept the intent behind all of lord etherton ’s recommendation 
 the previous defence secretary point out that the government 
 may deliver a number 
 of those recommendation 
 in different way from that describe in the report ”—[official report   july vol c. 
 in his statement today the minister be not clear on that 
 we welcome progress on hand back medal on an armed force veteran badge and on a national memorial and we welcome the opening of registration of interest for the restorative measure but what action be the minister take to ensure that pension be fully restore to those who be misinformed that their pension right have be abolish and to guarantee that those whose evidence of investigation be destroy in do not lose out will he fully involve fight with pride and other veteran group in develop the compensation scheme and confirm that the scheme will make provision for the main group propose by fight with pride be the financial provision of £ in the ministry of defence budget and when do he aim to open up the scheme 
 we can not change the past but we can act to make amend we can honour the service of our lgbt veteran we can take pride in the inspiration that they provide to future generation that be what they and we across the house have the right to expect from ministers 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman i gently remind he that it be this government who set up the etherton review and it be this government who be carry out the recommendation i be proud of that he need to be very careful political party should not throw stone and i think that he would be the last to try to make party political point out of this subject matter to a large extent i think that we have resist that 
 i say that a full debate would happen in the new year but it must have the advantage of there be something meaningful to debate namely the financial element which i perceive to be the main point of likely controversy the right hon gentleman make it clear that we be all in agreement with the general thrust of the review so the controversy will be around how we structure the financial award i expect to be in a much well place in the new year to bring a suggestion to the house about how we might do that have consult other and observe the lesson of the past and experience in other country however the debate will not be confine to the finance i think that be imply by my use of the phrase full debate i hope that reassure he 
 on intent we have discuss before other way of deliver the same outcome to the satisfaction of veteran for example some veteran want a veteran badge that be different from the exist veteran badge some do not we have therefore design a ribbon which i have see the prototype for and i think that be a compromise that be an example of how we might do thing differently from the way describe by lord etherton lord etherton also talk about re list people on the navy army and air force list those list do not exist in the way they once do but we can publish those name if people want they publish via the london gazette that be a further example of do the same thing but in a different way 
 we debate pension in the summer when we last go round this particular buoy so the right hon gentleman will know that accrue pension right remain however some people be mislead when they leave the armed force and i strongly recommend that they refer to the guidance available on gov.uk the lgbt veteran support and next step page be very comprehensive and will take people through how they can apply for pension if they be not currently draw they 
 destroy document as the right hon gentleman will be aware be impossible to rediscover however there be tag attach to most of they that highlight the fact that material have be remove follow the advice of the association of chief police officers in so there be a marker at least of why those page be miss he will know too that acpo make those recommendation for very good reason at the time namely the desire of people who have be wrong to have reference to those wrong expunge from their record 
 i think that i have cover most of the right hon gentleman ’s point but i want to be as comprehensive as i possibly can so if i have miss anything out i will be happy to write to he 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement last week i meet fight with pride and of my constituent who i will not name because he have not give i permission to do so point come across in that meeting the be the importance of testimony he be a grown man who have be discharge in the 1980 and whose mother have receive a letter from his command officer out he as gay he be still traumatise and cry in my office last week this be about make sure that those testimony be hear the point be about have the debate on the floor of the house and not farm it out to westminster hall will the minister make sure that the debate happen on the floor of the house 
 the point be about financial redress i welcome the opportunity that my constituent will now have to feed in how he have be impact how he have live a life alone because he have carry that shame for all these year on behalf of my constituent and all the other lgbt serviceman and woman who suffer in that way i put it on the record that they want the opportunity to feed in their own story so that the financial redress address the harm they suffer 
 my right hon friend be right that testimony be vital those testimony will ultimately be lodge in the national archives and they will be part of our national story i urge she to encourage her constituent to log on and provide their testimony that be very important i can confirm that the debate will be on the floor of the house and not in westminster hall 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement in it he say 
 the treatment of those armed force personnel perceive to be lgbt between and have long be a stain on the conscience of the nation 
 it have also be a stain on the conscience of this place so i welcome his statement today and the work of lord etherton the apology the minister speak of be welcome but they will never take away the hurt or the terrible impact on the life of those affect by this institutional homophobia we must remember that while homosexuality be decriminalise in the ban on lgbt people in the armed force remain for more year that be decade of additional harm the reality be that all our veteran deserve respect and proper support and all the more so those ostracise and sham in that way 
 i recognise what the minister say on reparation but what assessment have he make of the adequacy of the reparation cap i wonder how that arbitrary cap on reparation payment will work particularly when as he say we be ask people to come forward how can he set a cap at this stage he say he be throw open the door today but that need to be do in a way that be as easy as possible for people to navigate and that work for all those affect no must be leave behind 
 my colleague keith brown msp himself a veteran be lead a member business debate in the scottish parliament today on fight with pride i be pleased that the minister speak about fight with pride and i would be keen to hear more about his reassurance that he will continue to work with that group and other to make sure that all lgbt veteran be properly and adequately support in the way that be right for each of they individually 
 the cap be part of the etherton report we have accept all recommendation and be work they through i do not know the hon lady will have to ask he but i suspect that lord etherton be mindful of the canadian experience in that regard the canadian scheme be not directly comparable to anything we might set up not least because of its scope but nevertheless there be precedent and i imagine lord etherton be mindful of that the hon lady be right to suggest that we should work with the community and she cite fight with pride in particular we have of course do that throughout and i pay tribute to they we will continue to work with they on the detail of the financial scheme as we work those out in the next few month 
 when fight with pride describe to i some time ago now the awful thing that we have do to lgbt veteran it be the bad injustice i have hear of in my year in parliament i welcome the etherton report which come about as a result and i welcome the minister ’s warm deep and expansive response to it today the fact that he be accept all recommendation be vital the debate be also important because veteran want to tell their tale through their own mp and i think that will be a great opportunity to do so however like the snp spokesperson i have a concern if the claim that come through the website that the minister describe come to more than £ will the government undertake to revisit the cap it would be crazy if £ be apply for but the cap say that only £ could be pay out 
 my hon friend will know full well that we can not write a blank cheque it be just not possible to do that lord etherton come up with £ which   be a significant amount of money he will have be mindful of other scheme albeit not directly comparable in this country and overseas that be why i believe the figure of £ be arrive at 
 i thank the minister for his statement recommendation of the report reference pension in his statement he say that people can apply for pension that have be accrue but some individual will have expect a pension for long service but be dismiss before they could accrue it will that be take into account and will next of kin be able to access those pension benefit 
 on the £ compensation which be recommendation of the report i be a little lose to understand how that will be distribute if the minister be go to come up with a scheme i suggest that he look at the post office horizon compensation scheme of which i have be on the advisory board for the last year help to develop it we be go to have to look at what element be take into account before we get to an accrue sum set up an advisory board or some steering group to work up the scheme would be a good idea and let i say that i do not think £ will even touch the side 
 there be precedent for such a scheme as i say i hope the right hon gentleman will be aware of the canadian scheme so we be not start with a blank sheet of paper and neither be lord etherton 
 on pension it be important that those who think they do not have an entitlement to pension look again because accrue pension be accrue pension and be not forfeit i take the right hon gentleman ’s point about pension that might have be accrue after the point at which individual leave the service there be no way of restore those pension and i hope he will understand that it would be incredibly difficult to do that so i be not go to give he any encouragement that that will form any part of our deliberation in relation to the financial award 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on woman in defence and of the defence committee ’s inquiry on woman in the armed force and female veteran i wholeheartedly welcome the statement and thank lord etherton for his work however i be also acutely aware of the strength of feeling on this matter which disproportionately affect woman and on the ban on pregnancy in our armed force our armed force still have pocket of misogyny poor leadership and inappropriate behaviour so will the minister continue to commit to root that out so that we can have a well environment for our armed force now and in the future 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and predecessor i pay tribute to she for the work that she have do not least in her report which have be extraordinarily impactful i agree with her we need to root out misogyny wherever it be find in defence i hope she will accept that thank to her report and the work of other we have take significant stride in that direction 
 on   may i speak in this house about the case of john beckett of my constituent he be a young man who have be in the royal navy for year and be go to train to be an officer along with other young man he be discharge for be gay all he have do be to have a civilian gay relationship about which we have tell his padre and his commanding officer and it be sufficient to have he discharge we can try to undo the wrong that be do to john beckett and other at the time i know that john get another job afterwards but can the minister possibly believe it be right that someone who commit no crime all he do be offend against the bigotry and prejudice of those who discharge he will potentially have to suffer financially for the rest of his life for what be do to he surely when we come to look at compensation the principle ought to be to not merely to rectify the hurt and the prejudice of the time but to ensure that people do not lose out financially for the rest of their life 
 that be why lord etherton have make his recommendation on financial award the structuring of that be yet to be determine but i just want to manage expectation as i suspect my canadian counterpart manage the expectation of the canadian community about the quantum i do not want people to think that all that financial loss will be restore to they it would be unwise of we to suggest that 
 the hon gentleman mention padre i hope that he read the government ’s response to the report in full if he do he will see that there be a specific section relate to chaplaincy and contrition on the part of chaplaincy about how some of its practitioner behave during that period which i think do they no credit at all i be very sorry to hear the testimony that he have just give i encourage his constituent to engage with the front door that i be launch today 
 i join other in thank lord etherton and all those who take the brave step of share their experience with he to inform the review and all recommendation although significant work clearly need to be do to follow through on those recommendation will my right hon friend consider how we can use this work to help part of the world that be still face up to this realisation they may need to do a wholesale piece of work to understand how they can change the way they deal with the lgbt community among their military personnel and veteran the change that we be see in the uk must not be stop from happen elsewhere in the world 
 none of we have a monopoly on this we be learn from the canadian experience and i expect other will learn from we across the board this country be look up to as a purveyor of norm and value of the high order when for example we train people from among our ally in how to conduct themselves as be happen right now those norm and value be inculcate include this material 
 in the late 80 i be very close to someone who suffer considerably as a result of this ban when she be throw out of the army for be a lesbian she have she   distinguished and lengthy period of military service cut short she be humiliate in the process and initially she find it hard to find employment commensurate with her skill and worth as a human being all that happen to she just because she be a woman who love other woman it be a ban base on sexual orientation nothing more nothing less her loss and that of other include pain and suffering loss of earning loss of employability and loss of pension right any compensation scheme should seek to put they back in the position that they would have be in be it not for that homophobic ban can the minister confirm that all those head of damage pain and suffering loss of earning loss of employability and loss of pension right will be take into account in the compensation scheme 
 the hon and learn lady will be aware that in the early 2000s the mod be take to court by a significant number of people who have be malign in the way she have describe the mod be find wanting and award be make at that time i can not give she the assurance that she seek because the financial award scheme it be a financial award scheme not a compensation scheme be still be work through but i hope that we will be able to come back to the house soon to describe at least the bare bone of what we have in mind 
 may i thank my right hon friend for his statement and for the tone in which he deliver it and express my pleasure that there will be a memorial at the national memorial arboretum in my constituency what discussion have he have with colleague in the home office regard any conviction that there may have be for servicemen in connection with their military service and their sexual orientation 
 my hon friend will be aware of the disregard and pardon provision in part of the police crime sentencing and courts act they have the effect of expunge those offence which be no long offence that clearly apply to what we be debate today the answer to his question be that that expunge of material will be complete in relation to offence that be service offence and go outwith the civilian then criminal offence list in part official report   january vol c. 2mc 
 my constituent work for the secret intelligence service between and in he be offer a post overseas at which point he declare that he be gay and he be then dismiss expressly because of his sexual orientation i thank lord etherton for the review and for meet i to discuss this clearly the review do not cover my constituent but he and other in his position do not even have the comfort of be able to go public at any point because of the nature of their employment have the minister speak to colleague in other part of government if not will he undertake to do so because this experience should not be prolong for those in the secret element of service to this nation 
 i be more than happy to discuss the detail of that constituent ’s concern separately this be a review into the way in which defence handle the matter between and and lord etherton ’s   term of reference be draw up accordingly from what the hon lady have just tell i i do not think that her constituent will be cover by the review but i be more than happy to have a conversation 
 i commend the government for commission the review and thank lord etherton for such a thorough piece of work i also thank the government for accept all of the recommendation it be pretty unusual to accept all the recommendation so the government should be commend for that 
 to follow on from the point make by my hon friend   the member for lichfield michael fabricant   about the disregard or expunge as the minister suggest be i right in think that those who have have service conviction would need to apply if so what more can be do to encourage they to apply to the home office for those disregard perhaps the ministry of defence could proactively suggest to they that they could do so 
 far to the question ask by   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier the uk intelligence community should not be overlook there should perhaps be a review or at least some sort of internal review about the treatment of uk intelligence officer over the past few decade 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his question lord etherton ’s term of reference be deliberately draw in the way that they be to focus specifically on defence but my right hon friend have make a reasonable point and i be sure colleague across government will hear what he have say i be more than happy to have a discussion about this specific case with   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier   and with my right hon friend if they wish to do so 
 it be important that if we be consider the implication for wide public service we learn from what have go before and from this review i be confident that colleague right across government will be look at what we have propose do in response to lord etherton ’s report today and draw their own conclusion perhaps they can learn from what have go on and assure themselves that they in turn do not have dark corner that need to be give the light that lord etherton ’s report have certainly give to defence 
 i draw attention to my declaration in the register of member ’s financial interests include those relate to my recent army reserve service i be very happy to be able to do that as an openly gay man alongside many other lgbt+ service personnel who serve we bravely around the world and in this country that opportunity be not available to the many generation who go before who be equally courageous and brave in the service of our country in so many contexts but who face horrific discrimination 
 of those discriminate against be of my constituent in cardiff south and penarth she be discharge in a totally humiliating way from the raf in the 1970 for be a lesbian but in her service record the reason be record as service no long require i have raise her case with the mod over   many year but be tell that it could not be change because it be correctly administer in his statement the minister refer to amendment to veteran service history which recommendation and of the report also refer to will he confirm that where individual be discharge for reason other than their sexuality but their sexuality be clearly the reason that will be consider in restitution for they and their service 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman i remember he raise his constituent ’s case when we debate this matter in the summer the straight answer to his question be yes and i encourage his constituent to go to the front door that be now open to ensure her case be properly examine and if she want reference to what happen to she be remove or expunge 
 it be impossible to put a price on or indeed measure the extent of the grief trauma and shame that be cause to lgbt veteran so why should we be put a financial cap on the compensation they be go to get when i be at a fighting with pride event recently that grief trauma and shame be palpable so i plead with the minister that although there be much to celebrate in lord etherton ’s report i congratulate he and the government on it there be clearly shortfall and give that nothing have be decide he could go far i be sure he agree and i think he should do so give what have be experience by our lgbt veteran 
 i be grateful to the hon lady lord etherton recommend £ and we have accept that recommendation the detail of the scheme will be work out in the next few month and i hope she will be pleased with what she see 
 we need to know what the cohort look like at the moment we really do not know that which be why the front door open today in a very short while i hope with the help of right hon and hon member across the house encourage their constituent we will have a well handle on who need to be mark with this financial reward and what they suffer at the time and the degree of that once we have a handle on that we will be well place to design a quantum that will be appropriate to people who be malign between and 
 i welcome the government ’s recognition of and apology for the persecution dismissal or force resignation of lgbt personnel but the answer the minister have give be raise more concern the be the cap on reparation the be whether there be a deadline for those reparation and the be this if people ’s record do not actually state that their dismissal be because of lgbt persecution how be they mean to prove that it be 
 the answer be with difficulty give what happen in for perfectly understandable and perfectly good reason it be the law of unintended consequence be it not i can not give the hon lady that detail at the moment because it be be work out it be so very difficult if everybody have their record mark   up it would be quite straightforward but they do not we need to know who the folk be who be in scope and then we need to look at what record exist many of those record have tag place on they when paper be remove which i think will help 
 we also have to look at other scheme such as the canadian scheme however i suspect most right hon and hon member in this house would be cautious about the canadian scheme because it draw the criterion very narrowly those who be nudge out or inch out through all sort of mean innuendo personal pressure or be tip the nod and the wink that somebody be on to they would be disadvantage under the canadian scheme i hope they will not be disadvantage under our 
 the raf lose a courageous serviceperson in when it sack carl austin behan carl win the royal humane society bronze medal for rescue a pilot from a burn hawk aircraft at raf chivenor last september an inquiry find that there have be accelerate enlistment for woman and ethnic minority candidate in the raf which be find to be dubious and possibly in breach of the equality act clearly we be not look for that sort of overcorrection but what assessment have the government make of the legacy of the sacking of people such as carl for recruit the next generation of courageous gay service personnel 
 let i be absolutely clear defence want people regardless of their sex gender sexual orientation ethnicity and social class we just want people with talent that be the touchstone for recruitment into the army navy and air force right now i do not care if people be gay i welcome gay people serve side by side with everybody else our history be full of example of the most courageous individual who serve in uniform and be gay 
 i be privileged to be an ambassador for fight with pride and i work with the minister for veterans affair on this matter before he take up his role i pay tribute to caroline and craig in particular as well as all the people they have be work with 
 fight with pride have welcome the pace positive intent and completeness of this process but the next stage be a full debate in this chamber to which member can contribute i hope the minister will listen to the representation he have hear today finally i put on record my concern about the £ cap and the fact that the minister have speak about this be a financial award scheme not a compensation scheme i think the government be in the wrong place on that and that they will end up cause themselves more problem if they do not seek to compensate veteran who have lose livelihood career and pension through their mistreatment by government 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s observation he may like to look up the canadian scheme which be a reasonable exemplar although the circumstance be different it award canadian dollar and this morning a canadian dollar be worth 58p but that scheme cover a much broad scope and the population of canada be small than that of the uk it cover police the armed force and   civil servant so the scope be much wide although the be not directly comparable the canadian scheme do at least make we feel that we be in the right ballpark i be afraid i can not give the hon gentleman the commitment he be seek but i urge he to look closely at other scheme and certainly at the canadian which be probably the close comparator we have 
 may i impress again on the minister the importance of hear lgbt veteran voice on the floor of the house just as it be important to hear the apology from the prime minister at the time i too want to share my concern about the structure of the scheme that the minister have talk about he have refer to a front door can we have an assurance that that front door will remain open for as long as be need many of our lgbt veteran suffer great trauma and shame and will be quite far away from that front door they will need support from trust partner such as fight with pride to get anywhere near it 
 yes the front door will remain open but a stakeholder pack will also be send to all organisation that we know be interested urge they to socialise it which be vital i can not emphasise enough that it be vital that those who believe they be eligible for some restorative action in the instance non financial should register their interest in do so they be able to register or flag the fact that they may be interested in a financial award as well unless we have that datum i think our job of determine what the scheme ultimately look like will be very difficult and the soon we get a handle on that the soon we can start to get money out of the door 
 this be an issue i raise many time over the year that i be the armed force spokesperson for the snp so i very much welcome lord etherton ’s review and i pay tribute to caroline and craig at fight with pride we have mention the spurious reason for which many lgbt veteran be dismiss of course the other thing be that the colleague they serve with be encourage to report their suppose misdemeanour i do think of the difficulty for the government will be track down all those who have be affect and impact by this but it will not just be in their own record i be sure there must be thing in other people ’s record that can be tie into this as well 
 i want to mention the £ i have do a quick sum and if the people who respond each get a share it would be £ each which be an absolute pittance for a lost career a lose pension loss of earning and the loss of a reference to go on to a new career outside the armed force we really have to look at that £ figure which do not even touch the surface
