i be pleased to respond to the debate when my hon friend   the member for worcester mr walker the former schools minister and now the chair of the education committee say that he have apply for the debate i welcome it because i want a good debate on further education despite the kind word of   the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell i do not know if he be quite the secret weapon i would take with i when i have negotiation with the treasury but his point be well make 
 i hear a lot of rhetoric from the shadow spokesperson   the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins warm word butter no parsnip last year fe week report that 
 labour can not commit to boost fe funding level 
 the article go on to say that speak to fe week   the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson 
 say the economic landscape have change significantly and could not pledge any uplift in cash for further education or address the disparity between fe and high education funding until the economic outlook be clear 
 so despite what the hon member for chesterfield say the opposition be not guarantee any uplift in further education funding 
 i thank   the hon member for wirral west margaret greenwood   for open the debate she be passionate about adult education i be with she and i understand the absolute importance of community learn i have see that in my own constituency and i champion it in the department i will say more about adult and community learn later in my remark but look at all the programme together the skill boot camp the level offer multiply and adult apprenticeship we be spend well over £ 
 my hon friend   the member for waveney peter aldous   as well as the hon member for wirral west raise the issue of community learning which have actually increase over the past year if we look at the key focus we will see that in the academic year learner participate in a community learn course compare with in the academic year that be an increase of i have other figure that i could quote but that do not mean that everything in the garden be rosy we be do a lot of work to try to support adult and tailored learning which i will go on to discuss a bit later in my speech 
 i be experience a bit of déjà vu here this time last year i believe that i be the chair of the education committee lead the estimate debate and my hon friend the member for worcester be answer it what we say here be i think touché what i would say to he be that absolutely he have make a valid case for funding for further education as have many other member i will go on to talk about that a bit later in my remark i also think that it be important that we do not paint just a partial picture we should look at the uplift in t level funding the £ that we be spend on institutes of technology the £ spending on high technical qualification which be now be teach in more than institution the £ that we will be spend on apprenticeship by the up to £ that be be spend on multiply and the many million of pound be spend on boot camp billion and billion of pound be be spend on skill which be absolutely right it be right too to make the case for ever more resource i always champion more resource but it be important to paint the whole picture not just a partial there be many good thing happen and it be fair to acknowledge that 
 the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   raise the issue of btec as do my hon friend the chair of the select committee he be resolute on this so i will be quite resolute in return btec have already be delay they have already be review and be be review there will be a significant number of btec that remain we have specifically introduce the t level transition year the whole purpose of which be to prepare those student for t level because as be rightly say by my hon friend   the member for great grimsby lia nici t level be hard but there be now a t level transition year and more than institution be teach it and there will be another along the way to prepare student 
 importantly we be remove some btec and other qualification that have low uptake or poor progression the hon member for twickenham mention the tourism   qualification i shall write to she with the detail and the figure i shall also come on to childcare in a bit because of the brilliant speech by my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom as i be say though we be remove t level that have low uptake or not great progression or that significantly overlap with other t level the whole purpose of this be that we have create employer lead qualification through our apprenticeship reform the t level and the high technical qualification be all employer design with the institute for apprenticeships and technical education i be proud to legislate for they in my last stint in this role employer will be able to develop new qualification for example if they want to they could develop a new tourism qualification 
 there be another important issue which have come up time and again i have say that some btec will remain i recognise that disadvantaged student be do some of these btec but we go down a very dangerous road if we say that we want to keep some qualification because disadvantaged student do they and the other one the middle class and everybody else can do that be a dangerous road because i do not want to have tier qualification some for the disadvantaged and other for the middle class and the well off what i want and what i have devote my whole parliamentary life to be to develop state of the art world beat vocational and technical qualification that be as good as if not well than a level that be what be important that be how i would respond politely but robustly to my hon friend the chair of the select committee 
 as i say a significant number of btec remain and will remain there be new qualification that can be develop so that those who do not pass will be able to do some other qualification at level or they may want to do a level or level apprenticeship instead there will be option for those people but we could make the same argument about those people who fail a level we should not just have rule for t level and another rule for those do a level 
 i will come on to funding because every hon member have raise that   the hon member for sheffield brightside and hillsborough gill furniss   talk about it and i be pleased that she have have more £ invest in sheffield city college my right hon friend   the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton   be thoughtful as always we have talk a lot about skill over the year and i reiterate that we be champion quality qualification which will address the skill deficit and introduce lifelong learning through the lifelong loan entitlement 
 the hon member for stretford and urmston andrew western   again talk about funding i will come on to that and i be happy to write to he about the specific issue that he raise regard trafford college i be pleased to meet my hon and learn friend   the member for eddisbury edward timpson   and the principal of   reaseheath college land college have be beneficiary of important capital funding and i know the college have receive more than £ i say in that meeting that i would work with my hon and learn friend on the issue he have raise and i will continue to do so as much as i possibly can 
 the hon member for twickenham talk about the skill wallet and we do have a difference here i have sympathy with many of the thing she say and i genuinely admire she for her knowledge of education and skill but we look at the skill wallet and as i understand it it give every adult £ to spend on training but with incremental payment start with £ at age £ at age and the final £ at age that would mean that learner would be constrain by when the funding become available we want to be fair to student and fair to the taxpayer our lifelong loan entitlement will be transformative because everyone will have access to up to £ that they can take any time up to the age of there be entry point and they can do short course or module of course 
 i have nothing but incredible admiration for the way my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire champion early year i have good news for she because when i find out she be on the list to speak in this debate i want to be sure about what we be do on early year skill as my department official who be watch will know 
 to let my right hon friend know what be go on there be a lot the ever national professional qualification in early year leadership cohort begin in october and the cohort commence in february the employer trailblazer group have develop level and level apprenticeship but we now have a level apprenticeship and we fund more than childcare course through our free course for job offer some learner start t level in education and childcare in september and there be a load of early year high technical qualification there be mass go on so we will have the train workforce that she passionately and rightly talk about right across that sector 
 my right hon friend   the member for bexleyheath and crayford sir david evennett   have great experience and wisdom he too talk about funding and he will know that his college i think it be the london south east colleges group have have £ since i think the shadow minister have also have £ in capital funding for chesterfield college in his constituency again that be a brilliant investment by the government that no doubt he will be celebrate to the rafter 
 i have mention the right hon member for hayes and harlington i appreciate the way in which he say what he do we have spend constraint but i will talk more about those in a moment my hon friend the member for waveney speak powerfully about the skill revolution in his area 
 my hon friend the member for great grimsby make a brilliant speech there be a lot that i agree with on the math to issue i be of those people who have a fear of math i pass my math o level but it take i month and a time around i be slightly dyspraxic it be a nightmare it be wrong that i be tell that i would never have to do it again we should have practical numeracy basic numeracy times table and so on and what i call numerical   literacy so that people can read bill and understand budget that would help those who have difficulty of course any math teaching should promote career in mathematic i think that the prime minister be right we must have math to along the principle that he set out in his speech i absolutely believe in that the experience of my hon friend the member for great grimsby be clear to see 
 this be an estimate day debate so we have to talk about fact and figure the dfe ’s resource budget be about £ an uplift of more than £ since the spending review and £ be directly link to apprenticeship and further education apprenticeship be a key rung on what i call colleague have nicely quote it back at me—“the ladder of opportunity we redesign the programme in partnership with industry there be now accredit route to more than occupation from entry level to expert government funding for apprenticeship will reach £ by as i have mention and that money be reach the economy 
 the hon member for twickenham mention the apprenticeship budget we spend of the apprenticeship budget and let we not forget that we send hundred of million to the devolved authority so the levy be be use i can give she a raft of quote from business that be supportive of the levy the opposition quote or business here and there that perhaps want it to be a skill levy but i have to disagree with the hon lady and the shadow minister a skill levy would mean no apprentice or a diluted number of apprentice we be spend billion of pound on skill i have already give the figure on that 
 as the chair of the education committee my hon friend the member for worcester mention the association of colleges have call for of the apprenticeship levy to be spend on apprentice at level and who be below the age of under-25s make up of start in of start be at level and provide an entry level springboard into work contrary to the bad news set out by the shadow spokesman we have have a increase in apprenticeship achievement in the academic year that be what count achievement the who achieve get good job when they finish their apprenticeship there be more start in than in we be push and encourage more degree apprenticeship they be a brilliant route up the ladder we be now put in £ over the next couple of year it be £ previously to encourage provider to take up more student for degree apprenticeship 
 my goodness what a brilliant visit we have to the college in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for loughborough jane hunt anyone who want an example of t level success should go to loughborough college where state of the art t level be be teach brilliantly include healthcare t level create a pipeline for future nhs worker and an institute of technology be be build it be an honour to lay the groundwork as i mention we be spend £ on institute of technology around the country of which there be already they be the rolls royce of further education in collaboration with high education and big and small business and an example of the government ’s commitment to skill and of the investment in the skill that we need for the future sadly i understand   that the principal be leave loughborough college but i be sure that the college will find a principal who be just as brilliant as she to take over 
 i mention the high technical qualification and new and exist level and we have the t level yes there be delay in some of they but we want to get they right we have provider across the country and student start t level in that be more than double the figure we will roll out t level in so that more young people can benefit from those high quality qualification more than of student achieve a pass 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether he have make a recent assessment of the strength of the union 
 recent year have highlight the strength of our united kingdom the successful covid vaccine roll out be just example of the strength of our union the ability to spend £ during the cost of living challenge cause by the covid pandemic and the war in ukraine be another that support will continue with freeport and an investment zone be deliver in wales 
 polling on welsh independence have find that young people age to be far more likely than any other group to vote by a majority for independence for wales to secure the change they feel their nation need that mirror the view of young people in scotland who believe scotland can and will prosper outside this break union why do the secretary of state think that so many young people have so little faith in the union 
 contrary to what the hon lady posit young people want and welcome the right to be able to live study and work in all part of the united kingdom which be why the conservative and unionist party have consistently poll far high in every kind of election than party that seek independence for wales 
 benefit of the union should be that all its citizen be entitle to broadly equivalent public service no matter where they live yet in north wales on the anniversary of the foundation of the nhs patient be unable to access specialist medical service in england with the same ease as english patient despite the fact that those service may not be available in wales do my right hon friend agree that that be an unreasonable and unfair state of affair will he urge the welsh minister to rectify that as quickly as possible 
 it be deeply disappointing that on the anniversary of the national health service the welsh labour government which be responsible for healthcare in wales be unable to provide the same   level of service as that receive by patient who live under a conservative run government run the nhs in england it be deeply unfair that patient in wales be wait long for treatment and wait long in accident and emergency and that those who draw attention to allegation of misspend of more than £ in the betsi cadwaladr university health board have be sack from their job 
 diolch yn fawr iawn lefarydd in people in wales be face hunger on the nhs ’s birthday we must break the vicious cycle where poverty fuel hunger and consequently poor health as the secretary of state be a staunch believer in the power of the union i would like to pose he a challenge would he be willing to stake his support for the union on its ability to eradicate food poverty in wales by the end of the tories time in office 
 i assure the right hon lady that my support for the union be absolute it be because we be in a powerful union that we have be able to spend £ on cost of living support which have mean that pension benefit and the minimum wage have all go up in line with inflation if the right hon lady be concerned about food poverty i hope she will talk to her friend in the welsh labour government which her colleague be prop up about the ridiculous proposal to ban meal deal 
 i will take that as a no perhaps i can give he another go to prove that wales get add value from the union english water company can extract the equivalent of almost olympic swimming pool of water from wales every day among those company be thames water which pay over £ in dividend over the past year can he explain to household in wales why the profit gain from extract our country ’s natural resource be benefit profiteer and not our community 
 the right hon lady will be well aware that the way in which water company be run be rather more complicated than that she will also be aware that there be a nationalise water company in scotland and we have a not for profit water company in wales and yet in both wales and scotland average bill be high and so be spill into the rivers—[interruption mr speaker snp members can say what they want they be preside over a situation where there be more sewage spill go into the water in scotland than there be in england 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on promote the uk as an international tourist destination 
 wales be a great tourist destination and only recently i spend a long weekend in llandudno i believe my hon friend be there he have see for himself what a wonderful place it be we have some of the good beach in the united kingdom and some of the good mountain biking in the united kingdom it be a shame that as a result of the welsh labour government ’s decision to impose a tourism tax on overnight visitor few people see it 
 my right hon friend be indeed right i go to conwy castle with my whippet and see the delight that wales have to offer i encourage everyone to go and see it tourism account for about £ of uk industry and almost job what conversation be he have with the welsh labour government to ensure that there be a uk wide approach to both domestic and international tourism 
 it be deeply disappointing not only that visitor will face a tourism tax but that those offer accommodation will face extra regulation and that those come to wales will be force to drive at around mph on road that currently have a mph limit therefore people will have to pay more to come to wales and spend long get here as a result of the welsh labour government ’s policy i encourage all tourism operator to speak to their welsh labour government minister about this 
 on the subject of tourism be the secretary of state aware that avanti have decide to cancel further service into chester and north wales to coincide with the peak tourism season improvement have be dangle in front of we day and then pull away at the next opportunity when will this hokey cokey of train service stop 
 i be aware of widespread concern about avanti ’s performance i know that my colleague in the department for transport have speak to the company about they but it have also suggest that some of the old fashioned working rule that have be work out with the union be hamper its ability to supply train as often as it want all i can say to the hon lady be that my colleague in the department for transport be well aware of the concern about avanti and have speak to the company about they 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of economic growth in wales 
 this government have put in place step to deliver growth and to level up across the whole of the united kingdom the imf now predict that cumulative uk growth over the period will be high than that in germany and japan and the bank of england make of the big upward revision to its growth forecast for the uk in wales the government have invest in freeport and will guarantee at least investment zone to support economic growth 
 but the most recent data be not pretty reading as far as the welsh economy be concern the welsh economy still have not return to pre pandemic level unlike in england and unemployment in wales be go up unlike elsewhere in the united kingdom do my right hon friend share my concern about what be go on inside the welsh economy under the labour administration in cardiff do he agree that   what we need be a laser like focus on support growth support business and unleash all the opportunity and potential in wales 
 my right hon friend be correct it be deeply disappointing that growth in wales be now below pre pandemic level whereas in england it be above pre pandemic level the welsh labour government need to ask themselves some difficult question and perhaps stop concentrate on nanny state policy such as the ban on meal deal the mph limit and the ban on new road and start think about what they can do to deliver job i do not mean the £ scheme to create a whole load of extra senedd members 
 the secretary of state will be aware of the announcement last week that have shock the bridgend community about zimmer biomet and the suggestion of lose more than job i along with my senedd colleague have meet the economy minister vaughan gething may i ask the secretary of state to do all he can to make representation to the business and trade secretary to encourage zimmer biomet to change its mind and keep the job in bridgend and to grow from bridgend to ensure that we keep these well pay highly skilled job into the future 
 the hon gentleman make a very useful and important point bridgend be a wonderful place in which to invest and do business and the new freeport will make it even well in the vicinity i have be in touch with the department for work and pensions about that but i be very happy to talk to those in the department for business and trade about what further measure can be take to encourage that company and other to take advantage of the wonderful work environment that be bridgend 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on the anniversary of our nhs create by welsh founder and labour minister nye bevan may i thank on behalf of labour members all our nhs staff in wales past and present for their dedication and public service 
 last week the department for business and trade publish its report on foreign direct investment in wales will the secretary of state join i in congratulate the welsh labour government ’s economy minister vaughan gething on his success in deliver economic growth through attract an additional job to wales in the past year 
 i think the hon lady will be aware that both the minister for economy in wales and the department for business and trade work closely with embassy across the world to ensure that investor know about the enormous opportunity that exist in wales i hope she will agree with i that that be testament to the fact that while we may have political difference on the issue of foreign direct investment the uk conservative government and the welsh labour government both enjoy work constructively together 
 i be pleased to hear the secretary of state ’s response i be sure we can both agree that we want strong economic growth across wales and the rest   of the uk the last labour government give the go ahead for new nuclear site in nearly a decade on none be up and run and it be now year since hitachi pull out of the wylfa project labour be ready to deliver new nuclear to ensure energy resilience security and low bills—[interruption what have the government be do when be they go to stop talk and start act 
 i be delighted that the hon lady have set out that the labour party now support nuclear power it be not something that be evident to we when labour be in opposition a few year ago labour have an opportunity over the year it be in government to build nuclear power station but it be good that it have belatedly decide that it will support new nuclear power in wales i can assure she that i be happy to work with the welsh labour government and anyone else who be interested in make sure that great british nuclear can take forward site such as wylfa which be an excellent site for new nuclear 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on new nuclear power site in wales 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on new nuclear power site in wales 
 to continue the topic from the previous question there be regular discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential for new nuclear in wales this government be launch great british nuclear to support our ambition to ramp up nuclear capacity in the uk to up to gw by gbn be actively work with the government on access to potential site for new nuclear project 
 nuclear power have an important part to play in a balanced energy policy to provide energy security do my hon friend agree that wylfa be an ideal site not only to continue generate nuclear power but to expand beyond it because the reality be that without improve and continue that site nuclear power have to come to wales 
 i agree with my hon friend wylfa be of the good site in this country if not in europe for nuclear power generation due to its optimal location and geology i be confident that the site ’s potential to support our gw target can be utilise i know it be a site that gbn be very interested in 
 nuclear power be an excellent and much need source of power but when demand for energy decrease that power be often waste have the minister look at any new welsh nuclear power plant produce so call pink hydrogen at time when electricity demand be low so that we be not waste that energy 
 we recognise the important role of both nuclear energy and hydrogen in reach our net goal we be committed to a nuclear future for wales and so far this year i have visit the wylfa site and bangor university ’s nuclear futures institute my hon   friend be right to mention the importance of store energy effectively our hydrogen strategy lay out our intention to explore the use of electricity and heat from nuclear power station to produce pink hydrogen 
 will the minister confirm that there be not an approve small modular reactor design in the uk yet so talk of instal smr at wylfa and elsewhere be just fantasy 
 the hon gentleman mention smr i know great british nuclear be look into the importance of those to our future net contribution and there will be site i hope across the united kingdom 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the delivery of freeport in wales 
 the secretary of state be delighted recently to announce successful freeport in wales the celtic freeport and anglesey freeport which will each be support by £ of government funding we have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on the delivery of the welsh freeport which we aim to bring into operation as soon as possible 
 i have be a keen supporter of the new solent freeport join my meon valley constituency i know the economic benefit that freeport can bring to business and worker can my hon friend assure i that he be do everything he can to ensure that the freeport bid in wales move ahead swiftly to benefit the community they serve 
 i certainly can the new freeport will help to level up north west and south west wales and bring new high skilled job to successful area they will become driver of growth and employment in their area act as hub for regeneration innovation and global trade i understand my hon friend ’s desire to see rapid progress both the uk government and the welsh government will work closely with the successful bidder to develop their outline business case so that we can understand the benefit cost and the most beneficial intervention option 
 the celtic freeport bid be base on float offshore wind the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme be a vital programme to get the infrastructure in the port ready for the fabrication of substructure and turbine for float offshore wind as the voice of wales in the cabinet what step be the secretary of state take with cabinet colleague to secure flowmis to maximise the benefit of the celtic sea freeport 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right about that he may also be aware of yesterday ’s announcement of the leasing area in the celtic sea for float offshore wind my right hon friend the secretary of state have regular meeting with stakeholder as do i about flowmis and the necessary infrastructure to bring that into being 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on improve transport connectivity between south wales and south west england 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague to discuss transport link between wales and the rest of the united kingdom i be pleased to say that the uk government have recently provide £ to develop solution to m4 congestion and deliver improvement to rail infrastructure 
 my right hon friend will know that route such as the a303 from the south west to london have be upgrade to ease congestion and boost the economy but for those travel to cardiff along the m4 delay and congestion persist what be the barrier to get the vital upgrade that that route need 
 i be afraid to say that the barrier be the welsh labour government who have decide that they will as a matter of policy end all new road build project in wales and on top of that bring in speed limit and road user charge that be bad for job bad for commuter and bad for the economy of wales 
 the government have woefully underinveste in welsh rail the burns commission and the union connectivity review all point to what the government should do upgrade the south wales main line and build new station such as in magor when will the government invest 
 the hon lady make an important point there be a project which be go through the business case process at the moment to improve the freight line on the south wales line to enable passenger service to run on it i believe that there will be announcement about that shortly when the new rail network enhancement pipeline programme come out 
 consider that not a single mile of high speed track will reach wales and that current service between wales and england be woefully unreliable and expensive what step will the secretary of state and the government take to improve that and ensure that those live in wales actually benefit from hs2 
 the hs2 project which be of course propose by the last labour government and be support as far as i be aware by the labour opposition will benefit passenger in north wales the government be commit to passenger across the whole of wales which be why £ have be spend on a range of improvement in addition to that we will shortly have the south wales metro system which be part of the cardiff capital region growth deal 
 whether he have have discussion with the secretary of state for transport on the adequacy of network rail funding in wales 
 i have regular discussion with department for transport colleague on a wide range of transport matter wales receive proportionally great funding than the rest of great britain in fact figure from the financial year demonstrate that government funding of the operational railway be 32.1p per kilometre travel in england 57.3p in scotland and 59.3p in wales 
 when i ask the department for transport about the maintenance funding spend on the wales route it tell i that it get or of the spending and it equate to of the network so it must be fair the problem be that the figure be base on train mile rather than track length and the train mile be always low in wales because of a lack of investment in infrastructure the track length be actually not will the minister make representation to the dft to increase rail spending proportionately to make it a fair settlement 
 the hon member be right to reference investment in rail in north wales growth track have press for that hard i have be involve with that as he have and the north wales transport commission have recently outline similar project he will be aware of the union connectivity review development funding pot that have be available and the entry in rnep for the north wales coast main line in relation to line speed 
 what step he be take to increase level of investment in wales 
 foreign investment create job over the last year with the number of fdi project also on the rise that show that more and more investor be look to wales this be testament to the £ that we be provide to support new freeport our commitment to deliver at least investment zone in wales and the £ we be invest in the next decade to boost the uk ’s global strength in semiconductor 
 do the minister agree that supply chain business need 
 a modern function road network to keep good move efficiently 
 whether they be on the m4 the a55 or elsewhere and that the failure of the welsh government to commit to this be a body blow accord to the road haulage association director geraint davies 
 i absolutely do my hon friend make an excellent point the welsh government ’s response to the road review be more of a roadblock sadly their opposition to the m4 relief road and other scheme continue to hold the welsh economy back the welsh government ’s impact assessment suggest that the impact of the mile an hour default speed limit could be as much as £ the welsh government i be afraid be advertise that wales be close for business 
 the automotive sector contribute significantly to the economy in wales include gestamp in my constituency where investment in the late technology to make light tough bodywork part contribute to the safety and energy efficiency of vehicle include new electric vehicle however with the us and the eu offer big incentive to company to invest in new green technology what talk have the minister have with ministerial colleague about offer similar incentive to get the investment from automotive company to ensure that we keep a vibrant automotive sector 
 i know that that question be very important to the hon member and her constituency i point she in the direction of the growth deal which have an important role to play and regular ongoing discussion be hold between the secretary of state the wales office and other government departments 
 investment in wales be also conditional on there be adequate healthcare be my hon friend aware that in tywyn on the west coast of wales a hospital that be build only or year ago have now close people in that area have to travel many many mile to get healthcare when it be need 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that issue clearly the provision of healthcare service in rural area be often very difficult but he will be aware of the particular challenge in wales especially north wales over the availability of safe and accessible healthcare service he be right to raise that point 
 as a gp the minister know the value of community engagement will he ask the home secretary to increase investment in police in wales to ensure that there be an effective response to tackle crime when bad thing happen 
 the hon member will be aware that there be more police officer in all the force in wales than ever before the government and the home office have be invest in the uplift programme and ensure that there be a strong police presence across wales 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of cost of live support for household in wales 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of cost of live support for household in wales 
 this government be support household across wales with the cost of living between october and the end of june a typical household would have see half their energy bill pay for by the government 
 accord to a study on hunger in wales around welsh people face hunger in mid-2022 that be more than double the population of cardiff with welsh trussell trust foodbank experience   an increase in the number of emergency food parcel that they distribute compare with year previously what specific conversation have the secretary of state have with cabinet colleague and the retail sector on the high cost of food in supermarket 
 obviously all cabinet colleague be absolutely committed to make sure that we put our resource towards the least well off that be why pension benefit and the minimum wage have all go up in line with inflation and it be why there have be extra payment of £ to people on benefit £ to pensioner and £ to household with disability but at least the people of wales be not in the same position as those of scotland where people be be hit with extra taxis 
 actually family who need it most in scotland be see the game change £ a week scottish child payment when will the secretary of state devolve power over social security to senedd cymru so that it can also make decision like that to protect the people of wales from the tories cost of living crisis 
 i can assure the hon member that all member of the cabinet be commit to resolve the cost of living problem that have come about as a result of the covid pandemic and the war in ukraine that be why our priority be to halve inflation as well as grow the economy reduce debt stop illegal immigration into this country and we be responsible for this in england reduce hospital waiting list

 last friday i meet a group of resident who have raise a petition to keep the last bank in corringham town open the viability of our town centre often depend on the presence of a small number of anchor business such as a post office or a bank can my right hon friend therefore tell the house what action the government can take to ensure that at least of those organisation maintain a high street presence to support business and resident alike particularly when they have receive significant government support 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue bank be a cornerstone of our high street of course it be ultimately a commercial decision for bank but i think it be right that they take into account the view of local community i be sure the bank in question will have hear his remark to the house and i trust that it will take appropriate action 
 we now come to the deputy leader of the opposition angela rayner 
 thank you mr speaker and can i associate myself with and thank you for your opening comment regard our nhs i thank all those staff who have work and continue to work in our nhs today 
 i be sure member across the whole house will join i in pay tribute to lord bob kerslake a decent and kind man who accomplish so much in both local and national government during a lifetime of public service our heartfelt condolence go to his family 
 i be glad to see the right hon gentleman here today i think i be right in say that i have the pleasure again next week week on the trot the government   really have give up every day family mortgage deal expire with more since we last meet and million more next year family be sick with worry about the cost of the tory mortgage bombshell do the tories still claim to be the party of home ownership 
 may i begin by associate myself with the right hon lady ’s remark about lord bob kerslake i know he from my time in downing street he be a stalwart public servant and he will be miss by many on both side of this house 
 it may come as a surprise to the right hon lady but some leader trust their deputy to stand in for they when it come to mortgage rate i support the independence of the bank of england in take the necessary measure to control inflation just ask the international monetary fund what we have do to support they it have say that we have take decisive and responsible action to bring down inflation and we will continue to do so but what be labour ’s plan it be to borrow £ a year push up inflation to cut our domestic energy supply push up inflation and to penalise worker save into their pension push up inflation there we have it from labour endless borrowing and high price 
 we have have year of conservative failure homeowner watch that pathetic answer will be cringe they be not celebrate the government ’s success they be count the cost of their failure the only thing that be not soar in price at the moment be the right hon gentleman ’s gag which be get cheap by the minute it be not just homeowner who be suffer security of renter have be rip away too with high mortgage cost hand directly to they give most renter live in home with a buy to let mortgage can he tell we be buy to let property include in the mortgage support package yes or no 
 actually under this government thank to my right hon friend the secretary of state for levelling up we have introduce legislation for the time to support renter and to give they great security of tenure of course the chancellor will take all necessary measure to stand behind mortgage holder and take necessary measure for renter 
 we have a choice in this country and the choice that we have make be to invest in our economy give we the fast grow economy in the g7 for the past year create job with record low unemployment and increase people ’s wage by provide the national living wage—£1,600 into everyone ’s pocket that be how this government be support people 
 i know that the deputy prime minister be not very good on fact but the tory party do crash the economy he will know that accord to his own government ’s data over buy to let property be miss out on support no fault eviction be up by this year so will he tell we if the prime minister have the spine now to stand up to the vested interest in his own party and finally deliver its promise to ban no fault eviction 
 i do not think the prime minister be go to take any lecture on weakness from the labour party there be a lot of talk about reshuffle in the air from the labour party the last time the   leader of the labour party try to sack the right hon lady she walk out with a promotion we will continue to stand behind renter and to support they and my right hon friend the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities will take all necessary step 
 that answer be pathetic for all those people who be face homelessness on the right hon gentleman ’s watch we will ban no fault eviction unlike the conservative party jessica and her child from plymouth be evict from their home in april they be temporarily live with jessica ’s mother in a cramp house where the eld child be sleep on blow up bed in the front room surround by their belonging hardly the decent secure life that the right hon gentleman ’s government promise do family like jessica ’s not deserve well 
 i will tell the right hon lady what we be do for family like jessica ’s we be increase the national living wage it be the conservative party that introduce the national living wage not the labour party it be this party that have double double the personal allowance cut taxis for those people and it be this party that have lift a people out of unemployment i be immensely proud of the record of this government that be why people will not trust the labour party not to crash the economy again 
 i ask a question about no fault eviction i be very clear on what the labour party would do but i can not see we get through a single of these encounter without the deputy prime minister blame the opposition for his government ’s own record 
 when ask yesterday about the record low number of council house be build the housing minister say she do not recognise that statistic when ask about support for people in temporary accommodation she say it be not her brief the brief of the housing minister if council housing be not her responsibility whose be it 
 the labour party may have fail to notice that it be actually under this government that more council house have be build than when they be in office it be under this party that we have record level of housing be build we stand very proudly on the record of this government 
 but let we look at what we have do more broadly inflation and waiting list come down growth forecast up albanian crossing down while we be deliver on our priority what have we see from the labour party it have u turn time in the last month already the record be clear the only thing we can rely on the party opposite to deliver be break promise 
 talk about broken promise house building be set to collapse to its low level since the war rent and mortgage be soar home ownership be plummet and over a people be trap wait for a council house there be simple solution to this problem and everyone know it so when will the right hon gentleman finally stand up for the national interest instead of the tory party ’s interest and build more house 
 the right hon lady may not have listen to the answer i give and just move straight on to the next pre scripted question but we have build more house under this government than the labour party i be afraid it be the same old thing from she she stack up the endless job title she take the union cash and she constantly talk britain down that be why we will do everything we can to keep labour out of people ’s pocket out of their life and out of government 
 i might respectfully say to the deputy leader of the labour party the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner that if she want to know what we be do on rental reform she can look at the renters reform bill that this government be introduce 
 order be that your question i think you ought to ask your question 
 my question be about the slapton line in my constituency can it be right that natural england be hold back major infrastructure development in south devon and not allow we to keep key infrastructure be develop 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to speak up for the slapton line it be of the most beautiful road in the country i understand that the slapton line partnership which include natural england and the environment agency be work closely with the local community on the plan 
 we now come to the deputy leader of the scottish national party 
 i begin by thank all the staff in our health service across these isle as we celebrate the anniversary of the health service in the uk i want to reflect on quote from people the be 
 it ’s about use the private sector more something that we actually should be very comfortable with 
 the be 
 a number of people do go as nhs patient to the private sector and we could do more of it 
 can i ask the deputy prime minister which quote be from the pm and which be from the leader of the opposition 
 may i begin by say genuinely how sorry i be to hear that the hon lady will be stand down at the next election she and i join the house at the same time and i know she have contribute much to her party and to this place may i also say that i be sure she will wish to join i in celebrate his majesty king charles receive the scottish regalia pretty much as we speak 
 indicate dissent 
 there be always time for a damascene conversion 
 when it come to the nhs i will take no lecture from either the snp or labour it have be there for i i be bear in an nhs hospital and my child be bear in an nhs hospital it have be there for i and my family and this government have put record funding into it 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his kind word we do join this place at the same time i be pretty sure we will be leave at the same time too laughter 
 the no problem that face the health service across these isle be workforce and research show that brexit have worsen the uk ’s shortage of doctor european nurse register to work in the uk fall by after the brexit referendum what more will it take for both he and the labour party to admit the damage that brexit be cause our health service 
 it all start off so nicely i do not know whether the hon lady have be listen to what the government have announce this week but we announce an additional £ for our groundbreake nhs workforce plan it be the time in the nhs ’s history that that have happen if we look at the record since this party come to power we have almost more doctor and more than more nurse once again the conservative party be deliver for the nhs 
 tonight at west lindsey district council ’s planning meeting the raf will apply for list building consent to move the grave of wing commander guy gibson ’s dog apparently the home office be content for migrant to be coope up next to of my constituent live near or on the base but the raf think it intolerable that it should leave the grave of a dog that have lie in peace for year more importantly will the home office start listen to we if it insist on this proposal on illegal migrant will it put they on a discrete part of the base and let we get on with £ of level up with a building many of they list a mile long runway and a spaceport and let the dog lie in peace 
 my right hon friend know that we have to take action to address the unacceptable cost of housing migrant in hotel i thank he for the constructive approach he have take to raf scampton play a role in respect of that of course home office ministers will have hear his broad representation and i be sure they will respond to he 
 may i on behalf of my colleague extend our deep appreciation to all those past and present who continue to be dedicate to our nhs include our staff in the health and social care system in northern ireland 
 in northern ireland gps nurse doctor and carer be adversely constrain by a lack of sufficient funding for our health service the northern ireland fiscal council have highlight that our allocation fall beneath need which compound the difficulty year on year will the deputy prime minister assure i of the government ’s willingness to engage on this issue and ensure that public service get what they need to continue deliver for the people of northern ireland 
 i be happy to give the right hon gentleman that assurance as he know the department of health in northern ireland have be allocate £ an increase of £ above but of course the absence of a northern ireland executive be exacerbate the severe challenge that the healthcare service in northern ireland be already face a fully function devolve government be the right way to deliver the reform need for the northern ireland health service 
 of the case of melanoma diagnose in the uk every year sadly over will prove fatal regularly apply sunscreen be our most effective weapon against this deadly disease yet the treasury remain stubbornly opposed to exempt these lifesave product from vat with a further heatwave expect later this month will my right hon friend assure i as a melanoma survivor that he will do everything in his power to remove vat from high factor sunscreen to save life and support the nhs as it celebrate its anniversary 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the danger of melanoma as a fair headed person with a fair headed family i be acutely conscious of the need to wear sun cream i will not trespass on treasury decision in this setting but i know that my right hon friend the chancellor will have hear her representation 
 after year of tory government the government ’s record be pretty dismal let we consider it inflation spiral out of control interest rate set to hit by the end of the year energy price double those in the rest of europe food shortage strike across the public sector and nhs and graduate leave university with mountain of debt and little to no prospect of home ownership will the deputy prime minister admit his tory government ’s failure and urge the prime minister to call a general election now 
 rather than focus on play politic we be actually deliver for the british people i listen to the hon lady ’s litany i be interested to note that her leader have be in power for day and what have the snp ’s record be fail ministers unfinished ferry and a fail deposit return scheme i think we can all agree that the people of scotland deserve well 
 conservative government have a proud record of support the uk ’s steel industry i have i do not know why labour member be laugh because steel production halve under labour i have stand up many time in the house to talk about the importance of steel not just to my home town of scunthorpe but to our whole nation do my right hon friend agree that we will always need steel in this country and that if we can not make it ourselves we will have to ship it over from the other side of the world with all the emission and environmental and ethical concern that that will inevitably bring will he reaffirm the government ’s commitment to take further measure to ensure that we have sustainable long term steelmaking in this country 
 i be very happy to reaffirm this government ’s commitment to steel manufacturing i pay tribute to my hon friend as i know what a champion she be for steel production in scunthorpe long may she continue to be we have make meaningful offer of support to tata and british steel the secretary of state recently visit they to see at hand the work under way 
 i be sure that the deputy prime minister will be as pleased as i be that work be well under way to construct the sutherland spaceport in fact it be ahead of schedule recently the north coast space cluster have be develop which involve enterprise agency and company do the deputy prime minister agree that that can build massively on the skill build up over many year at doonreay and that the establishment of international link with company in the united states can only be good news for the far north of scotland 
 i completely agree with the hon gentleman ’s remark the development of that new spaceport be a key part of our ambition to grow the uk ’s space launch capability in the year we be expect to reach £ of investment create job we be work with the united states particularly through the technology safeguard agreement to allow uk company to exchange technology with it 
 could i associate myself with your comment about the nhs mr speaker i pay tribute to all nhs worker both in newcastle under lyme and across the country i welcome the new long term workforce plan particularly more place in dental school access to dentistry have be an issue for a number of my constituent would my right hon friend consider the merit of open new dental school not just new dental place keele university be of the good medical school in the country and would make an excellent site for a new dental school 
 as ever my hon friend make a very strong case for his constituency as a result of the nhs long term workforce plan we be currently assess capacity at exist dental school to see whether they can accommodate the expansion in training place of course we retain an open mind about whether we need further such education facility 
 it be a pleasure to join colleague from across the house this morning for the nhs anniversary parkrun on this special day however my joy be short live when i return to my office to find the usual array of email from desperate constituent who can not get a doctor or dentist appointment access to child ’s mental health service or proper care for their love one do the right hon gentleman agree that as today ’s report from highly respected think tank suggest after a decade of under investment our beloved health service face either manage decline under the tories or a labour government with a radical new health and wellbeing strategy to put it back on its foot 
 mr speaker it may not surprise you to hear that i do not agree with that characterisation let i tell you about this government ’s record on the nhs record funding record doctor record nurse record scan and record operation the only record from the opposition party be in wales where they now have the bad a&e waiting time in the country 
 the only other record be the length of the answer maybe we can speed up with richard drax 
 i associate myself with your comment about the nhs mr speaker 
 my constituent in weymouth and portland and i be get a little tired of be tell that place a migrant barge in our port be in the national interest it be neither in the national interest nor in our the barge design for will accommodate illegal migrant already test our overstretched resource it be impose on we without any consultation there be many concern both about the barge and about what the young man will do go around a seaside resort at the height of the summer unmonitored and with little money will my right hon friend stop it and ask my right hon friend the home secretary to do likewise 
 i be sure my hon friend appreciate that we need to reduce the bill of housing asylum seeker in hotel and that we need to look at different measure to accommodate they of course i be very happy to engage with he and i be sure the home secretary be too to ensure we can find a satisfactory solution in his constituency that protect his constituent interest 
 last week the coroner find that the cause of luke ashton ’s suicide in april be gamble disorder immediately before his death luke bombard with inducement place over bet at no point do the operator intervene from his previous brief the deputy prime minister will have extensive knowledge of the harm those inducement cause so do he agree that the commitment to curb advertising and promotion in the gambling white paper do not go far enough to reduce harm and prevent more tragedy like luke ashton ’s suicide 
 the hon lady will know from our conversation when i be digital secretary that i share her concern about gambling inducement indeed i pay tribute to she for she campaigning on this issue i think we have a very good set of proposal in the gambling white paper that sit alongside the nhs long term plan which commit to specialist unit across england by to support those with gambling addiction i think we have good proposal in place 
 may i draw the house ’s attention to the fact that we have the chief minister of his majesty ’s government of gibraltar in the gallery fabian picardo may i seek an assurance from the deputy prime minister that as the uk eu negotiation on the border between gibraltar and spain continue the sovereign freely express opinion of the gibraltarian people to remain british will be protect as well as their security and economic interest 
 i be very happy to give my hon friend and indeed the minister of gibraltar exactly that assurance this government will always stand up for the people of gibraltar and their right to determine their own future 
 sarcoma be cancer that can affect any part of the body inside or outside include muscle bone tendon blood vessel and fatty tissue sarcoma be rare in the uk around people be diagnose every day and a year include in family in merthyr tydfil and rhymney awareness be low and as this be sarcoma awareness month may i ask the deputy prime minister to meet i and family affect so that we can discuss what more the government can do to raise awareness and vital fund for research go forward 
 i be very happy to give that commitment i think probably well on behalf of health ministers of my colleague in downing street who be a prime minister ’s principal private secretary sadly die of that disease so i have a great awareness of it and it be important that we continue to raise its profile 
 last week as an alumnus of durham university i have the pleasure of go to the installation of dr fiona hill as its new chancellor dr hill start in bishop auckland and could not afford a school uniform to go to the high school where she have a scholarship she finish up work in the white house and be an example of social mobility that be what she will be champion as the new chancellor will the deputy prime minister encourage the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my right hon friend   the member for surrey heath michael gove   to work with i and the all party parliamentary group for left behind neighbourhood to do everything we can to support she 
 i join my hon friend in relay the government ’s congratulation to she i will ensure the secretary of state hear the representation he make 
 university in cardiff and across the uk be home to world lead research and innovation but thousand of job and huge amount of expertise be now at risk because of the government ’s dither in the negotiation over horizon the   report last week that sir paul nurse nobel laureate and head of the francis crick institute describe the delay as absurd and 
 damage science and damage the country 
 be the government still commit to negotiate a deal if they be why do they not get on with it 
 since we agree the windsor framework we have have very constructive discussion on horizon but the difference between my party and the hon gentleman ’s party be that we will not accept a deal at any price we will wait until we get the good deal for the british people and british university 
 i be run a campaign call a year of reasons to visit the moorlands each week for a year i be focus on of the many reason to visit the moorland so far i have include hetty ’s tea shop in froghall the heaton house farm wedding venue some brilliant artist and alton towers and this week be league club day may i invite my right hon friend and you mr speaker to visit my constituency to see of the reason for yourself 
 i should be delighted to do so i think that hetty ’s tea shop may be more my cup of tea than alton towers but i be sure i can arrange a visit 
 we will both go on the big ride together 
 i think everyone in this house can recognise that my city of dundee be a city to be proud of it have world lead university pioneer business and a determined snp city council lead the way and there be a real ambition to deliver for the future we want to continue our journey and the potential delivery of a world class site for the eden project in our city will help to cement its reputation bring further investment and job and boost our local economy can the deputy prime minister confirm that the uk government will deliver on previous promise and finally commit to support capital funding for that project in my city 
 i be a big supporter of the eden project and i hope very much that we can have in dundee of course the united kingdom government always stand ready to support people in scotland and to support people in dundee 
 as the child of nhs doctor the sister of an nhs doctor and the wife of an nhs doctor may i too say thank you to everyone who work in our nhs will my right hon friend send particular congratulation to the student at the new medical school at anglia ruskin university in chelmsford who will graduate as doctor in a couple of week this be the time we have ever train doctor in essex and it have be hugely successful will my right hon friend meet i to discuss double the size of our medical school 
 i be very happy to offer my sincere congratulation to those student who thoroughly deserve their graduation ceremony i know what a difficult course be require for someone to qualify as a doctor health ministers would be happy to meet my right hon friend to discuss exactly that proposal 
 of my constituent who be a year university student tragically take his own life in may he have sign a private sector tenancy for his next year ’s accommodation with his parent as guarantor the tenancy include a clause which state that the responsibility of the guarantor be unaffected by the death of a tenant and the letting agency be disgracefully insist on enforce that abhorrent requirement my constituent not only have to live with the devastating loss of their son but face terrible financial hardship   because of this cruelty will the deputy prime minister support my call for the inclusion of a clause in the long overdue renters reform bill to outlaw that practice and protect bereaved family 
 what the hon lady have describe sound totally abhorrent and i shall be very happy to look into the detail and discuss what measure might be bring forward to address it 
 at a time of record employment an unemployment rate nearly half that of the eu average and strong inward investment can my right hon friend explain why every single period of labour government since the world war have end in economic failure with sterling weak and unemployment usually high 
 my hon friend be entirely right i might add that labour government also spend every last penny in the treasury i well remember the    note say that there be no money leave when we enter government we should never allow that to happen to the british people again 
 our absentee prime minister do not turn up for the owen paterson vote he do not turn up for the boris johnson vote he will not stand up to the mp who call the privileges committee a kangaroo court and yesterday he embarrass himself by act like a stroppy schoolboy in front of the liaison committee with nhs waiting list at a record high and the tory mortgage penalty hit my constituent hard he have bite off more than he can chew have he not 
 i be not sure that there be a question in that i might respectfully say that it be a rant i will proudly defend this government ’s record we have grow the economy in the past year fast than any other country in the g7 with record low level of unemployment and few people in workless household all of which would be put at risk if the labour party ever enter power 
 on a point of order mr speaker it be a shame that the deputy prime minister have leave because this point of order refer to his appearance in the chamber on   june when he claim that my party ’s plan to invest £ a year in green energy would add £ a year to everyone ’s mortgage he make that claim a day after the daily mail report that figure and say that it come from treasury analysis 
 however the treasury have admit that the statistic do not come from official analysis it be force to make that admission to the uk statistics authority after that organisation demand to know where the figure have come from the uksa tell lbc that despite investigation it have be unable to find any official source for the figure its spokesperson state 
 we speak to hmt and they have inform we the figure quote be not base on any analysis produce by treasury official 
 the ministerial code by which all government ministers must abide state 
 it be of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament correct any inadvertent error at the early opportunity 
 mr speaker i would be grateful if you advise i how we can get the deputy prime minister who will be back next week to correct the record 
 may i say that you have absolutely put that point on the record and i think you have make sure that it have be correct for the record i have no responsibility for this the responsibility lie with a minister to correct an error and to ensure that they do so as you quite rightly say at the early opportunity i be sure that ministers on the treasury bench have hear that and i be sure that the minister responsible will want to correct it asap 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to publish revised guidance on the deployment visibility and signing of speed and red light camera for traffic enforcement to require that guidance to include amend site selection criterion for safety camera include a low threshold for the number of collision in which a person be kill or seriously injure to require that guidance to provide for a process by which local community can express support for the installation of safety camera in area of concern and for connected purpose 
 a circular from the department for transport recognise speeding as of the 
 most significant dimension of unlawful disorderly and dangerous road vehicle use 
 it provide key guidance on the use of speed and red light camera for traffic enforcement to improve the safety of road user and pedestrian it encourage change in driver behaviour pave the way for local authority partnership to support their community and outline criterion for site selection to help decision making regard any new camera 
 i want to get ahead of the keen journalist in the gallery and confess that i currently have point on my licence for speeding but i emphasise that i be catch by a camera and modify my behaviour prove that camera do in fact work 
 year on from the introduction of the guidance speed motorist be arguably the no local issue highlight across dewsbury mirfield kirkburton denby dale and i be tell many of my colleague constituency alongside the concern that my constituent regularly raise that be something i have see myself with the dewsbury ring road in particular occasionally resemble an indy track 
 speeding become significantly more noticeable during the pandemic when few people be drive with some driver take advantage of the emptier road to drive at reckless speed i pay tribute to west yorkshire police for all the work it continue to do to keep our road safe but it can not be everywhere at once especially give the vast expanse of rural road 
 accord to the current guidance the primary objective of camera deployment be to reduce death and injury on road with a study conduct by the london school of economics find that from to traffic enforcement camera reduce accident by between and while reduce fatality by between and 
 since april the criterion for fixed and mobile camera deployment have be base on the number of accident in which someone be kill or seriously injure with a scoring system in which each ksi accident score point and each slight injury accident score point 
 people die and more than people be injure in collision on the road of west yorkshire last year the majority of these collision be entirely preventable with excessive or inappropriate speed be of the most common factor in fatal and serious injury collision however the guidance in west yorkshire still require at least people to be kill or seriously   injure within a year period at least people need either to die or suffer a serious collision with potentially life change injury to satisfy just of the criterion to install a speed camera this mean that at least family need to have their life change forever before a preventive measure can be implement 
 between and nearly collision be report on road in my constituency of those be on liley lane run through the middle of lepton accord to the current list of speed camera provide by west yorkshire safety camera partnership there be no fix camera cover that road there be also report collision on huddersfield road run through shelley and skelmanthorpe there be camera on nearby road but apparently none cover the road itself 
 the local community continue to highlight concern to i regard those road accord to the local safety camera partnership 
 community concern be factor which may result in the use of a camera provide there be evidence of a collision history and/or traffic survey reveal speed limit violation meet the require threshold local authority will apply the criterion to determine whether the use of either fixed or mobile camera be justify 
 prevention be well than cure so what be be do to support that 
 as it stand the circular appear keen to involve local community concern by the effect of high speed driving in their area however in the guidance and on the partnership and local authority website there be no structured signpost point of contact for community to reach out to so complaint be consequently be make to local councillor the police and local mp 
 the creation of standardised point of contact for local resident across the uk to highlight where speed camera would be useful would be a crucial step in ensure our constituent be hear and keep safe rural community notice and be most affect by speed motorist so it be vital that we create and implement an effective and straightforward channel they can use to encourage change 
 i have therefore work closely with community group and village association to understand and highlight the impact of dangerous driving in their area alongside highlight the concern of shepley village association   at prime minister ’s question last year i have support the campaign of resident in briestfield in dewsbury and upper hopton in mirfield to tackle speeding in their area by reduce the speed limit i would also like to take this opportunity to thank my team and the local councillor who work hard to respond to these concern and can then support the development of a coherent approach for local resident to highlight the issue publicly 
 i have raise this issue in the house on multiple occasion in september i highlight the need to change the guidance with the department for transport promise a redrafte form of the circular by the end of the year i appreciate that much have change over the past year but it would be fantastic if we could complete the redraft and implement a circular 
 finally i want to assure colleague that this bill seek not to give local authority the green light for want of a well phrase to install as many camera as they can as part of a revenue generate scheme but to reassure our constituent that they will be listen to and support in make their community a safe place to live walk cycle and enjoy speed traffic put everyone at risk whether they live in a build up town or a more rural village we want our road to be safe for everyone but too often we hear about accident or near miss where speed be a key factor 
 i be introduce this bill to bring down the point threshold with a requirement for few serious accident within the timeframe and to establish a pathway for community to petition for camera so that we can make sure that action be take soon and life be save i hope member from across the house can agree that the continuous improvement of road safety be crucial to all our constituent and i commend this bill to the house

 the sum authorise for issue out of the consolidated fund be reduce by £ 3,200,982,000.—(andrew bowie 
 the debate will be open by the chair of the select committee on welsh affairs 
 it be a privilege to open this afternoon ’s debate on energy infrastructure at the start of this estimate day it be an important and timely topic for we to consider and i be grateful to the backbench business committee for select it i be also grateful to the colleague from both side of the house and from different part of the united kingdom who be here this afternoon to participate 
 energy be the lifeblood of the global economy the need for heat light and power be as old as humankind in the intensely complicated fast move and interconnect world we now live in efficient infrastructure supply reliable and secure source of affordable energy be the critical mean by which we sustain our living standard and basic security for previous generation of policymaker think about the affordability and reliability of our energy system be perhaps challenge enough but in an age now when we well understand the far reach impact of hydrocarbon on the atmosphere and our planet and when threat to global energy supply can cause sudden and devastating spike in price the task of not just renew but transform our national energy infrastructure be monumentally important and difficult it should be at the very forefront of debate in this place 
 the twin challenge of energy security and net have come together in a potent way in recent year and i welcome the way in which this government have move quickly to respond to the change landscape the energy security strategy paper publish in april   highlight the commitment to produce far more domestic energy more recently the government ’s blueprint for the future of our energy mix power up britain publish in april clearly set out how we plan to diversify decarbonise and domesticate energy production by invest in renewable and nuclear 
 over the last year the welsh affairs committee have undertake several inquiry into different aspect of energy policy and infrastructure as they relate to wales might ask why the welsh affairs committee be take such an interest in energy but it be simply because of the immense importance of energy to wales and the welsh economy wales be not only a consumer of energy but a primary producer and a gateway for energy import and export furthermore we recognise the potential economic opportunity that could accrue to wales from future development in renewable energy and nuclear energy 
 have complete an initial wide range inquiry into renewable energy in july our committee pursue subject in great detail grid capacity in wales nuclear energy in wales and float offshore wind in do so we be acutely conscious of the fact that none of that be particularly niche or specific to wales indeed much of the evidence we hear on all of those subject have direct read across to other region and nation of the united kingdom in the time i have available i would like to touch briefly on the key output of the inquiry and highlight some ongoing challenge 
 i commend the right hon gentleman for bring this debate forward as chair of the welsh affairs committee he be talk about wales but he also mention that all of the united kingdom should benefit in this area will that be from the option that he put forward or will it be from tidal energy which we could do more on in northern ireland do he feel that when it come to bring forward a strategy for this house today it be about what happen not only in wales or england but in scotland and northern ireland it be about what happen collectively because we should all benefit therefore a strategy have to come from this place but it must be drive out to all the region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland collectively 
 as ever the hon gentleman be correct we be united kingdom of course on energy on the island of ireland there be interconnection with the republic but with the change nature of our energy system the economic opportunity for investment job creation and industrial renewal be enormous for all part of the uk for northern ireland wales england and scotland 
 i wish to touch briefly on the key output of the inquiry i mention on grid capacity we be talk about the network of power line pylon and interconnector that transport electricity generate to area of demand that be a critical piece in the energy infrastructure puzzle not just in wales but for all part of the uk the issue should keep ministers awake at night because it be clear from our inquiry that the entire way in which grid enhancement and new connection be deliver be not fit for purpose give the imperative of uk energy policy 
 i recognise the step that have be take by the government and the national grid electricity system operator with the appointment of nick winser as the uk ’s electricity network commissioner the government be take step to address the challenge however if we think about the increase in the speed of delivery and consenting that be require if we be to see the renewal of our national grid in the way we need in the year ahead we see that we need a much more significant step change in the pace of activity 
 rise 
 i give way to the chairman of the select committee on energy security and net 
 the right hon gentleman make a good point there other issue to address be the plethora of zombie project that be clog up the system which do not make it easy for anybody identify they be not easy either i do not pretend it be but i want to bring that to his attention 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for bring that to the house ’s attention there be currently about gw of project on the book many of those be zombie project as he describe they that will not come to fruition and so be clog up the system the government need somehow to get rid of those project in order to focus on area where we know there will be investment and to encourage an anticipatory investment approach that will deliver the new infrastructure we need in a timely way otherwise we will end up develop a renewable technology and a system able to generate clean energy but we will not have the grid to get it where it be need 
 secondly on nuclear energy our inquiry confirm that there be a broad consensus between the uk government and the welsh government on the role that nuclear should play in achieve the uk ’s net target and ensure domestic energy security the majority of our witness be in favour of new nuclear energy generation in wales and i be pleased to say that the committee agree that nuclear energy have a strong role to play in a mix of low carbon source 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie   for the role she play on the committee as well as in her capacity as a constituency mp in champion nuclear energy for ynys môn there have be no more energetic and active member of parliament for ynys môn that i can remember she have do a great job in champion her constituency our report carry and reflect much of the positivity that my hon friend bring to the subject 
 we hear strong evidence about the suitability of the wylfa site on ynys môn for a new gigawatt scale reactor in fact we do not believe that the government will meet their target for increase nuclear power without build that large scale nuclear plant at wylfa we recognise the progress that the government have make in establish great british nuclear and bring forward the regulated asset base model for secure investment in new nuclear however despite that positive progress a new nuclear power station at wylfa in north wales be not in the bag 
 when i be in government year ago we champion a new nuclear power station at wylfa minister be send for photo opportunity there and to meet potential investor but it do not happen i know that the community in ynys môn represent by my hon friend feel disappointment because it have have its hope raise and dash in the past we do not want that to happen again so i implore the minister to hear the argument about wylfa i know he feel passionate about the subject and will discuss these issue with government colleague 
 do any of the witness point out the eye wateringly high cost of new nuclear as well as how painfully slow the process will be give the amount of time it will take for it to be up and run with the good will in the world it be unlikely that there will be a new big nuclear power station until the early 2030s give the government ’s own target to decarbonise the electricity supply by nuclear will be unable to play much of a part in help we to achieve that 
 the hon lady make a good point investment in large scale nuclear or even small modular reactor be a long term feature of our energy system as the government ’s power up britain report recognise in fact the government ’s target for increase nuclear be for not 
 on the cost of nuclear yes those point be make to the committee we make sure that we have an evidence session to hear from friend of the earth and other who be oppose to nuclear per se we hear their strong argument about their belief in an energy system entirely comprise of renewable and power storage technology in the future but we also hear strong evidence that the technology for that do not yet exist we have to stay in the real world so nuclear which have be try and test over the long term as a provider of cheap and reliable power be an important part of our future energy mix in conjunction with other energy source 
 i be go to make a similar point to that make by   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas the right hon gentleman be talk about not rely on future technology but smr be future technology he have admit that they use technology that do not exist at the moment how much do he estimate large scale new nuclear plant will cost and how much would a fleet of smr cost if they come to fruition 
 i be go to disappoint the hon gentleman because i do not have those specific figure in the pile of note i have bring with i however those figure be out there and the evidence be there he be right that small modular reactor be a technology for the future and testing be still require but that work be go on and not just in the uk but in other country it will be a technology for the future so there be no point in we put our head in the sand and wilfully pretend otherwise i believe it will be a technology for the future but a lot will depend on future cost 
 particularly on estimate day be we really put our head in the sand when that technology be simply the most expensive in consider   government expenditure should we not be look for a technology that produce clean energy and be the least expensive not the most expensive 
 the evidence we consider take in the entire life cycle of a nuclear power station look at the energy produce over or more year show that they give we a secure reliable base load of affordable energy production people who oppose nuclear per se will not be persuade on cost or on the efficiency of the technology they will not be persuade at all
