what a pleasure it be to respond to the contribution of my hon and gallant friend   the member for bracknell james sunderland   this evening i hope that we will be able to reflect on a huge success in our country it be a wonderful thing for our community to have cadet i have see they in my constituency and they be an important part of the local fabric support occasion from remembrance sunday to armed forces day and beyond we be lucky to have they 
 i pay particular tribute to the volunteer who make that possible so many of our institution have i be afraid suffer as a result of the pandemic and it have be extremely difficult for they to get go again yet cadet seem to have bounce back and be flourish and the reason be that there be people who be prepared to give up their time and shoulder a fair amount of inconvenience to serve their community in that way we all owe they a great deal 
 the benefit that our cadet programme offer to young people and society as a whole be well known and well rehearse i agree wholeheartedly that the mod sponsor cadet force provide brilliant opportunity for our young people they have be catalogue by academic from the university of northampton to whom i be grateful for their rigorous appraisal which give scientific objectivity to what we all understand instinctively to be the case namely that cadet be a force for good 
 participation in cadet have be show to build character self discipline and self reliance it improve teamworking problem solving leadership and social skill it provide a boost for physical and mental health benefit that i be sure my hon friend will know about from his time as a cadet which he describe so well i have to say that my time be not quite as happy as his i remember join the air cadet briefly i be tell i be go to fly aircraft after about month it dawn on i that that be not go to happen it would be march up and down for as long as i could put up with it which be not very long i have to say that i part company from the cadet much soon than my hon friend but there it be i be sure it benefit i on some level 
 headteachers of school that have establish cadet unit report that their cadet have improve attendance and academic attainment as well as behaviour and self confidence some headteacher use cadet as a central part of their strategy to reduce exclusion cadet programme be also a gateway to new skill new qualification and even employment they be also a valuable way of make young people aware of the further opportunity available in defence and defence relate industry although as my hon friend make clear cadet force be not mean to be recruit tool as our military footprint have shrink however cadet have assume an even more important role in at least provide some sort of presence in many community where otherwise there would be none they benefit the whole of society by build link between different community boost social mobility and strengthen young people ’s resilience to become involve in antisocial behaviour criminality and even extremism in short join the cadet be a springboard to success as well as be a powerful engine for social mobility and level up 
 the cadet expansion programme be a joint ministry of defence and department for education initiative to expand cadet participation in school it have be a fantastic success since its launch by the then prime minister year ago by march ahead of schedule the government reach their target of establish new combine cadet force unit in state secondary school in england in november again ahead of schedule we reach our further target of establish new cadet unit across the united kingdom fund with £ from libor fine the expansion programme benefit many school in less affluent area 
 to give renew impetus to the programme the government have by this time outline a further aspiration to increase the number of cadet in school unit to by april however cadet unit require a significant amount of personal commitment from school leader and volunteer and in spite of success about of the unit establish since have fail often as a result of change to a school ’s leadership or priority that be a pity but it in no way detract from the leadership and drive of school team that have advance the cadet programme to whom i pay tribute as we approach april although cadet number in school have increase by since april to more than it be clear that covid have have an impact on this as on so much of our national life and that we will not reach our aspiration within the challenge timeframe that we set 
 however it be not only the direct impact of the pandemic that have slow progress in addition to cadet activity be halt or limit by covid restriction participation have be affect by the result change in school priority with many understandably reorientate themselves from extra curricular activity to prioritise catch up on lose learning give this context the fact that we have already achieve of our ambition to have cadet in school be a great credit to every individual and school involve in our expansion programme 
 we have also make progress on a number of other front to provide the great support for school cadet unit that we can in the last year we have develop a combined cadet force engagement and communication framework we have work with the single service cadet force to improve the delivery model and have extend funding for regional school cadet expansion officer accord to a report produce by academic at the university of northampton more than of headteacher survey consider their cadet unit to be a good investment for their school and a whopping report an improvement in the resilience of participant most recent estimate have calculate the cost of participation at £ per cadet and i call that a fantastic value for money investment in their future our future and the future of our country however member do not have to take my word for it the academic who conduct the study conclude that 
 school base cadet unit be deliver excellent value for money 
 as well they should give that the estimate of the institute for public policy research be that the cost of just school exclusion be £ 
 resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of the report from the right honourable sir alan moses chairman of the spoliation advisory panel date   march in respect of oil sketch by sir peter paul rubens now in the possession of the courtauld institute of art london.—(aaron bell 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to support financially people unable to work due to serious medical condition 
 my department do a great deal to support the long term sick and disabled include through universal credit and its health element and through the personal independence payment which be a contribution to the additional cost of sickness and disability 
 my constituent jenifer picton be currently undergo extensive treatment for cancer and be consequently unable to work i wish ms picton all the very good with her treatment she have come to my office which have help with universal credit pip and the new style employment and support allowance she have now manage to get pip but give that she be seriously ill why should she have to come to my office for help why do we make it so arduous and difficult for people who need treatment to get help 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and the typical assiduity with which he take up his constituency case may i send my good wish and i be sure those of the whole house to ms picton i be happy to meet he to discuss in more detail the circumstance that he have describe 
 datum in response to my write question on pip appeal show that more than ill or disabled people have their appeal uphold at tribunal without the need for new evidence give that the uk government will be examine today by the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities follow its special inquiry that find that the threshold have be meet for grave and systematic violation be it not time to replace the flawed and outdated pip system with a framework that be fit for purpose 
 of course we always keep all benefit under review at the department include pip and the assessment process as the hon lady point out there be rightly an appeal process for those who be not happy with the conclusion of those assessment we keep those under review and i can reassure she that they represent a relatively small proportion of the total number of application 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of regional variation in level of employment and inactivity 
 the regional employment gap be significantly low than in jobcentre take a place base approach to deliver targeted support that reflect local need and the local economy 
 health equity north research show high level of economic inactivity in the north east due to disability or ill health—40 above the national average i visit the jobcentre in newcastle and be very impressed by the dedication and hard work of the staff but i know from the public and commercial services union that in universal credit manager take time off in for mental illness which be time the figure before we be the only country in the g7 not to have the same level of employment as before the pandemic be those high rate not because of record nhs waiting list low staff morale and general government incompetence 
 as the hon lady find within our jobcentre we have highly skilled people help people to find work we have a high number of people with disability in work than in more than and we intend to ensure that work coach can work carefully and sensitively and attend to people ’s need 
 in recent month the welsh affairs committee have hear from young adult about their experience with the benefit system we have be strike by how this group of young people want to work and feel that they can work but they have be write off as long term sick and pass to the long term sickness benefit roll by jobcentre they feel incredibly let down do the minister agree that we can not afford to be sign off so many of our young people on long term sickness 
 that be why we have workwell the back to work plan and the occupational health group lead by dame carol black look into fit note reform it be also why we have youth employment coach and the   youth hub we be work to ensure that there be the right attenuate support include kickstart the sector base work academy programme and boot camp only last week i meet steph who be year out of work and grateful for the help that she have have 
 what step he be take to help people into work 
 jobcentre plus provide a variety of different support to encourage and support people into work include training and to face to face counselling by work coach 
 in february there be claimant age to out of work in sittingbourne and sheppey do my right hon friend agree that it be important that school and business work together to ensure that young people have the qualification and skill they need to progress into work once they finish full time education 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend it be exactly why we have youth hub provide advice and support on not just get into work but other important matter to young people such as housing their health and debt management 
 i be talk to the royal national institute of blind people which represent the blind and partially sight it tell i of an employee who say 
 i be newly employ and i be unable to fulfil my role it have be extremely stressful and frustrating 
 and this be because of access to work do the minister agree that without have access to work in place within the week of someone enter work it be incredibly difficult for they to maintain that position 
 i be pleased that the hon lady raise access to work because it be extremely effective the grant can be there year in year out and be up to a maximum of £ along with other approach it have very much lead to our meeting our employment goal for disabled people in half the time that we set in over a more disabled people be in work by 
 what be the government do to use apprenticeship to help young people engage with the labour market to tackle level of economic inactivity and to give they the opportunity they need to get the career that they want 
 my right hon friend raise economic inactivity which be low in our country than in the united states france and italy it be below the average of the oecd the g7 and the european union apprenticeship play a very important part in produce those good figure though there be of course always more to be do not least through our approach of engage extremely closely with employer both at the national level and through our jobcentre 
 as somebody who have fight really hard over the last year to overcome the difficulty present by long covid i be sure that the secretary of state will appreciate that a significant number of the people not in work because of health condition will have some form of post viral fatigue link to long covid what assessment have he make of the effect of long covid on the workforce and what be he do to help people who have it get back to work 
 the hon gentleman specifically raise long covid which be of many health pressure in our society and post covid in many other country that be also affect by the virus we have a number of approach include universal support which place people in employment and give they critical support for up to month we also have workwell and we be look at occupational health and what tax incentive we might put in place to encourage employer to do more on that front we be do a great deal 
 i call the shadow minister 
 arguably the big barrier to growth in the uk and to turn around the prime minister ’s recession be the supply of labour follow the chancellor ’s back to work budget in the autumn and all the measure unveil since then some of which the secretary of state have just reel off do the office for budget responsibility upgrade or downgrade its forecast on employment growth in the budget day ago 
 of the most important figure in the spring budget economic and fiscal outlook be a recognition by the obr that there will be a net more people in employment as a consequence of that fiscal event and the that precede it in the autumn what the hon lady can not get away from be that economic inactivity in our country be at a low level than in every year under the last labour government 
 what the secretary of state can not get away from be the fact that as have already be say our employment rate have not return to the post pandemic level he can not answer the question because the truth be that the obr downgrade its forecast the unemployment forecast be bad the reason for that be a truth that the british people have know for a long time now these ministers sit on the treasury bench have no idea no plan for job no plan for growth they be do it be time for a general election 
 i have already refer to the additional job that the obr suggest in its forecast but the hon lady can not get away from the fact that we have record level of payroll employment in our country and near record low unemployment let we contrast that with labour ’s record it always leave unemployment higher than when it come into office economic inactivity be high than it be now in each year of the previous labour government and we have more people in absolute poverty after housing cost under labour as a direct consequence 
 what his plan timetable be for the roll out of welfare reform 
 we be bring forward a number of important reform to our welfare system at pace phase of our universal support have already be activate and phase will be later this year next month we will announce workwell area about a of england that have be successfully select and will be roll out live this autumn 
 i thank the secretary of state for list all those reform the data be clear that after week out of work the chance of someone find work start to fall off rapidly therefore there be a need for more intensive and tailor support could he update the house on the additional jobcentre support roll out and when my constituent might get access to those benefit 
 we be keen to do that ajs to which my hon friend refer have be roll out in part of the country at week but shortly will be extend and strengthen for week at the week stage of the unemployment journey that be part of the more intensive condition that we apply to ensure that we help and in many circumstance require people to go back into work 
 some of the poor people i know in my constituency work for themselves hill farmer have see a drop in their income over the last year the welfare system do not work for they because they be pay less than the minimum wage access to universal credit be less for they because of the minimum income floor will the secretary of state urgently look at that so that small business owner especially hill farmer in my constituency be not make even poor because of the government ’s rule 
 the hon gentleman be right inasmuch as universal credit for the self employ have to recognise the fact that sometimes there be inconsistent level of income month to month that be why we have a minimum income floor and the arrangement around that i know he have a rural agricultural constituency i recognise some of those issue and i be look closely at they 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of his department 's support for vulnerable people who claim social security benefit 
 in british sign language happy sign language week everybody it be a key priority for the department for work and pensions to provide effective support for our vulnerable customer we provide training on how to support customer mental health and we have a point plan for support claimant who may be at risk of suicide or self harm the dwp regularly review process to make improvement through colleague and customer feedback and through the work of the serious case panel 
 the government estimate that of household on legacy benefit would fail to move to universal credit under manage migration   however by last december have not manage to do so and as a result have their benefit stop this be a matter of real concern the dwp will now ask more vulnerable people who be wholly reliant on benefit to transfer what will the government do to ensure that those vulnerable people do not fall out of the social security system 
 i thank the hon lady for her point about vulnerable customer who have come into our curtilage and purview the minister for employment have remind i that we will take this very slowly and will engage with and support customer customer can speak to help to claim adviser at citizens advice and we will ensure that we listen to they 
 in addition to the financial support provide to personal independence payment claimant what progress be be make to refer claimant proactively to the wide support available in their community 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight this point there be the household support fund help to claim and opportunity to pop into the local library to get additional support for example there be also an extra £ out there on top of the £ through to the end of this month i would say to anybody the benefit calculator be out there and do talk to the cab and your local council”—perhaps in swindon 
 today the government be in geneva defend their policy to the un committee that be investigate the uk for breach of the convention on the right of person with disability include article on the right of disabled people to social protection give that drastically cut disabled people ’s social security support between and and austerity be find to be responsible for avoidable death how will the new wave of austerity announce in the budget affect the health and wellbeing of disabled people 
 i be pleased to have this opportunity to make it clear to the house that the government be commit to the un convention on the right of person with disability and we look forward to outline the uk ’s progress on advance the right of disabled people across this country our national disability strategy and the disability action plan be deliver tangible progress this include ensure that disabled customer can use the service they be entitle to as we have spell out today disabled people ’s need be well reflect in planning for emergency as well we be make sure that this country be the most accessible and importantly equal place to live in the world 
 i truly welcome and be personally grateful for my hon friend ’s support for my campaign for parity between mental and physical health in the workplace and for the recent publication of the national suicide prevention strategy which reference of the point i have be campaign on i understand acutely that the health and safety executive have work hard on update aid guidance and i would be grateful if the minister could please update the house on this 
 the dwp be also proudly committed to become a more trauma inform organisation and we will be world lead on that i be pleased to see that in hastings the hse continue to work with we as do the department of health and social care to support the suicide prevention strategy for england i can confirm that the phase of mental health guidance on the hse website have be revise to include text that emphasise the importance of and the need to consider parity of risk to either mental or physical health 
 what step he be take to help fill job vacancy in banff and buchan constituency 
 the jobcentre team be provide a broad range of support include partner with morrisons and the co op to fill local vacancy in my hon friend ’s constituency and deliver target outreach at banff library with local provider 
 my hon friend be aware of the very low unemployment in banff and buchan and the difficulty in fill vacancy with local people particularly in the food and drink sector the seafood sector in particular be still in a transition away from dependency on overseas worker which could take some year what datum can the dwp provide on the measure that local business have take to maximise the employment of local people and what other support can the department offer to attract worker to area of low unemployment such as banff and buchan 
 there be the wage pay through the rise in the national living wage my hon friend ’s local jobcentre and the range of access to support i be sure we will be discuss all these issue tomorrow at the roundtable with seafood processor that i will be attend along with the minister for legal migration and the border my hon friend   the member for corby tom pursglove 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 a large number of people in banff and buchan be economically inactive they be not claim benefit so they be not eligible for employment support from jobcentre but the select committee recommend last summer that such people should be eligible would that not be in their interest and in the interest of employer struggle to fill vacant post at the moment and therefore supportive of much need economic growth 
 we always take these matter very seriously and keep they under full review 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the potential impact of change in the cost of live on level of food bank use 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the potential impact of change in the cost of live on level of food bank use 
 food bank be independent organisation with dwp have no direct role in their operation we do however monitor the use of food bank through the family resource survey and the next instalment of that will be later this month 
 nearly people need help from ealing foodbank last year some of they be child under it be amazing that the food bank and its volunteer be there to help but it be a national shame that it be need what be the government ’s plan to reduce dependence on food bank 
 this be the government who have oversee a reduction in the number of child in absolute poverty since despite the chuntering from the opposition front bench unfortunately the figure be far bad under the last labour government than they may be at the moment the hon gentleman ask directly what we be do we be again put up the national living wage by substantially more than inflation this april the chancellor have already bring in national insurance cut that will be worth £ to the average earner benefit themselves be go up by next month we have also change the arrangement for local housing allowance which mean that people many of whom be on very low income will be well off by an average of £ a year 
 while on the campaign trail i meet the daylight centre and serve rushden both have see their service user increase in number even with the extension of the household support fund which they both welcome what can the secretary of state do to expand the eligibility of the fund improve uptake and increase the value of the healthy start payment 
 may i welcome the hon lady to her place in answer to her question i will simply point out that there be much speculation before the spring budget about whether the housing support fund be go to be extend in my opinion the chancellor take exactly the right approach and the fund have now be extend for a further month 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 research from the trussell trust reveal the devastating truth more than half of people receive universal credit run out of food in january and could not afford more and universal credit claimant have fall into debt because they could not keep up with essential bill will the secretary of state back the trussell trust ’s joint campaign with the joseph rowntree foundation and commit to legislate for an essential guarantee in universal credit to reduce food bank use and ensure that everyone have a protect minimum amount of support in order to afford life ’s essential yes or no 
 the most important thing be that this government recognise that the good way out of poverty and the good way to address the circumstance that the hon lady describe be through work that be why the chancellor reduce taxation make work pay ever more and why the national living wage be to be increase by close to this april follow a similar increase around this time last year benefit be go up by and increase by this time last year i have already mention local housing allowance and of course we have now have consecutive month of real wage growth as inflation have fall 
 what step his department be take to increase the support offer by jobcentres in darlington 
 the team be work tirelessly with darlington borough council tees valley combined authority and other partner to deliver through job fair swap and skill bootcamp 
 i thank my hon friend for her answer and may i be the in the chamber to wish she a very happy birthday in addition to the issue that she have highlight may i highlight the wonderful work that darlington jobcentre have do in set up its facebook page do she agree that it be a template for other to follow and will she come to darlington and meet my fantastic work coach 
 i thank my hon friend it be seemingly quite a large number on my birthday card today 
 my hon friend have be a fantastic champion of his local jobcentre and have campaign vigorously to ensure that darlington be at the forefront of innovation i will be meet his team in april i have be to jobcentre since the last dwp question and i will make sure that his work coach be at the top of my list 
 the minister in her response to   the hon member for darlington peter gibson have emphasise what she will do for his local jobcentre whatever she will do for darlington she will also do for the rest of the united kingdom include my constituency of strangford across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland how can we work well with further education college to get our young people ready for the job that become available 
 i talk regularly to colleague in the department for education ensure that those skilled boot camp swap make people job ready because they have not only the experience but a guaranteed interview that be the way we be drive those number up 
 what step his department be take to support pensioner 
 what step his department be take to support pensioner 
 what step his department be take to support pensioner 
 in we will spend over £ on benefit for pensioner in great britain—5.9 of gdp include a forecast £ on the state pension 
 i thank my hon friend for his reply south derbyshire pensioner have be in touch with i follow the budget email to say that it seem to offer they nothing would he be kind enough to set out today the help that the government have give and be give to pensioner to help they realise that nothing be far from the reality of what a conservative government be give they 
 i be grateful for that question the answer could not be further from nothing this be a government with a prove track record of support pensioner include our commitment to the triple lock in april we will see the state pension raise by this year after an increase of last year mean that it will be a full £ high in cash term than it be in 
 i very much welcome the record on support pensioner that my hon friend have just outline a number of pensioner in my constituency have contact i about the effect of fiscal drag they may have a very modest private pension that be now be drag into tax when they never expect it to be what step be my hon friend take in conjunction with the treasury to ensure that we can get pensioner on modest private pension out of tax 
 this be the government who have nearly double the personal allowance since ensure that most of the low earner do not pay income tax indeed thank to the personal allowance around of individual do not pay tax and of course any pensioner solely reliant on the state pension do not pay income tax 
 do my hon friend agree with i that while the conservative proudly continue to support pensioner in their hard earn retirement with the triple lock and other cost of live support measure it be disgraceful that the labour mayor of london have hammer pensioner and work people in bexley by increase council tax by approximately £ per year and ultra low emission zone charge to £ per day 
 i be sure my hon friend agree with i that the mayor of london seem to spend more time pay extremely expensive salary to some of his key employee around greater london of course ulez have an effect on pensioner whether they be go to the shop visit their family or attend hospital appointment they will be the one to pay the price for the mayor ’s overweene ambition 
 in early december my constituent be inform by the dwp that they must renew their personal independence payment entitlement they be tell that if the necessary form be not return by   january their pip could be stop on christmas day the dwp inform my constituent that as the form have not be return their pip entitlement have be stop and they owe some money my constituent return the form in early january long before the deadline but they have have no response since then and nor have they receive their benefit could i implore the minister to intervene in this astounding case and work out exactly how this error could have occur 
 i thank the hon lady for her question if she write to i with further detail i will ensure that the relevant minister be able to look into the case 
 with more than pensioner now pay income tax many as we have just hear as a result of frozen allowance and almost not receive pension credit to which they be rightly entitle do the minister think it might be time to improve the uptake of pension credit 
 i be pleased to be able to say that application to receive pension credit be currently increase quarter on quarter 
 indicate dissent 
 if the hon gentleman will wait and listen to the answer i will explain what we be do to increase uptake of pension credit not only do we have major nationwide campaign our late feature harry redknapp we be also carry out experimental campaign such as write to all those pensioner who be in receipt of housing benefit to make sure that those most likely to be eligible for pension credit be be target to take it up 
 it be all very well people apply for pension credit but the well advice centre in my constituency have identify massive delay in people get the pension credit for which they be eligible constituent get in touch with i in february have apply for pension credit in august and they be still wait for the application to be resolve result in a backdating of more than £ would that money not have be much well in the pocket of a pensioner who need it right then rather than wait indefinitely for the dwp to get back to they 
 i be obviously disappointed to hear of that constituent ’s experience but it be not something i hear very often about pension credit we have an excellent delivery record and an extremely low level of complaint 
 southend ’s indomitable pensioner and waspi woman frances neil and deborah dalton come to see i on friday on behalf of the waspi woman across southend with the ombudsman ’s final report due within week   will the secretary of state please commit to come to the house to make a statement so that these issue can be fully air 
 as i be sure my hon friend be all too aware i be not able to comment until the parliamentary and health service ombudsman ’s report be publish 
 when will this miserable government wake up to the fact that there be a shortage of skilled labour in this country and at the same time that we have an army of pensioner who could be retain in the workforce if they be give the right incentive to carry on work there be a good relationship between work and stay healthy so will the minister act 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman be volunteer himself for a post commons career but there be many job opportunity for pensioner across the country indeed many people work on attendance allowance in my part of blackpool be in their 70 and 80 and they be do a fantastic job we put an awful lot of effort not just through the mid life mot but through the old worker support in our jobcentre to make sure that we match jobseeker to the right job for they 
 i call the shadow minister 
 time and again pensioner have be let down by this government they suspend the triple lock break a key manifesto promise their disastrous mini budget knock hundred of billion of pound from pension pot and their failure to get a grip on the cost of living mean that pensioner be mainly live in cold home over the winter and have a choice between heating or eating against this backdrop be the minister at all surprised that almost in pensioner be now live in poverty 
 it be as if the shadow minister have not notice the almost £ of cost of living payment make to pension credit recipient across the country over the last year i know the opposition have rely on last week ’s resolution foundation report to criticise what we be do but this be what the report actually say 
 pensioner use to be by far the most likely to be in poverty now they be the least likely this change in the relationship between old age and low income be of the most profound social and economic change this country have see 
 we achieve that under this government not under our fail labour predecessor 
 what step he be take through the benefit system to tackle poverty in rural area 
 we be bear down on poverty not least by incentivise work within the benefit system as the hon gentleman will know we have reduce the universal credit taper for example which have lead to a record level of payroll employment and near record low unemployment 
 i commission a poverty report for the arfon constituency from the highly respect bevan foundation copy be available online in welsh and english finding be that of the people receive both universal credit and housing benefit in arfon be pay the bedroom tax compare with across wales this be cushion to some extent by the gwynedd local authority ’s discretionary help but will the minister review the differential negative effect of the bedroom tax between community particularly those with a diminished housing stock because of for example high level of holiday home 
 i thank the hon gentleman for refer to that report which i will look at with interest of course there be no such thing as a bedroom tax as it be not a tax at all it be a spare room subsidy it be there for very good reason to free up additional space for those who need it on the housing front as i say early local housing allowance have be improve such that people on low income in the private rent sector will be on average £ a year well off come april 
 of the good way to tackle poverty in rural area such as ynys môn be through job fair will the secretary of state join i in thank alwen gardiner and my brilliant ynys môn dwp team for organise an excellent tourism and hospitality job fair which be attend by over jobseeker in llangefni and company such as tredici butchers deli in beaumaris and the breeze hill in benllech diolch yn fawr 
 i thank my hon friend for draw attention to her job fair she be a local dynamo in stand up for her constituent when i arrive there recently think i be very special to support yet another job fair a disability job fair i be quickly remind of the fact that i be the minister to have be to her constituency in i think the past month 
 what step he be take to tackle non payment of housing benefit to district council when the beneficiary be not a register social landlord 
 the supported housing regulatory oversight act bring reform to the support housing sector to improve quality and value for money any change to funding model would need to be consider in the context of those broad reform but we keep the subsidy policy under review 
 charnwood borough council currently contribute £ a year to subsidise the support housing benefit payment to local charity which be unable to become registered social landlord the charity provide excellent support and accommodation to those suffer from addiction or ex offender undergo rehabilitation however the cost to the council be unsustainable please will my hon friend look at fund those service as the department for work and pensions currently do for similar organisation that be register social landlord 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue the challenging fiscal environment mean that we need to prioritise resource and ensure that support be target effectively to maximise impact for citizen i chair a cross government group with the department for levelling up housing and communities on quality issue and other matter such as subsidy loss which she raise we will continue to review and monitor the concern that she and other local authority have raise however i point to the local housing allowance uplift which be a central focus for i 
 what recent estimate he have make of the average time it take for claimant to complete medical assessment for personal independence payment claim 
 we treat all claimant individually recognise the differ need of health condition and disability and the impact on claimant daily life the length of time for an assessment be not include in the contract between the dwp and provider but i can confirm that the average time for be minute 
 i be heartbroken to hear the experience of a constituent who have to go through an enhance medical assessment for pip a bowel cancer survivor with severe arthritis she be make to stay on a phone call for over hour to be assess that mean that due to her need she have to suffer the indignity of soil herself just to complete the assessment how on earth can that be okay i would like to understand what step be be take to reduce the time of these assessment and to hear what can be do to ensure they be finally undertake with basic human compassion 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise a distressing case the dwp be commit to assess people as quickly as possible i be happy to look into that particular situation to see why in this case the support the claimant be entitle to do not come promptly prioritise the reduction of processing time to maximise the number of assessment complete without affect quality be key but i be very happy to take that case away 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the department for work and pensions have a staggering outstanding pip claim the average clearance time be currently week people be wait almost month for a decision which can have a significant impact on physical and mental health what be the minister do to improve clearance time so that people be not leave in limbo worry about whether they can afford the extra cost associate with their disability or long term health condition the government urgently need to get a grip 
 claimant satisfaction have remain above the service level of or high as of the month average that begin in september the end- to end clearance time from registration to a decision be make be currently week which have be reduce from   week in august interruption the hon lady ask very gently what we be do we have multi channel assessment and i be engage regularly with my official twice a month to ensure that we be assess the queue and the delay and as i say at the start of this question that we be treat everybody individually and in a tailored and suitable way 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty 
 what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty 
 we be reduce child poverty through the use of a large number of measure not least ensure that work pay hence our increase in the national living wage in april and the reduction in the national insurance tax that my right hon friend the chancellor announce recently 
 a total of child will be keep clear of poverty this year thank to the scottish government ’s policy primarily the scottish child payment surely the secretary of state must now look to roll out some of our policy in other part of the uk and at the very least ditch the child limit which deliberately force child into poverty 
 the limit to which the hon gentleman refer be there for a very good reason which be that people in those circumstance should face the same basic decision as those not on benefit that be an important matter of fairness across those who receive benefit as well as the many who be pay tax as for the number of child in poverty that have fall by since 
 many of those people be in work secretary of state some £ have be pay to more than child ’s family in renfrewshire thank to the widely praise scottish child payment praise have come from the institute for public policy research scotland which say that the scottish government be make employment for parent central to their child poverty strategy but it say that devolve employment support programme be 
 hold back by responsibility be split across government and a reserved jobcentre system which be more often focus on compliance than help people reach their full potential 
 it recommend the full devolution of employment support to tackle child poverty will the secretary of state listen to the expert 
 i be always very interested in listen to the hon gentleman and any idea that he have about how we should improve our welfare system but i point to the fact that this country have see a considerable drop in absolute child poverty after housing cost of since 
 what correlation do the secretary of state see between child in poverty and workless family give that there be no age restriction on most apprenticeship and today ’s announcement that there will be more apprenticeship and that the apprenticeship levy can be spend on great number of contractor and sub contractor what opportunity do he see for his department to highlight those opportunity for people who be of work age and who may have child in poverty 
 my hon friend refer to workless household he be absolutely right about the correlation a child be time more likely to be in poverty if they be grow up in a workless household he be right to draw attention to the announcement that have be make today about even great investment in apprenticeship and also the change in the way that the apprenticeship levy work so that supply chain can benefit to a great degree 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i join the house in say happy birthday to the minister for employment my hon friend   the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill it should be a national holiday as far as i be concern perhaps that be an idea for a private member ’s bill or something similar 
 i be pleased that since the last question we have publish our review into autism employment and i place on record my thank to my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   who do such excellent work in bring that useful report forward 
 look forward from april we will see benefit generally rise by the state pension by the national living wage by around and the next tranche of the household support fund be bring forward as i have already set out our plan be work it mean more employment historically low unemployment and an economic inactivity rate below country such as the united states france and italy 
 the economic inactivity rate be now very high with people cite long term sickness as a reason some day of work be lose at a cost of £ to the economy have the secretary of state see the policy exchange report publish today with policy proposal back by of his predecessor david blunkett and my right hon friend   the member for norwich north chloe smith what step be the government take to improve the provision of workplace health service through occupational health pathway and vocational rehabilitation and will he consider the proposal in the policy exchange report 
 i will of course look closely at the report that my right hon friend refer to indeed i reach out to he recently to invite he to the department to discuss that and other matter with regard to long term sickness and disability we be work on an array of intervention include occupational health support   within business workwell bring together medical intervention with work coach universal support to help people into work and to stay in work with that support and fundamental reform of the work capability assessment such that the obr say that few people will go on to those benefit go forward 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the budget the chancellor say that he want to end national insurance contribution because the 
 double taxation of work be unfair ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 people ’s nic record help to determine their entitlement to the state pension so if national insurance be scrap how will they know what pension they will get 
 i be not surprised that the hon lady bring that up because i be well aware of the position that her party have take on the announcement that we have make she will be clear in her own mind that the chancellor have not guarantee that we will reduce at stroke national insurance contribution it be an aspiration that have be speak about as occur over a number of year if not parliaments so the problem that she be conjure up to frighten pensioner be nothing short of political scaremongering 
 the secretary of state can bluster and deny all he like but the prime minister tell the sunday times 
 we want to end this double taxation on work 
 it be there in black and white so let i try again how will people ’s pension entitlement be determine if nic be scrap and if the government be go to merge nic with income tax what will that mean for pensioner tax bill be the truth not that their unfunded £ plan to scrap nic be yet more chaos from the conservatives and britain ’s pensioner deserve so much well 
 the hon lady quote from the sunday times and i scribble it down 
 we want to end this double taxation 
 of course we do but that be not the same as a near term pledge it be a long term aspiration—[interruption we have be quite upfront quite unlike—[interruption if she would care to hear i out it be quite unlike the £ firm commitment that her party make and subsequently u turn on which be nothing short of fiscally reckless and would have lead to increase in interest rate inflation unemployment and so on 
 i extend my gratitude to the minister for disabled people health and work for recently hold a menopause roundtable that be particularly focus on employment in tourism and hospitality and to gatwick airport for host it what step will the menopause employment champion take next 
 i be delighted about the regional roundtable include in the leisure and hospitality sector oil and gas and education among other they be   inform the sector work of the menopause employment champion and her year report be now available showcase a variety of stakeholder perspective and outcome for woman who need support 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the resolution foundation highlight that scrap the child limit would be of the most efficient way to drive down child poverty rate and would lift child out of poverty overnight surely child grow up in poverty be child too many the secretary of state should reverse course on this and the labour party should also commit to scrap the child limit do the secretary of state agree that no child should grow up in poverty and will he take action to ensure that that stop now 
 the hon lady raise the same point as her colleague   the hon member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart c. mcdonald about the child limit i will not detain the house by repeat exactly the same answer other than to agree passionately with she that child in poverty be too many and to say that although we have far to go it be important to recognise that we have reduce the number of child in absolute poverty after housing cost by since 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group for disability i thank the minister for recognise sign language week in the chamber it be so important for disability inclusion in the workplace will she recommend that hon member from across the house meet representative of the british deaf association who be now welcome people in dining room a at an event i be co sponsor 
 i be delighted to welcome sign language week which be mark its anniversary of recognise british sign language as a language in its own right i encourage member to join the british deaf association reception after these question have end 
 the government will move thousand of my constituent across to universal credit over the next year they will be force to wait week for their payment or   up to week if they receive child or work tax credit accord to dwp datum of the people across merseyside who be in that situation will take out an advance loan do the minister think it right that my constituent who be among the most deprived in the country should be push into debt or face week without the bare minimum that they need to afford the essential 
 the plan be to roll out those migration notice by   march we intend to publish datum for the hon gentleman ’s constituency we be committed to ensure that the transition work as smoothly as possible for everyone 
 have the minister make any recent assessment of what trade or occupation be short of worker at the moment   and what step be be take to persuade people perhaps more experienced people back into the workforce to fill those vacancy 
 we be work with other departments employer and stakeholder to isolate where those vacancy be and on sector base work academy programme we have put over people through construction care tourism hospitality all those gap that we need to fill 
 of people currently claim tax credit be not move over to universal credit in the migration the department tell we that those who be not claim would have get a median amount of £ a year will the minister assure i and the house that she be do everything she can to ensure that people be get the money that they be owe 
 i assure the hon lady that we be keep a close eye on the issue but ultimately it be the customer ’s responsibility to claim i gently point out that we have be roll out the migration in her constituency since may with not complaint there be plenty of help available to those people as they transition 
 as my right hon friend will know fast diagnosis and treatment be key to get people back into work what representation have he make to his departmental and cabinet colleague to ensure that that be the case 
 i thank my hon friend and near neighbour for her question i know that she care deeply about the issue that she have raise we work closely with other department for example we work with the department of health and social care on nhs talk therapy of which we have announce more over the next year as well as on workwell which i have mention and on fit note reform with the department for levelling up housing and communities we be work closely on housing i have speak about the local housing allowance change come through and with the department for education we be work on swap and on training and apprenticeship 
 school general practitioner social service charity and housing association can all refer their client to a food bank in an emergency yet this government who be responsible for benefit sanction have order dwp staff to stop refer claimant to food bank how can minister justify this decision to the family of the child live in poverty in my east durham constituency 
 may i make it clear that that be just scaremongere the dwp have not change its policy there be merely improvement be make to the signpost slip so that we comply with our obligation under the gdpr we continue to provide guidance to customer signpost they to emergency support as be right 
 a couple in my constituency recently receive an apologetic letter from the department for   work and pensions that set out a catalogue of mistake that it have make those mistake almost lead to their lose their home which cause they enormous stress my constituent be now wait for a decision on the compensation that they may receive will my right hon friend look into the case and ensure that a decision be take as quickly as possible to save my constituent any further stress 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter i obviously can not comment on an individual case however i be very happy to look closely into the matter he have raise and either i or a relevant minister will be happy to meet he 
 the number of the long term sick have rise from pre pandemic to today this huge increase start in spring at the same time as the roll out of the experimental emergency use vaccine or do the secretary of state have an alternative explanation for the unprecedented rise in long term sickness in the uk since spring 
 among the major driver of the increase to which the hon gentleman refer be mental health issue and musculoskeletal issue i be not entirely sure that he be accurate when he say that the upward trajectory in the number occur just as vaccination occur i think it predate that moment and i certainly do not subscribe to the view that vaccination be in any way unsafe 
 for many year the department publish statistic give a breakdown of welfare claim by nationality although the department still have the datum it no long publish the statistic will the minister look again at that and start publish those important statistic once again 
 i thank my hon friend but i would like to inform he that at the moment there be no plan to recommence the publication of those statistic 
 the last labour government lift child out of poverty after year of tory government we have child in destitution what have go wrong 
 i have to take issue with the hon gentleman he need to look more closely at his party ’s record in government fact no be that the labour party always leave office with high unemployment fact no be that economic inactivity in our country be low than in any year in his party ’s time in office fact no be that absolute poverty have decline in our country since his party be in office fact no be that there be more child in workless household on his watch than there be on ours perhaps most tellingly of all during his party ’s time in office over people languish on long term benefit for almost a decade that be a disgraceful record 
 of the most challenging group of people to get back into the workforce be those in their 50 and 60 whose job disappear during covid they have possibly fall   back on their personal pension although with inflation that money be be eat away what action be my hon friend take to get those people back into work and to encourage they into job that be valuable and improve our productivity 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i would ask people to go to their jobcentre which can help they build their cv and their confidence we have 50plus champion across all district and midlife mots i for think that work in my 50 and now my 60 be a very good idea indeed 
 the wellbee hub in my constituency in brora and dunbeath be crucial to the wellbeing of pensioner they signpost the good mix of benefit and be a last safety net but their future be uncertain because of the vagary of nhs scotland finance will a minister meet i to discuss how we can safeguard the future of these centre 
 i be always happy to have a debate with the hon gentleman we sit next to each other almost every morning in portcullis house and i be sure that we can have a conversation 
 aylesbury be a wonderful place to live work visit and invest in but sadly we have some area of economic deprivation opportunity bucks run by buckinghamshire council have identify aylesbury north and aylesbury north west as area for extra attention where we could improve education training and skill how can my hon friend ’s department assist such initiative in get more aylesbury resident into work 
 we be work with employer and jobcentre on the sector base work academy programme and boot camp but i be more than happy to visit my hon friend in aylesbury and to talk to his jobcentre and employer to see how we can provide more encouragement 
 on a point of order mr speaker over the weekend i see on social medium that a number of labour members have the good judgment to visit the beautiful bishop auckland constituency and while i be grateful to the member who give i notice of their visit that be in stark contrast to the member the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and the hon member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson for blaydon liz twist and for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell)—who do not have the good judgment to follow your advice mr speaker and notify i as the sit mp i have let they know of my intention to raise this issue in the chamber today could you advise the house once again on how we can ensure that member give notice of a visit to another member ’s constituency 
 i be grateful to the hon member for give i notice of this point of order and inform the members concern the courtesy apply to any visit make in an official capacity i know that election fever have take over but i remind the house once again that as i say on   november   and   january when a member intend to visit another constituency other than in a private capacity they should make every reasonable effort to inform the member represent that constituency boundary change do not take effect until the next election and in the meanwhile we must observe the convention of not involve ourselves with other member constituency i have have complaint from member on both side of the house please do the right thing and stick to the convention that we expect each other to follow 
 on a point of order mr speaker on   thursday march during business question in response to a question from   the hon member for colne valley jason mccartney   about council spending the leader of the house say that labour have a legacy of vote rigging in tower hamlets that be a false claim i wonder if the right hon lady get her party confuse as there be a widely report case in in which the election commission and richard mawrey void the mayoral election of under the representation of the people act on the ground of corrupt and illegal practice but that relate to the activity of a party name tower hamlets and have nothing to do with tower hamlets labour party or the national labour party can you offer advice mr speaker on whether and when the leader of the house can come to the house to set the record straight 
 the leader of the house be here 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i take such matter extremely seriously and in the past when i have    misspoken or get a fact wrong i have correct the record however if i be guilty of anything in our exchange last thursday it be of underplay the situation the incident that the hon lady refer to do indeed involve an independent politician although back by ken livingstone however in the year alone there be new case of corruption under the then labour mayor john biggs and the incident i refer to be labour ’s legacy because just a few week ago government inspector be call in again to investigate tower hamlets i fully understand it if the hon lady do not want to take my word for it so i direct she to a letter write to her party ’s national executive committee in about a local selection it be write on behalf of member of the local labour party it say 
 on behalf of a number of distressed member the tower hamlets labour party who have be victim of intimidation bullying harassment and blackmailing by member of john biggs campaign team some of whom be senior and leading figure of the local labour party 
 if she look up the letter and see who be signatory to it she may be more persuade

 proceeding on any subsequent message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to a conclusion hour after their commencement.—(aaron bell 
 question agree to 
 consideration of lords amendment 
 i can confirm that none of the lords amendment engage commons financial privilege 
 i beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment 
 with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment to and government motion to disagree 
 this bill be an essential element of our wide strategy to protect our border and to stop the boat to prevent the tragic loss of life at sea cause by dangerous illegal and unnecessary crossing of the channel there be lords amendment i turn to amendment it imply that the legislation be not compliant with the rule of law but i can confirm that it be i do not accept that the bill undermine the rule of law and the government take our responsibility and international obligation incredibly seriously there be nothing in the bill that require any act or omission that conflict with our international obligation 
 the minister will understand that many of we be deeply concerned that the bill undermine the good friday agreement he have tell we previously that it do not but he will also know that the irish parliament have be consider this matter indeed on   february the irish prime minister admit that the irish government be concern and be follow this debate closely for the avoidance of doubt can the minister tell we when the uk government consult the irish government about this legislation and about our obligation under the good friday agreement what be the outcome of that consultation 
 i be concern with this government and this parliament as for our obligation nothing in the bill require any act or omission that conflict with our international obligation in fact this bill be base on compliance by both rwanda and the united kingdom with international law in the form of a treaty that recognise and reflect the international legal obligation of both the united kingdom and rwanda 
 at least the minister respond to our question and try to address the issue the last time i ask a question on this matter he try to answer it but the fact be that because of northern ireland ’s border with the republic of ireland it have special circumstance we be reassure then about northern ireland ’s circumstance   the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy   refer to the good friday agreement which be example but there be   also the matter before we can the minister confirm that the concern that the democratic unionist party put forward in our last debate on this issue have be take on board we do not see that from the legislation before we tonight and if we do not see that it will be hard for we to support the government 
 i do recall our early exchange across the chamber and the hon gentleman may know of my exchange with his hon friend   the member for belfast east gavin robinson   and the subsequent correspondence the government continue to believe that there be no incompatibility between the bill and article of the windsor framework i know the hon gentleman have be concern about that but i hope he be reassure by some of the detail set out in the letter 
 i must say i be surprised that the government be not concerned about the clash between the bill and article of the windsor framework and the northern ireland protocol give that the high court in belfast have rule that legislation of this nature can not apply in northern ireland because it be incompatible with the obligation in article to accord with european law 
 i understand the right hon gentleman ’s concern but i repeat that there be no incompatibility between article and the bill he be right to cite the judgment but there be to be an appeal so it would not be right to debate it far at this stage the government ’s position on this point be very clear as set out in previous exchange and also in the letter that be now in the house of commons library 
 rwanda can not be deem a safe country for refugee simply as a result of a unilateral declaration by the government in the face of the court and other independent organisation that have prove the contrary to be the case but let i get this straight it will cost nearly £ for just refugee to be send on a plane to rwanda which amount to an eye watering £ cost per person to the public purse do the minister agree that that be precisely why this political gimmick of a rwanda bill be extortionate unethical unworkable and unlawful 
 i disagree entirely with all the point that the hon gentleman have make i know that he be patient and he will hear i respond to each and every 
 like i the minister have always believe that immigration should be deal with on a uk rather than a great britain basis for obvious reason give the comment that we have just hear do he agree that there be plenty of precedent within our own law for deem certain claim for certain citizen inadmissible that have apply to the eu and surely it be not a problem to extend it far because we already have the principle that we can say   a claim be inherently unfounded when a country be clearly safe 
 i agree entirely with my hon friend who speak with great experience and authority he will be aware of other instance in which we have legislate and continue to legislate and have deem country to be safe 
 my right hon and learn friend be make a good case for the importance of the bill and the irrelevance of the amendment offer by the other place to what we be try to achieve do he agree that when people criticise the bill on the ground of the cost of send people to rwanda they entirely miss the point that this will act as a huge disincentive to people in family and community predominantly in the middle east who fundraise vast sum of money in order for their child to arrive here in the uk and not end up in east africa do he also agree that the accusation base on cost hugely underestimate the actual cost of housing current illegal immigrant in hotel across the country 
 my hon friend be entirely right on both count i will develop the point about the deterrent effect in a few moment because it be a point that be miss repeatedly by the labour members he be also right about the cost and the cost of not act not least the human cost of not act 
 rise 
 i be go to make some progress now 
 the bill be base on the compliance of both rwanda and the united kingdom with international law in the form of the treaty which itself reflect the international legal obligation of both the uk and rwanda along with other country with similar constitutional arrangement to ours we have a dualist approach international law be treat as separate to domestic law and international law be incorporate into our law by parliament through legislation this bill reflect the fact that parliament be sovereign and can change domestic law as it see fit include if it be parliament ’s judgment by require a state of affair or fact to be recognise that be the central feature of the bill and many other provision be design to ensure that parliament ’s conclusion on the safety of rwanda be accept by the domestic court 
 the treaty set out the international legal commitment that the uk and rwandan government have make consistent with their share standard associate with asylum and refugee protection we have make it abundantly clear that we assess rwanda to be a safe country and that we be confident in the government of rwanda ’s commitment to the partnership in order successfully to offer safety and protection to those relocate under the treaty 
 i be unable to accept lords amendment as be it simply not necessary rwanda have a long and proud history of support and integrate asylum seeker and refugee into the region the government of rwanda the african union and the united nations high commissioner for refugees sign an agreement to continue the operation of the emergency transit mechanism centre in rwanda which temporarily accommodate some of the most vulnerable refugee population who have face trauma detention and violence rwanda have showcase its willingness and ability to work collaboratively to provide solution to refugee situation and to crisis 
 it be worth reflect on the policy statement and some of the evidence that have be put forward in relation to this debate and previous debate because there it be clear that the eu have announce a € support package to the emergency transit mechanism the ambassador have say that it 
 be a crucial life save initiative to evacuate people to safety in rwanda it be a significant example of african solidarity and of partnership with the european union 
 the point the minister have not mention be that the european scheme be voluntary be the government intend the same sort of parameter within this scheme 
 on the safety of rwanda the ambassador be very clear about his assessment i be go to continue read the quote but there be other there be more than refugee safely in rwanda and be look after the ambassador go on to say 
 we be grateful to the government of rwanda for host these man woman and child until such time durable solution can be find 
 there be evidence of the safety of rwanda 
 the minister say that he be accept the word of the rwandan foreign minister that the country be safe yet our judge in the high court of our country have decide that rwanda be not safe so be our minister say that the high judge in our land be wrong 
 no respectfully i encourage the hon lady to listen to the debate because i read out the word of the eu ’s ambassador not of any representative from rwanda that be a powerful independent voice which be why i cite it here in this chamber 
 the implementation of all measure within the treaty will be expedite indeed since our previous debate on this matter the legislation require for rwanda to ratify the treaty have pass through both houses of the rwandan parliament once ratify the treaty will become law in rwanda the implementation of these provision in practice will be keep under review by the independent monitoring committee whose role be enhance by the treaty and which will ensure compliance with the obligation as agree 
 do the minister recall that the supreme court judgment hinge on the issue of refoulement and not on whether or not refugee be safe in rwanda it might benefit some to have listen to its judgment 
 i be grateful indeed to my hon friend i will turn to refoulement and non refoulement and that important issue which be exactly the basis of the supreme court judgment and how we have meet it through evidence from subsequent to the time when the supreme court be look at the fact on the ground 
 the implementation of these provision in practice will be keep under review by the independent monitoring committee as be state clearly in clause of the bill the provision will come into force when the treaty enter into force and the treaty enter into force once the party have complete their internal procedure 
 the bill ’s purpose be to make it clear that rwanda be safe generally and that decision maker as well as court and tribunal must conclusively treat it as such the amendment as draft would open the door to lengthy legal challenge which will delay removal it therefore follow that i can not support the amendment we be confident in the government of rwanda ’s commitment and i be clear that rwanda be a safe country 
 i turn to lords amendment which be also unnecessary the government will ratify the treaty only once we agree with rwanda that all necessary implementation be in place for both country to comply with the obligation under the treaty as i say the legislation for rwanda to ratify the treaty have now pass through both chambers of the rwandan parliament once ratify the treaty will become law in rwanda it therefore follow that the government of rwanda would be require to give effect to the term of the treaty in accordance with their domestic law as well as in international law 
 in relation to the monitoring committee it be always intend that the committee be independent to ensure a layer of impartial oversight over the operation of the partnership maintain that committee ’s independence be an integral aspect of the policy ’s design the treaty enhance the role of the previously establish independent monitoring committee and will ensure that obligation to the treaty be adhere to in practice the detail of the monitoring committee be set out in article of the treaty and it in turn will report to a joint committee make up of both united kingdom and rwandan official 
 there will be daily monitoring of the partnership for at least the month the enhanced period of time to ensure rapid identification and response to any shortcoming the enhanced phase will ensure that there be comprehensive monitoring and reporting and that that take place in real time the amendment risk disturb the independence and impartiality of the monitoring committee and therefore should be resist 
 i turn to lords amendment and and the issue of rwanda ’s safety we have already touch on this but it be clear that the bill ’s purpose be to respond to the supreme court ’s concern and enable parliament to confirm the status of rwanda as a safe country to enable removal of those who arrive in the united kingdom illegally to the point make by my hon friend   the member for torbay kevin foster it be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence pack that together demonstrate that rwanda be safe for relocate individual and that the government ’s approach be tough but fair and lawful the government be clear that we assess rwanda to be safe and we have publish evidence to substantiate that point 
 with reference to the point make by the hon member for torbay about the basis of the supreme court ’s decision i be sure that like i the minister will have read the decision carefully do he agree that paragraph to make it clear that there be reason for the supreme court ’s decision it be base on evidence about the general human right situation in rwanda secondly about the adequacy of rwanda ’s current asylum system and thirdly about rwanda ’s failure to meet its obligation in a similar agreement regard asylum seeker with israel in will he tell i what have   happen since the supreme court ’s decision to improve the general human right situation in rwanda he will be aware that the home office publish a page document date january this year detail concern about human right in rwanda 
 in fact that document support the government ’s position because the evidence put forward be balance the accusation from opposition party that somehow partisan evidence have be put before the chamber be completely wrong and be refute by the hon and learn lady ’s own point she as chair of the joint committee on human rights have just be to rwanda to see for herself we have an exchange on that last week and i look forward to her committee ’s report the answer be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence pack in the bill be the conclusive presumption that rwanda be generally a safe country 
 my question be this in january this year the british government through the home office publish a page document about the human right situation in rwanda detail serious concern from such august body as the us state department about the protection of human right on the ground in rwanda so what have change since the home office publish that note in january the minister have not answer that question if he can not answer it then this house can not say that rwanda be a safe country 
 the answer be that the hon and learn lady must not cherry pick her evidence the evidence must be look at in the round as i say it be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence together the hon and learn lady may not have confidence in our international partner to abide by their treaty but this government do the government of rwanda will abide by their treaty 
 will the minister give way 
 i will not give way there be a conclusive presumption in the bill that rwanda be generally a safe country there be a series of fact reinforce by statute the court have not conclude that there be a general risk to the safety of relocate individual in rwanda rather as we have repeatedly set out the treaty respond to the supreme court ’s finding the assurance we have have since negotiate in our legally bind treaty with rwanda directly address the finding they make detailed provision for the treatment of relocate individual in rwanda ensure that they will be offer safety and protection with no risk of refoulement respectfully that respond directly to the point that be raise 
 be the minister aware of the united nations high commissioner for refugees comment it say 
 unhcr will build on the favourable protection environment through continue advocacy and technical support to 
 the government of rwanda it go on to say that it be move from a humanitarian approach to a developmental approach so that people will be able to have the chance of a livelihood and a safe environment to build their life for the future be this not exactly what rwanda want to put across to people who find themselves there 
 my hon friend prove the point i just make that it be the evidence in the round that must be consider i be grateful to he for draw that to parliament ’s attention 
 will the minister give way 
 i have give way twice to the hon and learn lady so i will make progress we have be clear that the purpose of this legislation be to stop the boat and to do that we must create a deterrent that go to the point of my hon friend   the member for gloucester richard graham 
 will the minister give way 
 i have already give way to the hon gentleman so i will make progress 
 that show that if you enter the united kingdom illegally you will not be able to stay we can not allow systematic legal challenge to continue to frustrate and delay removal those opposition members who support this amendment do not mind if there be continue legal challenge that frustrate and delay removal but we on this side be not support the amendment it be right that the scope for individualised claim remain limited 
 on that point about the deterrent will the minister give way 
 no i be go to move on to amendment 
 amendment seek to enable united kingdom court and tribunal to grant interim remedy as i have previously state of the core principle of the bill be to limit the challenge that can be bring against the general safety of rwanda this amendment completely undermine the purpose of the bill and be not necessary 
 i thank the minister for give way the rwanda plan will not work as the deterrent that minister claim it will not least because it will only account for less than of all those seek to cross the channel irregularly where be the plan for the other will the minister concede that instead of fix their broken asylum system the conservatives have spend an eye watering £ on this include over £ on asylum hotel and accommodation that be what be at the crux of the matter and that be what they need to resolve 
 on deterrence which i think be the thrust of the question the albania scheme bring into effect by the prime minister back in december prove the deterrent effect crossing on small boat by those from albania be down as a result of that agreement that show the deterrent effect 
 lords amendment completely undermine the purpose of the bill it be unnecessary because the bill already contain appropriate safeguard to allow decision maker and the court to consider claim of an individual person in particular circumstance if there be compelling evidence 
 the house will know that i be the chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief the people who go through the system and go to rwanda need to have their religious belief protect whether they be christians or belong   to other religion or no religion my concern be that when they get to rwanda that protection may not be as strong as that which they have here can the minister give some assurance that people ’s religious belief will have the same protection 
 i know how seriously the hon gentleman take this important issue there be a policy of non discrimination in the rwandan constitution which will provide some reassurance the monitoring committee be also there on a daily basis i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that point we have make it clear that we can not continue to allow relocation to rwanda to be frustrate and delay as a result of systemic challenge on general safety 
 on amendment we need a strong deterrent to stop people put their life at risk by cross the channel while create that deterrent it be important that the government take decisive action also to deter adult from claim to be child 
 my right hon and learn friend be right that it be essential that protection be in place to ensure that adult do not masquerade as child to safeguard all those concern however he will be aware as be raise in the lords that the age assessment criterion be to be introduce in 2022—[interruption my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   and my hon friend   the member for torbay kevin foster   agree the criterion still have not come into effect at the border in dover and manston will the minister assist the house by explain how there can be confidence about age assessment and how it can be game if the amendment be agree 
 i note some vigorous nodding from my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   and my hon friend   the member for torbay kevin foster my hon friend be right that we need to introduce scientific age assessment our european and international friend and ally do so and we must get that scheme up and run there be nothing in amendment that directly affect that or the policy so i encourage she to be reassure on that point i will take away her encouragement to expedite that and i be grateful for her intervention because she be right 
 my hon friend anticipate my point that assess age be inherently difficult and there be obvious safeguard risk if adult purport to be child be place in the care system it be important that we take clear step to deter adult from claim to be child and to avoid lengthy legal challenge to age assessment decision to prevent the removal of those who have be assess to be adult however the amendment would result in treat differently those who be to be remove to rwanda from those remove to another country we consider the provision in place entirely necessary to safeguard genuine child and to guard against adult who seek to game the system by purport to be child 
 on lords amendment the house will be aware that the home office regularly publish statistic on migration level in the united kingdom it be not necessary to report the number of removal to parliament in the manner propose we do not consider an obligation to report to parliament on operational matter to be appropriate 
 revert to the previous amendment on the fact that parliament should be give can the minister confirm the report in the paper that the home office be now seek to pay people to go to rwanda in order to fill the flight can he also confirm that if people take up that home office proposal they will be subject to exactly the same very substantial payment to the rwandan government will they also be cover by the capacity question in the treaty 
 respectfully that be not directly relevant to amendment the answer to the question on voluntary removal be yes this will happen in exactly the same way there have be voluntary removal include last year all the way back to the dawn of time or possibly before there be nothing new the novel part be that there will be voluntary removal to rwanda that be absolutely right specifically in relation to amendment it be not necessary to report the number of removal to parliament and we do not consider obligation to report to parliament to be appropriate 
 will the minister give way 
 i be go to continue 
 amendment would act to impede provision already recently pass in the nationality and borders act and the illegal migration act the amendment be unnecessary it be important to be clear that the government of rwanda have system in place to safeguard relocate individual with a range of vulnerability include those concern mental health and gender base violence furthermore under article of the treaty rwanda must have regard to information provide about relocate individual relate to any specific need that might arise as a result of their be a victim of modern slavery or human trafficking and must take all necessary step to ensure that those need be accommodate 
 in relation to amendment the government greatly value the contribution of those who have support we and our armed force overseas that be why there be legal route for they to come to the united kingdom it remain the government ’s priority to deter people from make dangerous and unnecessary journey to the united kingdom anyone who arrive here illegally should not be able to make the united kingdom their home and eventually settle here a person who choose to come here illegally particularly if they have a safe and legal route available to they should be liable for removal to a safe country 
 the minister seem to try to brush over some of the cost involve be he aware that virgin galactic can send people into space for less than this government want to spend send person to rwanda be it not time to rethink this absurd policy and its extortionate cost 
 we have a debate on thursday on the cost of the scheme and not a single labour back bencher be there there be only   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who propose the debate and the shadow minister of course i do not treat the right hon lady as an ordinary back bencher because she be the chair of the home affairs select committee it be her debate and not a   single other labour back bencher be there that show the lack of priority that labour members give to this matter
