that be just the intervention that i need 
 there have also be the case of jodey whiting david wood and many many other our report recognise the significance of every death and harm experience by claimant and the impact of these case on their love one 
 we know that death and serious harm of claimant be investigate by the department in alone as part of its internal process review but in common with the national audit office ’s report we believe that the actual number be much high we hear evidence that the process of access dwp support and some dwp policy themselves can create or exacerbate exist vulnerability for example sanction or the threat of sanction can lead to material deprivation stress and the deterioration of physical and mental health in some case the experience of engage with the system and the process have be so difficult and distressing that it have contribute to claimant decide to take their own life 
 some of the most serious case of harm where a coroner ’s inquest have find that dwp contribute to a claimant ’s death have result in prevention of future death report since dwp have be issue with prevention of future death report relate specifically to the death of benefit claimant the fact that the equality and human rights commission issue a section notice on the dwp for potential discrimination against disabled people in and the investigation that be subsequently launch last year after the failure to reach an agreement add to the evidence that the work and pensions committee collect on the dwp ’s inadequate approach to safeguard the inquiry set out to examine the support that the department provide to vulnerable claimant how it have learn from mistake and failure and what need to change 
 the new committee agree to reopen the inquiry on   october before i turn to the finding and recommendation of the report i should acknowledge that in the pathway to work green paper publish in march the government say they be consult 
 on a new dwp safeguarding approach to make it clear what the department and its staff be expect to do in order to safeguard the public 
 i welcome that and i be hearten by the secretary of state ’s evidence to the committee last november 
 our principal recommendation be for a statutory safeguarding duty to be place on the dwp to protect claimant although the secretary of state would be accountable for this duty reflect the leadership need to drive these change it would make safeguarding in the dwp everyone ’s business at all level of the organisation and at all stage of policy development and implementation the duty would include the proactive consideration of the safeguarding need of claimant the ability to refer vulnerable individual to other agency with a duty of care and again the proactive consideration of the impact of key policy and legislation on the health and wellbeing of claimant before they be implement 
 the need for a new legal obligation be clear the current approach to safeguarding in dwp have be describe as piecemeal and lack coherence and the committee agree for that reason the report call for a comprehensive system base approach to safeguard that integrate into every stage of policy development implementation and review the approach must involve everyone in the dwp to ensure that safeguarding become a fundamental part of the department ’s culture 
 we see a new statutory duty as the cornerstone of a big cultural shift that be need in the dwp for too long the focus have be on cost cutting often at the expense of provide genuine support that approach have lead to a system in which claimant feel undeserving of support and fearful of the very department that be mean to assist they the necessary cultural shift must be drive from the top down with ministers and senior official lead the way a statutory safeguarding duty would help to focus mind improve accountability and ensure that safeguarding become everybody ’s business in the dwp 
 the need for deep root cultural change in the department can not be overstate the process of engage with the dwp often lead to mental distress for claimant this distress be compound by a lack of trust in the system drive by continual cost cut measure and an unhelpful media narrative to rebuild trust the dwp must prioritise safeguarding and support over cost cutting and this mean create a system that not only help people to find sustainable work but compassionately support those who may never work 
 the report also emphasise the importance of learn from past mistake the department have conduct a number of ipr but the full scale of harm be much high the ongoing investigation by the equality and human rights commission into the department ’s treatment of disabled people and those with long term mental health condition underscore the need for transparency and accountability 
 in addition to the statutory duty the report make a number of other important recommendation which i will go through quickly as i have mention it be recommend that all significant new policy be analyse by the department ’s chief medical adviser ’s team currently such assessment be not routinely carry out lead to policy that may inadvertently harm claimant or exacerbate exist vulnerability by make these   assessment a standard part of policy development we hope to ensure that the impact of policy on the health and wellbeing of claimant be consider and harm mitigate 
 the report stress the importance of have a robust clear and accessible complaint procedure to prevent failure recur as i have state the true scale of death and harm be not know the report call for systematic recording and publication of all case of serious harm and death involve claimant the department should commit to publish this information annually to aid transparency the report also recommend improve transparency in the process use to learn from serious mistake and failure and the introduction of an independent body the department should not mark its own homework to investigate serious harm 
 on define and identify vulnerability the department ’s current approach be see as flexible lack in clarity and consistency the report call for a formalise definition of vulnerability that be clearly communicate in public face document it also recommend add victim of abuse to the additional support area in universal credit and implement proactive measure to identify and support vulnerable claimant 
 ensure that vulnerable people can access the benefit they be entitle to be crucial for deliver equitable welfare provision the removal of the help to claim face to face service have make it more difficult for some individual to apply for universal credit the report recommend that the dwp ensure that jobcentre provide thorough support and that detailed information about additional support be proactively offer to claimant in that regard i do give praise because there be so many good people in the department such as the advanced customer support senior leader who be integral to help frontline dwp staff i praise those staff and we need more of they 
 effective communication and make sure that people be aware of what support they can access be also important and we need more of it that also apply to training and capacity building for frontline staff which need to happen to achieve the cultural change we need finally collaboration with other agency need to be a statutory responsibility and there need to be dwp membership of the safeguarding adult board i be very grateful to you madam deputy speaker 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to help ensure the transport system support economic growth 
 what step she be take to help ensure the transport system support economic growth 
 economic growth be this government ’s top priority and a reliable well connect transport network be critical to drive prosperity that mean deliver local priority in place such as huddersfield and hyndburn include through west yorkshire ’s £ city region sustainable transport settlement and the local transport grant for lancashire combine county authority 
 the government have rightly prioritise rail as a key factor in the future viability of our transport infrastructure there exist in hyndburn an outstanding opportunity to create a freight rail terminal that would fit with the department for transport ’s target for increase rail freight capacity by the proposal also add value in increase east west rail freight capacity which must currently pass through manchester sadly no progress be make on this under the last government do the secretary of state agree that a north west freight strategy should be a priority and will she meet i to explore the potential of this as a priority project in the north west 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of rail freight and i be clear that with a reform railway we must do more to shift freight from the road to rail i be keen that network rail work collaboratively with industry to develop terminal where there be either current demand or the potential for future growth if there be viable interest in develop this land my official and network rail would be happy to engage with interested party 
 i welcome the funding commitment for transport in huddersfield include rail upgrade to the penistone line and the trans pennine route which be very much need however during a coffee morning with resident last week the main issue discuss be the reliability of bus service and the need for integrated transport can the minister outline how she be support our west yorkshire mayor in ensure that transport lead economic growth include bus service and be feel across all neighbourhood and community in huddersfield 
 i be not surprised to hear that bus be top of the agenda for my hon friend ’s constituent reliable affordable bus service will be essential for so many of those she represent and i be particularly delighted to see the successful launch this week of mayor tracy brabin ’s weaver bus network the government be invest £ in west yorkshire ’s bus that be in addition to the £ we be spend in the region to improve local transport infrastructure and the rail investment we be make as part of the trans pennine route upgrade 
 the secretary of state know that high speed ’s central purpose be to deliver economic growth but she know too that it be take far long and cost far more to deliver than anyone expect give that project of the scale of hs2 require parliamentary approval be it not important that parliament have accurate estimate of how much the project will cost and how long it will take to deliver will she commission a properly independent and thorough review of why the budget for hs2 have increase so often and the timetable have expand so often 
 i will be provide update to the house on the emerge cost position and opening window as the right hon and learn gentleman will know this government have appoint a new chief executive of hs2 mark wild who be conduct an ongoing review we have also reintroduce ministerial oversight which be sorely lack under the conservative party ’s leadership i recognise that this be an important issue and we be do all we can to deliver the rest of this railway at the low reasonable cost to the taxpayer so that people can enjoy excellent rail service in the future 
 the transport secretary recently refuse to commit to keep the £ cap on bus fare outside london beyond the end of this year leave many in rural area worry about how much more they will end up have to pay to get to work resident across my constituency have already see vital route scrap or scale back hold back economic growth can the transport secretary explain what support will be make available to not only keep rural fare down but restore lost service 
 the hon lady will know that this government step in to prevent soar bus fare increase give the last government ’s decision to only fund a bus fare cap until the end of last year interruption opposition member can chunter but the truth of the matter be that it be fantasy money and the money be not allocate to fund that bus fare cap we be in an ongoing process through the spending review i appreciate   the importance of affordable reliable bus service and we will do all we can to ensure that people can continue to enjoy the bus network that they need 
 i call the shadow minister 
 greater anglia support economic growth in the east of england with modern quiet fast train pay for by £ of private sector investment its service be the most punctual in the country it be popular with its passenger and it be run so efficiently that instead of cost the taxpayer it pay money into the treasury it be currently train operator of the year greater anglia know that nationalisation be come and it have offer to extend its operation to allow the government to focus on the bad perform operator why do the government refuse be the secretary of state focus on improve the life of passenger or be it an ideological determination to put the union back in charge of the railway 
 i really do not know how many time i have to say this to the hon gentleman i meet he a couple of day ago and i explain that our process for bring train operating company into public ownership be design to offer good value for money to the taxpayer we will not be buy out fail private sector operator by break contract early he be right to say that greater anglia provide an excellent service and i be confident we will build on that when it come into public ownership in october 
 perhaps the secretary of state do not understand the nature of the offer from greater anglia it be not expect to be buy out it be offer to continue its current arrangement for a couple of year 
 in a previous answer the secretary of state say to i that the benefit of rail nationalisation will be the £ of efficiency saving let ’s see how that be go her nationalisation will be south western railway in week time that new service will need train yet the telegraph have reveal that inept contract negotiation by her department where there be no effective competition mean that the cost of re lease the same train be increase by £ over year be those the efficiency saving she have in mind 
 the up to £ of saving that the taxpayer can enjoy as a result of train operating company come back into public ownership be the save management fee that we be currently pay to private sector operator and efficiency will be deliver on top of that 
 on the substantive issue that the hon gentleman raise about south western railway the cost of renew roll stock lease have be fully and properly budget for with successful commercial negotiation recently conclude the franchising process under his government see some buy now pay later deal do on rolling stock where cost be always expect to increase i think that approach be deeply dubious but that be the short termist ill think through approach of his government and we be now have to clear up that mess 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that worker have necessary skill for the rail sector 
 a skilled workforce be key to deliver the railway that passenger need and i be work closely with colleague across government to ensure that we train up the right people in the right way for the job of the future as my hon friend will know from our visit to derby last week we be also take action to ensure that we attract young talent into the industry by lower the age at which someone can become a train driver to 
 derby be the centre of the large rail cluster in europe an east midland cluster employ people there be an incredible range of role in the sector from engineer to drive digital to welding advanced manufacturing to customer service and many more however with a of worker in the rail sector age or over it face a significant shortage of rail skill in the future what role can great british railways with its headquarters in derby play in ensure that we have the skill we need for the future 
 develop an industry workforce plan will be a key priority for great british railways and i be confident that we will be make the most of the expertise that already exist in place such as derby the fact that derby will soon become the new national headquarters of gbr will mean more high skilled job for a city that be already brim with rail industry talent i look forward to work with my hon friend and local leader on maximise the opportunity that the creation of gbr present 
 what step she be take to support the maritime sector 
 what step she be take to support sustainability in the maritime sector

 the port of dover have ambitious target to be the green shipping corridor what be the government ’s plan to ensure sufficient power supply to the port for ship to plug into 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that infrastructure which be so important to our nation i be pleased to meet doug bannister the chief executive officer of the port of dover just the other day to talk about these matter this government be implement a new strategic planning process and reform connection to ensure that electricity meet future demand if we do that right we can have the green shipping corridor in the world 
 fleetwood in my constituency have a proud fishing industry but our port be currently massively underused the government ’s clean power mission be a huge opportunity for port like fleetwood to take advantage of job and investment bring by offshore wind project will the minister meet i to ensure that the port of fleetwood get the investment it need to take advantage of those project so that my community can start to rebuild after the last year of austerity inflict on it by the previous conservative government

 isle of wight ferry company red funnel be control by canadian pension fund it be unregulated and charge isle of wight resident up to £ to take a return car ferry crossing do the minister support that ownership model and pricing structure for a lifeline transport connection in the uk 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that the avanti up to manchester can cost more but that do not help his constituent in the isle of wight who have   be struggle for some time that be why i go to the isle of wight to meet the hon member and representative from the council we be establish an local transport forum and we have agree a number of way forward look at ticketing pricing and the reliability of those ferry to the island i promise to continue to be engage but i will need the hon member ’s help with this as well 
 in common with   the hon member for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers i have concern about the fishing sector in term of maritime need and co ordination with the drive towards net and with the push towards marine base renewable energy what discussion have take place with the secretary of state for energy security and net to ensure that the need of the fishing industry be consider weight and fully evaluate 
 this be a huge opportunity for the uk our mission to have clean energy by be an incredible target and we be get on with it that mean make big decision with the crown estate our fishery the department for environment food and rural affairs the department for transport and department for energy security and net we be work together at pace and we be begin to see some of the fruit of that such as the investment in the port of tyne that i just mention but the work be ongoing 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the performance of rail service operate from north wales 
 despite recent improvement the performance of avanti west coast ’s service in north wales be still not good enough poor network rail infrastructure reliability also remain an issue north wales and its surround region have such huge potential so i be actively engage with the welsh government on plan to create a transport system that meet the need of all our community and deliver economic growth 
 rail play a vital role in the north wales economy so i welcome the recent announcement of additional service per week between holyhead and london however that remain a shadow of the pre covid timetable which see up to daily direct service the north wales line regularly see more cancellation and poor reliability than other part of the west coast franchise it be vital that with economic growth tourism and access to employment across north wales and beyond we see a return to a more frequent and reliable service pattern what measure be the secretary of state take to ensure that that happen 
 the uplift in service level between london and holyhead from this sunday be indeed welcome and i agree that a reliable service be deliver for the passenger of north wales be vital for economic growth i recognise that wales have not see its fair share of funding historically and i be committed to continue rail infrastructure investment in wales to release capacity and improve reliability 
 the midland rail hub be back by the previous government it will unlock and drive economic growth across the west midland and beyond include into wales and improve the performance of exist rail service when will the secretary of state make an announcement in her review of that project or be this just another example of the treasury reversing or hold up investment in our region 
 i can see that mr speaker be smile i congratulate the right hon lady on her ingenuity in work in a question about the midland she be right to talk about the benefit of the midland rail hub she will be aware that a spending review process be under way and i anticipate be able to say more on that project in due course 
 whether she plan to increase rail capacity on the brighton main line 
 official in my department be in regular discussion with network rail and train operator on opportunity to improve service across the brighton main line take account of change to commuter travel since the pandemic decision about the department ’s capital portfolio will be announce after completion of the spending review ensure that every penny spend support our mission and our plan for growth 
 network rail have identify that if the croydon area remodelling scheme be not undertake capacity through east croydon will be exhaust by prevent passenger from across much of southern england from be able to travel to london give that the department for transport have outline that it be minded to approve gatwick airport ’s capacity increase almost double the overall number so long as of passenger travel by public transport that be in addition to the figure will the minister outline how it be possible to achieve that without the work be undertake 
 i appreciate the work that my hon friend be do to stand up for his constituent who rely so much on rail service as he acknowledge plan for a major upgrade to the brighton main line be cancel by the previous government in the spending review and they do not even acknowledge that that have happen network rail be fund to progress automatic route set signal technology to far enhance performance across the brighton main line further decision will be make after the spending review 
 what step she be take to support the aviation sector 
 we be unlock growth by progress airport planning decision and invite runway   proposal for heathrow by the summer a new uk airspace design service and support fund will drive airspace modernisation we introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and yesterday we propose a revenue certainty mechanism to support uk production 
 saxonair norwich airport and norfolk and suffolk county council recently launch aviation east a call to make east anglia the heart of aviation innovation we be already lead in the development of electric aircraft and the early availability of sustainable aviation fuel but we could do so much more to unlock growth and deliver job will the minister outline how this government will support aviation in the east i be due to meet he soon but will he also come to norwich take a flight in an electric plane and see what innovation be under way 
 this government want to see the uk maximise the benefit of the future of flight technology include fly taxi both for the economy and for community we recently announce over £ of government funding for the civil aviation authority and the future flight challenge to deliver the future flight programme this year that joint programme between industry government and the caa will enhance drone capability by with fly taxi in the uk ’s sky by i would be delighted to visit norwich and the airport in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 as the minister be well aware the government have support and sign off on the development consent order for manston airport in my constituency it be hop and expect that the final private funding for that package will be in place and that work will start in the very near future will the minister now reaffirm his support for the contribution that manston can and will make to freight and growth in the united kingdom and can he also seek to expedite the necessary licence at the appropriate time 
 i be delighted to spend my easter holiday in the right hon member ’s constituency cycle the cantii way i stop and take a look at manston airport and a sip of water from my bottle because it be a hot day i be look forward to the outcome of the talk and the funding and at that point i will be happy to look at the proposal from manston and sit down with the right hon member to unlock that capacity 
 my hon friend will be as aware as i be that the air passenger duty which be introduce by a conservative chancellor more than year ago have be study intensively every study show that the revenue generate by that tax be much less than the benefit of abolish it will my hon friend and the secretary of state try to talk some sense into the chancellor of the exchequer and her official to get rid of this tax and benefit both aviation and the economy 
 i would never disagree with the former leader of my council but on this occasion i might have to i pay tribute to my hon friend as somebody who be chairman of the airport that deliver the only international runway in this country in year air   passenger duty be part of the rich mix of the aviation tapestry however last month in april heathrow have passenger through its door the large number ever most airport and airline be see demand go through the roof we be modernise the airspace decarbonise the fuel and unlock the constraint on our airport which be why we be see record passenger number 
 i recognise the vital importance of the aviation sector but any airport expansion include at bristol airport should reflect the cumulative impact of emission and our legal commitment to net do the minister support the climate change committee ’s advice publish last year that no airport expansion should proceed without a uk wide capacity management framework 
 i congratulate bristol on the excellent job it be do and the growth it be see we have strict criterion on carbon emission noise growth and pollution at our airport that be our guide principle as a government but we also want to see local ambition in term of growth those carbon budget be fix we still want to reach net by even with the growth in our air market that be expect over the next few year 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as we approach the summer holiday we know that many family be look forward to the opportunity to get away however in what may come as concern news labour ’s employment rights bill could threaten passenger ability to travel without disruption or additional cost this be because in exist passenger right legislation under article 5(1)(c)(i of regulation passenger be entitle to compensation if they be inform of cancellation less than week before their flight the employment rights bill reduce the require notice period for strike action in any industry from day to day increase the risk of last minute cancellation that could in theory cost airline ten of million of pound which could in turn lead to high cost for passenger as airline pass the expense on to the travel public do the minister agree that the government should maintain the day notice period in aviation put the interest of passenger ahead of those of their union friend 
 the shadow secretary of state will forgive i if i have not read that sub paragraph that trip off the tongue this government will always put passenger that be why more passenger than ever be fly in our sky and leave our airport the department be fully engage with the aviation sector at all stage include on this issue 
 what step she be take to reduce the backlog for drive test 
 last month the secretary of state announce further measure to tackle the unacceptable   drive test backlog include double training capacity for drive test examiner and offer overtime pay incentive to provide extra test that will create up to extra test a month we be determined to get britain ’s driver move 
 i thank the minister for her effort towards improve access to drive test however in my constituency of broxtowe i continually get email say that people be struggle to book test due to a shortage of examiner will she provide we with an update follow the instruction make last year to the driver and vehicle standards agency to double the number of examiner be train 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue we be hold the dvsa to account for successfully implement the measure in last december ’s point plan some new driving examiner have already pass their training and be work in drive test centre and last year the dvsa provide test this month it will launch an accelerated consultation on improvement to the test booking system to end the reselling of test and the exploitation of learner which be completely unacceptable 
 do the minister acknowledge that part of what have happen as a result of the pressure test have be a displacement of learner driver to test centre in rural area where they perceive that there might be less waiting time that be prejudice against local applicant will she do everything she can to ensure that local applicant for test get priority 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important point we know that people be book test in part of the country where they have no intention of take a test because they can swap that for a test in another drive test centre that be of the issue address in the call for evidence that be launch in december we have hear that evidence and we will consult on further change to the booking system that might address the issue that he raise 
 i call the shadow minister 
 at the transport committee in april the secretary of state admit that under labour ’s watch 
 wait time for access to drive test hit new high 
 for all the talk of a new plan she then admit that the government only aim to reduce driving test wait time to week by summer next year that be no good for young people wait need the freedom to drive to get to college or work now be it when will the government see the real urgency for real people and pick up the pace 
 we be act to fix the mess that the shadow minister ’s government leave behind our point plan be be implement and last month the secretary of state announce additional measure we be determined to succeed where the last government fail 
 i do not think the minister have get the memo that she be in charge now the government can not hide behind the same old excuse and try to blame other as average test volume be now low on a month by month basis than they be in the previous year in quarter alone nearly few test be conduct than in the same period in the average waiting time for a drive test in the uk sit at week over month that be up from week in july and week in february for all the government ’s promise there have be no actual delivery why have capacity not increase or at the very least stay the same as when we be in charge 
 the hon gentleman be not listen we be implement the point plan but turn around the mess and the problem that the conservatives leave we take time i be determined that we will see the result that waiting time will come down and that we will support learner driver it can not be do overnight when we be try to fix year of mess

 i thank the hon member for his question and he be right to raise the impact that pavement parking have on the ability of child to walk safely to school which we want to encourage there be many thing we can do and he be right to say that part of the mix be communication and publicity to explain the danger that pavement parking pose to pedestrian 
 what step she be take to help improve compliance with vehicle registration regulation by driver 
 my hon friend have rightly identify the importance of hold the correct information to identify the keeper of every vehicle operate on our road the driver and vehicle licensing agency work closely with the police who have the power to seize non- compliant vehicle 
 i recently speak to a road police officer about driver who use illegal number plate such as ghost number plate that can not be read by police and speed camera he tell i 
 the scale at which this problem now exist be frightening these plate be on every street in every town and they be be use to openly commit offence and evade capture in the knowledge   there ’ very little we can do about it the problem be only get bad pose huge danger on our road we need to toughen up the law urgently 
 will the minister set out the action she be take to increase the penalty for use these ghost plate to at least £ and penalty point and put an end to this number plate wild west that be endanger our street 
 my hon friend be a great campaigner and she be right to continue to highlight this issue it be already illegal to sell and display that type of number plate but i recognise that there be more to do the dvla be work with the national police chiefs council the home office various police force and trading standard on the supply and use of these illegal number plate and implement strict penalty and fine will be consider as part of our work on the new road safety strategy

 i thank my hon friend for his question this year we be provide local authority in england with £ of funding for road maintenance include more than £ for the east midlands combine authority of which over £ be for derbyshire those council can now get on with the job we have also introduce new reporting requirement mean that from next month people will be able to see exactly what their council be do with that money we will end britain ’s pothole plague 
 on street parking have an effect on our local road in king langley my local high street be suffer significantly from the liberal democrat lead council impose parking restriction in a way that have cause confusion not just to business but to local resident can the minister give any guidance to dacorum council on how to communicate well with resident to ensure that on street parking be properly adhere to but not to the detriment of our high street 
 i understand how important it be for people to access their high street that issue obviously relate to parking but it be also about the availability of active travel and public transport i be not go to dictate how local authority should implement parking restriction in their area that be for they to decide we provide they with the power and the resource and it be for local people to decide what be right for their area

 as i say a decision be ultimately a matter for the regulator open access can provide benefit such as improved connectivity and choice for passenger but it can also increase cost to taxpayer and create additional performance pressure on an already constrain network the department will always look at application on a case by case basis and feed into the regulator ’s decision

 consider a strike over harmonise pay and condition to be a necessary strike”,—[official report   march vol c. 
 she avoid answer the question which be uncharacteristic of she i will give she another chance now would that be a necessary strike 
 the answer i give to the shadow secretary of state ’s previous question be that if as an operator of the railway we feel it be necessary to take a strike on ground of safety we would of course put the safety of the travel public that will always be the case on the harmonisation of term and condition we need to bring legislation forward to establish great british railways we will have many discussion with our trade union colleague in a constructive way while ensure that we provide value for money for the taxpayer

 at yesterday ’s transport committee hearing the minister for local transport outline the measure that the government be take to reverse the year decline in bus service the measure will protect many at risk bus route and may deliver a few more but as they deliver growth and reduce congestion do the government have a wide ambition to ensure that all rural and non city area in england have at least a basic level of bus service so that everyone can get to school work and the shop and use public service without need to drive a car 
 i have to say i really enjoy my appearance at the select committee yesterday ultimately we want people to choose to take the bus because it provide well connection in every part of the country to get people where they need be it be a more reliable more affordable fast and more integrated form of transport and i hope to see that in debate with member across the house as the bus bill proceed 
 farnborough airport ’s noise and emission pollution affect a significant part of my constituency the airport have announce that it will be launch its consultation to expand in august this have obviously bring a lot of concern from resident group and campaigner who be worried that people will be away at this time what can the minister do to ensure that there be maximum engagement with the public and therefore a proper consultation 
 i thank the hon member for his question but he will know that this matter be for the determination of rushmoor borough council the local planning authority he will appreciate that this be a live application so it would not be appropriate for i to comment at this time 
 business on the newhouse and bulwark industrial estate in chepstow be desperate to keep use the m48 severn bridge which will be close to lorry for at least month by the end of may they will have to add at least mile to their journey over the border seriously affect profitability and growth will the minister meet i and monmouthshire county council to find a solution such as control flow so that we do not hold back economic growth in monmouthshire

 in chorley ’s case work start but it have still not be finish it be abandon halfway through 
 resident across my constituency regularly raise with i the issue of pothole and the state of our road in general i greatly appreciate the additional funding provide by the government to south gloucestershire council to help with improvement this be about safety it also about pride of place and the cost of vehicle repair all these thing matter so what will the next step be to support council to keep road up to scratch once the pothole be fill 
 we be provide record amount for local authority this year and we hope to provide a long term funding settlement for local road maintenance after the spending review 
 will the secretary of state accept my warm invitation to visit my constituency and sit in traffic with i so she can experience what my    constituent experience morning noon and night on the a27 which be strangle economic growth in the area and prevent investment 
 as tempting as the hon lady ’s invitation be i regret that i will not be able to do that and i will not commit the road minister to it either but we will look at the matter she raise and write to she with an update on the action we think could be take to improve the situation 
 economic growth require people to be able to get to work this morning yet another road traffic accident happen on the stretch of m6 motorway that go through my constituency and your mr speaker this have a hugely disruptive impact on the mainly small road around it in my constituency yet again my resident in longridge grimsargh and all the surround area wake up to the prospect of another journey to work that take hour instead of minute and that be become a monthly if not weekly occurrence will the minister meet i to discuss what can be do

 congestion on the a38 in bromsgrove be make it nearly impossible for resident to get around easily yet despite current investment there be widespread scepticism that the bromsgrove route enhancement plan know locally as brep will improve the situation do the minister agree that investment in transport must deliver a tangible improvement in traffic flow and will the secretary of state meet i to discuss investment in bromsgrove so that we can keep bromsgrove move 
 i understand the hon member ’s wish to get his constituent move it be that we share i would be happy to look at his concern in relation to the a38 and i will contact he with further information 
 in the previous government cut a significant number of southeastern service that my constituent in bexleyheath and crayford rely on my constituent continue to raise concern that direct service from london charing cross to barnehurst and bexleyheath should be reinstate during the evening and weekend could the minister provide an update on progress to reinstate those service 
 southeastern plan service to meet passenger demand while ensure value for money for the taxpayer timetable be keep under review and can be adjust to reflect fluctuation in demand i be pleased to say that additional weekday evening service will be introduce on the route in december 
 once again i have have to grant an urgent question on a matter that be brief extensively to the medium in recent day i recognise that a write ministerial statement be issue but i be surprised that the government do not think that member would want an opportunity to question ministers on a very important issue 
 on monday the home secretary be unapologetic about the fact that detail of the immigration white paper be give to the medium start on sunday morning before it be lay before this house and long before she come to make a statement i note that those who now occupy senior ministerial role be not slow to complain when the previous government make major policy announcement outside this place i will continue to uphold and defend the right of this house the right of back benchers to be the to hear the most important announcement of government policy and the right of hon member to question ministers on those announcement in person that be my position under the previous government and it have not change under this government 
 it be clear to i that the general principle set out in paragraph of the ministerial code be be disregard more often than it be observe i will write to the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to invite that committee to consider the issue in more detail if the government be not go to take the ministerial code seriously who will 
 i do not like do this i believe that i be here to represent all back benchers and back benchers have the right to question ministers i be not interested in sky news the bbc or political programme i be here to defend you all and i will continue to defend you i say to the government please do not take mp for grant it be not acceptable i know it be not the fault of the under secretary of state for justice   the hon member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin    who be about to respond to the urgent question but the message have to go back loud and clear when you be in the wrong apologise to member 
 mr speaker i hear your word very clearly i very much respect the role of parliament and i be pleased to be here today to follow up the write ministerial statement that be lay yesterday by the lord chancellor 
 order let i gently say to the minister you would not be here at all if i have not grant the urgent question that be the thing we should remember you be only here because i have decide that you should be here please do not try to take advantage of a situation that be not of your own making 
 i will certainly apologise mr speaker i be not try to take advantage clearly it also take the action of   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick lay an urgent question that be how parliament work and rightly so 
 order i do not want to labour the point but no this be not the way we should be act the statement should have be bring here on the day the plan be announce let we get this very very clear this be not about have to grant an urgent question this be about the government do the right thing rather than somebody else have to drag ministers here that be not how we should be work 
 thank you mr speaker i be sorry for any misinformation that i have give in try to respond 
 you be a good minister and a nice person 
 thank you mr speaker we respect each other and i respect very much that you be stand up for parliament which be exactly the right thing to do i applaud that 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make a statement on the public safety implication of the government ’s plan to set a day limit on prison sentence for recall offender 
 the lord chancellor lay a write ministerial statement yesterday the background to which be the change around fix term recall in the light of the prison capacity challenge that the government face when we be elect almost a year ago we inherit a prison system on the brink of collapse although we take immediate action to prevent the catastrophe prison continue to be perilously close to fill up entirely last december we publish a long term building strategy set out our aim to open up prison place by that be the large expansion of the prison estate since the victorians we have already commit £ to prison expansion and since take office we have deliver new place 
 we also commission the independent sentencing review which will report shortly the sentencing review will hopefully offer we a path to end the capacity crisis in our prison for good but the impact of sentencing reform will not be feel before next spring on our current trajectory we will hit capacity in our prison in november we can not allow that to happen that be why we have announce our intention to lay a fix term recall statutory instrument that will mean that those serve sentence of between and year can only be return to prison for a fix day period the measure build on previous legislation introduce by the last government that mandate day recall for those serve sentence of under a year 
 to be clear high risk offender have be exempt from that change if further information relate to an offender ’s risk be receive after they have be recall which mean they be no long consider suitable for fix term recall they may be detain for long on a standard recall if that be assess as necessary 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 sorry seem to be the hard word today i see that the justice secretary have still not come to parliament to defend her policy yesterday she deliberately avoid scrutiny in this house because she know that this decision be wildly unpopular and risk the safety of the public to govern be to choose there be foreign criminal in our jail and people in prison await trial combine those group make up roughly a of the prison population 
 the sensible step forward would obviously be to introduce emergency measure to expedite deportation and get the court sit around the clock if the justice secretary choose to do that we would support she but so far she have not she have refuse to take the judiciary up on its offer of extra court sitting day it be not uncommon for as many as half the court at the old bailey to sit empty on any give day instead she have decide to let out early criminal who reoffend or breach their licence there be now no punishment or   deterrent for criminal who immediately reoffend or cheat the system the justice secretary say these people will be in prison outside of prison”—i be sure that harden criminal will be quake in their boot at that farcical doublespeak 
 there be no way about it this decision have put the public in danger and victim in jeopardy the domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs have say that she 
 can not stress enough the lack of consideration for victim safety and how many life be be put in danger 
 be the justice secretary or her minister really tell domestic abuse victim that their abuser will be back on the street in just day if they breach their licence and that nobody will even check with the parole board can the minister explain to the house who be exempt from the scheme because right now confusion reign yesterday the justice secretary give the impression that no domestic abuser or sexual offender would be eligible for her scheme but her department have since say that it will include many but not all 
 the write ministerial statement lay yesterday deliberately conceal the answer to the question of which criminal will be exclude so will the minister take this opportunity to tell the house if he do not know the answer will he commit to publish it by the end of the day lastly can he confirm to the house that anyone in breach of a restraining order will be ineligible for a fix term recall because anything else would be an insult to the victim 
 since take office we have deport over foreign national offender in custody secure their early removal from our prisons—15 high than in the previous month we have just announce court sitting day which be the high level for a very long time 
 to answer the right hon gentleman ’s specific question we will exclude anyone serve more than year in prison all those convict of a terrorist or national security crime and those who be subject to high level of risk management by multiple agency where the police and the prison and probation service work together which include certain sexual and violent offender include many domestic abuser if there be ongoing concern about the risk pose by an offender who be due to be release after the day period frontline worker can apply additional licence condition to manage that if further information relate to an offender ’s risk be receive after they have be recall mean that they be no long consider suitable for fix term recall they may be detain for long on a standard recall if that be assess as necessary by the hmpps public protection team 
 we know how important it be that victim be keep inform all those eligible for the victim contact scheme will be notify about an offender ’s release and will have the opportunity to make representation about victim relate licence condition although there be certain exclusion for serious offender change recall for fix term offender be necessary it would be even bad to run out of space which at this stage would mean the manage breakdown of the criminal justice system the lord chancellor say rightly that that would be unconscionable no government should leave that challenge as a legacy to their successor as the right hon gentleman ’s government do 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 we should never forget that the crisis in our prison that the current lord chancellor be seek to resolve be create over year by the irresponsible mismanagement of the previous government although today ’s announcement make sense in the short term subject to safeguard we must consider the whole way in which recall have develop from case year ago to more than today over of the prison population with less than of recall be for further offence will the government consider the way in which recall operate without the freeing up of space in prison rehabilitation be impossible overcrowd reach ridiculous level and we run out of space altogether 
 my hon friend be right the recall population have double in just year and we need to address that the independent sentencing review will report shortly and i hope that there will be recommendation to which we can respond in that report 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 there be no doubt that the conservatives plunge our prison into crisis interruption they chunter from a sedentary position but what else would they call it it be clear that the government have fail to step up and tackle the sheer scale of the problem across the country victim and survivor be worried about what this will mean for they if there be a specific domestic abuse offence dangerous offender could be exclude from early release but the government have take no action at all since the liberal democrats raise that solution with they last autumn will the minister finally commit to give victim and survivor the protection that they deserve by create new domestic abuse aggravate offence and will he go far to protect our community by introduce a clear plan to reduce reoffending which be the only way to solve prison crowding once and for all if the minister will not listen to i will he listen to the domestic abuse commissioner who have just warn that life be now at risk 
 the hon member will know that his colleague   the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller be work closely with the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones on get thing right for victim that be something we take very seriously and it need to be do properly with victim in order to get it right i hope that the independent sentencing review report will contain thing that give we confidence about move forward and about the way we work with victim 
 the conservatives appear to have forget quite a number of thing and i think it might be a good time to remind they former justice secretary chris grayling ’s disastrous partial privatisation of the probation service be overturn in after the number of serious offence include rape and murder commit by those on probation skyrocket do the minister agree that we be see the long tail of conservative failure which overshadow everything that we must do now 
 my hon friend be right to remind the house of the chaos and turmoil that the conservatives apply to our very important probation service when they be in government we be put probation back together we have already bring new probation officer on board and we be commit to a further in the come year 
 mr speaker to pick up on your statement for which i think the whole house will be grateful i be sure that my committee will take up your clear urge for we to look at the issue with regard to the ministerial code 
 i know the minister will agree that domestic abuse can not be an issue to which lip service be pay in this house and then policy seem to neglect i make no apology for return to the view of the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales who issue a severe warning to the lord chancellor yesterday comment 
 i can not stress the lack of consideration for victim safety and how many life be be put in danger because of this propose change 
 why do the minister think the commissioner with all her expertise and knowledge have arrive at that conclusion 
 we have great respect for the victim commissioner what would be let down victim be if we allow the prison system to get to a place where we can not lock prisoner up that would be unconscionable that be why it be important that we have take these step i remind the hon member that we be exclude those prisoner who pose the most risk and be manage under mappa multi agency public protection arrangement level and that mean various agency work together the exclusion also include all those convict of terrorist and national security crime proper action can be take where agency identify risk to move from a fix term recall to a standard recall 
 will the minister tell i whether i be correct that when we enter office there be few than space leave in our prison a terrible failure from the conservative party do he agree that instead of empty word and false promise to build prison this government be get on with the job 
 my hon friend be quite right we face a real emergency when we come into office it be unconscionable that any government would do that to an incoming government the previous labour government add prison place in year in their year the conservative government manage to add in month we have already deliver prison place 
 have the ministry of justice conduct an impact assessment for this policy if so will it release that to the house as soon as possible if not can the lord chancellor confirm how she know what impact the policy will have on victim and the wide public 
 we be always alert to the need to assess how policy apply to the wide public and victim that be important 
 this situation be of the most egregious example of state failure and a consequence of the bad chaos and incompetence of the last year the lord chancellor have be clear that give current level of demand we can not build our way out of this crisis do the minister agree that we have to be honest and do something different to ensure that we never again run out of prison place include improve the exist prison estate and invest in the probation service so that we can reduce reoffende and thereby reduce the pressure on prison place 
 we be improve the prison estate and invest in probation and there will also be action come forward from the independent sentencing review i agree with everything my hon friend say 
 victim of domestic abuse sexual abuse and stalking be now in fear particularly those who live in rural area where tagging do not always work what particular measure will the minister put in place to support victim in rural area who be distant from probation officer and the police 
 anybody subject to a fix term recall will be recall for day and if their risk be assess as great they will be transfer to a standard recall the reality be that anybody affect by this have already serve their time in prison they be on licence be properly monitor and effectively manage by the probation service 
 the prison capacity crisis have be year in the making do the minister welcome the news that wayland prison in norfolk have be grant planning permission just this week by breckland council ’s planning committee for a increase in capacity with extra place that application alone represent of the total place create under the last government in year do he agree that this be further evidence of the government deliver after year of inaction 
 my hon friend be exactly right to point to that planning application go forward it be excellent news and show that we be crack on with the job 
 although the government should have volunteer to defend their position i accept have hold ministerial responsibility for the prison estate that they have no good option at this point do the minister accept that the problem with what he be choose to do be that the return to prison for breach of important licence condition be there to be a deterrent and if we reduce that deterrent we run the risk of more people breach licence condition which would make the overcrowding problem bad if he choose that path will he consider increase the deterrent effect by ensure that follow a day return to prison there be other restriction on a prisoner ’s freedom such as electronic tagging 
 i certainly hope that all those thing will be look at by the independent sentencing review the mandating of the day fix term release   be a measure take by the previous government we be extend that to day for sentence of up to year because of the situation that we face to ensure that we do not run out of prison place in the interim 
 like i many resident across filton and bradly stoke be rightly appal last summer to discover the real situation leave behind by the conservative party when it come to prison do the minister agree that this be an opportunity for the conservative party to apologise 
 my hon friend make a good point and the house will have hear it 
 the minister and the secretary of state have often use the word emergency to describe the state of the prison population and i have ask the secretary of state how long it will take to deport all the foreign criminal clog up our jail this be a moment for the secretary of state to say yes this be an emergency and to deport the lot of they free up about place which would help overcome this crisis 
 we have deport more foreign national offender in month than the last government do in the previous month and we be continue to work hard with the home office to deport foreign national offender we will never be able to do that on the scale necessary to address the challenge that we face in our prison at this time 
 on a recent visit to featherstone prison near wolverhampton i come across several prisoner who have be recall and who be wait up to a year to have their case progress do the minister agree that limit the recall sentence make great use of technology to punish offender in the community and make the probation service more effective will result in well rehabilitation of prisoner reduce reoffende and ease the prison overcrowding cause by the previous government 
 my hon friend point out the action that we must take to address the challenge that we face in the system and to make the system work well for victim and protect the public 
 many domestic abuser will give their nature welcome the opportunity to give another twist of the knife at the cost of a mere day have the minister just present they with a practical opportunity 
 i have carefully go through the exclusion from this measure and emphasise the importance of good professional body continue to apply proper risk assessment when risk assessment say that a standard recall be more appropriate than a fix term recall that will happen 
 it be a bit rich for conservative members to be critical when they leave the criminal justice system in total meltdown do my hon friend agree that tagging be an important resource for protect the public from   criminal perhaps he see the channel programme dispatches which show that the contract give to serco by the conservative party be totally and utterly fail do he have confidence in serco to deliver that contract and if not will he remove it and bring that service back under public control 
 it be clear that tag technology have huge potential a recent study have show a reduction in reoffende by offender wear curfew tag but my hon friend be right to draw attention to concern about the contract serco ’s performance be improve but it be still not acceptable the reporting in the dispatches programme be from last year when we know that there be serious issue and we issue financial penalty to serco which be give the contract by the previous government if serco ’s performance drop again all option will remain on the table 
 this announcement be a further illustration of why this house should legislate to remove all impediment to the deportation of foreign national offender in his reply to the shadow justice secretary the minister say that victim who be affect by this policy should be keep inform about release yet he refuse to say whether the department have conduct an impact assessment what new information be he today willing to commit to publish each month so that victim be indeed keep inform 
 victim absolutely need to be keep inform and we continue to work with victim group and the victim commissioner to ensure that they be 
 in separate case family in my constituency lose love one when they be murder by offender who be out on remand but should never have be will the minister meet i and if they wish both family so that they can have some assurance that lesson have be learn from these case and so that other family be not place in the same horrendous situation 
 i be very sorry to hear about the case mention by my hon friend i be happy to meet he to take the matter far 
 the victim commissioner have warn that free prisoner early who have be show to pose a reoffende risk to the public will 
 place victim and the wide public at an unnecessary risk of harm 
 the domestic abuse commissioner have say that it be simply unacceptable what discussion do the government have with those commissioner before make the announcement 
 we speak to the victim commissioner regularly the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones be speak to they later today 
 the justice secretary could have choose to deport more of the thousand of offender in our jail maxe out court sitting day repurposed building or procure temporary facility to hold offender why have she instead choose to release serious offender include domestic abuser from jail early with no consideration for the victim 
 this be not about release people from prison early 
 yes it be 
 no it be not this be about people who have already serve their sentence in prison they be out in the community if they breach a condition of their licence they be return to prison the hon gentleman might as well ask why the government he support do not take any of the measure that he mention our government inherit the mess that his government leave we and we be take decision to address the unconscionable threat of have a prison system that be not able to lock up dangerous people 
 minister seem to have be deliberately vague about the number of domestic abuse offender who will be eligible for release and the breadth of their offence give how big the announcement be the government and the department will have do a lot of work look at who will be eligible will the minister set out to the house the exact number of domestic abuse offender who will be eligible for this scheme 
 i hear the right hon gentleman ’s question and i will write to he 
 the duty of government be to keep the public safe i recently meet a constituent whose convict ex husband be serve a prison sentence have rap she twice despite be in prison he continue to have indirect access to their child my constituent think that be wrong and i agree do the minister agree that convict violent and sexual offender should serve maximum possible custodial sentence and lose parental access right 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that the victims and courts bill be about to go through parliament and that be the sort of issue that we will look at during the bill ’s passage 
 of the reason why our prison be so full be that we have more than foreign national in they what step be the minister take to deport they 
 i say gently that we have deport more foreign national in the year on our watch than the previous government do in the year on their watch he be right that we have to roll up our sleeve and continue to get on with the job 
 the minister have be slightly equivocal in answer this question which i have ask on previous occasion time   lucky prior to announce this policy change yesterday do the government meet and consult the domestic abuse commissioner about it yes or no
