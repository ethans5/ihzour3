i do not agree with that and nor will i take any lesson on political opportunism from the snp i be tempt to say that i would whatsapp my answer to the hon lady but she would probably delete it before she read it a lot will depend on whether the identification have the relevant hologram i also point out to the hon lady that—[interruption she chunter from a sedentary position without want to listen to the answer but of the who do not have the right identification come back 
 i will try to pick out the question from the bluster 
 on the £ this be a specific issue that affect september onwards where we allocate to local authority week of funding because that be the period from september to march some then say that they pay week to their provider so we have that money in order that they can provide week of funding where that be what they do 
 on the funding rate we announce the funding rate for and year old in april last year and for year old in november give that local authority have to pass on of the money that we give they provider have a pretty good idea of what they will receive however while the vast majority of authority will confirm their rate in the come week a small number leave it until   march we be encourage they not to do that and to confirm their rate as early as possible in the same way as the other 
 the hon lady ask how many family would not be able to access the childcare offer as a result of those issue the answer be none as she know we have increase funding rate significantly neil leitch to whom she refer be in our stakeholder group and we value his input however i think it will be clear to people watch these exchange that while we get on with the big delivery of childcare ever the labour party have no plan no policy and no idea how to help family with childcare cost 
 we set our rate by conduct a survey of provider in order to understand the cost they face and set the rate accordingly last november we delay publish the rate a bit in order that we could provide more money to take account of the government ’s near increase in the national living wage we believe we be get they right in relation to what people be pay but if the hon lady have particular evidence she would like to send i i will happily look at it 
 i set out in my statement the additional money that we have give to the sector in the last financial year and this to help it to meet those cost pressure that be anchor to the survey of provider that i talk about again if the hon gentleman want to send i information datum or specific case study i will gladly have a look 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point about the increase cost pressure that everybody have to face that be why we give an additional £ in the last financial year and a furth £ in the current financial year to help meet those pressure base on the fact that we survey provider in order to understand exactly what they be pay for all the thing he outline 
 i thank the hon lady for give i the chance to update the house on this important matter far to the write ministerial statement that we will publish later today 
 the uk health security agency announce last week that it have declare a national standard incident in response to an increase in confirm case of measle in order for our measle mump and rubella vaccine to work the world health organisation recommend at least coverage to maintain population coverage at the moment our mmr reach be for the dose at month and for the dose at year 
 this be not a new issue there have be a gradual decline in coverage over year because of a number of factor range from the wakefield generation when dr andrew wakefield publish his discredit paper on the risk of mmr through to covid when routine vaccination be miss and there have be a drop since then there have also be concern in particular community such as the jewish and muslim community about the type of vaccine use we have not be wait the nhs have carry out a catch up effort over the past month proactively contact parent and carer of unvaccinated child age and young and we have see a increase in vaccination compare to the previous year 
 however that be not enough nhs figure show that almost child under the age of be unprotected and at risk of catch this serious and preventable disease measles be so infectious that infected child in a classroom can infect up to other unvaccinated child make it of the most infectious disease worldwide while for most it will be a mild illness in child with measle will need to be admit to hospital for treatment put additional pressure on the nhs 
 i want to stress that this be not just a childhood disease for adult who have not be vaccinate it can be a serious and potentially life change event my message to mum and dad with child who be currently unvaccinate be to come forward we have a range of measure in place letter be go out to the parent of unvaccinated child across london and the midland 
 we have extra clinic be set up by gps pop up clinic in school and vaccine bus target community with low vaccination rate we have hold mp briefing session on and   january for the west midland and for london today we have send out information to mps so that they can help we get the message out to their constituent to come forward it be not too late there be no age limit anybody who have not have their vaccination can come forward the vaccine will   provide roughly protection and the will provide the message be to come forward and get vaccinate 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if he will target levelling up funding at the most economically deprive community 
 the government have set clear and ambitious mission to end long stand geographical inequality in the uk in target levelling up funding we consider a range of factor include levelling up need these metric draw on the extensive evidence base of what matter for level up as set out in the levelling up white paper 
 i be interested in the minister ’s comment about target deprivation be make bad by bad policy decision the bedroom tax significantly impact and bring an end to a multimillion pound housing renovation scheme in the village of horden in my constituency can the minister explain to my constituent why our levelling up bid aim at regenerate horden which be rank in the bottom for the uk be reject 
 we select the bid base on strict criterion and the methodology be set out on gov.uk i be sorry that the hon gentleman be disappoint that his constituency do not benefit we fund a project in county durham in round of the levelling up fund and i be happy to work with he to see what more we could do to invest in county durham 
 the household support fund have give a lifeline to council across the uk include bracknell forest council and it be discretionary will the minister confirm whether that fund will be extend beyond this financial year 
 i can not make spending commitment today but i can say that my hon friend be a fantastic champion for his constituent and i be happy to ensure that the relevant minister be able to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 the secretary of state be the deputy chair of the tata steel transition board so if his department be at all serious about level up will he acknowledge just how devastating tata steel ’s announcement be for port talbot and for family worker and community across south wales why will the minister not work with business and trade ministers to look again with the company at a long fair transition that protect our sovereign steelmaking capability and our community 
 the hon lady know how important steel be to i my constituency be deeply affect when ssi close in we have already provide £ of support but i be happy to ensure that the relevant minister meet she to discuss how we can provide further support 
 it be very positive that stoke on trent have be include as of the levelling up partnership scheme do the minister agree that it be vital that every part of stoke on trent get levelling up support so that all community include those in my constituency and particularly the town of longton can benefit from the scheme 
 the levelling up partnership will be transformational for stoke on trent build on the levelling up investment we have already make there i be pleased to meet my hon friend last week to discuss his priority include the town of longton and we hope to make further announcement about that in the come month 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i be glad that my delay avanti west coast train get i here on time with a sprint for i at the end 
 datum reveal by the centre for cities today show that after year town and city in every corner of our country have be level down leave behind and leave out of pocket on average people be over £ a year bad off as a result of the sluggish growth since analysis of the country ’s large city and town reveal that every place be out of pocket north and south from former industrial town to major city year after take power do the minister accept that the british people be bad off now than they be then 
 i absolutely do not accept that the right hon lady seem to forget the reality that we have have a financial crash covid-19 and the scottish government fail to support city like aberdeen with the oil and gas industry she can look at the evidence of what we be do through level up we have invest more than £ of levelling up funding directly into community the length and breadth of the country and we will continue to do that 
 the minister say look at the evidence and i be look at the evidence—14 year of a conservative government elect on a promise to level up the country which have leave work people bad off in manchester the average household be over £ a year out of pocket down the road in burnley the loss amount to £ will they now listen to our proposal to reform planning reinstate housing target and get britain build again or will the country have to suffer another final year of failure 
 the labour party have bankrupt birmingham and it would bankrupt britain we have make huge progress towards level up include by roll out gigabit broadband introduce educational investment in area open new freeport increase the national living wage recruit more police officer funding regeneration and community ownership and devolve more power to local mayors we will continue to level up 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the european union have provide great funding support to economically deprive community in scotland than the uk government have with their mismanaged levelling up fund if scotland be still part of the eu we would have be entitle to a multibillion pound share of the € nextgenerationeu fund why should scot be happy with the tiny sliver of westminster levelling up funding that we have be give when westminster have deny scotland a share of the far great opportunity of eu development funding 
 i completely reject the hon lady ’s assertion we have invest £ in scotland through the uk share prosperity fund so far £ through the levelling up fund and £ through the community renewal fund i could go on mr speaker if the hon lady want to support constituency in scotland she should back our bill later today 
 what step he be take to increase the provision of social rent housing 
 our £ affordable home programme will deliver thousand of affordable home for rent and to buy right across the country the levelling up white paper also commit we to increase the supply of social rent home and a large number of the new home deliver through our affordable home programme will be for social rent 
 local authority have be strip of resource for the past year and even conservative members agree with that do the secretary of state recognise that local authority and housing association need certainty and stability over time so that they have the confidence and security to invest in affordable social and council housing stock rather than the conservatives last minute unplanned change that wreak chaos and instability 
 i certainly agree that housing association do fantastic work in provide home for social rent as well as share ownership home and we work in partnership with they we be aware of the many pressure they be under the hon lady say that they need certainty and stability but that be why it would be so damaging if there be a labour government with their £ black hole which would mean either more borrowing or tax increase and high interest rate for those aspire to get on the housing ladder that be why we should stick with the plan rather than go back to square 
 in my constituency of suffolk coastal flagship be sell house to home owner that be a scandal it try to suggest that it be because it can not repair they economically but it be not offer they of all to the local council there be restriction and covenant that could be put in place if these be council house but they be not they be housing association home i would love to meet my right hon friend to discuss this   matter far to make sure that the housing that be originally give to the housing association stay for local people 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for raise that issue she represent of the most beautiful constituency in the united kingdom and do so with great skill it be because it be such a beautiful constituency that demand for housing be so high the proportion of home in her constituency do create challenge for local people which i would be more than happy to discuss with she at her convenience 
 i call the shadow minister 
 rather than levy fine of £ on the most vulnerable people sleep rough as be propose in the criminal justice bill will the minister commit to build a new generation of social housing the current level be pitiful and be an embarrassment be they not secretary of state 
 no absolutely not our record on build social home be significantly well than that of the last labour government it be under our administration that local authority have be give the chance to take of the receipt from right to buy and to reinvest they in social housing it be this government spend £ through the affordable home programme who be capable of deliver social home as we be talk of billion of pound the £ black hole in the shadow minister ’s budget would devastate our housing market 
 what step his department be take to ensure effective accountability of regional mayors 
 what step his department be take to ensure effective accountability of regional mayors 
 the english devolution accountability framework be publish in march to make it easy to understand how mayors leader and institution with devolved power be hold to account the framework alongside the recently publish scrutiny protocol will improve scrutiny and make clear the outcome and metric that mayor be deliver against 
 once again i thank the minister for the £ of levelling up fund to upgrade the penistone line which will significantly improve the service and bring much need improvement to shepley stocksmoor and denby dale station however to achieve the ultimate goal of get train to run a half hourly service more investment be require and that need to come through the west yorkshire mayor and network north do my hon friend agree that the mayor should make that a priority and announce the extra investment to ensure a full upgrade of the penistone line 
 we be delighted to provisionally award kirklees council with £ from the levelling up fund to upgrade the penistone railway line i thank my hon friend and other particularly conservative members for their dedicated support and i look forward to see the benefit that the funding will bring to people travel between huddersfield and sheffield as my hon friend say network north will see additional devolve funding provide to the west yorkshire mayor my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport and i will work with he and the mayor to ensure that this new and unprecedented level of investment address local priority and support town city and rural area across west yorkshire 
 in nottinghamshire and derbyshire we be look forward to elect our mayor in a few week time especially with the £ of funding for transport improvement how do we ensure that that money be spend on improve our road link fix pothole improve railway line and so on and be not lose in the creation of a costly administrative tier of local government 
 we have provide additional funding to council in the east midland to set up the new local authority so any additional funding through network north will not be consume by that it be a fantastic opportunity to get my hon friend   the member for mansfield ben bradley   elect as the east midlands mayor i be sure that he will focus on exactly the priority my hon friend   the member for amber valley nigel mills   mention 
 i call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee 
 of the well aspect of devolution so far which might actually work be the trailblazer project that have be roll out in the west midland and greater manchester of the key element of those project be have a single pot of money i have repeatedly ask whether it be the intention to roll devolution deal out to the other combined authority and i have be assure that it be why then in the iteration of what a new devolution deal might look like have south yorkshire merseyside and west yorkshire be tell that a single pot of money will not be include in the devolution deal why be the government backtrack on the commitment to give those area a full devolution deal not a devolution minus deal 
 we have invite the combine authority area that the hon gentleman mention to progress to level devolution which as he rightly say do not come with a single settlement it be something that we be still consider and when we see it in action in the west midland and greater manchester we will be able to assess its value for money and whether it be deliver for people there i assure he that this be not devolution minus we be give devolution plus to community the length and breadth of the country 
 i be a big supporter of devolution to city region such as greater manchester and i welcome a number of the   government ’s proposal to shift even more power and responsibility from this place to the combine authority and mayor but do the minister understand the disappointment of greater manchester mps of all political persuasion in the proposal for great scrutiny by mp question at meeting with a supplementary at the discretion of the chair just do not cut it 
 i hold a session for greater manchester mps on the scrutiny protocol i can not remember whether the hon gentleman be there but i be happy to hold a further session with he the scrutiny protocol be not yet in place it be a work in progress which we be try to establish in partnership with mps we want to know what would work well for mps in the scrutiny session 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last week the secretary of state tell the business and trade committee that he hop that the long delay inquiry that he commission into teesworks and the tees valley mayor will be publish soon and that he would not pre empt it the report be promise in july then november then december it be now january where be it 
 the hon lady should know that the ministerial code mean i be recuse from matter relate to my constituency however i would simply say to she when she want to criticise ben houchen that he be of the most effective mayors we have have the employment rate in teesside since ben be elect have increase by compare with the rest of the north east which only increase by and the national average of she should focus her attention on some of the labour mayors like the labour mayor of london sadiq khan who be fail on housing fail on crime and fail on the thing that matter to people 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of voter identification requirement on election turnout 
 we be pleased to see in the may election that the vast majority of voter in polling station be able to cast their vote successfully that amount to of those seek to vote 
 voter be turn away from polling station at the may local election for not have photo identification local council have be cut to the bone so they do not have the resource to ensure that everybody have photo id what will the government do to ensure that nobody be disenfranchised when we get to the general election 
 there be nothing novel about have voter id france germany austria and canada all have it and we have have it in northern ireland part of the united kingdom for the past year i understand that in internal labour party selection election their member also have to produce voter id we have a full and comprehensive list of voter id which council   have be use very well for those who wish to vote and do not have of those form of id a tiny number we also have the voter certificate available free of charge which allow they to vote we want to see as many people as possible voting and of course we want to see they vote conservative 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the government ’s voter id requirement which allow travel card for old people but not the young person ’s equivalent be unfair at good but the reality be that this be political opportunism as have just be say analysis by the electoral commission follow england ’s local election find that people be unable to vote due to voter id requirement there be real concern base on that datum that there will be a potential impact in the forthcoming general election voter at local election be often a small group of more politically informed people whereas the large group of voter who wish to cast their vote at a general election may be less aware of the requirement do the minister agree with the word of his former cabinet colleague   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg that 
 party that try and gerrymander end up find their clever scheme come back to bite they as we find by insist on voter id for election 
 i do not agree with that and nor will i take any lesson on political opportunism from the snp i be tempt to say that i would whatsapp my answer to the hon lady but she would probably delete it before she read it a lot will depend on whether the identification have the relevant hologram i also point out to the hon lady that—[interruption she chunter from a sedentary position without want to listen to the answer but of the who do not have the right identification come back.[official report   january vol c. 4mc 
 what assessment he have make of the cause of council budget deficit 
 what assessment he have make of the cause of council budget deficit 
 the department work closely with the local government sector and other departments to understand specific demand and cost pressure the provisional local government finance settlement for make available over £ an increase in core spending power of almost £ or in cash term we stand behind council up and down the country to deliver the service that their community look for 
 it be recently reveal that devon county council be use its broadband clawback money to close its deficit that £ be intend for improve broadband across rural area countryside connectivity be key to boost business so that they can pay their taxis so what do the minister plan for   next year when devon county council ’s finance minister put his hand down the back of the sofa only to find he have spend the million intend for broadband on pay day to day direct debit 
 if the money from that department be ring fence it be not at the discretion of the county councillor where they use it they have to use it for that purpose i would take the hon gentleman ’s concern a little more seriously if he have take part in the parliamentary engagement as colleague across the house do include   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse or attend the westminster hall debate about mid devon council funding secure by my hon friend   the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger 
 i appreciate the time that the minister take to answer my question at the drop in session we will not cut nhs waiting time without good well resource social care my liberal democrat council colleague in bath be on track to bring social care back in house which mean well care that be well deliver locally and long term saving however even bath north east somerset council as he know and as i have already point out be under severe financial strain will he therefore commit to extra funding to allow it to deliver the vital social care that my constituent so desperately need 
 adult social care be a demand on all upper tier authority i commend banes council on the work it be do that be precisely the demonstration of flexibility and innovation in local government that we look for to deliver quality service in a cost efficient way and it deserve our approbation for that with the department of health and social care we keep under review precisely those policy relate to adult social care to make sure that those who be most in need receive the service that they need in a timely fashion 
 would the minister like to put on record that he share my thank to councillor lezley picton the leader of shropshire council who have do a fantastic job despite the challenge in try to get down the deficit there the council have find significant efficiency saving but there be still more to do ahead of the local government finance settlement announcement could the minister look at the rural service delivery grant and see what more can be do for large rural county such as shropshire which he will know be the large landlocked county in england 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and for the work that councillor picton do as the leader of his council he be absolutely right to point to the continue importance of innovation change and reform to ensure value for money that be key and to highlight the importance of the rural service delivery grant my right hon friend the secretary of state and i remain committed to that and we hope to be able to make that announcement in due course 
 rural council face a disproportionate triple whammy from the rise cost of energy due to the ukraine war with rural council and rural public service have to pay high   heating energy and labour cost could i have a meeting with my hon friend to talk about the fair funding formula to make sure that rural council be properly fund in this next settlement 
 as a rural member of parliament i be tempt to tell my hon friend that he will be preach to the choir but of course i be happy to meet he he point to the challenge that rural council face in deliver service in area that be wide in geography and sparse in population 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the reality be that more and more council be be push to the financial brink it stand as a fact that more council issue bankruptcy notice last year than in the previous year combine those council be conservative liberal democrat and no overall control but the thing they have in common be the conservative government in downing street the local government association report that council face an immediate £ funding gap now that the deadline have pass can the minister confirm how many council have apply for exceptional financial support and whether pressure in adult social care child ’s service and homelessness will be fully meet in the financial settlement 
 it be not policy for we to comment individually on council that be seek advice from or engagement with official but i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question because it give i the opportunity to put on record that my department and i stand ready to engage with all those council who wish to discuss their financial circumstance we want to make sure that we have a well fund professional local government sector deliver for those people in our community who look to they for the service that they require for their daily life 
 what step he be take to protect public green space 
 through the levelling up park fund taxpayer be provide more than £ to create new green space or significantly refurbish exist one the department own green flag award scheme which be currently operate under licence by keep britain tidy set the national standard for public green space and encourage local authority to ensure that park and green space be welcome safe and well maintain 
 behind the closed door of the town hall labour control erewash borough council be plot to sell off large swathe of green open space include the former pewit golf course in ilkeston which have previously be designate as a nature reserve will my hon friend take step to prevent local authority from sell public land without carry out full public consultation and will he join i on a visit to the pewit site to discuss how we might save it from the hand of developer 
 by law local authority be require to publish a notice and advertise it before dispose of any open space this be exactly why it be so important that my hon friend be and continue to be the mp for erewash she can call out all the disaster of the labour erewash borough council which as a fellow derbyshire mp i see derbyshire labour do regularly all across my county it have the wrong priority and outcome and it make the wrong decision 
 the minister might know that we have wonderful public green space in our country many of they be around london and in west yorkshire but be he aware that the decline of education department in many local authority owe to the policy of successive conservative governments mean that today the ability to organise school trip to green space be minimal could we have a policy that allow all our child of whatever background to go to and enjoy those beautiful green space 
 i call the minister 
 because if they can not get there to visit they they can not love they 
 order mr sheerman please do not take advantage of the chair i be try to bring the minister in and i have to get many other in you be important but so be other people 
 the hon gentleman should look at the conservative party ’s record on education in over year in government there have be substantial improvement in education and teaching and our child be well readie for the challenge ahead as a result 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of a day working week for local authority employee 
 the government have be crystal clear that we do not support any attempt from local authority to implement part time work for full time pay remove capacity to deliver service to resident be not acceptable the government have take step to deter council from operate such practice and we will take further step if necessary 
 the minister only early extoll the virtue of devolution in fact page of the tory manifesto say that the 
 ambition be for full devolution across england build on the successful devolution of power to city region mayor 
 and other how do that laudable aim fit with the government ’s shocking attempt through threat and bully tactic to strangle the ability of local council such as south cambridgeshire district council to trial a day week and other money save initiative 
 if the hon gentleman can construct an argument for hard work family across the country many of whom will be work or job to   keep a roof over their head that day pay and benefit be commensurate with day work a week i would be interested in hear it i invite he in all seriousness to consider the impact on the public ’s perception of the public sector if it be give out that we can afford to work day a week but still expect and receive day pay 
 what step he be take to help time buyer 
 get on the property ladder be everything that be important about be a conservative the government have a range of scheme available to time buyer include the home scheme share ownership and right to buy so far nearly people have be help on to the property ladder by this government 
 do the minister agree that while labour member actively block the building of new home for time buyer the conservative government have increase the number to a year high and help almost household through government back scheme 
 i absolutely agree with my right hon friend i hope he hear some of the chunter of come on from the opposition benches when he raise the absolutely correct point that when the opportunity be there for labour members they flub it they have block house that could be use for time buyer people who need help and the most vulnerable it be all down to   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner 
 i thank the minister for that answer what discussion have he have with large uk bank such as danske bank in northern ireland to ensure mortgage be make as accessible as possible for time buyer encourage they to buy not rent when they have a steady income far be there any plan to reintroduce the help to buy isa 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his important question get people on the housing ladder be absolutely vital that be why we introduce the mortgage guarantee scheme which extend the number of mortgage that be on the market for those people who need it include time buyer i be happy to talk separately to the hon gentleman about other idea that he may have 
 what step he be take to reform the leasehold system 
 right now the government be take action with the progression of the leasehold and freehold reform bill through this place which deliver on the government ’s manifesto commitment on leasehold reform 
 leaseholder in leazes park in newcastle be have their life ruin because their supposedly charitable freeholder the st mary magdalene and holy jesus trust refuse to allow they to extend or buy their leasehold across the constituency in a cost of living crisis my constituent face exorbitant management fee high cost for fire safety and ever increase ground rent can the minister tell my constituent why when the labour party be commit to comprehensive and fundamental reform of the leasehold system as set out by the law commission he have bring forward a leasehold reform bill that do not actually reform their leasehold 
 the leasehold and freehold reform bill which be go through parliament at the moment go through in a very constructive way so far with contribution from member of all party presumably because they recognise the value of the clause it contain will make substantive change for those who have leasehold at the current time we look forward to its continued progress through the house 
 i call the father of the house 
 there will be agreement on both side of the house that reform be need for my part i welcome the introduction of the leasehold and freehold reform bill to get people on to modern leasehold and commonhold and through the minister i invite those who be suffer the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah   explain that her constituent be suffer to put their point through mps to the department so that when amendment to the bill be table as many as possible can be discuss and accept 
 i be grateful to my hon friend as i and the secretary of state have say we be keen to improve the bill where we can but it be a substantial bill that will make substantial change for people who have need reform of leasehold for a long time 
 what step he be take to promote transparency in local government 
 step be always be take to improve transparency the local government accountability framework and transparency code set standard for transparency it mandate the publication of certain information such as spend the office for local government will promote transparency far by provide authoritative local government performance datum on the local authority datum explorer 
 be a cabinet member in a local council should require the high level of transparency however i fear that be not always the case when relevant previous criminal and custodial conviction remain hidden what advice would my hon friend give council leader about how to ensure cabinet member be fully transparent about their previous conviction where relevant to their role as a cabinet member 
 my hon friend raise an important question at the time of appointment all council leader should be aware of exist disqualification criterion bar councillor who have be give a custodial sentence of month or more or who be register sex offender if the council leader be not aware those people who be due to be appoint should make their group leader aware of those circumstance they have a legal obligation to declare as election candidate this be an important issue the nolan principle be there for a reason to maintain transparency and standard if my hon friend wish to write to i with the detail of the case he have mention i would be happy to receive his submission 
 what step he be take to reform the private rented sector 
 the renters reform bill will soon enter its report stage in the house of commons that bill abolishe section eviction move the sector to a system of periodic tenancy and introduce a private rent sector property portal and ombudsman improve the system for responsible tenant and good faith landlord 
 in my casework i have see an alarming rise in the number of no fault eviction this be lead to family be move a long way from my borough with child have to travel ten of mile to get to school every day the government have say that they be go to remove section eviction but they have not give the criterion under which they be go to do so and it seem that this be go to be in the hand of the minister opposition front benchers have offer to work with the government to eradicate section eviction the government say they would do it year ago accord to the government ’s own figure family have be threaten with no fault eviction when be the government go to co operate and get this resolve 
 that be exactly why we be bring forward the renters reform bill however as we set out on reading and in committee we will not be able to do that until the court system be able to cope with the increase number of case we hear evidence in committee about the huge increase in case that we will find we be introduce these reform in a phase way so that court and the sector have time to adjust interruption i would say to the hon gentleman and to   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner who be chuntere from a sedentary position that it serve no to leave tenant or landlord in limbo in a court system that be not function properly 
 chelmsford be a brilliant city and lot of people want to go there to live but that do mean there be huge demand for property especially affordable property both to buy and to rent at the moment when we build new house the local authority can put a quota of affordable home on those new build property but they can not do that when large office block be convert into flat will my hon friend   arrange for i to meet the housing minister so that i can discuss how to make progress with my private member ’s bill on affordable housing in conversion of commercial to residential property 
 i will ensure that the housing minister be able to meet my right hon friend 
 what assessment he have make of the reliability of information on associated infrastructure provide to buyer by housing developer 
 it be absolutely vital that buyer have correct up to date and accurate material information on their purchase before they make a decision to buy a home 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend the minister he will know that promotional document put out by major house builder such as barratt homes taylor wimpey david wilson homes and so on to prospective purchaser on large scale housing estate commit absolutely to the building of health infrastructure which very often do not turn up just allocate a piece of land simply be not good enough can he please make sure that we do not mislead purchaser and that frankly the doctor surgery be the building to be build on many of these new estate 
 my hon friend make a hugely important point and i be grateful for the time he have spend with i in my couple of month in the job to highlight this issue to articulate the problem and to show the real life example of where there be an issue he be such a good champion of this issue for his constituency a substantial amount of infrastructure have be build all across the country but where there be gap it be hugely frustrating and we will continue to work with assiduous member such as my hon friend to try to close they 
 a recent freedom of information request reveal that only a of the housing infrastructure fund have actually be spend which leave £ unspent the national audit office say that successful delivery of the housing infrastructure fund appear to be unachievable so what be go to happen to that £ 
 the housing infrastructure fund continue to transform very difficult challenging and unviable area of the country it be be spend at pace and it will continue to be so we expect it to be able to transform more part of the country over the year ahead 
 what assessment he have make of the role of neighbourhood planning in the national planning policy framework 
 the government recognise the time and commitment that community put into neighbourhood plan our recent update to the national planning policy framework mean that neighbourhood plan meet their identify housing requirement be now well protect from speculative development include through the additional reform come in the levelling up and regeneration act 
 my lib dem run borough council still do not have an up to date local plan every day that pass mean that we be open to speculative housing development without the right infrastructure such as gp practice and road and those kind of thing my community be fantastic at produce neighbourhood plan but they be ride over roughshod in place such as desford where housing have be put in where the community do not want it will the minister look at increase the priority give to neighbourhood plan when community and local planning authority do not have an up to date local plan 
 it be hugely frustrating when local plan be not in place as my hon friend indicate in his area the lib dem council have fail to do that which be let resident down there have be change as a result of the national planning policy framework give additional protection through neighbourhood plan but district council and those with planning responsibility need to get their plan in place 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of a permit development right for urban homeowner to increase their property to storey where that comply with the local authority ’s design code 
 we have introduce national permit development right to allow a wide range of exist residential and commercial building to extend upwards by up to additional storey we have also recently consult on proposal to apply local design code to those right and further announcement will be make in due course 
 may i urge the minister to go far and fast on this the permit development right would create beautiful urban townscape and unleash the big wave of housebuilde in half a century which would in turn cut housing cost to rent or buy be green by allow people to live within bicycle or walk distance from work and protect rural landscape from urban sprawl and by increase the development potential of almost any urban building be the big single act of wealth creation in decade what ’ to dislike 
 there be absolutely nothing to dislike as my hon friend indicate about speed up the planning system to ensure we get the house we so badly need as i know my hon friend will appreciate however there be always a balance to be strike we must ensure that we take local people with we but we be commit to build more house and do so in the right place 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 early this month we launch the consultation on awaab ’s law which insist upon time limit for repair in the social rent sector in the shaping of this law and many other initiative and intervention to help people in social housing the example of tony lloyd the late member for rochdale be in all our mind and heart awaab be of his constituent and tony lloyd could not have be kind or more supportive of the effort of my department and other to see justice for awaab ’s family 
 the household support fund have support household in liverpool since its introduction the focus need to shift from crisis support to prevention but in the short term the demand for local welfare be rise like many other council liverpool city council say the household support fund will need to continue beyond march to keep resident well support to stay in and enter work and prevent an escalating crisis reduce pressure on public service include local authority what representation have the minister make to the treasury and the department for work and pensions to ensure the continuation of the fund after march 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right the fund have help many community in need particularly in liverpool he and other liverpool mps have be assiduous in make the case for its continuation and i have pass that on to colleague 
 leicester shire mp have plenty of time last week with ministers from the department the levelling up minister and the local government minister to discuss the funding and structure of our county council to follow up will the minister for local government commit to meet the county council leadership to ensure that the funding and the formula that go with it be improve for the future 
 i thank my hon friend for his positive engagement alongside that of my right hon friend   the member for charnwood edward argar   and my hon friend the members for loughborough jane hunt and for south leicestershire alberto costa who come to see i to discuss this issue last week i would of course be delighted to meet the leadership of leicestershire county council with my hon friend   the member for bosworth dr evans   and his colleague through the good office of our hon friend the member for south leicestershire i meet informally with councillor louise richardson the cabinet lead on health last week 
 i call the shadow spokesperson 
 mr speaker may i echo the comment make by the secretary of state in relation to the late tony lloyd who will be greatly miss in all part of the house 
 as we have hear from the shadow secretary of state the whole country have be level down since at an average rate of £ per person that be a damn indictment of this government but with about project fund by the future high street fund the town deal and levelling up fund that decline should in theory not have happen how many of those project have now be complete and what evidence do the department have that those project have contribute to reduce regional inequality 
 the evidence of the reduction in regional inequality be perhaps most marked in teesside and the tees valley where the conservative mayor ben houchen have be responsible for oversee an economic renaissance renew foreign direct investment and improvement in public health and education the message be clear if we want level up to work we need to elect conservative mayor in may 
 the minister will be aware that labour run rotherham metropolitan borough council have recently give the go ahead for developer to build hundred of new home at highfield park in maltby on land that have always be greenfield what he might not be aware of be that the developer have give thousand of pound to the local labour party which none of the councillor vote on the issue declare what can he do to ensure that such greenfield site be not wantonly give over to developer 
 i be sorry to hear about the challenge that my hon friend have see in rother valley it be reason that more conservative councillor need to be elect on to rotherham metropolitan borough council for the future we be absolutely aware that there be challenge we need to build more house and in the right place and the good way to do that be by get a local plan in place and by the council that be responsible for that engage properly with their community about it 
 my local authority be bend over backwards to try to build social housing and be commit to build new home yet the government be still stand in the way by place restriction on reinveste right to buy money in build social housing why will the government not assist local authority to build those house we have have few home a year since do the minister accept that that be a disgraceful record for the government 
 we always stand ready to work with local authority of whatever stripe or colour to ensure the delivery of new home as the hon member know london be the region of the united kingdom that have perform worst against its housing target principally that be down to the mayor not to individual local authority so i look forward to talk to he about what more we can do together 
 there be a powerful community campaign to stop an asphalt plant be build in countryside in my constituency the application have drag on for year   will the minister look at how applicant and council can be compel to provide and process information in a more timely manner so that such application do not blight the life of local people for so long 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we need decision at the early possible opportunity sometimes that be not possible but it be important that thing be do as quickly as possible that be reason that we announce a few week ago that we be monitor local authority planning application performance so that can see where they be and be not do the right thing 
 lease holder at orchard house in my constituency be in an unsafe building with known defect they have be issue with a remediation order but the freeholder be simply not co operate do this not suggest that the feudal freehold system should be abolish for flat as well as for house what assurance can the minister give my constituent that they will get help from somewhere 
 it suggest to i that the freeholder be do the wrong thing and where the freeholder be do the wrong thing they need to be hold to account through the court system as they be and they will eventually be force to do the right thing on the specific i be happy to talk to the hon lady if that would be helpful 
 we have £ for bishop auckland through the levelling up fund the future high street fund and the town fund £ for spennymoor through the long term plan for town and a £ investment fund through the north east devolution deal it really be the conservatives who deliver for the north east be it not 
 i completely agree with my hon friend and i thank she for her work in this role in the department and all that she have do to help level up in her constituency 
 there be family wait on liverpool ’s housing register we be face a housing and homelessness crisis and the cost of provide temporary accommodation have go from £ to £ in the past year the leader of the council have write to the secretary of state twice when will the secretary of state wake up to this emergency 
 i appreciate the advocacy of liverpool mp on behalf of those in temporary accommodation and i appreciate the scale and nature of the problem i have be work with the mayor of liverpool city region and other to look at a strategic future advisory panel report that we believe will unlock not just additional housing but additional investment in liverpool and the liverpool city region i look forward to discuss that with the hon member and indeed the new leader of liverpool city council 
 over the weekend the express run a story about ferryhill in my sedgefield constituency be a dumping ground for rapist and   paedophile my constituent believe that have be drive by housing group advertising in the south to people that they have house in place such as ferryhill where no check be require can the minister meet i to discuss how we can stop the degeneration of place such as ferryhill 
 i be very sorry to hear of my hon friend ’s concern i will meet he and discuss how our antisocial behaviour action plan can help in ferryhill 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests today more than of the government ’s own mp have write to the prime minister with their concern about the financial situation face council and the need for emergency funding the local government association say that there be likely to be a £ funding gap over the next year if there be to be these council shortfall and many people will not see the essential service they rely on what will the secretary of state do to ensure that people still have access to the vital service they so desperately need 
 i think that of the mp who write that letter be   the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner   and be   the hon member for somerton and frome sarah dyke so i look forward to their join our rank as part of the swell tide of conservative support that i see across the country on the specific of the hon member ’s point we have be listen carefully to colleague in local government and will respond in due course 
 local council tax payer in warrington quite rightly expect high level of governance and transparency when councillor be use public money to invest in commercial business which carry a high level of risk do the minister agree that the decision by labour run warrington borough council to reduce the number of opposition councillor on its audit committee fly in the face of good governance and that question need to be ask about how it be manage its £ debt 
 i recognise the concern regard warrington ’s debt of course the levelling up and regeneration act provide new power for the government to step in and take action to protect the public purse my experience be that where important scrutiny chairmanship role be hold by opposition party those who take the decision take well decision and the scrutiny be much well as a result 
 do the secretary of state think it be acceptable that leaseholder of lee court in my constituency should be without heating and hot water as well as experience multiple problem in the communal area if he do not think that be acceptable how and when will he strengthen the leasehold and freehold reform bill to stop these injustice from happen 
 i absolutely accept that and i believe that i write recently to lewisham council to draw attention to its responsibility in the area 
 on metro mayors may i draw my right hon friend ’s attention to the decision of ben houchen to deliver the £ darlington northern link road use network north fund do he agree that that be a fantastic example of ben deliver for darlington and the tees valley 
 it be just another example of ben houchen as metro mayor use all the power at his disposal and the resource release by this conservative government to ensure that at last teesside and the tees valley get the investment it need reason he attract so much criticism from the labour party be that he be a tory who deliver for teesside in a way that no have ever deliver before 
 come on jim 
 will the minister commit to further levelling up funding for the devolved institution for local sport club across northern ireland instead of fund casement park to the detriment of every other sport look for funding in northern ireland so that all tradition and all side of the community can benefit from the funding 
 i take the hon gentleman ’s point seriously it be important that we support grassroots sport and other civil society organisation in northern ireland we be work hard to try to ensure that we can do that with our partner in a restore executive in the meantime i should say that i be grateful to ulster rugby for end its relationship with kingspan which mean that we can unlock additional funding for grassroot rugby across northern ireland 
 while i be deeply disappointed that stoke on trent labour refuse to make the necessary term and condition change to help save stoke on trent city council funding there be a united view across the political divide in stoke on trent that the legacy in child ’s social care be cause huge financial strain on the local authority will the secretary of state do everything he can to work with councillor jane ashworth to ensure that that gap be fund and those child the most vulnerable in our society be protect 
 absolutely i hope that the house will note that my hon friend who fight incredibly hard for his principle and for stoke on trent be take a typically statesmanlike approach in put his constituent come the next general election people should remember that he be someone whose big heart reflect their good value 
 road safety be put at risk by road that be not adopt because speed limit can not be enforce and often they do not get grit there be serious worry that people will get injure what more can the department do to ensure that key service road on big new housing estate get adopt more quickly 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we need to ensure that developer live up to their responsibility to provide appropriate infrastructure it have be the case that a number of fleecehold for want of a well word development have unadopte road where child be at risk 
 before we proceed to the next business i would like to make a brief statement the link between member of parliament and our constituent be special and fundamental to the democratic life of the country as we enter the general election year many hon member be expect boundary change some will contemplate stand for constituency that they do not currently represent i have receive a number of representation from hon member from all part of the house about colleague involve themselves in their constituency i think it would be helpful to remind the house of some important rule and convention regard constituency representation 
 member usually deal with individual case relate only to their own constituency when a member be contact by someone seek assistance who be not she or his own constituent the normal expectation be that the person should be refer to the relevant constituency member secondly when a member intend to visit another constituency other than in a private capacity they should make every reasonable effort to inform the member represent that constituency before they do so that apply equally to ministerial visit the ministerial code state that the minister intend to make an official visit in the united kingdom must inform in advance and in good time the mp whose constituency be to be include in the visit i should add that although the ministerial code do not apply to shadow ministers they should adhere to the same protocol if visit constituency 
 thirdly when issue relate to another constituency be raise in the house the member concern should where possible and when time permit inform the other member involve in advance that apply equally to the tabling of write question 
 hon member have a duty to look after the constituent who elect they to this place boundary change do not take effect until the next election we must observe the convention of not involve ourselves with another member ’s constituency until that time more generally i understand that the political temperature will rise as we get close to an election i urge all hon member to continue to treat each other with courtesy and respect in the remain month of this parliament the election seem to have start a little too early 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make a statement on her department ’s plan to roll out hour of fund childcare to year old in work family from april 
 the government be roll out the single large expansion in childcare in english history by september we will provide work parent with hour of free childcare a week from when their child be month old all the way until they start school by this government expect to spend in excess of £ every year on free hour in early education double the amount we be currently spend 
 we be introduce that in phase from april eligible work parent will be able to access the hour of free childcare each week for their year old in september they will be able to access the hour each week for month old a year later in september they will be able to access the full hour for all eligible child age month upwards 
 we want parent to be able to access the new offer as soon as they can deliver that ambition include increase childcare funding rate with an additional £ in this financial year and an additional £ in the come financial year we be provide grant to help new childminder enter the sector and to make it easy for the sector make change to the early year foundation stage that it have ask we to make 
 we hear every day from family how significant this policy will be for their finance once the roll out be complete eligible family will save up to £ per year it will help parent to return to work or increase their hour and ten of thousand of parent have already successfully apply for their code ready to take up their place in april parent should visit childcarechoices.gov.uk to see the full range of support they be entitle to 
 regard tax free childcare we will be issue letter with temporary code to any parent whose tax free childcare reconfirmation date fall on or after   february   and before   april that will ensure that any eligible parent who need a code to confirm their fund childcare place with their provider will have and that no parent should worry that they will lose out 
 i welcome this opportunity to correct some misleading story about the childcare roll out and to hear from   the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson   about whether she support our childcare policy and if not what her childcare policy would be i be sure member on the labour benches would like to know as much as we would 
 in which case it would have be good to have come forward with a statement rather than i grant an urgent question so please bear that in mind before you make a comment 
 thank you mr speaker and thank you for grant the urgent question 
 crumble school building botched school budget and now the hat trick a childcare pledge in tatter because of conservative bungling it be not minister but family across the country pay the price for tory incompetence how do we get here 
 a litany of failure a pledge without a plan and a department without a grip lead by ministers without a clue family without the certainty of a childcare place they be promise by the chancellor last march and meanwhile the department be face a furth £ shortfall because of yet another miscalculation how be they go to make up that shortfall 
 family be face a rolling wave of conservative chaos which wreck all before it for provider it be an utter fiasco where their income after april be still a state secret when will provider be tell about their funding rate how many family do the minister estimate will now not be able to access new hour because of this shamble the prime minister ’s official spokesman this morning say 
 we be confident that the provision and capability be there we be confident in the strength of the marketplace 
 but the market be tell they that their plan be simply not deliverable the chief executive of the early years alliance say that sign up to the new system be financial suicide for provider mr speaker this be not a market it be an almighty mess and minister know it government source be brief the paper that there will be 
 parent that just do not get their place 
 let i explain to ministers in word of syllable that be no good that will not work they must do more they need to fix it if provider can not price place now how on earth can they be expect to offer more in september can ministers guarantee to parent now that the roll out will be deliver on time yes or no 
 it need not be this way sir david bell be lead labour ’s early year review to ensure that childcare be about life chance for child as well as work choice for parent up and down this country family be feed up with this government their broken promise and their incompetence it be time for a general election to end this tory shamble once and for all 
 i will try to pick out the question from the bluster 
 on the £ this be a specific issue that affect september onwards where we allocate to local authority week of funding because that be the period from september to march some then say that they pay week to their provider so we have that money in order that they can provide week of funding where that be what they do 
 on the funding rate we announce the funding rate for and year old in april last year and for year old in november.[official report   january vol c. 9mc give that local authority have to pass on of the money that we give they provider have a pretty good idea of what they will receive however while the vast majority of authority will confirm their rate in the come week a small number leave it until   march we be encourage they not to do that and to confirm their rate as early as possible in the same way as the other 
 the hon lady ask how many family would not be able to access the childcare offer as a result of those issue the answer be none as she know we have increase funding rate significantly neil leitch to whom she refer be in our stakeholder group and we value his input however i think it will be clear to people watch these exchange that while we get on with the big delivery of childcare ever the labour party have no plan no policy and no idea how to help family with childcare cost 
 the expansion of childcare be extremely welcome and i have every confidence that the minister and the excellent team at the department for education will deliver this current expansion on time and that the funding will reach all the family who need it to be fair however the minister be deal with a system that have become remarkably complicated over the last or year would he be interested in discuss with the chancellor the notion of roll up all the various funding stream that we provide for childcare and indeed for family support and instead of take money from people in taxis lose some of the administration and return it to they in the form of mandate childcare thus give every family with child a generous tax break to allow they to make choice for themselves 
 my right hon friend have write some article which i have read propose that very idea we think that our present system be the good way of achieve what we want to achieve but i be of course happy to continue my discussion with he 
 good quality childcare be a crucial economic infrastructure issue for parent now and the education of child in the future which be why we need it but the system be too complex and we can not access it in my constituency provider be collapse when will the government think about draw up a workforce plan to try to stabilise the system before add more and more complexity for parent 
 i be not sure what the hon lady mean when she say that people in bristol can not access the system but if she send i the detail i shall be happy at look at they because i have say ten of thousand of parent have already access it i should also point out that while there have be a fall in the number of provider there have be an increase in the number of both staff and place so we be confident that we will deliver the roll out as plan 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement and work parent across my constituency welcome this expansion and the big ever investment in childcare in england today however i receive a letter from victoria morris a very experienced childminder who have work in leigh on sea for more than year point out that someone who own a nursery can claim the funding for child to whom they be relate include their own child but that do not apply to childminder she simply ask whether the minister would consider lift that ban so that childminder be on the same footing as other childcare provider 
 the current legislation state that people can not access government money for look after their own child although it can happen in a large setting we have no plan to change that at present but i should be happy to have a discussion with my hon friend 
 we know of the challenge that many parent face in try to find an appropriate nursery for their child but it be even hard when a child have special educational need accord to message i have receive some nursery be refuse to take such child on can the minister say without equivocation that that be unlawful 
 the hon gentleman have make an important point and he be entirely right we have hear from great organisation such as dingley ’s promise that provider have not give place to child with special educational need and the team and i be look into that to ensure that it be not the case 
 parent ask for support with childcare and the treasury and the government have deliver it but the system do need to be simplify i have be follow the analysis of the code and receive the code by pregnant then screwed which announce today that a fix have be find and thank the department it would be helpful to hear a little more about that will my hon friend meet for instance the new deal for parents group which be look for long term simplification will he also tell we how he be work through the different local authority area to show that there will be place available now and also in september because so many parent be look forward to that 
 my hon friend have be campaign on this issue since she arrive in this place the tax free childcare code issue be a specific issue cause by parent need to reconfirm their eligibility every month to prove that they be still eligible if they do that quite late last year they be concerned that they might not be able to get the place they need in time for the   march   deadline as my hon friend say pregnant then screwed have fix that issue i would be happy to meet the group that she mention on the sufficiency of place we be in monthly contact with local authority to ensure that they have sufficient place and only a very small number be report any concern at this point 
 a report from the early education and childcare coalition last november find that only of nursery manager say they could offer the extended entitlement because of the crisis in recruitment in the sector and say they would limit the number of place they offer unless the government help with recruitment more than half of all nursery worker have say they be plan on leave the sector in the next month what will the minister do to address the crisis in recruitment and retention in the sector so that nursery can provide the extended entitlement that parent want 
 we have see a increase in the number of staff in compare with none the less part of the reason why this be a phase implementation   and expansion of childcare be to ensure that we have the number of staff we need and in a couple of week we will be launch a big recruitment campaign to get more people into the sector 
 will the minister name and shame those authority that be be dilatory in publish their rate 
 i reserve the right to do that but we hope that if we ring they up and ask they to publish with the threat of do that if they do not they will do so 
 the current system of childcare support be not work it problem be cause parent to be lock out of the system code be not work there be no timescale to sort problem there be no response to complaint and people be wait week for money to be pay to provider if the current system be not work how do the minister expect to reassure parent that the new system which will rely on the same code and system be go to work 
 i simply do not accept what the hon lady says—[interruption if she want to send i detail i will be happy to take they up with any local authority that be not do what it be ask to do on the particular issue with the roll out we have move quickly and provide solution for they 
 this be the big ever expansion of childcare and it will be transformational for many work parent so it be bind to be really complicated to implement the minister have just say that only a tiny number of local authority be report that they think they will not have sufficient place so do that mean that the vast majority of local authority say that they will have sufficient place what be he do to encourage more people to come into the profession and act as childminder 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the vast majority of local authority be already report that they will have the number of place that they need we be work with the small number that have challenge and we be confident that they will be in the right place by that point on her question about childminder of the thing we be do be introduce a brand new childminder grant scheme to encourage more childminder into the great early year career that be available 
 i hear the minister talk about the staffing for a new parent or carer hand over their young child to the staff in the sector be of the most scary thing those staff do fantastic work but be often pay low wage the women ’s budget group have estimate that there will need to be at least additional new early year staff to cope with the increase in entitlement in term of recruitment and retention in the sector will the minister outline when we can expect the long term workforce plan for the early year sector so that we can actually have the staff it be no good have this increase in entitlement if there be no staff to look after the child 
 the hon lady be right that we need more staff i think she refer to the estimate in time for september rather than for the part of the roll out in april which be part of the reason for the current recruitment campaign we be pleased to have already see a increase in the number of staff 
 i welcome the fact that the government be roll out the big ever investment in childcare in england will my hon friend outline how much the average work family will benefit from the extend childcare entitlement 
 my hon friend be right that it be the big expansion of childcare provision in history by the time the roll out be complete in september it will save the average family up to £ a year in childcare cost 
 many of we try to warn the government that this would be like help to buy push up demand without tackle supply number matter in this sector and it be day since the policy be announce and just day before it be due to be implement there have be separate question in this place about the staffing shortfall and none of they have be answer there be child chase every register place and only local authority have actually agree the rate it be little wonder that parent be frustrate will the minister set out here and now the staffing shortfall in term of deliver the year old offer in april will he tell we what it be and will he tell we when he expect to close it 
 as i have already say the roll out be base on 
 what be the number 
 the hon lady cite the figure for september not for april i be confident that in april she will see that we have the staff available for the roll out 
 i declare an interest as the father of wonderful child charlotte and persephone who go to nursery in this very place and will benefit from the new proposal 
 the uk have a decline birth rate on average child per woman and we clearly need more child time and again when survey woman who want more child say that they be not have more child because they can not afford it i thoroughly welcome the money that have be announce but what more be be do to support parent who say they want more child but can not afford to have they that could perhaps include look at the tax rate 
 i hope charlotte and persephone enjoy their nursery provision here which i be sure be among the of early year provider that be good or outstanding my hon friend be right that childcare be of the big financial challenge face family today which be why we be pleased to save they so much money i be happy to continue the conversation about what else he think should be do to support family 
 the shortfall in childcare provider be a serious issue for constituent in putney eastwood nursery school the last remain state maintain nursery in my constituency be under immediate threat of closure it provide training for childcare provider across the constituency as well as excellent early year education do the minister support state maintain nursery will he meet i to talk about the future of eastwood nursery school 
 we certainly support state maintain nursery which play a vital role in the sector i would be delighted to meet the hon lady to discuss that particular case 
 i praise the minister for be on top of his brief and for iron out some of the misunderstanding fly around today be it not the case that as other have say the challenge of roll out this offer sit within the broad context of the ongoing workforce challenge today i speak to a provider that have setting and be not able to fully staff a single of they i know the minister be do a lot of work on this but will he say a little more about how he plan to meet that workforce challenge with his recruitment drive 
 i thank my hon friend who have also do a lot to champion the sector and to raise awareness of the challenge it face he be right that we need to get more people into the workforce particularly for the september roll out that be what the recruitment campaign and the change we make to the early year foundation stage be all about we listen to provider on the flexibility that might make their life easy and deliver almost everything they ask for in the hope that it will help they with recruitment and retention 
 i recently visit the ryton willows montessori nursery in my constituency where its manager explain her concern about the impact of the change on she and about how she be go to make the sum add up financially and provide an excellent service we have hear that the final figure be not available when will they be available will the minister undertake to review the figure to see that they meet the need of the sector 
 we set our rate by conduct a survey of provider in order to understand the cost they face and set the rate accordingly.[official report   january vol c. 9mc last november we delay publish the rate a bit in order that we could provide more money to take account of the government ’s near increase in the national living wage we believe we be get they right in relation to what people be pay but if the hon lady have particular evidence she would like to send i i will happily look at it 
 last friday i visit the butterfly lodge nursery in blackpool to hear the concern of early year provider many of whom be at break point they welcome the uplift in funding from april but they be keen to emphasise that it do not even cover the significant increase in their cost such as for utility and the national living wage   what step be the government take to stabilise the sector and prevent early year provider from leave it altogether 
 i set out in my statement the additional money that we have give to the sector in the last financial year and this to help it to meet those cost pressure that be anchor to the survey of provider that i talk about.[official report   january vol c. 10mc again if the hon gentleman want to send i information datum or specific case study i will gladly have a look 
 i be glad the minister say that because i have a specific case from my constituency that i wish to raise it relate to the parent of a year old and a month old baby they be teacher in local secondary school and the mother be plan on return to work after maternity leave they have be really struggle with this issue of the portal when they would get the code through and so on i hope that what be announce will help they but will the minister confirm that if it turn out that it do not i will be able to write to he and get an immediate response 
 yes and i hope that the hon lady will do so we have take an extra cautious approach on this a particular group of parent be affect and rather than just write to they we have write to a much broad group of parent everybody whose reconfirmation window go from middle of february to the end of march so no parent should lose out as a result of this issue and she should get in touch with i immediately if those parent be encounter any problem 
 the business involve in provide childcare need to be able to plan ahead the minister may say everything will be fine in april there may be some problem down the road but we be confident we can iron they out but that really be not go to be get people to invest in lease from premise and all sort of thing that those who run childcare business be go to need to commit to so will he give we a bit more detail he say he be confident that this be go to meet the need but child be go to join the scheme accord to the government ’s own figure where be those childcare provider go to get the information they need in order to be confident that they can invest to go forward 
 we be in monthly contact with local authority and at least monthly contact with provider about this some local authority do take a long time to publish their rate we be look at that because we have provide the information and the funding that we need to and we do not think it be right for provider in the sector to be wait right up until   march   to get   that information so we be look at what we can do on that have say that some local authority have already confirm their rate and the vast majority will do so in the come week 
 the initiative be suppose to provide additional childcare place yet of provider withdraw from the market last year include in the sandymoor part of my constituency how do ministers square that circle give the funding pressure go forward 
 we be do all we can to help provider meet the funding pressure it be important for member of the house to understand that there be a difference between the fall in the number of provider which can be see in nationally publish datum and the increase in the number of staff and place i be confident that parent will be able to access these hour as entitle 
 every time the government have make an announcement to improve childcare i have welcome it i be pleased to serve on the bill committee for the childcare act but i question then exactly how the government be go to deliver the capacity need within the budget available the minister say that all would be well but he be wrong and it take year to build up capacity and the current offer be still not be universally deliver give the poor preparation for this late initiative how on earth can parent expect the government to deliver this time 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman have welcome our announcement on childcare although member on the opposition front bench have not do so we be in close contact with local authority and provider in order to deliver the initiative and parent will be able to get those hour for their year old in april 
 do the minister believe that part of the consideration on affordable childcare will take into account the need for nursery to be able to operate alongside the cost of living crisis can additional funding be find to meet that need not for the sake of the delivery of a promise but for the child who desperately need the care to enable their development and for the parent who simply can not afford to do it alone 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point about the increase cost pressure that everybody have to face that be why we give an additional £ in the last financial year and a furth £ in the current financial year to help meet those pressure base on the fact that we survey provider in order to understand exactly what they be pay for all the thing he outlines.[official report   january vol c. 10mc 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care to make a statement on the declaration of a national incident in response to the recent surge in measle case 
 i thank the hon lady for give i the chance to update the house on this important matter far to the write ministerial statement that we will publish later today 
 the uk health security agency announce last week that it have declare a national standard incident in response to an increase in confirm case of measle in order for our measle mump and rubella vaccine to work the world health organisation recommend at least coverage to maintain population coverage at the moment our mmr reach be for the dose at month and for the dose at year 
 this be not a new issue there have be a gradual decline in coverage over year because of a number of factor range from the wakefield generation when dr andrew wakefield publish his discredit paper on the risk of mmr through to covid when routine vaccination be miss and there have be a drop since then there have also be concern in particular community such as the jewish and muslim community about the type of vaccine use we have not be wait the nhs have carry out a catch up effort over the past month proactively contact parent and carer of unvaccinated child age and young and we have see a increase in vaccination compare to the previous year 
 however that be not enough nhs figure show that almost child under the age of be unprotected and at risk of catch this serious and preventable disease.[official report   may vol c. 16wc correction measles be so infectious that infected child in a classroom can infect up to other unvaccinated child make it of the most infectious disease worldwide while for most it will be a mild illness in child with measle will need to be admit to hospital for treatment put additional pressure on the nhs 
 i want to stress that this be not just a childhood disease for adult who have not be vaccinate it can be a serious and potentially life change event my message to mum and dad with child who be currently unvaccinate be to come forward we have a range of measure in place letter be go out to the parent of unvaccinated child across london and the midland 
 we have extra clinic be set up by gps pop up clinic in school and vaccine bus target community with low vaccination rate we have hold mp briefing session on and   january for the west midland and for london today we have send out information to mps so that they can help we get the message out to their constituent to come forward it be not too late there be no age limit anybody who have not have their vaccination can come forward the vaccine will   provide roughly protection and the will provide the message be to come forward and get vaccinate 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker 
 the declaration of a national incident due to the rise in measle case by the uk health security agency on friday be concern measle can be serious and it be extremely infectious with a reproduction rate time that of covid however it be also entirely preventable the minister be right to emphasise the importance of get vaccinate the mmr vaccine be safe effective and the good way to protect ourselves and our loved one against measle there be no age cut off for get an mmr vaccine there be alternative available for those who do not touch pork product once a person have have it the vaccine can provide protection within week i urge anyone watch this who have not be vaccinate to contact their gp 
 mr speaker we be in agreement that this issue be serious i thank the minister for outline some of the step that she be take however we should never have get to this point the uk be deem by the world health organisation to have eradicate measle just year ago since then mmr vaccination rate have plummet leave ten of thousand of child completely unprotected which mean that now in child be not protect with dos by the age of case have also rise consistently over the year and by in the past year alone so the warning sign could have be see from space what step be be take to get a grip on this crisis before it become a national outbreak how will the minister rectify her department ’s failure to maintain child vaccination rate for contagious disease be this not another instance of government complacency when it come to protect our child ’s health
