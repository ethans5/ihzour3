the secretary of state be ask 
 what his department ’s plan timetable be for when the independent commission on reconciliation and information recovery will be operational 
 what progress his department have make on implement the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 i start by welcome the return of the devolve institution to northern ireland follow the publication of the safeguard the union command paper early this month and the windsor framework which be agree exactly a year ago yesterday let i also take this opportunity to mention that the northern ireland human rights commission and the equality commission for northern ireland will celebrate their anniversary on friday 
 the government be do all that we can to support the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery in deliver effectively for victim and family significant progress have be make since the icrir be establish in december last year and i expect the commission ’s door to open on   may 
 in the light of this morning ’s high court ruling do the secretary of state still think that after   may   the citizen of northern ireland should be the only people in the uk deny the right to seek justice for crime commit during the trouble through civil case and inquest 
 mr justice colton hand down his judgment at this morning it be a very complex case i be tell that the judgment run to over page and i be yet to see it it will take some time to consider but we will consider mr justice colton ’s finding very carefully we remain committed to implement the legacy act 
 it be deeply concern that the government ’s own impose   may   deadline mean that inquest will be unable to conclude as they otherwise would we have hear report that there be only specialist in the ministry of defence deal with these inquiry and that possibly mod delay in provide material have cause additional hold up we really need to understand what the government be do to ensure that inquest can conclude by the government ’s self impose deadline 
 i humbly remind the hon lady that the original deadline before we table amendment to the act then a bill in the house of lords be   may so there have be an extra year the government continue to assist the northern ireland court in good faith on legacy matter there be no question of the government deliberately seek to frustrate inquest the act allow a coroner to request a review of a death by the independent commission lead by chief commissioner sir declan morgan if the inquest have not be conclude via the coronial process by   may 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the government ’s legacy act be oppose by victim group all the political party in northern ireland the northern ireland human rights commission and other this morning the belfast high court find that the act ’s immunity provision be not compliant with article and of the european convention on human right give that immunity have always be present as the central foundation of the legacy act what do minister intend to do about the judgment and how can the commission become operational when of its central power have just be strike down 
 as i say this be a very complex case the judgment run to over page which be be report on less than minute ago so it will take some time to consider but we remain committed to implement the legacy act include deliver the icrir 
 recognise that the issue raise in today ’s judgment will take some time to be conclusively determine by the high court assume that the government appeal do the secretary of state agree that it would be quite wrong to close the door on inquest and civil case from   may that will deny citizen in northern ireland right that citizen in the rest of the uk take for grant will he therefore extend the deadline not least to ensure that inquest that would otherwise be stop on   may   can continue so that a decision can be reach 
 the right hon gentleman be quite right that this be a complex case that be likely to head to further action in the high court but i want to consider the judgment carefully look at all page and take the legal advice that he would expect i to take in such circumstance we remain committed to implement the legacy act include deliver the icrir 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to safeguard northern ireland ’s place in the union 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to safeguard northern ireland ’s place in the union 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to safeguard northern ireland ’s place in the union 
 the government be fully commit to protect and uphold northern ireland ’s place in the union a commitment we reaffirm recently in the command paper safeguard the union that include proposal for new measure in domestic legislation to protect unfettered access to the uk internal market and to affirm northern ireland ’s constitutional position as set out in the belfast good friday agreement this government be convince that that be the good way we can safeguard northern ireland ’s place in the united kingdom 
 what action have my right hon friend take to ensure that no new regulatory border between great britain and northern ireland can emerge from future agreement with the european union 
 we have end the presumption of automatic alignment with eu law by make it clear that the very narrow set of good rule that apply in northern ireland be subject to the democratic oversight of stormont include the stormont brake once the brake be trigger for a rule or where an entirely new rule be bring forward it will be for the uk to determine at the joint ministerial committee whether that provision should apply in northern ireland here again the government have establish the protection available through statute we believe that there be very strong reason for say that we have end the presumption of automatic alignment 
 i congratulate my right hon friend and the minister of state on their very impressive achievement in restore the northern ireland executive do the secretary of state agree that good cross border transport link be vital to safeguard all part of our union in my border constituency of clwyd south iusb think of the electrification of the north wales main line which link to north west england and improve road link such as the propose pant llanymynech bypass between wales and north shropshire 
 i have to congratulate my hon friend on make some excellent constituency point as well as highlight the importance of good transport link across our union the need for those link be recognise in the safeguard the union command paper and more recently early this week when we talk about the reinvestment of money that would have be spend on the northern section of high speed into ensure good connection across our country those connection include the a75 which be a vital connection between scotland and northern ireland 
 the union be strong when people can see and feel its benefit to their daily life do my right hon friend agree that a prosperous northern ireland with a stable devolve government be the sure way to safeguard the union ’s integral place in the united kingdom 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i absolutely agree with his sentiment it be a real pleasure to see the devolved institution at stormont up and run you mr speaker have a new colleague there the former speaker be desperate to retire for year tribute be pay to speaker maskey at the time but speaker poots be now in place it have be wonderful too to see the new minister and deputy minister work together to achieve good solution on public service and a whole host of other thing for the people of northern ireland the union be well serve by devolved institution work i very much welcome everyone ’s commitment to that cause 
 this morning ’s high court ruling confirm what every fair observer know that the government ’s legacy legislation be not compatible with human right it put the need of perpetrator ahead of the need of victim and it be not support by any party in northern ireland or across the island of ireland the secretary of state can not truly believe that it serve the rule of law or our shared future in any constitutional arrangement when will the government repeal that completely unacceptable legislation 
 i thank the hon lady for her question but i be afraid that she will have to refer to the answer i give early the court judgment be hand down only early this morning it be a complex case and we have more than page of judgment to consider i do not even believe that the government kc have go through the ruling yet in any great detail we be not give any notice beforehand of what might be in it but obviously i pledge that we will consider mr justice colton ’s finding carefully as i will continue to say we remain committed to implement the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act include delivery of the icrir 
 the recent safeguard the union command paper claim to 
 copper fasten northern ireland ’s political and constitutional place in the union 
 yet the british irish agreement make it clear that the agree position be 
 for the people of the island of ireland alone by agreement between the part respectively and without external impediment to exercise their right of self determination 
 how do the secretary of state square that clear contradiction in the uk government ’s commitment to all the people of northern ireland 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question get the devolved institution in strand of the belfast good friday agreement running be of vital importance because it mean that the strand institution can work properly for everyone in all community and it also allow the strand institution to work in a well way because they can include   representative such as the minister and the deputy minister and body such as the british irish council so there be a whole host of thing involve the constitutional status of northern ireland obviously require the consent of a simple majority of its people all the provision of the belfast good friday agreement still stand 
 thing of great importance to this place be our education system include the trip that people make to parliament we want to safeguard the union so what step be be take to ensure that student in northern ireland have equal access to educational tour of westminster bear in mind that student in northern ireland should have the same access to they as those in england but that the cost of fly over can be prohibitive will consideration be give to additional funding to allow some sort of subsidisation 
 northern ireland be across the irish sea be in a geographic location that make travel difficult to other area of the united kingdom i understand the hon gentleman ’s keenness to help northern ireland student benefit from learn across the union we put in place a £ financial package for the incoming executive that help we to achieve some of those objective by provide support for northern ireland give its unique challenge however if he have individual case in mind i would be interested to hear about they and will consider what we might do in future 
 i call the leader of the dup 
 far to the question from my hon friend   the member for strangford jim shannon will the secretary of state join i in welcome the fact that the new uk east west council will have its meeting next month in belfast of its key objective be to encourage great educational co operation across the united kingdom as well as bind northern ireland more closely into the wide economy and the uk internal market 
 i be happy to join the right hon gentleman in welcome the new east west council and its situation and i also look forward to see the north south ministerial council functioning the uk east west council will bring together a wealth of experience and knowledge from representative of the united kingdom government the devolve administrations business and the culture sector and educational leader we be committed to get it work in march and do good thing 
 the secretary of state refer early to the financial package that the treasury have put in place to support our public service in northern ireland but our commitment on public sector pay mean that there remain a significant gap in the next financial year will he work with we to seek further support from the treasury so that we can ensure that the executive live within its budget and that we can pay our public sector worker a decent wage for the vital work they do 
 again i pay tribute to the right hon gentleman for all his work to ensure that the devolved institution the executive and stormont can come back together he have achieve an amazingly good historic piece of work it be good to see the executive back up and run make choice and opening negotiation with the union to get the public sector in northern ireland back on track on pay and work i believe that there be a meeting today between the finance minister and the chief secretary to the treasury i will always happily work with the right hon gentleman on all those agenda 
 what step his department be take to help grow the northern ireland economy 
 what step his department be take to help grow the northern ireland economy 
 what step his department be take to help grow the northern ireland economy 
 the government be commit to the economic growth of northern ireland work closely with other uk departments the newly form executive and ni business our plan include boost trade and investment build on the success of the northern ireland investment summit last year level up northern ireland ’s economy include through our city and growth deal worth £ and implement the key deliverable of the safeguard the union command paper only last night i attend retail ni ’s supplier showcase and i be very grateful to have make it back thing this morning 
 i thank the minister for that very full answer give that the rest of the united kingdom the internal market be the big market for northern ireland what role do he see for the new intertrade uk particularly with respect to trade between great britain and northern ireland 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about northern ireland ’s most important economic relationship be with great britain as set out in the command paper the government be work to establish intertrade uk fulfil our pledge to grow the economy by ensure that business large and small can maximise the full range of east west trading opportunity implement the windsor framework and the command paper be of course government priority and i be pleased that i be responsible for they we will update the house in great detail at an early opportunity 
 the safeguard the union command paper state that 
 there will be no check when good move within the uk internal market system save those conduct by uk authority as part of a risk base or intelligence lead approach 
 regulation of the windsor framework retail movement scheme regulations require official to check the id number on the seal of all retail consignment enter northern ireland and break   open to for visual inspection be my right hon friend now able to confirm when or if that regulation will be remove 
 i be most grateful to my hon friend for his insightful and well rehearse question well research question laughter perhaps i should not have get that early flight after all mr speaker 
 as we set out in the command paper as we transition to the uk internal market system we will provide clear legal direction to the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs and other uk government authority through our risk management approach to eliminate any physical check when good move within the uk internal market system except those conduct by uk authority and require as part of a risk base or intelligence lead approach to manage the risk of criminality abuse of the scheme smuggling and disease risk i recognise the importance of my hon friend ’s question and i will update the house on our plan in great detail at the early reasonable opportunity which i hope and intend will be before we break for the easter recess 
 it be good news that the executive be back up and run will my right hon friend ensure that the new executive take full advantage of all the devolve capability they have particularly on taxation to encourage the private sector to grow and thrive in northern ireland 
 i will certainly give the executive every support while of course respect the devolution settlement to give my hon friend example the reason i be in northern ireland last night with retail ni be to promote the department for business and trade ’s terrific offering in northern ireland which include a trade and investment hub that cover the uk export academy and the export support service there be now dbt export champion which include in person support if anyone wish to learn great detail i recommend that they go to the great.gov.uk website 
 will the minister liaise with the relevant departments in northern ireland to maximise the benefit of promote and develop the only enterprise zone in northern ireland which be in my constituency as be excellent broadband facility the good in these island that way we can promote our economy bring inward investment and create prosperity 
 the hon gentleman make a great case for his constituency and i would certainly like to see terrific level of investment into it however i would like we to go far i would like to see that investment zone reach right across the whole of northern ireland i hope and expect that together the uk government and the restore executive will make the most of that opportunity 
 why do the uk government think it be good thing for northern ireland to have access to part of the eu single market but not for other part of the united kingdom to have such access particularly those part of the united kingdom that vote to remain in the eu and the single market 
 i be most grateful to the hon member for his question but he will know thing the word access be somewhat contested i would encourage he to go and look at the figure for trade between the united kingdom and the eu and satisfy himself of the effect of our leave the european union secondly in all seriousness we should all reflect carefully on the status and circumstance not only of geography but of history of northern ireland it be because of the unique status of northern ireland that we have be able to agree unique arrangement and i do not imagine the european union would have agree those unique arrangement for any other territory 
 i call the shadow minister 
 accord to a northern ireland affairs committee report northern ireland receive proportionately less than scotland wales and england in the round of levelling up funding in the late round of funding in november not a penny be allocate to northern ireland and the government say this be because the executive be not sit be there good news for the people of northern ireland today now that power sharing have be restore will the secretary of state update the house on any discussion he have have about ensue that a fair share of levelling up funding go to northern ireland 
 the hon lady raise a very important point and i will be glad to continue such conversation with the executive as she know we have make available a generous package of £ overall we be have conversation on the detail of those area of funding that have be repurpose and those conversation will continue when we can update the house in fuller detail we will of course be glad to do so 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the propose east west business council 
 the government be work to establish an east west business council as set out in the command paper fulfil our pledge to establish a unique forum for key representative across the united kingdom from government business and the education sector to identify opportunity for deepen connection between northern ireland and the rest of the uk in important area such as trade transport education and culture i shall be in regular contact with other ministers across government to ensure the timely delivery of this commitment 
 i thank the minister for his answer the economic statistics centre of excellence have estimate that of northern irish freight export to england come through scotland while a considerable proportion of ni trade with britain be direct trade between the north of ireland and scotland give this what concrete role do he see or propose for the scottish government on the new east west council 
 of course the government of scotland have their right and be entitle to be part of these arrangement and we shall be respectful in engage with the scottish government to ensure they play a full part fully respect the devolution settlement 
 do my right hon friend agree that the northern ireland members of the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly include   the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey m. donaldson play a very important role in improve understanding between the eu and the uk about the way in which the trade and co operation agreement should work and in ease the way for a well relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 
 i do agree with my right hon and learn friend i pay tribute to he for the lead role he play in that forum and i be most grateful to he a large number of colleague whatever their view on exit the european union have put a great deal of effort into build up the bond of friendship that be so important as we go forward under the trade and co operation agreement i be most grateful to he for highlight the important work of that forum and i again pay tribute to he for his lead role 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the east west council as propose be something that i be personally very enthusiastic about because it potentially open up a space in which scotland and northern ireland can co operate along with other part of the uk on all that they have in common economically socially and culturally and that we will continue to have in common irrespective of whatever constitutional arrangement may be in place in future will the ministerial team at the northern ireland office agree to meet i so we can discuss how scotland could play a positive role in that and to get the engagement with other part right 
 yes of course we would be delighted to meet the hon member to discuss those matter 
 we now come to prime minister ’s question we be join in the gallery today by dr andreas norlén the speaker of the swedish parliament and his delegation 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday february 
 i know the thought of the whole house will be with the friend and family of lord cormack and ronnie campbell they be dedicate parliamentarian 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i will have further such meeting later today 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer i be certain that everyone in this chamber will agree whatever their political standpoint that we should be able to think speak and vote without fear or favour but today i need to ask about the painful subject of dental care in clacton which be in crisis our integrate care system have find the money and a private firm have find the student to massively increase dental appointment in my patch but paper pusher in nhs england keep cite spurious reason to prevent this groundbreaking initiative from be deploy do my right hon friend agree that be scandalous should be deal with and those people block it hold to account 
 our dentistry recovery plan will make dental service fast simple and fairer for patient include in clacton and will fund around more appointment the matter that my hon friend raise as he will know be a local matter so the integrate care board will determine whether it wish to support the pilot proposal in clacton but i know that the minister for public health my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom   have write to my hon friend about the proposal and i hope that her letter address his concern 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i join the prime minister in his remark about lord cormack and ronnie campbell 
 tory mp spend last week claim that britain be run by a shadowy cabal make up of activist the deep state and most chillingly of all the financial times at what point do his party give up on govern and become the political wing of the flat earth society 
 this be another week when the right hon and learn gentleman just snipe from the sideline because he have absolutely nothing he can say about what he will do we be get on with deliver on the people ’s priority the number of small boat be down by a nhs performance be improve inflation be continue to fall and while we be deliver a significant tax cut for million of work britons his incoherent energy plan would put taxis up for everyone across the country 
 the prime minister ’s predecessor   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss spend last week in america try to flog her new book in search of fame and wealth she have take to slag off—[interruption they make her prime minister now they can not bear talk about she in search of fame and wealth she have take to slag off and undermine britain at every opportunity she claim that as prime minister she be sabotage by the deep state she also remain silent as tommy robinson that right wing thug be describe as a hero why be the prime minister allow she to stand as a tory mp at the next election 
 i do not believe that a single member of this house support tommy robinson but if the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about former leader and predecessor the whole country know his record he sit there while antisemitism run rife in his party and he back not once but twice a   man who call hamas friend to their credit the shadow chancellor the shadow home secretary and indeed the shadow foreign secretary refuse to back the former labour leader but he do not because he be spineless hopeless and utterly shameless 
 i have change my party for the well the prime minister be be change by his party he be let the right hon member for south west norfolk stand because he be too weak to do anything about it it be the story of his leadership when the tories refuse to accept any blame for the ruin of the past year wonder who they think have be run the country all this time thankfully the former prime minister be on hand again to help it turn out that it be all the fault of the medium the corporate world and bizarrely the president of the united states 
 winston churchill once say 
 the price of greatness be responsibility 
 now the british public be not expect greatness from this prime minister just a bit of accountability do he not think it would be great if just for once the tories take some responsibility 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about leadership and about change but when i learn of something that i do not agree with i suspend of my mps straightaway when he learn of vile antisemitic remark make by a labour candidate what do he do he instruct his team to defend he he send a shadow cabinet minister to campaign for he and he personally back he for day that be the difference between we i act on my principle he have not get any 
 i can not believe the prime minister say that with a straight face the former prime minister continue on her american odyssey this journey into the wild west of her mind and claim that nigel farage be the man to restore the tory party will the prime minister confirm whether he too would welcome mr farage back into the tory fold 
 in our party we have a proud tradition of diversity and accept everyone from every background indeed it be a proud record that put labour to shame this be the party that deliver the jewish prime minister the female prime minister the black chancellor and the muslim home secretary and it be now lead by the british asian prime minister while it seem that the right hon and learn gentleman can only champion man from north london it be the conservatives who represent modern britain 
 so this diverse tory party do welcome nigel farage month ago the prime minister say that 
 the tory party be a broad church i welcome lot of people who want to subscribe to our ideal to our value 
 that be the same nigel farage who say he agree with the basic premise of enoch powell ’s river of blood speech and bemoan the influence of the jewish lobby be the prime minister simply too scar to stand up to the gaggle of tory mp who moonlight as gb news presenter or do he genuinely think that nigel farage share the ideal and value of the tory party 
 the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about value but tomorrow in rochdale the people will have a choice of former labour candidate of whom be antisemite the truth be his party be so mired in hate that despite ex labour candidate stand he can not back a single of they we expel antisemite he make they labour candidate 
 the truth be that these be no long the tories your parent vote for and the public can see it the prime minister have lose control of his party to the horde of redcoat and malcontent the tin foil hat brigade on his benches and the extremist who wreck the economy be all line up to undermine he humiliate he and eventually get rid of he when will he ever stand up to they and end the pathetic spectacle of a tory party that use to try to beat nigel farage now give up and dance to his tune instead 
 that be utterly shameless from someone who stand by while antisemitism run rife in his party oversee the appalling situation in rochdale and twice back   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn in the last few week we have see member of parliament ’s home surround their event disrupt and council meeting threaten just last week we see the very rule that govern this place abuse because of intimidation while the right hon and learn gentleman might want to bend to mob rule we will face down the extremist and stand up for british value 
 year ago last saturday russian force launch their heinous attack on ukraine the response of the british government and the british people have be magnificent i pay tribute to all those who have do so much not least in my own constituency of bracknell where ukrainian people have be so warmly welcome we must never bow to tyranny so could the prime minister please assure the house that our support for ukraine and all our nato ally will continue to be unwavere 
 i join my hon friend in thank people up and down the country include the people of bracknell for welcome ukrainian family into their home and community during my visit to ukraine in january i announce a major new package of support include £ of military assistance last week we announce new sanction that target individual and business that be sustain putin ’s illegal war machine our support to ukraine will never waver 
 i call the scottish national party leader 
 some people dead injure shelter in rafah live in feral condition in northern gaza and of course hostage still tragically hold by hamas the horror of those number demand that this house have its say just as it show that this house should demand an immediate ceasefire president biden have indicate that the ceasefire may take place from monday do the prime minister share his confidence 
 we have consistently call for an immediate humanitarian pause which would allow for the safe release of hostage include british national and more aid to gaza we welcome progress on a deal as the hon gentleman say there have be progress and we urge everyone on all side to seize the opportunity i have be clear that we must seize the momentum from this terrible tragedy to find a last resolution to this conflict that deliver on the promise of a state solution and ensure that israelis and palestinians can live in dignity and security 
 we be approach month since this conflict begin in that time this house have equivocate and on occasion at the united nations this government have abstain when they could have vote for a ceasefire abstentionism be not leadership should this matter now come before the united nations with a ceasefire potentially in sight will the prime minister use his government ’s vote to deliver that ceasefire 
 we support the united states draft resolution that be discuss with colleague at the united nations last week but just call for an immediate full ceasefire now which collapse back into fighting within day or week and do not include the release of hostage include british one be not in anyone ’s interest we must work towards a permanent ceasefire that start with an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostage out i agree about the suffering of the people in gaza in this country we should be proud of everything we be do to help they and to provide they with the lifesave aid they deserve 
 i be sure that we be all proud of our open government the availability of information and our open datum but with machine learning and artificial intelligence become more prevalent do the prime minister agree that now be the time to look at license this information where it be to be use for commercial gain and to inform intelligence that will disrupt society and our economy 
 i join my hon friend in his passion for ai like he i be proud of our record at the forefront of the ai revolution have create of the world ’s ai safety institute establish the state of ai report and host the world ’s ever global ai safety summit i will ensure that he meet the relevant minister to discuss his proposal to ensure that we can harness the opportunity of ai and protect ourselves against the risk that it pose 
 plaid cymru have sign full fact ’s pledge for an honest general election campaign of full fact ’s ask be to renounce deceptive campaigning tactic there be evidence of egregious mislead campaigning in wales and elsewhere by the conservatives in recent week we all have a responsibility to campaign honestly because the alternative be to be complicit in dismantle democracy therefore will the prime minister sign full fact ’s pledge for an honest election 
 i be pleased to be in wales just last week and these be the fact on the ground the labour run welsh nhs be perform the bad in the   united kingdom small welsh business include pub and restaurant be face a crippling rise in their business rate and welsh farmer be be decimate by the plan of the welsh labour government those be the fact in wales and we will continue to point they out at every opportunity 
 there be patient in carshalton and wallington face uncertainty after landlord pull out of discussion the day before their gp practice ’s lease expire and then issue notice that it be trespass the local integrate care board have issue a very weak statement and the local liberal democrat run council be refuse to meet the practice and i those patient be now unsure whether they will have a surgery to go to can the prime minister assure i that when such decision be take by landlord there be appropriate infrastructure in place to support nhs patient before they be cast out to try to find somewhere else to go 
 as my hon friend will know gp lease be commercial agreement between landlord and tenant but he be right that everything that can be do should be do to ensure that gp surgery do not have to close that be why in march last year we commission a review into legislation govern these lease the review will create a new framework that will make leasing to tenant such as gp surgery and other group easy and more accessible but i know that his local resident will want this to be sort as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the extra appointment that we be create so that people can get access to the primary care they need 
 of the few good thing to come out of wednesday ’s stramash last week be that the house unite around a call for an immediate ceasefire now i welcome that that be progress the prime minister be just give an opportunity by my hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn to commit to the uk ’s representative in the united nations and elsewhere articulate that position of this house if they be not go to do that what will he say to those of we who say this place really be just a sick pantomime 
 as i outline previously it be not right to call for an immediate ceasefire that would collapse instantly into more fighting and not do anything to get more aid into gaza to alleviate the suffering that people be experience or to make sure that we can safely remove hostage include british hostage that have be our consistent position we have be call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire which will provide the condition for a lasting and sustainable peace but just call for something that will collapse back into fighting be not in anyone ’s interest all our diplomatic effort at the united nations and elsewhere be target at bring that about i be pleased that in recent day progress have be make we should keep pressure on all party to come to a resolution

 the parent of a year old in the uk be currently spend more than £ a year on a full time nursery place last year the prime minister promise parent that in april there would be a new free childcare offer with only a month to go parent do not know whether they can access that offer because of staff shortage and the lack of childcare space will the parent to whom the prime minister make that promise be able to accept the offer that he talk about last year or be this another example of a broken tory promise 
 we be deliver on what we say which be hour of free childcare a week for work parent of child from when they be month old until they start school that be the large ever expansion of childcare in our country ’s history perhaps the hon lady might want to have a conversation with her welsh labour colleague who be give the funding to deliver childcare expansion in wales and what have they do they have pocket the money instead of match our plan to support parent in england 
 the notorious crossroad between ulley lane and treeton lane just outside aughton in my constituency be just of several major road safety and highway issue that have be ignore for decade by labour control rotherham council i will be present a petition to this place tell the council to end this chaotic mismanagement but may i also ask for the prime minister ’s support in urge both the labour council and the labour mayor to listen to resident and get the junction sort to stop the huge tailback save life get rother valley move and end this war against car in my constituency 
 my hon friend raise an important point and he be right to champion his constituent in this way when labour run thing it do just run they badly he can be assure that we have provide rotherham council with quarter of a pound for safety improvement to local road and we be continue to provide for his constituent with a further £ allocate to his local area in the round of the city region sustainable transport settlement    because of the decision that we make on hs2 community town and city across the north and the midland will receive billion of pound for transport project that will make a difference to he and his constituent far quick than anything else that be plan

 my constituent lee haywood in dalmarnock be on a communal heat network and have see both his standing charge and his energy bill absolutely soar the heat network market framework be introduce in but the minister in the lords say in a letter last week that his ambition be that price regulation will only start in spring be it this government ’s incompetence or ofgem ’s lack of power that be let down constituent who can not afford to put on their heating this winter 
 as the hon lady will know stand charge be a matter for the independent regulator ofgem which be currently look at all those thing as part of a consultation more generally it be this government who be provide considerable support to family across the country include in scotland with their energy bill i be sure she will join i in welcome the recent announcement about the fall in energy bill bring they back to level that we have not see in a long time on top of the cost of live support that the chancellor have provide so that everyone in our country get the help that they need 
 werrington fields be a much love open space cherish by local resident and use by the nearby school as play field shockingly peterborough city council propose to fence off almost the entire area reject a compromise that most resident and the school be happy with bizarrely the local council seek to blame the secretary of state for education myself and even the prime minister will my right hon friend get behind my campaign to save werrington fields and make it clear right here right now that this be a matter entirely for the local authority 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for champion his constituent on this matter as he know last year the education secretary rightly reject peterborough city council ’s application to change the play field land at ken stimson community school from educational land to public open space that decision ensure that child will have access to the open space that they deserve but i be tell by the department that the council can provide for some of that land to be fence and that the department would be comfortable with that provide that the overall site remain educational land that be something that i know he want to see and the department be ready to work with he to ensure that happen 
 after yesterday ’s revelation that nick read the post office ceo be under investigation follow an page report write by the former head of hr at the post office do the prime minister and the business secretary have confidence in nick read ’s leadership at the post office 
 it would clearly be inappropriate for i to comment on an investigation before it have be complete our focus remain work closely with the post office to ensure that it deliver justice for postmaster catch up in this historic scandal which be why we will imminently bring forward the legislation that we promise 
 a few year ago there be a proposal to build nearly house in a beautiful part of my constituency near the village of castor and ailsworth against the wish of local resident i work with the local community and together we be able to stop the development however effort be now be make to include this land in a revise peterborough local plan do the prime minister agree that it be very important that the voice of the local community be hear and that it be unacceptable that development can take place in   this circuitous way especially when other more   suitable land be available in and around the city of peterborough 
 my right hon friend raise an important issue and he be right to say that the local community should always have their voice hear it be important that council bring forward local plan but this must be do in close consultation with local community because their voice matter as i understand it the peterborough local plan be still under preparation and there be opportunity to provide comment on the draft plan so i commend he for continue to support his local community to ensure that their voice be hear 
 the prime minister talk about thing go backwards the uk be the only western g7 power in recession with consecutive quarter of no growth that be the bad since record begin in can the prime minister tell the business go bust the family struggle to pay their bill and the people be make homeless why this recession which have his name write all over it be a good thing for our country 
 the hon lady might want to check some of the fact that she just outline to the house they be not quite right perhaps she would like to explain to the country why her party be stick with a completely incoherent energy policy that will saddle work family with £ of high tax rise and high energy bill 
 since the prime minister have have our back in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke with record funding for our local transport over £ for stoke and staffordshire to repair pothole over £ to improve our bus network with cheap fare and new and extended route fund to upgrade kidsgrove and stoke on trent railway station and bring back the stoke to leek line and this week stoke on trent and staffordshire have see a tenfold increase in transport funding year in year out i know the opposition like to talk down stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke but be not it true that this prime minister and this conservative party be the only one with a plan to improve and well connect our community and fix our break road and pavement 
 as ever my hon friend be a fantastic champion for stoke on trent and he be right over the next several year his area will receive time as much as it currently do to invest in local transport scheme as a result of this government ’s decision on hs2 but he be also right to say that after year of be neglect by the party opposite it be this conservative government that be level up across the country and in stoke on trent champion by fantastic mp like he 
 the advent of the cromarty firth green freeport be most welcome what discussion have the prime minister have with the scottish government who will be responsible for ensure that there be a robust road network associate with the freeport and that there will be sufficient housing   for the influx of worker who we hope will contribute to our dream of the fabrication of offshore renewable structure 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s support for the freeport we be take advantage of our brexit opportunity to deliver freeport in scotland to attract job and investment in the industry of the future with regard to infrastructure investment not only do we provide the tax benefit for a freeport but £ of seed funding be available to the freeport in discussion with the government that can be use on local infrastructure improvement that make sense to develop the opportunity that the freeport provide 
 the aukus programme be not just a national endeavour design to keep our nation safe it be also an international partnership that speak about our ambitious work across the globe to pursue security and contain threat i want to personally thank the prime minister for his engagement with the team barrow initiative which be bring together senior civil servant my council bae systems and myself to drive this programme forward to make sure we can deliver those boat to time and to budget that mean improve and invest in the local area considerably with that in mind may i invite the prime minister to barrow to meet not just the fantastic people build the boat of the future but to see how the programme be go to uplift furness for the future 
 at a time of great instability around the world with the war in ukraine and in the red sea my hon friend be absolutely right to say that aukus be a game change defence and security partnership that will keep we safe and create thousand of job in the uk shipyard and the supply chain build on the investment in place such as barrow and derby he be a fantastic champion of what this industry mean in his area and the team barrow partnership be a crucial component of ensure that aukus be a success that be why the chancellor provide million of pound of funding for a delivery board for barrow we have recently discuss this at cabinet and i look forward to visit my hon friend and his community to see the progress for myself when my diary allow 
 last weekend the prime minister pose for photograph with a group that share extremist conspiracy theory on climate change and campaign against net do he share their view 
 that be no way to talk about the welsh farming community 
 my integrate care board tell i that only £ of the £ of capital that it receive annually be for primary care which seem an unfairly   small amount for our amazing family doctor and practice nurse who be after all the front door of   the nhs can our local general practitioner have a great share 
 i thank my hon friend for his excellent and continue campaign on health provision for his constituent on his specific point integrate care board have the power to increase their primary care annual capital management budget so long as they keep within the overall budget i understand that he meet a health minister early this week to discuss this far and i will make sure that his proposal be very carefully consider 
 the prime minister have just tell my right hon friend   the member for north durham mr jones   that as a minister it be inappropriate for he to comment on the bullying allegation at the post office yet he allow his business and trade secretary to comment freely loudly and often on twitter be he content with her activity and behaviour in this respect 
 the business and trade secretary set out her position explicitly and clearly in the house last week since then and despite some of the claim make by the party opposite the department ’s permanent secretary have completely refute the claim that be make yesterday the post office ’s current ceo and the department ’s director of business resilience also refute mr staunton ’s recollection 
 our focus and priority be deliver justice and compensation for those who suffer a historic injustice we be introduce legislation to right this wrong and we will make sure that everyone get the compensation they deserve 
 the £ allocate to cornwall from the share prosperity fund not only keep our promise to the cornish people to replace eu funding but have support dozen of business and funded project across the duchy however the current round of spf expire next year so can the prime minister confirm that his government will continue the share prosperity funding and will continue to provide the support that the cornish economy need 
 it be great to visit my hon friend in his constituency the other week to see the delight of cornwall i wish everyone a happy st piran ’s day for next week 
 cornwall have be award over £ through the uk share prosperity fund to deliver i think a different project across the county funding be confirm for this spending review period up to the end of march but as with all government funding decision regard the fund ’s future be a matter for the next spending review i assure my hon friend that we remain committed to an ambitious levelling up agenda in cornwall and across the country 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on what step be be take to restore public confidence in the post office board and governance follow evidence take at yesterday ’s business and trade committee 
 i sit there for hour listen to all the evidence that be give to the select committee yesterday several serious allegation have now be make against the government my department and its official by henry staunton his most recent revelation be that there be an ongoing hr investigation that involve both he and the post office ceo nick read i have to say as a former chair that i clearly   find that statement to the select committee highly unprofessional 
 the fact that nick read be be investigate be evidence that no be untouchable and the post office culture be change an investigation be of course not evidence that allegation be accurate while nick read have co operate fully mr staunton try to block the investigation look at his conduct it be this action as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint a new director to the board which lead the secretary of state to lose confidence in mr staunton as be say in the business and trade committee yesterday board member feel so strongly about mr staunton ’s conduct that they be go to resign it be right that the government decide to act 
 mr staunton have now make a series of allegation which we strongly reject he be use the nick read investigation to divert attention from the issue the select committee be discuss about his dismissal the allegation make be also prove to be a further distraction from the victim of this injustice his central allegation be that the government tell he to slow down compensation payment not a single person back he up on this claim my official be clear that they have never be instruct to do this post office executive be clear that such an instruction be never pass on to they we have provide a letter from june from my department to mr staunton tell he the opposite his only evidence be a note of a conversation which be clearly about operational financing of the post office business this be entirely different from compensation to sub- postmaster the permanent secretary write recently to give her truthful account of what happen we also release her office ’s contemporaneous note of that meeting 
 mr staunton allege that the secretary of state refuse to apologise to he after he learn of his dismissal from sky news this be not the case he claim there be pressure on nick read to send a letter to the justice secretary this be not the case he claim the secretary of state tell he that someone have get to take the rap for the horizon scandal and that be the reason for his dismissal this be not the case 
 the post office face unprecedented challenge and need to work at pace to deliver compensation to the thousand of postmaster who fall victim to a flawed   it system as well as continue the essential work to implement the necessary operational and cultural change need within the business as we have repeatedly say post office governance be a priority for the government that be why we act swiftly to remove a chair about whom there be serious concern and allegation and why we be work at pace to appoint an interim chair 
 we of course recognise the seriousness of an investigation into individual at the post office i also recognise parliamentary and public concern and the need to ensure there be confidence in the post office leadership i will therefore ask the post office to provide i with the finding of the investigation once it be complete however it be right to wait for this investigation to conclude before make any further judgment 
 i be really disappointed that the secretary of state herself be not here but i thank the minister   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   for everything he do for post office and be happy to work with he go forward 
 prominent horizon victim be still say financial redress be far too slow legal representative of victim say yesterday that redress scheme be not work for victim too much lawyering go on too much obfuscation lawyer say complete claim might have settle for less than they be entitle to and might need to be revisit neil hudgell suggest that august deadline target will not be meet and the current compensation impasse could continue for another or year 
 henry staunton ’s claim persist why have the prime minister refuse to back up the secretary of state refuse to repeat the claim that staunton lie this be the time we have be here to find out about the circumstance of mr staunton ’s departure the last time the secretary of state mention investigation into staunton but fail to reveal an page investigation into current ceo nick read with all we have see about the secretary of state ’s past assurance be undermine how can we trust her firm assurance now 
 do the secretary of state have faith in the post office board which be clearly in total disarray there be even claim that the chief executive officer nick read have threaten to resign over pay victim and the public have lose faith in the post office board and governance when more than £ of public money be be spend on financial redress the taxpayer ought to have confidence that cost will not be drive up far by mismanagement the evidence from yesterday ’s business and trade committee show that the public and victim have no reason to be confident as incompetence and obfuscation have mar the process until now sub postmaster say that redress scheme be not work victim agree the lawyer say that they be not work and the former chair of the post office say that they be not work why should we trust the government and what will the minister do to fix this 
 i should say that the secretary of state be abroad at a world trade organisation conference 
 i thank the hon lady once again from this dispatch box for all that she do on behalf of postmaster interestingly in his evidence yesterday mr staunton say that he have no concern over the speed of compensation which i think astound both the hon lady and i we have be fight for year to try to   improve the speed of compensation that be just more concern that people might have with mr staunton ’s evidence but it be clearly state in of his response 
 it be right that we constantly seek to improve the speed of compensation and to make sure that it be full and fair and be see to be so reason that i spend all day listen to the evidence yesterday be to make sure that we be do everything possible to accelerate compensation i hear some interesting conversation in the evidence session include idea from mr hudgell and other on how we can accelerate compensation which we be very keen to do 
 the hon lady will know that the late figure be quote yesterday at the select committee hearing on the group litigation order scheme for example full claim have be submit offer have be make and have be accept without reference to the independent panel which would tend to indicate that the offer be make be fair the hon lady will also recognise from the announcement that we make on monday during the statement that we have introduce a £ interim compensation figure for when people submit their full claim for the overturned conviction when an offer be make we will provide of that initial offer to claimant in the glo scheme 
 interestingly henry staunton seem to think that the big concern with the compensation scheme be around the overturned conviction he clearly say that yesterday when the hon lady and every member of this house know that we announce legislation on monday and previously that will overturn the conviction en masse which be unprecedented obviously that be the key to unlock compensation for all those reason we should not take henry staunton ’s evidence at face value 
 mr staunton continue to insist that he be tell to delay compensation for the postmaster but at the select committee hearing yesterday he say that unlike his own note the publish note of the meeting with sarah munby be not contemporaneous can the minister undertake to provide a contemporaneous note of that conversation to put this accusation to bed once and   for all 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for her work on the select committee it be thing to criticise minister but entirely another to sully the good name of a civil servant sarah munby have be very clear in her letter that she publish on this matter that mr staunton be wrong she have also be very clear that she have contemporaneous note of that meeting and we will be publish those note that will clarify and back up the fact that henry staunton be wrong and that sarah munby be right 
 i call the shadow minister 
 what we see yesterday be unedifye and at point a fiasco sub postmaster watch will have rightly be dismay and will have feel that if anything they be move far away from justice the ongoing conflict at the top of the post office and the failure of the   government to get a grip be help no and be only far erode trust in this process the secretary of state should reflect on how her approach to the news of recent week have only exacerbate that we and especially victim have all have enough of the he say she say do the minister now recognise that the good way to end this be by fully clarify what the government have or have not say through an independent cabinet office investigation 
 may i also pick up on some very worrying evidence give yesterday by carl creswell the director of business resilience in the department for business and trade when talk about the financial provision set aside for horizon compensation he say 
 i personally think we will end up spend more money on compensation overall than that £ figure which be model at an early stage 
 that be incredibly serious do the minister share that view hold by of his senior civil servant if so what conversation have he have with government colleague and will we see that reflect in next week ’s budget 
 will the minister clarify whether he or the secretary of state be aware that nick read be also under investigation as be allegedly state in the page document refer to by henry staunton in yesterday ’s select committee hearing in response to i during an urgent question on   january the minister say that henry staunton ’s sack be not due to a fall out but that it be 
 about very serious governance issue relate to the person who head the board of the organisation which be obviously confidential human resource issue ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 will the minister confirm whether he have sight of the confidential human resource report refer to in yesterday ’s select committee hearing if so why be he selective in his update to the house 
 finally it be very important to make sure that we restore trust by urgently bring forward legislation i hope that unlike yesterday ’s unseemly event our focus can return to make sure that we exonerate the sub postmaster and deliver the recompense that they rightly deserve 
 when the hon lady say that i be selective about what i say be she accuse i of be economical with the truth if so i would take exception to that it would be absolutely wrong for anybody in this house to disclose information about an investigation that have not conclude and where the presumption of innocence must apply for the individual concern if she think i should come to this house to talk about those kind of sensitive confidential matter she do not understand how the corporate world work 
 rise 
 i will not give way as i be answer the hon lady ’s question 
 this be not a debate 
 i do find what happen yesterday unedifying but that be about person everybody else who give evidence yesterday be clear that there be no sense ever of try to slow down compensation neither do i think the hon lady be right to say that postmaster be far away from get compensation   it be quite the opposite to imply that and so raise question about the compensation scheme could lead to people not come forward we welcome the fact that more people have come forward since the itv series people be close to compensation not far away and the action we be take through the compensation advisory board the overturning of conviction the horizon shortfall scheme which be nearly complete and the glo scheme be all move on if she want to end the he say she say perhaps she should end it because we want to move on and pay compensation 
 as for the figure of £ be the hon lady say it be serious if we have no cap on compensation i do not think that be serious at all of course we have no cap on compensation the £ be a maximum budget but if that need to be increase it should be if she be say that we should not increase it if people deserve more she should put that on the record it would be an entirely irresponsible thing to do every time i have deal with this matter over the dispatch box with shadow ministers it have be constructive and collaborative and i resent the tone she have take in this case 
 let i say in fairness to the minister that he have come here on more occasion than anybody else i have know he have absolutely ensure that the house have be keep inform he go without question on this 
 i commend the minister not only for the consistent and compassionate approach he have take to this matter but for his attendance at yesterday ’s session it last for hour and he be there for the great part of it he be right to say that much of what we hear yesterday be a real distraction from the key objective of the government and the committee of make sure there be speedy compensation for our postmaster it be clear that the former chairman and possibly the chief executive exhibit limitation in their role and be perhaps unsuitable for the role to which they be appoint so be there any broad lesson we might deduce on how we go about recruitment for publicly own organisation such as the post office 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his work on the select committee he be a doughty champion in this area and many other relate to the committee ’s work there be some lesson we need to learn the post office certainly require the right kind of skill and the right kind of person to turn it around that be clearly a work in progress and i do not think people will be confident that that be happen until it have actually happen word be no long enough we need action be it on the turnaround of the post office or on the compensation scheme 
 i call the chairman of the select committee 
 i be grateful to the minister for join we for most of the hour of hearing yesterday but he will know as well as i do that what we see yesterday be complete chaos at the top of the post office when what we need be a clarity of purpose about pay redress fast and fairly not a single witness yesterday say that    they be satisfied with the speed of any of the process in fact the lawyer for the claimant say that it may now take to year in order to complete the payment of redress and we hear evidence of offer be make that be frankly insultingly low that be true across each of the scheme 
 most worryingly we hear that the post office chief executive have not have regularly meeting with the secretary of state or receive a clear write instruction to accelerate every of the scheme there be no deadline and no target and there be no incentive to get the redress scheme do and dust that be not good enough will the minister again reflect when he bring his bill before the house on the need to eliminate the post office from this process to the maximum possible extent and ensure that there be a legally binding set of timescale under which claim be give the information they need and process with offer make and offer settle i say that because we can not go on like this 
 i do think the chaos be cause by individual i sit through the whole session for the bit i be not in the room with the right hon gentleman i be watch on television it be right for people to be able to say that they be not satisfied with the speed of compensation i have say that time and time again from this dispatch box and we be keen to accelerate the process and make sure it be fast and fair 
 we be aware of the recommendation from   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   on an appeal mechanism for some of the scheme where people feel the compensation be too low we be look and will continue to look at that every compensation scheme i have deal with such as the royal bank of scotland global restructuring group scheme and the lloyds hbos scheme have be too slow because of some of the complexity involve we hear some good suggestion yesterday about how we might remove some of that complexity which i be very keen to do we hear some positive remark from the individual concern for example from some of the solicitor and from the post office on the fix sum award the £ for the overturned conviction and the £ for the glo scheme we hear how that be reduce the amount of disclosure that be require that be of the limit factor this should mean that the timescale that some people put on the table of to year should be rapidly reduce and i be very keen to build on that work 
 as the ceo confirm to   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne   yesterday i meet he every month and we speak about the need to accelerate compensation every single time we have target for when to pay the compensation by august for glo case and for all case ideally by the end of the year as we hear yesterday new claimant have come forward since the itv series which make it difficult to put deadline on payment i be aware that the right hon gentleman want a legally bind target i be happy to discuss that with he but we have just remove legally bind target because not everything within the process be within our gift 
 i know that my hon friend have a passion to get this right and to right the wrong of the past do he agree that we must do all   that we can to ensure that sub postmaster who be victim of the awful horizon scandal be exonerated and compensate fully fairly and with haste 
 i thank my hon friend for his work on this issue as of my predecessor i know that he be as keen as i be to ensure that full and fair compensation be pay to all individual as i say there be no limit to the amount of compensation that we will set aside to ensure that people be compensate properly for this horrendous scandal 
 in the week that we hear that more than postmaster whose life and reputation be damage by post office ltd die before they could get justice yesterday we find another layer of post office ltd ’s organisational dysfunction on   february the secretary of state inform the house of bully accusation against mr staunton only for we to find out yesterday that those accusation relate to another individual entirely could i ask the minister for whom i have the great respect not just for the manner in which he go about his business with regard to the horizon scandal whether the secretary of state mislead the house by tell member that mr staunton be under wide investigation for bullying secondly will the minister now respond positively to request from the scottish government and the northern irish executive to reconsider introduce legislation that could lead to a swift uk wide exoneration for the postmaster affect 
 to be clear we terminate mr staunton ’s role as chair of the post office not because of bully accusation there be an page report which he refer to yesterday and which i have not read he freely admit in yesterday ’s evidence session that he be name in that report to what extent i do not—[interruption well that be what mr staunton say he say that it be to a very minor extent i do not know that i do not think the hon gentleman know that and i think we should wait for the investigation to conclude before we make a judgment on that the point be not about the allegation itself the point be that as mr staunton admit yesterday he interfere with the investigation that be unacceptable and if we have not act in the way that we do i think that the hon gentleman and other would be call we to account for why we do not act when somebody have try to suspend or interfere with an investigation into his own conduct 
 i be aware of the scottish and northern irish government position on legislation of course we will continue to discuss that with they there be some separate devolve issue around the judicial system in scotland and northern ireland that be the reason we have do it differently we be happy to continue our dialogue on it 
 from my time as a parliamentary private secretary in the department i know the determination of the minister and the secretary of state to get compensation to these wrong postmaster as quickly as possible in yesterday ’s select committee session mr staunton speak about   lobby for a pay rise for mr read which i know must have be quite gall to many of the sub postmaster the minister reportedly refuse to grant that pay rise what sort of pay rise do mr staunton think would be a fair equitable agreement at that time 
 i think on occasion mr staunton lobby for a pay increase for mr read he seek to double the overall package of mr read on those occasion 
 yesterday ’s committee meeting be bizarre in many way it be hour long and as happen only rarely the people in front of the inquiry have to swear on the holy bible that be how bad it be the recently dismiss former chairman reveal a number of thing that be quite alarming he reveal that the current chief executive be under investigation perhaps the minister can explain why we be not aware of that secondly he reveal that the current chief executive have threaten to resign on more than occasion not because of the lack of progress on any financial redress for postmaster and postmistress but because he say his wage be too low the chief executive also say that he be proud that he have a hardship fund for worker in the post office can the minister clarify whether there have be an approach by anyone on behalf of the current chief executive for a pay rise and what the response be 
 may i correct the record in response to the chair of the business and trade committee   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne i say that the fix sum award be £ it be £ 
 it would be wrong to disclose an investigation into somebody ’s conduct before that investigation have conclude it would be extraordinary to do that in any work context be it in the public or private sector i be happy to have a conversation with   the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery   about the hardship fund if he be talk about the post office pay salary to postmaster most postmaster be self employ not pay a salary directly and have a number of different stream of income into their business these be business in their own right of course but there be a hardship fund for certain postmaster in certain situation 
 i echo the comment about the minister and his assiduous work on this issue both as a back bencher and now as the minister do he agree that perhaps it be necessary to look at how many people be work on the compensation scheme on the post office ’s side i have raise the matter with he before a lot of it be expert work but if anything can be do to build the resource that would be helpful particularly for my constituent whom we have discuss before on disciplinary and grievance procedure be it not normal that they be private until the point when a decision be make 
 on the last point my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right he clearly understand these situation very well they should of course be keep confidential which be why it be highly unprofessional of mr staunton to say what he say yesterday on my right hon and learn friend ’s point i can not remember what it be now 
 resource get more lawyer in 
 we be absolutely committed to ensure that we have the resource available to settle compensation claim quickly certainly a file note that i take away from yesterday ’s session be about the number of individual look after compensation from addleshaw goddard ’s end although it be turn around the offer increasingly quickly response to full claim now happen within day in of case there have be an improvement we be keen to ensure that every part of the process have the resource it need to pay the compensation fairly and quickly 
 surely what we see yesterday be a glimpse of senior management in the post office who be now completely dysfunctional as such it be difficult to see how anyone can have confidence in their administration of the various compensation scheme would it not be a sensible step to restore confidence in that most important national institution the post office to take all role for they out of the administration of the compensation scheme and appoint an independent commissioner nothing start to get well for the post office until the scheme be successfully deliver and wound up 
 i think what we actually hear and see be a dysfunctional former chair of the post office that be what we see interestingly to the right hon gentleman ’s point about compensation scheme the former chair say at point during his evidence that he have no concern about the speed of delivery of the hss which be extraordinary because i have many concern about it 
 i hear loud and clear call from across the house about the role that the post office be play in compensation scheme these be sensitive matter because people in the post office be employ to manage and administer the compensation scheme i hear the point make by   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   loud and clear we be look at it but i reassure he that all scheme have independence in they an independent panel in the hss an independent panel and a reviewer sir ross cranston on the glo scheme and the independence on the overturned conviction in sir gary hickinbottom both latter people be retire high court judge which should give claimant and the right hon gentleman i hope some confidence that the scheme will operate properly 
 my hon friend the minister have refer to mr staunton who it seem have serious character defect how be he ever appoint in the place and who provide the character reference and oversaw that appointment process may we have an inquiry into that 
 thankfully not i i have nothing against mr staunton personally he have a strong track record as the chair of various large organisation as   he say yesterday i think we would all agree that the post office be a specific organisation with specific challenge yesterday ’s evidence from ben tidswell the senior independent director be interesting he feel that mr staunton ’s behaviour change in november last year and become far more erratic”—his word i do   not know the reason for that specifically although    mr tidswell suggest some yesterday whatever the reason mr staunton ’s recent conduct be not consistent with remain chair of the post office that be why we decide to act 
 i thank the minister for his work in this area he have be assiduous in his attention to detail i can not say the same of the secretary of state nevertheless yesterday be unedifying and we be sick to death of the he say she say business we be not interested except that witness yesterday take the oath and speak to the same issue as to whether mr read have ever tender his resignation or threaten to it be totally conflicting evidence from the people they both can not be right so i suggest that might have be a little economical with the truth from dr neil hudgell though the message come loud and clear these scheme be way too over engineer and far too bureaucratic and that have lead to the delay in get the money out of the door i have to correct the minister only of the fund be out of the door as yet we have to speed it up 
 finally i ask he to take on board the word of the predecessor select committee the business energy and industrial strategy committee in february which say that the good way through this be to remove the post office from the system now it may be too late to do that but my goodness be not the committee right to say that can we find way to relegate the role of the post office because that be the only way we will get justice for postmaster ultimately that be what this be about get they compensate 
 i totally agree with the hon gentleman ’s final point and a number of the point he make it be fair to say that on the compensation scheme we could use the old phrase if you be go there you would not start from here i think that sir wyn williams have say that but the good way now be to say when you ’re go through hell keep go we have to improve the scheme we have get the hon gentleman make an interesting point about the post office and he will have hear what i say early i think the fix sum award do take the post office out of the scheme completely because no disclosure be require for they 
 on tender resignation again i think it be extraordinary that a chair would disclose confidential and private conversation that he have have with the chief executive i have to say for the record that mr read have never tender his resignation to i or to the secretary of state other would be well than i to comment on the nature of those conversation but i do not think that it be right for mr staunton to comment at all 
 i assure the hon gentleman that the secretary of state have give i support in everything i have do in try to address these matter i accept what neil hudgell say i speak to he afterwards and we have speak before about the scheme be over engineer and he suggest some way to try to accelerate compensation we be of course look at those to see what the good way be to ensure that they be not over engineer but deliver rapid and fair outcome as quickly as possible 
 my primary interest be in compensation payment be make expeditiously across the entire united kingdom and in northern ireland in particular where i have be lobby directly   by a number of the sub postmaster who have be treat so vilely after the statement of   january i ask whether the minister would ensure that no delay would be allow whatever and he affirm from the dispatch box that that be exactly the government ’s intention will he reaffirm that no delay will be allow irrespective of the devolution settlement in northern ireland no devolved minister or devolved court be involve at that time will he reaffirm that the payment will be make and that our sub postmaster will not have to wait a day long than anyone else 
 i will be very pleased to ensure that that happen i meet the northern ireland justice minister virtually a few day ago to discuss these matter i know that the northern ireland administration ’s preference be for uk wide legislation we do not think that be the right approach but we will continue to work with the administration to ensure that they can deliver the right legislation or process to make sure that the compensation be pay clearly once conviction be overturn anywhere in the united kingdom people enter exactly the same compensation scheme they can get rapid compensation through the fix sum award of £ or go through the full assessment process we be determined to make the process quick easy and fair i be happy to work with the hon gentleman to ensure that that be the case 
 i thank the minister for his work on the horizon scandal and for answer my letter concern a constituent in that answer he confirm that former post office clerk and those work for a franchise who lose money job and reputation through the horizon scandal be not eligible for compensation under the current scheme will he look into way to include they in a compensation scheme 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for represent her constituent so effectively i be keen to have continue conversation with she all the scheme that have be establish thus far require a contractual relationship between the post office and the individual and i know that be not the case for her constituent a number of member of this house have address the issue and we will continue to look at it 
 whether we be talk about my constituent roger a former postmaster whose case certainly need review constituent in community such as clarkston and neilston who have experience the most recent post office closure in east renfrewshire or the brilliant postmaster operate locally none of they deserve this mess this be turn into a regrettable circus to all look in from the outside what assurance can the minister give i today that that will not be allow to divert or distract from a genuine focus on the swift possible resolution and on deliver a sustainable future for the post office 
 i thank the hon lady for make that point and for represent her constituent so well yes absolutely we understand that this be distract or could distract from work to ensure not just that we   make right the wrong of the past but that the post office have a strong future as she put it i totally agree we think that the post office do have a strong future revenue stream have be affect by change in how and where people acquire certain thing or access certain service but the banking framework we encourage the post office to be more ambitious in its negotiation with the bank on the remuneration that flow from the framework to postmaster and the parcel hub be an opportunity for the future we believe that the post office have a strong brand and strong future we be keen to support its effort to ensure that the future be bright for all postmaster 
 i declare my interest as a member of the horizon advisory board welcome back to the minister he should bring in his sleep bag he be here that often i be at the hour marathon yesterday and i be totally unconvinced by henry staunton ’s accusation and his allegation about delay compensation like   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope i wonder why mr staunton be appoint in the place to any board for that matter however to come to the point mr staunton do raise the point that the chief executive be under investigation follow an page report i accept that the minister can not talk about that individual that would be wrong but he know that the culture at the post office be rotten and it be important that the cloud be lift quickly when the secretary of state come to the house on   february do she and the minister know that nick read be under investigation be it true that the former hr director who write that report have leave the post office with a settlement and do that settlement include a non disclosure agreement 
 i be very happy to come to the dispatch box any time i be require to or feel that there be a need to which as the right hon gentleman say be quite often at the moment 
 i be aware of the investigation relate to mr read and mr staunton that be not the reason why the secretary of state decide to part company with the chair that be about interfere with the investigation the right hon gentleman ask about the hr director i do not know about those matter but i be happy to look into they and come back to he 
 i be sure that the minister will agree that everything we be see and hear about the post office inquiry be far undermine the confidence of those who be affect by the horizon scandal as the minister say more people have come forward they have no more confidence than anyone else in the governance of the post office of they a constituent of mine have be with the post office for almost year and be about to be offer redundancy she be ask to take over a sub post office for month to make up the year during those month she become embroil in the horizon scandal she be not charge because her post office manager plead on her behalf but she lose her redundancy and she be now completely confused about where she stand and have no faith in the governance to fix the problem be the minister prepare to meet i to discuss that case so that i can assure my constituent that it be be deal with
