 our white paper set out how we will regulate ai through a flexible framework underpin by principle this proportionate and adaptable approach have be welcome by british business it include new monitoring function allow we to update our approach in response to a rapidly evolve technology the government will come back with proposal in the autumn follow the white paper consultation 
 ai have be use by public authority in a wide range of context that affect individual right from facial recognition technology use by police to the system use by the department for work and pensions to investigate benefit claimant do the secretary of state agree that public trust in the state of ai be essential and that any change to the law will require public support and therefore great consultation to ensure that that trust be not undermine 
 the hon gentleman make a thoughtful point he be right that we need a comprehensive public debate on many of these point he name some risk that concern he i would marry those with consideration about opportunity for example my colleague in the department for work and pensions be also look at how the technology can help with job matching and ensure that people have information about the job market i look forward to further conversation as he say as we go forward with this critical technology

 the short answer be yes that be because the legislation that the hon lady mention focus on do that in addition in our white paper we set out the principle on which we intend to take advantage of ai which ensure that we have safety transparency explainability fairness accountability and governance and contestability and redress those be all vital as i know she will agree and there be much work ahead   of we 
 i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on her sure footed discharge of her responsibility over the past few week which i think end today 
 in the white paper there be a commitment that 
 when parliamentary time allow we will strengthen and clarify regulator mandate by introduce a new duty require they to have due regard to the principle 
 of the white paper give the blistering pace of ai deployment and the fact that the forthcoming king ’s speech will be the last opportunity until will the government confirm that they will bring forward that legislation in the next session

 i pay tribute to my right hon friend ’s leadership in this policy area the conference in the autumn will give the government an opportunity to lay out their plan for work with international partner do she agree that ai can not be block or stop and therefore an open pragmatic approach need to be show to harness the benefit of ai for the economy and society in general 
 my right hon friend be correct that be what we have lay out in our approach so far as the prime minister say we intend to lead overseas and domestically lead the charge of that opportunity in our public service and ensure that our pro innovation approach enable the benefit of this technology to be capture soon across the economy 
 be my right hon friend reassure by the comment make by nick clegg this morning while represent meta that ai at present be not capable of individual thought as such but go through a massive trawl very quickly of exist datum 
 we be draw on the benefit of a range of expert in our work in particular i thank ian hogarth and those who have step up to form our foundation models taskforce which be help we by look extremely closely at the safety requirement for those model at the very frontier there will be more update on that work as time go on 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state will surely have read the many report of bad actor use ai technology to create voice clone and ultimately scam victim out of money over the phone for as little as 76p a month a subscription to of those website can be your mr speaker computer security company mcafee recently find that in people have experience a voice scam or know someone who have what exactly be the secretary of state do right now to prevent and ultimately protect people from those voice scam and deepfake 
 the shadow minister raise a good point which we should all examine we have the correct answer through the approach we have set out in our white paper use our world class regulator the approach we be work on in this house and the other place on the online safety bill and exist crime and offence right now my official be work with ofcom to ensure it be ready for the duty that will come to it   through the online safety bill and that it have the tool to ensure that scam fraud and other offence be properly address 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the secretary of state say that my colleague have make thoughtful point about human right concern control of personal datum and public trust but we need actual action and commitment from the government in contrast the eu be move to become the regulator in the world to legislate for a specific ai act to ensure that ai work for people as well as business and government will she finally commit to the uk follow suit and legislate for ai to ensure that the uk do not become a haven for the bad possible application of what should be beneficial technology 
 the hon gentleman be tell the wrong story the uk government be act comprehensively the framework we set out in our white paper apply across the uk the work we be set out with our global summit lead the way internationally that approach be proportionate and flexible and have be welcome by business across the uk in addition the principle i have already name and the work of my colleague across government on human right and other aspect ensure that our citizen can enjoy the safe and responsible use of this technology i look forward to work with anyone in this house who have a thoughtful approach to take to that 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of uk research and innovation funding for decarbon isation technology 
 we can all be proud that this country be lead the global charge on net as part of our historic uplift in r&d expenditure to £ a year—£52 over the consolidated spending review period uk research and innovation be invest in £ annually on research and innovation in net and £ through the industrial decarbon isation fund i be delighted that scotland be in the vanguard with more than project fund in receipt of £ the faraday battery challenge investment of £ appear to be work with the good news today of tata ’s multibillion investment in a £ gigafactory 
 i be delighted to hear the minister acknowledge that scotland be in the vanguard of research in this area the industrial decarbonisation research and innovation centre at heriot watt university in my constituency have become a focal point of collaboration and innovation for uk industrial cluster but the excellent progress that it be make be at risk owe to a funding gap will the minister meet i to discuss the vital work be do at heriot watt university and how the government can support it well in its effort to help they to reach their industrial decarbonisation target 
 brevity mr speaker yes with pleasure 
 if she will take step to improve rural connectivity in a delyn constituency b north wales and c wale 
 under project gigabit we be launch procurement across wales and the rest of the uk to deliver gigabit capable broadband to rural and remote premise not include in supplier commercial plan we be plan to launch a regional procurement for north wales by the end of the year which will include premise in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 the town of flint and holywell in my constituency have and full fibre connectivity respectively but the exchange in mold have only and northop only the mold exchange in particular serve many of the small village and also the farming community which be vital to my constituency what more can the minister do to improve connectivity in these rural area so that the vital farming sector do not grind to a halt in place such as delyn 
 my hon friend be right to stress the importance of digital connectivity to rural community and business we be press ahead apace with project gigabit and have appoint our hon friend   the member for barrow and furness simon fell   as rural connectivity champion at present more than of premise in delyn have access to superfast broadband while have a gigabit capable network and our project gigabit procurement be intend to ensure that community such as northop and mold do not miss out on gigabit capable connection 
 what recent progress she have make on secure the uk ’s association with horizon europe 
 what recent progress she have make on secure the uk ’s association with horizon europe 
 what her plan timescale be for negotiate the uk ’s association to horizon europe 
 we be move forward with discussion on the uk ’s involvement in horizon europe and we hope they will be successful association be our preference the talk be continue constructively but we have not yet agree a deal we want to reach a resolution as quickly as possible to give the industry certainty we have also set out our bold alternative pioneer which we be ready to implement if necessary 
 owe to the government ’s delay in associate with horizon europe the uk have lose out on host nearly high end european research council grant furthermore nearly grant winner have leave the country altogether scientist include brian cox and sir paul nurse be warn that the government ’s failure to act be damage britain ’s science base be the secretary of state concerned about these failing 
 unfortunately it be the european union that have delay for more than year and that have cause serious and lasting damage to the uk ’s participation what we need to do be ensure that we can get the right deal for uk researcher uk business and uk taxpayer that that be what we be work to do and we be confident that the talk be proceed constructively it be much more important to get the right deal than to get a fast deal 
 the government make a manifesto promise to associate with horizon europe but it be now week since they take our country out of the world ’s big science fund it be shocking but not surprising that they have break yet another promise government inaction have seriously damage our international science pedigree how much long will our world lead scientist researcher and university who have suffer so much already be force to wait because this government can not keep their promise 
 we have continue to support the sector with more than £ of the horizon guarantee we have do that to ensure that there be no loss of funding for the uk science sector i think it far more important to speak directly to researcher business and taxpayer about our commitment to get the right deal than to engage in party politic here 
 we in bath have fantastic university the university of bath and bath spa university their leader continue to worry about lose talent from europe and the government have worsen the position by propose a increase in visa fee will the secretary of state explain what that increase will mean for uk science and how it accord with the government ’s state ambition to bring the good and brightest to this country 
 we continue to run a range of successful talent programme that bring the good and the bright to university and indeed to those in the hon lady ’s constituency i welcome she represent they here today the point be that we have to get the right deal on horizon as i have lay out and we also have to strike a balance with the need of policy across government that be what she have hear from i and other ministers at this dispatch box and that be how we will ensure that we get the right deal for britain both in term of talent and of science programme 
 do my right hon friend agree that it be very much in europe ’s interest for we to be part of the horizon programme because we have some of the strong academic institution in europe and in a way it undermine the science base of europe if we be not in there do she also recognise that although there be great enthusiasm at the recent meeting of the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly for we to join again there be also a feeling that it could surely be do a little more quickly 
 i welcome my right hon and learn friend ’s insight into this issue as i have already say we be work consistently and steadily to get the right deal for uk science by which we mean british researcher as well as taxpayer and business that be what we be do the talk be proceed and i look forward to the house be able to have an update very soon 
 i would like to put on record my respect for the secretary of state and her excellent stewardship of her portfolio 
 i would like we to join horizon europe but be it not right that we should get the right deal for our uk scientist our uk business and our uk taxpayer and that any commentary before a deal be do will only undermine our science industry and not be helpful in the slight 
 that be exactly right and it be right for reason the be that billion of pound of taxpayer money be at stake and we need to be responsible steward of that money that be why we be focus on get the right deal the point be that my department exist to forward and far the frontier of science in this country and to make sure that we stay a science and technology superpower interruption 
 order we be in the middle of answer to a question i call vicky ford 
 teledyne e2v be the world leader in space imaging it provide the eye to nasa the european space programme and copernicus can my great and right hon friend make sure that our conversation about horizon also include copernicus otherwise the eu be go to be build earth observation satellite that can not see the earth 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s interest in this area and she be absolutely right to say that we have enormous opportunity in our space sector across a range of aspect i know that the minister for science research and innovation my hon friend   the member for mid norfolk george freeman would like to discuss her constituency interest far with she i can also assure the house that there will be far update come soon on the uk government ’s space strategy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in vilnius the prime minister have the chance to conclude a deal allow our scientist to participate in the world ’s big international science programme drive innovation and sustainable growth he do not take it again so the horizon saga drag on month after month year after year be we in or be we out the science minister be not in the negotiation and the chief scientist be not in the negotiation it be all about the prime minister do the secretary of state understand that while the prime minister be dither our science base be wither 
 today be quite possibly my last opportunity at the dispatch box i serve from these government benches in may and   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah   shadow i year ago i know that she have a very fine mind and be a dedicated public servant however on this she be wrong labour front benchers may not know from day to the next what their policy be but we have be consistent on this point and we be work hard to get the correct deal for uk taxpayer and uk science 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 since i last update the house my right hon friend the minister for data and digital infrastructure have announce £ of funding to bring the fast internet speed to some of our most rural community the government ’s office for life sciences have agree a landmark deal with biontech that will see up to cancer patient benefit from potentially life save treatment today my department have launch a call for evidence on engineering biology 
 what action be the government take to deliver regulatory reform and business investment in the bioscience sector so that it can play its part in boost economic growth and deliver great job opportunity for people across the country 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s expertise in this area and i thank the team that work with i on this subject include my hon friend the minister for science research and innovation who have be central in lead how we will reform our regulatory landscape on life science i point my right hon friend   the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers   to the chancellor ’s announcement both at the budget and still to come on how we will continue to support our life science and bioscience sector which be essential to the uk economy 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for her time cover this role notwithstanding her answer to my hon friend   the member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah who ask a very important question 
 today ’s inflation figure confirm that price continue to rise broadband customer be deal with inflation bust price hike as a direct result of the government ’s choice they lift the cap on wholesale cost which have cause retail price to rise will the secretary of state apologise to hard press family and tackle the cost of live crisis for broadband customer 
 we recognise that household be have a very difficult time due to the cost of living which be why my right hon friend the chancellor have meet the regulator to press they to do more to help we have agreement that social tariff be now available to all those in receipt of universal credit and other benefit at the same time ofcom have agree with provider that anybody who wish to switch to a cheap tariff can do so without charge 
 there can be few more exciting and innovative project for any constituency than a spaceport to launch satellite into space we have a do deal to build on the runway at raf scampton before the home office march in and stymie the whole project will the minister please lobby the home office to try to get the spaceport back why would the home office want a runway or be there a dark purpose behind this 
 my right hon friend have raise this before and i will happily speak to he about it and support that space cluster the uk be poise to lead europe in the launch of low earth orbit satellite over the come decade and we be build launchpad around the country for that very purpose 
 the royal society ’s visa cost analysis show that researcher enter the uk via the global talent scheme have to pay time more than they would have pay under similar international science scheme do the minister acknowledge the cost of brexit in our failure to attract world lead researcher and skilled worker 
 the hon gentleman be on his own mission he fail to see the strength of the uk science and technology sector and he fail to see that it will be well for scotland ’s business scientist and citizen to continue to be part of that thriving sector that be what we be do in make sure the united kingdom be a science and technology superpower 
 indeed we have world class university in the west midland what plan do my right hon friend have to support regional innovation cluster 
 my hon friend make an important point we be invest heavily in regional innovation cluster all around this country we have in manchester in glasgow and in the west midland where the excellent mayor andy street be drive a genuine innovation economy 
 almost in property in my constituency and less than in in rural area do not have access to gigabit broadband they do not even have superfast connection the department must help property get connect where profit incentive be low will the minister provide an update on the gigabit voucher scheme and the total value of voucher claim this year 
 currently more than of premise have access to gigabit capable broadband and we be on track to meet our target of coverage by however the hon lady raise a good point about the take up of social tariff under the scheme and we want to see that happen much more we be determined to press ahead with project gigabit to achieve our target of universal coverage by 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday july 
 the ban on lgbt people serve in our military until the year be an appalling failure of the british state it be decade    behind the law of this land as today ’s report make clear in that period many endure the most horrific sexual abuse and violence homophobic bullying and harassment all while bravely serve this country today on behalf of the british state i apologise and i hope that all those affect will be able to feel proud part of the veteran community which have do so much to keep our country safe 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 may i associate myself with the remark the prime minister just make in the uk sadly every minute someone take their own life indeed for man under the age of and for woman under the age of this be now the big killer when i be the secretary of state for health and social care i meet many brave family and campaigner and i commit to they that the government would publish a comprehensive cross departmental suicide prevention strategy that be more than a year ago and still there be no strategy i know that my right hon friend the prime minister care as deeply about this issue as i do we have discuss it many time will he please commit his government to publish the strategy within day of parliament ’s return from the summer recess 
 when someone take their own life the effect on their family and friend be devastating i know that the loss of my right hon friend ’s own brother be an enormous source of pain for he i want to reassure he that we be actively address suicide rate through our national suicide prevention strategy back by funding and in particular by roll out suicide prevention voluntary community and social enterprise i can tell he that we will publish the new update national suicide prevention strategy later this year 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 labour in government be proud to repeal the ban on lgbt+ people serve in our armed force and today we strongly welcome this apology from the prime minister as a recognition of their historic mistreatment my constituent ken wright be a proud raf serviceman who be force to leave the job he love simply because he be gay i be delighted that he be here today to witness this apology although we can not right the wrong of the past the government should now act on the recommendation of the etherton review to fix the life break by the ban it be what lgbt+ veteran deserve 
 i also know that the whole house will want to send our very good wish to the lionesses as they start their world cup campaign this saturday let we hope they continue the brilliant success they have in the euros 
 when the prime minister take office month ago the nhs waiting list have people on it what be the number today 
 the reason that nhs waiting list be high today than they be then after actually be stable for the few month as we put in place new initiative be very simple because the nhs have be disrupt by industrial action we have put very clear plan in place to bring down waiting list in urgent   and emergency care primary care ambulance out patient and elective those plan be work and will continue to work but we do need to end the industrial action so i would ask the right hon and learn gentleman if he do care about bring the waiting list down do he agree with i that consultant and junior doctor should accept the pay deal that the government offer 
 mr speaker—[interruption 
 order the prime minister like to get away early but the long member stop i get on with the question the long i be go to keep he here so it be up to they 
 i be sure the whole house be pleased that the prime minister have grace we with his presence today but we do not get any more answer when he be here than when he be not he know the answer point people be currently on the waiting list that be the high it have ever be it mean that since he set foot into downing street people have be wait in daily agony for thing like hip and knee replacement while he boast have he figure out why after month dozen of gimmick and umpteen broken promise his government be fail more patient than ever before 
 mr speaker again i do not think we hear an answer to the question so interruption 
 order i also do not want opposition members hold up proceeding 
 it be very simple if the right hon and learn gentleman actually look at what be happen he would see that early this year our plan be begin to work ambulance wait time down from an hour and a half over christmas to around half an hour virtually eliminate the number of people wait and half year for treatment make huge progress on gp access all those thing all those plan we put in place all the funding all the extra ambulance the extra discharge be start to make a difference but all be hold up by very simple fact industrial action in the nhs again i will give he a chance if he really want to get people the healthcare they want will he agree with i that those doctor should accept the recommendation of the independent pay review body interruption 
 order this would be a bad time to get throw out it be week so think long and hard i just say to the prime minister this be prime minister ’s question not opposition question 
 mr speaker i think that give his time away the prime minister have slightly forget how this work he talk about his nhs staffing plan but he do not need to lecture me—[interruption 
 order this might be the last prime minister ’s question before recess but let i just say to somebody that if they really want to go early it will be very tempting to ensure that happen so they should think long and hard beforehand 
 the prime minister talk about his plan but he do not need to lecture i on that on the nhs staffing plan he nick it from labour it be the same old story they mess up the nhs and look to labour to fix it come the election the country will be do the same the difference be that unlike we he have not say how he would pay for his workforce plan now be his chance where be the money come from 
 not only be the nhs long term workforce plan fully fund but it be welcome by not not but different nhs stakeholder the right hon and learn gentleman talk about our plan and whether they be make a difference so let we just look at urgent and emergency care our plan mean that we will put more ambulance on the road and there will be more bed fast discharge and more community care that be why the royal college of emergency medicine describe it as significant and say that it would undoubtedly improve condition that be why we have see a&e waiting time in england the good in year while the opposition will not like this the nhs have the bad waiting time in the country in wales 
 when the prime minister say that the workforce plan be fully cost i have never see the chancellor look more bewildered it be less than a year since his party crash the economy with its unfunded spending commitment and he have not learn a thing let i ask this another way be his uncosted spending come from more tax rise more cut or be it just the late promise to fall from the tories magic money tree 
 as i and the chancellor set out the plan be fully fund the right hon and learn gentleman will see that at the autumn statement i be pleased that he be now interested in fiscal responsibility because that be very welcome there be an opportunity for we to make sure that this be true conviction we have just have in the past week the recommendation of independent pay review body include for the nhs i believe that the right thing to do be to accept those independent recommendation but that involve take difficult and responsible decision to deliver those pay rise without fuel borrowing inflation taxis and debt but yet again on this crucial issue while his mp be back on the picket line he simply refuse to take a position it be the same old story he should stop take inspiration from his friend outside and unglue himself from the fence hon member more 
 you want some more who want to lead the exit 
 in that burst of nonsense what we do not hear be a single word about how the prime minister will pay for it labour ’s nhs workforce plan be fully fund by scrap the non dom status that he so adore you know the mr speaker—[interruption 
 order i think that or of you have ask to catch my eye you be not go about it in the right way 
 labour ’s workforce plan be fully fund by scrap the non dom status that the prime minister so adore you know the mr speaker the non dom tax thing as he call it that allow some of the   wealthy people in the country to avoid pay tax here be that loophole so important to he that he would rather have billion in unfunded promise than simply make billionaire pay what they owe 
 that be the same policy that have pay i think for different thing at this point everybody know that i be a fan of do math to but the right hon and learn gentleman make a very strong case for do math all the way to when it come to the substance of the plan it be important that we address this i be aware i will say this that he do set out some proposal to train more staff the problem be that that be all he do our plan be much more comprehensive and much more impactful not only will we train more staff—[interruption this be important substance i acknowledge that the labour party do set out some plan to train more but that be not enough you also have to set out plan to retain more nhs staff as we do and crucially you also have to set out plan for how you reform the nhs so that you can have a more productive nhs that be the difference between we he be only ever focus on the superficial headline while we be get on with the actual reform 
 if the prime minister be so good at math he will know that i be not i do not know whether he have find time during the recent by election to visit hillingdon hospital where the ward have have to close staff be work in appalling condition and patient safety be at risk and that be simply a snapshot of the wide problem this week the national audit office set out in detail what everyone already know the government ’s hospital programme have shall we say some gap in it so can the prime minister confirm that apart from the fact that there be not of they that most of they be not new and that many of they be not even hospital everything be go fine with the new hospital 
 not only be we go to deliver on our manifesto commitment to build new hospital across the country by we be not stop there we be also deliver hospital upgrade across the country and crucially more than new community diagnostic centre to speed up treatment for people include in the constituency of the deputy leader of the opposition and the constituency of the shadow work and pensions secretary the shadow energy secretary the shadow justice secretary and the shadow attorney general that be how committed we be 
 let i end on this the leader of the opposition mention hillingdon hospital in uxbridge i want to help the people of this country i want to make sure that not only can they get to work but they get the care that they need why on earth do he want to charge they £ every time they visit their gp and hospital 
 there be welcome news this morning of inflation fall by more than expect business in my constituency be try to plan their pricing for next january and be struggle because of the proposal to introduce the extend producer responsibility they do not yet have the information on how much it will cost or how it will work will the prime minister look at pausing and reset that programme so that in january we do not   see price rise in our supermarket without the consequent reduction in packaging and increase in recycle that we all want to see 
 this be something that have be raise with i by those in the industry we be committed to protect the environment and deliver on our net target but the department for environment food and rural affairs be continue to engage closely with manufacturer retailer and packaging company on the precise design of the scheme i know that ministers will continue to keep this house and my hon friend update 
 i call the leader of the snp 
 the child benefit cap introduce by the conservative party have leave child live in poverty do the prime minister take comfort in know that the heinous legacy of that policy will no long be protect just by conservative members but by labour members too 
 i welcome the labour leader ’s new find support for our policy even though he previously commit to a different approach what i would say to   the hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn and indeed the labour front bench be that they do not have to worry too much give the labour leader ’s track record he have never actually keep a promise that he have make 
 voter in scotland be use to child poverty under the tories they almost expect it but they do not expect child poverty support from the labour party if we look very closely right now there be a shiver run along the labour front bench look for a spine interruption do this not tell we something much big that for child live in poverty in scotland westminster offer they no real change and no real hope 
 the good route out of poverty be through work and the good way to ensure that child do not grow up in poverty be to ensure that they do not grow up in a workless household that be why we be focus on create more job with more in scotland since and hundred of thousand few child across the united kingdom grow up in a workless household we will always continue to reduce child poverty i do not want to see a single child grow up in poverty and we will deliver that in every part of the uk include in scotland 
 do my right hon friend agree that if opposition member be in favour of illegal economic migration they should have the courage to say so rather than claim that young man in their 20 and 30 arrive here from safe country be actually asylum seeker 
 my right hon friend be right that the opposition do not have a plan to tackle illegal migration we see that just this last week when i think they vote over different time against our stop the boat bill that bill will make it crystal clear that if you come here illegally you will be detain and swiftly remove to a safe country that be the fair compassionate and right way to deal with this problem and that be what we believe in 
 it be exactly a year to the day since uk temperature hit a deadly ° c for the time with excess death last summer yet business and the prime minister ’s own climate adviser have say that his climate progress be worryingly slow he like to claim that the uk be decarbonise more quickly than the rest of the g7 but since the paris agreement that be simply not true he also like to claim that it be not a top concern for the public while recent polling show that that be not true either expert business and the public all want bold climate action but it be not even of his top priority can he tell we why not 
 the hon lady just make a completely bizarre point because we move quick and fast than everyone else she think that somehow that be something we should now not be proud of it be right that other country be catch up it be inevitable that they will have to decarbonise fast now to make up for the fact that over the past decade they have not follow our example i be not go to take any lecture from she on this topic because our track record be a good we have decarbonise fast than everyone else and right now we be make the right long term decision to make sure that we not only transition to net but do so in a way that bring people along with we and create job in the process 
 bedfordshire business now have apprentice on the factory floor earn £ a year on qualification easily beat cost of living pressure what more can we do to get school to promote apprenticeship to pupil and parent as our college and institute of technology be great poverty bust institution 
 my hon friend make an excellent point of the practical step we be take be to put all apprenticeship on to the ucas system this autumn which will make sure that they have parity of esteem in the classroom and increase information for parent and teacher at the same time as i announce early this week we be clamp down on university course that fail to deliver good outcome what we should be do be provide young people with the good opportunity for they to get on in life and he be absolutely right that that should include apprenticeship 
 why do the prime minister think that sir brian langstaff who chair the public inquiry into infected blood have reopen the hearing and summon before he the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer the leader of the house and the paymaster general to answer question next week 
 my thought remain with all those affect by this appalling tragedy the infected blood scandal should never have happen and that be why the public inquiry be set up by of my predecessor i have submit write evidence to the inquiry and be due to give oral evidence shortly so it would be inappropriate for i to comment far at this time 
 some people work indirectly or directly in our car industry which account for of our country ’s   export i strongly welcome the £ investment by tata motors in a battery factory and the job associate with it will my right hon friend build on that success and pursue a clear plan to get more gigafactorie include in the west midland so that we can capitalise on our lead in battery innovation and technology 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the importance of today ’s announcement it be of the large ever investment in the uk auto industry in this country ’s history with billion of pound and thousand of job and it be a massive vote of confidence in the uk economy 
 the nhs in england have just have its long ever junior doctor strike and consultant go on strike tomorrow for the time in year yet so far scotland have have no nhs strike that be not by chance it be because our health secretary and minister have keep work with the british medical association to try to address the pay erosion face by doctor since workforce shortage be the big challenge face healthcare and the prime minister just mention the importance of staff retention do he really think that refuse even to talk to health union will stop doctor leave the nhs 
 we do talk to health union but we also respect the independent pay review body process which be the right way to resolve these issue and mean that a typical junior doctor will see a pay rise as a result of this deal since the hon lady mention retention early this year the government deliver the bma ’s no ask which be to remove the cap on pension tax that be specifically design to retain senior doctor in the nhs the government have now do our bit and i urge the union please get back to the hospital and treat your patient 
 do my right hon friend share my unease that a bank that have the government as its large shareholder should close the account of a senior opposition politician will he use the government ’s shareholding to ensure that there be an inquiry into those circumstance because the subject datum access request make it clear or certainly indicate that it be the political view of the person concern that lead to his cancellation do my right hon friend agree that however much we may find they tiresome member of the opposition deserve bank account 
 it would not be right if financial service be be deny to anyone exercise their right to lawful free speech our new financial services and markets act put in place new measure to ensure that politically expose person be be treat in an appropriate and proportionate manner and have consult on the payment service regulation we be in the process of crack down on that practice by tighten the rule around account closure but in the meantime any individual can complain to the financial ombudsman service which have the power to direct a bank to reopen their account 
 i know how it feel to be homeless squat from place to another with your entire belonging in single black bin liner hard work family include in bradford west be at risk of homelessness because of the tory mortgage bombshell and the failure to legislate to protect renter apart from totally lose grip of the whole situation what be the prime minister do to stop half a people become homeless 
 actually rough sleeping level be about a low in compare with the peak in since our landmark homelessness reduction act come into force more than household have successfully have their homelessness prevent or relieve and we be invest £ over the next year to continue to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping 
 the prime minister mention our armed force may i mention they again we lose personnel kill in afghanistan and several suffer life change injury so i and some of my colleague on the defence committee be absolutely stunned to see a video post by our own chairman laud the taliban ’s governance of afghanistan but not mention that they be still try to identify and kill afghan civilian who side with nato force nor the fact that they do not like girl to go to school can i make it plain that that be not in our name and can i have the prime minister ’s assurance that that silly and naive act be not in his name either 
 i join my right hon friend in pay tribute to our brave serve personnel and veteran and i thank they for their service as we touch on early we have repeatedly call out and will continue to repeatedly call out the human right abuse that we see around the world he mention rightly the prohibition on woman be educate in afghanistan which be something that we have speak about in the past we will also continue to have dialogue with regime that do not mean that we consider those regime to be legitimate or that we approve of their action but that be all part as he will understand of establish normal diplomatic presence in country where the situation allow i will very happily look into the specific case that he raise 
 it be not just the adoption of the disgusting child benefit cap it be the endorsement of a hard brexit the tuition fee the immigration do the prime minister not agree that there be now no real difference between the main uk party be it not time that we perhaps rearrange the furniture in this house have they all on big bench and re title they the this be what you get from the uk party 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i will leave he and the labour party to debate the fine point of policy between they on the substance because it be important the track record demonstrate that we be make a difference and reduce child poverty there be now few child in poverty than there be in as a result of the   action of this government notably by move their parent into work because that have the single good benefit for those child that be the right policy and it be that we will continue to deliver 
 conversion therapy be quackery package up by bigot seek to promote their hate and to profit from it on   january a minister promise at the dispatch box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre legislative scrutiny be complete before the end of this parliamentary term how do my right hon friend plan to continue that may i also welcome his statement today and thank those lgbt veteran who be with we we be so grateful for their service and we seek this ban also in their name 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i agree with she that conversion therapy be an abhorrent practice and we need to do everything we can to stamp it out wherever we see it the minister for women and equalities my right hon friend   the member for saffron walden kemi badenoch will continue to keep my hon friend and the house update on her progress 
 do the prime minister remember year ago when he be a passionate supporter of leave the european union along with his then good friend boris johnson be he aware that sir john major now say in every speech he make that that decision be catastrophic for the people of this country and living standard as well as deeply damaging to our role status and influence in the world 
 i would say gently to the hon gentleman that he make the central point at the beginning of his question it be year ago and we need to move forward he talk about what have happen since then since we leave the single market this economy have grow fast than germany france and italy he also talk about our standing on the world stage he obviously be not here for the statement on the nato summit last week but nobody can be in any doubt that the united kingdom be highly respected on the world stage 
 just last week the leader of the opposition announce his new flagship policy the child benefit cap it be very popular on this side of the house but it be not so popular on the other side can the prime minister tell the house when the leader of the opposition will jump off the bandwagon be honest with the british public and tell they what he stand for 
 my hon friend be right i welcome the leader of the opposition now support the government ’s policy but i do not think anyone actually believe that he believe in what he say that be the 
 order the prime minister need not worry because he have no responsibility for the opposition 
 every single member of the house be require by law to confirm the true source of a donation before it be accept or declare can the prime minister tell we   whether he follow all the rule all the time before he take £ of free air travel on april if so why do his story keep change about who pay 
 all donation be declare in the normal way as the hon gentleman know if there be administrative change to that they be quickly correct 
 to bring the prime minister back to the question ask rightly by my right hon friend   the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg the opposition politician refer to be nigel farage whose bank account be close not because he be a pep a politically expose person or for commercial reason but because his view do not align with the value of coutts bank thinly veil political discrimination and a vindictive irresponsible and undemocratic action in addition nat west also disclose confidential detail about farage ’s account to the bbc and lie about the commercial viability of his account action that should jeopardise its banking licence and should certainly worry nat west ’s other customer the prime minister have tell we what he will do in the future but there be many other people in this circumstance will he require every bank with a british banking licence to inform the treasury of all the account that they have shut down for non commercial reason in the last decade 
 i know that my right hon friend have speak to the chancellor about this issue and that he will continue to have those conversation in the short term have consult on the payment service   regulation we intend to crack down on that practice by toughen the rule around account closure in the meantime the financial ombudsman service be available for people to make complaint to but i look forward to continue the dialogue with my right hon friend as do the chancellor 
 as a father the prime minister will know how precious child be adam watson aged and poppy ogle age from my constituency sadly lose their battle with childhood cancer just last year their home be forever break both family want to see a change in financial support for the child diagnose with cancer across the uk each year will the prime minister commit to meet these family to listen to their story and to review child disability living allowance payment so that they commence immediately on diagnosis of childhood cancer whether or not the diagnosis be terminal the month wait for support be just too long surely this government can see fit to wrap their arm around these child and their family in their hour of need 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that issue i can not imagine how difficult it be for family whose child be be treat for cancer with everything that come along with that i will happily look into   the specific issue that she have mention and get back to she in all haste she should know that she have my   total support for help and support family   who be go through what will be an unbelievably difficult time 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if she will make a statement on contest the united kingdom ’s strategy for counter terrorism 
 yesterday the government publish an update to our counter terrorism strategy contest a write ministerial statement be lay alongside the command paper in parliament 
 contest have a clear mission to reduce the risk from terrorism to the united kingdom our citizen and our interest overseas so that people can go about their life freely and with confidence the terrorism threat level set independently by the joint terrorism analysis centre have not change but the threat from terrorism be endure and evolve despite a prevalence of low sophistication attack in the uk the threat we see today and in the come year be more diverse dynamic and complex a domestic terrorist threat that be less predictable hard to detect and hard to investigate a persistent and evolve threat from islamist terrorist group overseas and an operate environment in which accelerate advance in technology provide both opportunity for and risk to our counter terrorism effort 
 it be within that context that we judge that the risk from terrorism be once again rise by far the big terrorist threat come from islamist terrorism it account for of attack since and about quarter of mi5 ’s caseload the remainder of the uk terrorist threat be largely drive by extreme right wing terrorism which account for approximately of attack since and about a quarter of the mi5 caseload our counter terrorism response will be even more agile in the face of an evolve threat more integrated so that we can bring the right intervention to bear at the right time to reduce risk and more align with our international ally to ensure that we continue to deliver together against that common threat 
 through this update strategy we will place great focus on use all the lever of the state to identify and intervene against terrorist we will build critical partnership with the private sector and international ally to keep the public safe and we will harness the opportunity present by new technology there be no great duty for this government than to keep the british people safe and i will not rest in deliver that mission 
 the contest update have very much be a sobering reminder of the threat we face our agency to which we be so grateful have prevent late stage terror attack in the past year the majority of they as we have hear be islamist motivated with extreme right wing terrorism make up the remainder however we be concern by certain omission from the update and the disparity between the threat outline and the response propose 
 on artificial intelligence the update recognise the challenge say that 
 terrorist be likely to exploit the technology 
 we have call for new offence criminalise the training of chatbot to radicalise individual but concrete measure be woefully lack in the update so how be the government go to tackle that the update say that the threat from daesh and al qaeda be on an upward trajectory so can the home secretary tell we how we be work urgently with international partner to mitigate that risk 
 the desperate situation in prison be lay bare with of the terrorist attack in the uk since perpetrate by serve or recently release prisoner we be tell individual may develop 
 a terrorist mindset during their time in prison 
 not only be we fail to de radicalise people in prison but people be be radicalise in prison and failure to manage those prisoner on release be put the public at risk can the home secretary tell the house how many terrorist prisoner be due to be release in the next month and whether every of they have be engage in intensive de radicalisation programme and assess for terrorism prevention and investigation measure 
 finally perhaps the most glaring omission be on state threat despite the fact that the director general of mi5 make it clear in his annual threat update in november that iran be 
 the state actor which most frequently cross into terrorism 
 in february our agency say that they have to disrupt attempt kidnap and assassination attempt here in the uk remarkably the report make no reference to the resource the approach or the power necessary to respond to that form of terrorism the home secretary know that we have advocate for proscription power on multiple occasion so why do the government continue to reject those proposal and why have they not finally proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 i thank the hon lady for her comment i know that she recognise the gravity and the sensitivity of this subject and she will share my view that we must face the threat of terrorism unite as unified country 
 since march our agency and law enforcement have disrupt late stage terrorist plot in the uk as the hon lady say these have include the targeting of public figure such as members of parliament specific community and event such as pride and public location such as iconic site in london i want to put on record my profound thank and admiration of all the professional who work day in day out under pressure for all they do to keep the british people safe every day many of we will never know the length to which they go in apply their expertise dedication and public service attitude to put our safety above their own 
 i be very proud of this government ’s track record when it come to keep the country safe as martyn ’s law make its way through parliament i expect the opposition to be responsible and to support we in our effort to provide this extra layer of protection for venue we have see significant reform in our national security bill now enact the hon lady mention terrorism in prison we take a very tough approach to manage terrorist prisoner limit their interaction with each other and restrict their communication we have develop a new counter terrorism assessment   and rehabilitation centre for expert psychologist and specialist staff to research and implement specialist programme to draw offender away from terrorism indeed the independent review of prevent make extensive recommendation relate to those in custody 
 the hon lady refer to the use of artificial intelligence and technology foundation model ai undoubtedly hold vast potential and they be crucial to the uk ’s mission to become a science and tech superpower but there be still many unknown with this class of technology and many other form of emerge technology that pose significant but not yet fully understand public safety and national security risk i be particularly concerned about the rapid development and public deployment of generative large language model like chatgpt and we be alert to the exponential pace of their development the emergent capability which make the exact risk difficult to anticipate or control and the relative ease with which safeguard can be overwrite those at the forefront of these technology be explicit about the seriousness of the risk if proper safeguard be not develop quickly 
 we look forward to promote and enable an open and constructive dialogue and deepen collaboration with tech company leader industry expert and like minded nation as we seek to ensure that the gift of this technology be deliver and that society be protect indeed at the recent eyes security meeting in new zealand where i represent the uk we discuss the emerge hostile use of technology and collaborative way in which we may work at the international level to mitigate those risk 
 to conclude i be very clear that we need to face the threat unite as country i hope that the opposition understand the heavy weight of that responsibility and that we will work together constructively to keep the british people safe 
 of the most effective way to disrupt identify and reduce the terrorist threat be to bring together the disparate and disjointed data source that exist to link organise crime group activity to terrorist will my right hon and learn friend detail how the contest strategy will help make that happen 
 as i mention in my statement yesterday there be huge interaction a blurring of the line if you like between terrorist organisation and group hostile state actor and serious organise crime group act on a transnational basis with sophisticated and well resource network and a heightened level of elusiveness that be exactly why our contest strategy have be refresh to realign our priority resource technological capability and co ordination across agency to properly respond in a swift and robust way to these emerge threat 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 may i start by express my party ’s deep gratitude to all those who be work to   protect we from despicable terrorist attack of course our thought remain with all those who have suffer as a result of such evil crime 
 on that note while i welcome the strategy ’s focus on victim may i raise the recent report of survivor of terrorism who have be deeply upset by poor treatment by the criminal injury compensation scheme what discussion have the home secretary have have with colleague about fix those problem 
 the strategy ’s commitment to engage across the tech sector be welcome but like the shadow minister i be surprise by its very limited reference to the use of artificial intelligence for radicalisation and instruction the windsor castle crossbow attacker be a perfect example of someone be radicalise in that way do the home secretary believe that legislation be require and what concrete step be be take to address the use of ai in that way 
 what extra funding will support the refresh strategy especially give the report that later this year a significant number of convict terrorist will complete their sentence which will require the most careful management the strategy recognise the critical importance of the close partnership work with the devolved government and agency that have responsibility for deliver various aspect of contest can we have the home secretary ’s assurance that that close working will continue 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his observation he talk about support and compensation for victim of terrorism more can and must be do which be why the government be review the support available to well address victim need we be absolutely committed to ensure that victim of terrorism get the full compensation to which they be entitle in line with scheme administer by the criminal injuries compensation authority those scheme deliver for victim of terrorism the truth be that no amount of compensation can ever make up for the ordeal suffer by victim of terror that be why it be right that survivor get all the support they need in whatever form it may be require through the publicly fund cica which pay out more than £ to victim of violent crime last year alone 
 i welcome the update of the strategy it would be helpful if the home secretary tell we whether it will get the big tech company to do more to prevent terrorist from exploit their platform an issue highlight in the intelligence and security committee report extreme right wing terrorism 
 the technological aspect of terrorism be very real our enemy be use more and more sophisticated tool against we for hostile purpose that be plain from an intelligence point of view that be why contest make a deliberate point of address the technological feature of this kind of work a huge amount of investment and operational capability have be put into mitigating and deal with that threat most notably in the form of the counter terrorism operation centre a new collaboration centre that i have the honour of visit recently 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 a few week ago i meet travis frain a founder member of survivors against terror who explain how his life have be change forever by the westminster bridge terrorist attack and how he do not get the support he need in the aftermath this week a survey of survivor of major terrorist incident find that more than third feel that the compensation scheme oversee by the criminal injuries compensation authority be unfair and unreasonable the home secretary talk about a review it be unacceptable that these people be in that position at the moment when will the review actually be publish 
 as i mention there be no word and there be no amount of money that can adequately reflect the pain and suffering experience by victim of terrorism that be why it be absolutely right that we provide victim of terrorism with full compensation and the full support possible and available to enable they to move forward from these tragic event as i say we know that more must be do that be why we be review the support available we need to well address victim need through the current scheme and ensure that they be properly meet the need of victim 
 there be people in ukraine who find their territory illegally occupy and annex by russia their child disappear into russian custody and their land settle by ethnic russians under international law we recognise the right of victim of the criminal action of the russian state to resist how can we ensure that we do not end up characterise the legal action by the victim in that conflict and in other analogous conflict around the world as terrorism 
 i be very proud of the uk ’s track record of support ukraine and the ukrainians both in ukraine and abroad through the devastating illegal conflict that russia and putin have wag upon they it be right that we provide military support it be right that we roll out an extensive set of sanction against russia and it be right that we continue our international and diplomatic support for ukrainians 
 i add my comment to those of the home secretary on our security service and thank they for the work that they do the intelligence and security committee report last year on right wing terrorism find that of disrupt plot be from right wing terrorism and that they mainly involve young people who aim to join either the armed force or the police we make recommendation on tighten up the vetting of police officer and proscribe membership of right wing organisation for member of the armed force will the home secretary update the house on what progress have be make on those issue 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to refer to the emerge threat pose by extreme right wing terrorism the director general of mi5 in his annual update refer to the ideology that be emerge and increase in activity and the independent review of prevent focus on work that can be well do it be absolutely right that we take robust action   that be why i be act on the recommendation set out by sir william shawcross on upgrade and update prevent so that it well respond to the risk of extreme right wing terrorism as well as to the risk pose by islamist terrorism 
 in update the uk ’s counter terror strategy what work be the security service do with uk border force to identify those enter the united kingdom particularly by irregular mean 
 my hon friend be absolutely right terrorist and those who have malign intent for our nation will exploit all sort of vulnerability include at the border that be obvious that be why the contest upgrade deal specifically with this issue we need to far strengthen the uk border as a critical line of defence against terrorism take advantage of new immigration tool detection target and biometric capability to identify and block threat from enter the uk illegally in the place 
 this be a policy area that throw up some of the most difficult case ever to be find so i welcome the home secretary ’s determination to build political consensus and ensure that we work with our strategic ally some of the most difficult case around counter terrorism involve uk citizen especially child who be traffic by isis and be currently in north east syria that be an area where we risk become an outlier because all our ally have repatriate their citizen it risk cause friction between ourselves and our ally indeed we have our own responsibility give the fact that these be uk citizen who be traffic be there anything in the strategy that will help to tackle those very difficult case 
 the right hon gentleman be right to refer to this very regrettable feature of modern day counter terrorism paragraph of the contest strategy state 
 in recent year there have be a small increase in the number of minor investigate and arrest by counter terrorism police most adverse activity conduct by minor have occur online over half of under-18s convict of terrorism offence over the past year be charge with non violent offence the collection or dissemination of terrorist publication 
 it be vital that we be cognisant of this emerge threat and that we have the right resource service and professionalism in place to mitigate and intercept the threat at source as soon as possible but it be clear that wherever criminality have occur there will be a robust response from the appropriate agency 
 technology bring huge benefit but it be also exploit by terrorist be my right hon and learn friend confident that the update strategy will ensure that technology company do far more to prevent their service be use by those who wish we harm and to co operate with our security and law enforcement service particularly give the approach that some have take on encryption and child abuse imagery 
 my hon friend have speak about an issue that be close to my heart tackle online child sexual exploitation which be rise at an exponential and horrify pace about instance of   online child sexual abuse be record by the global recording centre last year alone in this country we arrest individual a month involve in this heinous crime and we safeguard about child a month it be horrify and that be why we be take step to work constructively with the tech company in term of contest i refer he to the extensive section on page onwards and in other part of the strategy that talk about the technological aspect how it be emerge and our action and response notably our world lead counter terrorism operation centre newly establish will bring together the right datum technology and expertise to investigate and disrupt these type of threat 
 i welcome this statement although it be much delay it be much await of the key thing miss from the strategy be the use of covert human intelligence source the people who use to be know as informant to the police increase number of people catch under this network be people with mental health issue will the home secretary provide a detailed account of how many chis be use what the result be and how many of those report be people suffer with their mental health 
 i can not get into detail that relate to operational independence and decision make by the agency in live investigation but what i would say be that i expect all agency and law enforcement organisation to use the full breadth of power that we have afford they 
 the current situation whereby ten of thousand of young man be arrive in small boat on our shore primarily young man from unstable part of the world be frankly an accident wait to happen do the home secretary agree that the british people expect our border to be robustly enforce and that be just as important when it come to defend our nation from terrorism as it be for anything else 
 a strong border be critical to counter terrorism the contest strategy clearly set that out in the nationality and borders act the government revise schedule to the terrorism act expand power to prevent illegal entry include via small boat our migration and border system provide a critical opportunity to identify and manage individual and good that pose a terrorist concern that be why rigour and robustness in our border be essential for national security 
 in the government ’s response to the intelligence and security committee ’s extreme right wing terrorism report i thank the home secretary for refer to the scale of that threat early in her remark they say that 
 our counter terrorism strategy contest remain threat agnostic so that rather than target specific ideology our tool power and overall ct approach can adapt to change threat while also ensure our approach be still able to identify and assess what be inherently ideological threat 
 can i simply ask she to confirm that nothing she have say today and nothing that have be publish change the underlie philosophical basis of how the contest strategy operate 
 as the contest strategy refresh make clear a broad range of ideology and narrative draw people into support terrorism that include as i have say islamist terrorism which be by far the large proportion of mi5 ’s case load but there be also an increase threat from extreme right wing terrorism that we must confront eliminate and do everything in our power to stop wherever it come from and however people be radicalise into extremist and violent behaviour it be unacceptable and we take a robust approach ultimately to keep the british people safe 
 in june this year the border inspectorate say that not every arrival into the uk at manston be have security check do as part of their interview or have their property check can the home secretary guarantee now that every arrival be be fully check and if not why not 
 have visit the reception centre at western jet foil and manston and have be work closely on ensure that the right facility resource and mechanism be in place to ensure that those who arrive illegally be appropriately accommodate i can say that we ensure that those who arrive be check they go through biometric check and any other appropriate check and then they be put through our processing centre generally at manston they be then put on a track effectively to other onward accommodation if they have an asylum claim that be the general scheme that we have be carry out for some time 
 the uk police and security service use to conduct more than real time security check on a share eu platform before we lose access after brexit at the time the government inform we that we would have access to a share platform within or year now the permanent secretary have advise that we will not have access to a share dataset until or can the home secretary confirm just how much of a damaging effect the loss of this vital intelligence and security mechanism be have on our ability to tackle terrorism and cross border crime 
 i know the hon gentleman be on his brexit bandwagon or whatever it be but the reality be that from a security point of view we have never have strong collaboration with international partner than today we have continue to develop our global reach and insight through sustain work with ally that be particularly with the eyes where we share an enormous amount of common approach and strategic development but also with european partner i have meet many of my european counterpart and we share the common goal of national security in many instance the uk be see among european ally as a leader and a nation value for its contribution to pan european national security 
 as the shadow minister my hon friend   the member for halifax holly lynch rightly state the government ’s update acknowledge that when it come to ai 
 terrorist be likely to exploit the technology to create and amplify radicalise content propaganda and instructional material and to plan and commit attack 
 however there be no concrete plan in the update to address those grow risk beyond point to the government ’s own online safety bill which have be delay yet again and water down and other than the rhetoric we have hear today from the secretary of state what be the government actually do what concrete plan be in place to tackle this grow problem because we have see little to no action thus far 
 the hon lady obviously have not read the document if she have she would see our action our achievement and what our plan be i will save she the trouble of read the document we be realise the full potential of our newly establish world lead counter terrorism operation centre i do not think she have visit but i recommend she try to because it be an incredibly impressive world lead operational centre establish recently that bring together the right team datum and technology to more effectively identify interrupt and disrupt terrorist we be also ensure a broad range of expertise from non law enforcement intervention to mitigate the evolve terrorist threat we be maintain our investment in the critical threat assessment capability through the world class joint terrorism analysis centre i could go on but in the interest of time she would probably do well to read the document 
 the new contest counter terrorism strategy mention that incel threat 
 could meet the threshold of terrorist intent or action 
 the person behind the shooting in plymouth in where we lose people could have have their action inform by incel culture and violent misogyny incel violence currently largely fall out of the scope of all the prevent strategy tactic do the home secretary agree that it be now time to develop a cross government incel strategy so that we can not only prevent people from go down that path towards violent misogyny but help rescue those who be do so that would provide a great level of community safety for woman and our entire community and we would never again see the violence we see in plymouth repeat on our street 
 the hon gentleman be an incredibly powerful advocate for his constituent let i put on record my thought and prayer for the love one of all of those who be tragically lose or affect incel culture be not strictly within the contest apparatus but it do need work i readily accept that it be a violent trend and a radicalise influence that be promote a culture that be totally at odd with the free safe and democratic society that we all love and want to cherish i be happy to speak to he about what further step we can take as a government 
 in march the security threat level in northern ireland be increase from substantial to severe in the aftermath of the attempt   murder of dci john caldwell since the additional security funding that the government provide to the police service of northern ireland have be flatline in cash term at £ a year will the home secretary undertake to review that level of funding to ensure that the psni and the security service have the tool to continue their good work in combat both dissident republican and loyalist terrorism 
 northern ireland relate terrorism remain a serious threat particularly in northern ireland the contest strategy do not address the threat from northern ireland in northern ireland that be manage by a separate strategic approach lead by the northern ireland office at the home office our contest approach cover the threat from northern ireland relate terrorism in mainland great britain it be important that we do not decouple those threat which be very interlinked we know that some dissident republican group continue to carry out terrorist attack as the hon member refer to so we need to ensure that all the resource be available and we want to ensure that we support partner in northern ireland so they be readily equip to mitigate and respond to the threat 
 in june the national security adviser to the canadian government a key eyes member list russia china and iran as key state actor that pose a threat to canadian life they then add india to that list due to the rise of hindu nationalist activity specifically target canadian sikhs be that anywhere in the home secretary ’s thinking on extremism if not why not 
 as i say general ideology be set out in our prevent approach and our contest approach we be actor agnostic but we note where these threat be emerge base on a casework analysis as confirm by mi5 and other agency the predominant threat relate to islamist terrorism but of course it be right that there be robust law enforcement response for any kind of violence or extremism that meet the criminal threshold 
 i welcome very much the secretary of state ’s answer to the question pose far to the question from   the hon member for north down stephen farry will she outline what step have be take to allocate additional funding to local police force in area with high threat level such as northern ireland where republican terrorism be a real threat to the democratic process bear in mind that the police budget in northern ireland have be cut in real term in a time of crisis will she confirm what discussion have take place with the chief constable and the policing board to ensure that the commitment to ringfence funding for the battle against terrorism in all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be maintain 
 i make some reference to the specific nature of the threat pose by northern ireland relate terrorism it be clear that it be primarily concentrate and direct against target in northern ireland i regularly discuss with uk government colleague how we can ensure robust defence across the whole piece but i be happy to see what more can be do through a conversation 
 the rapid proliferation of end to end encryption and anonymous messaging service allow terrorist group   to communicate freely without the risk of detection or identification of course personal privacy must be uphold for ordinary citizen so how be the government look to work with tech expert to find alternative way of access the communication of member of such group 
 this be something that really do concern i the propose roll out of end to end encryption without enable lawful access or without safeguard will pose a danger not just to national security but to child and to all our people it be vital that the technology company work with we to roll out the available technology i be confident that it exist to enable and protect privacy right but at the same time to enable law enforcement access and intervention to take place so that we can safeguard child online prevent radicalisation online and prevent criminality online 
 with permission mr speaker i would like expand on the apology deliver by the prime minister this afternoon for the unacceptable hurt cause to lgbt member of our nation ’s armed force by the to ban on homosexuality it be not acceptable and it be not what the brave man and woman it affect deserve for that on behalf of the government and the armed force i be deeply sorry 
 for hundred of year join the british armed force have be a career choice full of opportunity adventure and self improvement of the most fulfilling and stimulate occupation a young person can choose but it be also of self sacrifice and bravery this morning we publish the independent review into the service and experience of lgbt veteran who serve prior to it make for miserable and distressing reading it be only right that the house take the time to acknowledge and reflect on those veteran who have share their experience with the review 
 i along with a number of colleague in the house serve in our armed force when the ban be in place i can not imagine what it must have be like for someone to join the armed force buoy up by that great spirit of service only to discover to their horror that many believe they do not fit i can not imagine what it must have feel like to be hound out of a job they love simply on account of their sexuality nor can i imagine what it must have be like to lose their livelihood their family and their home simply because of the person they choose to love yet that be the experience of many sailor soldier and aviator over decade and it happen here in this country little over year ago the report publish today bring the experience to life for we and spotlight the hurt feel by those affect for that i be truly grateful 
 the ban be introduce in unbelievably after the sexual offences act decriminalise same sex sexual act in private between consent adult to add to the injustice when the ban end at the beginning of the millennium the story of those who suffer be forget and their record be bury additionally in and in line with government policy agree by the association of chief police officers the ministry of defence enact a policy to destroy legacy police investigation record concern decriminalise sexual offence so that historical decriminalised conviction could not show up on criminal record check of service personnel i assure veteran that this be not a cover up and do not mean that their wide service record have be destroy 
 i want to place on the record my thank and gratitude to lord etherton and his team for compile this comprehensive report it be commission in january and since people have respond with their experience many in substantial detail i pay particular tribute to all those who come forward they have show tremendous courage in chronicle traumatic experience which for many have be cause grief and groundless shame for decade i also place on record my admiration and thank to fight with pride and especially craig and caroline who have hold the baton for so long 
 the testimony make truly harrowing reading they paint a shocking and shameful picture of a defence that be hard to comprehend the enforcement of the ban become something of a witch hunt the testimony detail investigation invasive search and examination degrading test brutal bullying and in some case sexual abuse doctor who join in describe how he have to perform a test for which there be no medical or clinical basis some who think they could confide in their chaplain be stunned to find their detail be pass to their superior 
 for those affect the hardship impact every aspect of their life reputation be demean and defame commission be surrender and officer demote by multiple rank veteran who serve with distinction award medal in famous campaign from the falklands to the gulf be strip of their medal 
 we can not turn back the clock but we can make amend and take action this report make recommendation my department alongside the office for veterans affairs the department for health and social care and other across government in partnership with the devolved administrations and the charity sector all have a role in deliver the report ’s recommendation many in the lgbt veteran community have be eagerly await the publication of this report and rightly so they have be wait for decade to be hear i be pleased to say that since we receive this report at the end of may multiple government departments have be busy work through the recommendation to ensure that we come to the house today accept in principle the vast majority of the report ’s recommendation while we agree with the intent behind they we may deliver a number in different way from that describe in the report 
 we will set out those difference when we publish the government ’s full response to the review after the summer recess but i assure the house that will be the time when we can not only deliver restitution and redress to the lgbt veteran community but make sure that the house properly debate the report and the government ’s response to it and its recommendation this of course be a statement today while i welcome all colleague challenge and request on it i have decide specifically that a debate in the house should take place to give a chance to debate the government ’s recommendation that be the right thing to do although that may take the summer it be important that both opposition and our colleague can hold i or my successor to account in fact we have already deliver of the recommendation today the prime minister deliver the this morning at the dispatch box

 i be glad that today ’s mod be a very different place today from the defence of the late 60 to 90 our lgbt colleague be an integral and undifferentiated    part of the defence family make a fantastic difference all over the world at the start of this month the minister for defence people veterans and service families my right hon friend   the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison meet lgbt member of our armed force and veteran before they march at london pride the occasion have become a celebrated part of our military calendar today ’s mod policy be gear towards lgbt issue there be training for lgbt ally and thriving lgbt staff network 
 there be no place for prejudice in the modern armed force however thing be by no mean perfect which be why we continue to improve on our tolerance policy towards discrimination we should not forget that we could not have reach this point be it not for some incredibly brave people i pay tribute to those who have campaign for justice over the decade include fight with pride rank outsiders and the armed forces legal action group 
 cultural change take time particularly in such large organisation as our armed force but it can only really begin when individual be prepared to stand up and be count this government have show they care about right historic wrong that be why we bring forward this review once we have take the time need to fully work out how to deliver recompense for this community we look forward to be back at the dispatch box to outline those detail
