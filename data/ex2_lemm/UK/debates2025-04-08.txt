it be a pleasure to take part in this easter adjournment debate i always find that these end of term debate really enlighten i about fellow member of the house their constituency and the issue that be important to their constituent 
 before i talk about something close to my own constituency and heart i associate myself with the contribution of   the hon member for reigate rebecca paul   and the thank that she give to surrey police my own borough team in guildford have be fantastic just as hers have be in support our town centre by deal with antisocial behaviour i note the absolutely crack contribution and egg cellent easter pun from   the hon member for carlisle ms minns i will stop there with the easter pun and move on to my constituency 
 i will use my time to highlight an issue in my constituency that have both national and local significance i hope that action on the issue will not just resolve it in guildford but help to drive long term change in the way we support charity and business during multi year infrastructure project 
 many members will be aware of the extensive redevelopment work take place at junction of the m25 near the royal horticultural society garden at wisley the redevelopment work start in november and be due to finish in summer but sadly it have be confirm recently that that will not be the case they will finish in approximately spring   that be year of disruption for local resident and business ultimately the project should improve the junction but it be a very big but”—there have be serious consequence for rhs wisley and our much love local café ockham bites alongside frustration and disruption for local resident in village around the junction and everyone who have have to travel through it 
 while the place be very different in scale both have see a significant loss ockham bites be lose £ a day and rhs wisley predict that by the end of the project it will have lose £ these financial loss be highlight in the early day of the project but dismiss on the basis that current legislation compensate only on the value of property not for loss of business for rhs wisley the loss have have far reach consequence plan for new arboretum have be delay fund for scientific research have be reduce and community outreach programme have be scale back the impact go beyond my constituency and the garden itself through to the community around guildford and other rhs site across the country they be be force to consider cut to training opportunity with a project reduction in workplace student horticulturalist position over the next year 
 i be sure that member of the house will be very sad to hear all those thing about rhs wisley i know that resident in my constituency as well as people across the country feel strongly about this issue a petition that be currently live have signature and that number keep increase i pause to thank my colleague baroness benjamin who have be highlight this matter in the other place for the answer she have gain from member of the house of lords on the issue surround the problem at rhs wisley will   the hon member for wellingborough and rushden gen kitchen   encourage the transport secretary to respond to my request to meet i and representative of rhs wisley 
 return to ockham bites and its fantastic cake and tea it have suffer big financial loss for a small business there have also be problem with water and all those thing combine have force the owner to make serious personal and professional adjustment include relocate their home and deal with heighten stress level these business story be of very different scale but they highlight a serious flaw in current legislation we should not be leave small business charity and other organisation struggle financially and potentially fail due to multi year infrastructure project not only be those organisation the lifeblood of our community they be fundamental to our economic success i hope that ministers will agree to meet i and work to find a way to support those business and commit to review the legislation to ensure that their story be not repeat and that future multi year infrastructure project be deliver without leave key part of our local economy and community behind 
 i want to close on a positive note in this afternoon ’s fantastic debate by give a cheeky little encouragement to everyone in the chamber if they have not yet experience rhs wisley or their local rhs garden to please go and enjoy they during the easter recess i also echo my hon friend   the member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade   in encourage member and the public when enjoy the great outdoors to be fire safe finally i hope that all member of this house and all   the staff security and police have a restorative easter and i thank   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   for lead the debate 
 before we come to treasury question i have agree to a request from the chancellor to make some brief comment about the global financial situation follow which the shadow chancellor and the liberal democrat spokesperson will be allow to respond and ask a question i will then call other hon member to ask the question on the order paper in the usual way other members may well wish to refer to the chancellor ’s comment in their supplementary or topical question and i will take a more liberal view of the scope of supplementary question than be usually the case i call the chancellor of the exchequer 
 thank you mr speaker as you say i would like to make some brief remark on the current economic situation 
 the united states decision to impose tariff have have and will continue to have huge implication for the world economy these implication have be reflect in the reaction we have see in global market in recent day which the financial authority have of course be monitor closely this morning i speak to the governor of the bank of england who confirm that market be function effectively and that our banking system be resilient 
 i know too that this be an anxious time for family who be worried about the cost of live we have your back british business be worried about what a change world will mean for they we have your back too this government be clear eyed that our response to global change can not be to watch and wait but instead to act decisively to take the right decision that be in our national interest protect work people all the decision that we make as a government will be underpin by the stability of our non negotiable fiscal rule 
 a trade war be in nobody ’s interest that be why we must remain pragmatic and cool headed and pursue the good deal with the united states in our national interest that remain our priority it be part of the discussion that i have with us treasury secretary scott bessent last week but we have be clear that nothing be off the table that be why we will continue to back british business during these uncertain time particularly in industry that be most affected as we rebuild our industrial base here in britain 
 we show that backing yesterday when the prime minister and i announce new measure to give british car maker certainty and stability and to support they on the transition to electric vehicle we have put forward plan to support our life science sector by cut back   the time it will take to set up clinical trial in the uk it be why we be work with our international ally to reduce barrier to trade right across the world over recent day i have have discussion with my counterpart in canada australia ireland france and spain and with the european commission we will pursue those talk in earnest tomorrow i will hold talk with the indian government as part of our nation economic and financial dialogue as we seek to secure a new trade deal with india 
 finally we must go far and fast in our mission to kick start economic growth i know that the challenge face the global economy and their potential impact could be profound as a government we must step up to that challenge to deliver security for work people through our plan for change which be underpin by stability reform and investment prioritise the builder not the blocker reform our public service not defend the status quo invest in our long term infrastructure not cut it for the short term security for work people renewal for britain that be our focus and that be what this government will deliver 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 i thank the right hon lady for advance notice of her comment 
 this be a time of great concern for million of people up and down our country for business and as an open trading nation for our economy at large free trade have be the bedrock of prosperity for our country and for many country around the world for decade it have raise billion of people out of poverty tariff be the enemy of free trade and we on the conservative benches will do whatever we can to assist the government in get those tariff down 
 have say that of course we will never cease to be an effective opposition who vigorously hold the government to account not least on the disastrous decision that they have already take in respect of our economy we will be responsible when it come to these matter particularly where market sensitivity be engage 
 i want to ask the right hon lady the follow question could she provide further detail of the us negotiation and specifically whether further meeting with scott bessent and other have be arrange that involve she secondly which area beyond tariff be be discuss in those negotiation thirdly which sector beyond car and life science be be consider for potential government support finally could she update the house on what option there be for protect sector of the economy that might be affect by the dumping of good as a consequence of trade diversion 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that response and for his offer to work constructively i know from my time as shadow chancellor that those moment when we can work constructively together in the national interest whether in response to covid or in support ukraine against the aggression of russia be when this house be at its good 
 the shadow chancellor ask for further detail in a number of area discussion be ongoing across a range of government departments include the treasury with the united states and i will be meet us treasury secretary scott bessent shortly beyond tariff we be   discuss a range of different area but the focus be on reduce tariff and non tariff barrier to trade with a particular focus on those sector that be subject to the high tariff 
 although the tariff be low than those for many other country around the world and we welcome that the additional tariff on car on steel and potentially on life science pose a real challenge to our country because those be some of our big export market that be why we make the announcement yesterday and in those sector automotive life science and steel we will continue to take the action that be necessary work in partnership with business and trade union to make sure we be address those issue we be also use institution such as the british business bank the national wealth fund and uk export finance to help business through these time 
 the shadow chancellor also mention concern around dumping we be work with colleague around the world to understand those implication but our priority be not to create more trade barrier but to reduce the one that exist today 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 people up and down the country will be incredibly concerned about what trump ’s trade war mean for their living standard and their community at the same time people want to show that britain be not go to take donald trump ’s trade tariff lie down we welcome the chancellor ’s announcement that the government will be work far and fast with our ally abroad can she confirm that any new trade deal will be bring before this house for a vote before they be ratify at the same time as work with our ally abroad to create new export market will the chancellor and the government commit to a buy british campaign as part of a broad national effort to encourage people to buy british here at home 
 i thank the hon lady for those question this be a time for pragmatism and cool head not to rush a response we be work closely with business my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade announce in the house last week a call for evidence on the response that business be look for ratchet up barrier to trade and ratchet up tariff will not be in our country ’s interest whether in term of inflation or indeed for supply chain we need to have cool head and think about the national interest not give knee jerk reaction 
 we be very much focused on do deal with other country around the world there be the eu uk summit on   may we be host the economic and financial dialogue with minister sitharaman who be come to london today for those conversation and those discussion be ongoing with a number of country of course any treaty would be bring forward for ratification by this house 
 in term of buy british i think everyone will make their own decision what we do not want to see be a trade war with britain become inward look because if every country in the world decide that they want only to buy thing produce in their country that would not be a good way forward our country have benefit hugely from access to global market and we   will continue to want to be able to do that because that be in our national interest for work people and business in this country 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what step she be take to help tackle tax evasion 
 close the tax gap and ensure that everyone be pay the tax they owe be of the government ’s top priority the autumn budget mark a step change to close the tax gap with the most ambitious package ever the government build on that in the spring statement take the total additional gross tax revenue raise per year to £ by 
 the uk tax gap grow by a shocking £ in in the die day of the conservatives and former chancellor nadhim zahawi be sack for fail to declare an investigation by his majesty ’s revenue and customs into his tax affair i welcome the treasury ’s crackdown on tax avoidance do my hon friend agree that labour ’s prudence with a purpose will be show by invest those taxis in the child poverty strategy this summer 
 i thank my hon friend for his remark he be right to say that the £ of additional revenue from close the tax gap be a huge boost to the public finance which enable we responsibly to fund public service and deliver key priority those priority include free breakfast club at all primary school in england the of they be begin this month via our early adopter scheme which be worth £ to parent and carer to go far the government will bring forward their comprehensive child poverty strategy as soon as possible 
 what step be the government take to address the concern of overseas company that be evade vat and online sale by fraudulently register uk address 
 at the spring statement the hon gentleman will have see the government set out progress on measure in the autumn budget to tackle a range of source of tax avoidance and the tax gap that include prosecute more fraudster introduce a new hmrc reward scheme for informant tackle phoenixism and tackle the offshore non compliance tax gap 
 what step she be take through the spending review to help increase level of economic growth 
 growth be the no.1 priority of this government that be why in the autumn budget and the spring statement we unlock an additional £ for capital spending compare with the plan that we inherit from the previous government yesterday we announce significant support for the automotive sector and life science and ahead of the spending review in june we have announce the roll out of an additional place in construction skill so that we can build the home and infrastructure that our country desperately need 
 to drive progress on our growth mission and get the most out of taxpayer money it be vital that department work collaboratively and not at odd with each other will the chancellor outline how she be promote cross departmental working and planning as part of the spending review 
 the chief secretary to the treasury be work closely in a constructive way to bring together cluster of colleague to discuss some of the press issue that span departments and that no department can address on its own whether that be reform of special educational need and disability provision for early year or tackle issue around homelessness and the cost of temporary accommodation we be work cross government to address some of those cross cutting issue 
 the chancellor be right to focus on increase economic growth so will she please explain why my office be still wait for a response on behalf of a small business to a letter that i send on   december ask she to look into the impact of her national insurance rise on small business we ask for an update on   february i raise a point of order on   march and i still have not have a response will she please get a response to i as soon as possible 
 i will follow up on that issue the small business those that employ the equivalent of people on the national living wage will be pay no national insurance at all from this april up to of the small business will be pay less or the same national insurance as they be pay previously 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 since the spring statement the world have be rock by the announcement by president trump on tariff last week it be an event as significant as the financial crisis of or perhaps as covid and in those instance the state unleash everything it could to try to resolve those issue be the chancellor consider change any of her rule to ensure that everything that the state can throw at this problem be be do 
 it be incredibly important to retain cool head at this moment the tariff have be impose and we be work closely with our friend and counterpart in the united states to reduce the impact from those not just in the uk but around the world as well as i say in my opening remark at the same time we be look to secure well trading relationship with some of our big trading partner around the   world of course as we do yesterday we be look at some of the sectoral response include on life science automotive and steel but the fiscal rule be very important for give our country the stability it need we see what happen when the previous government lose control of the public finance it result in interest rate go through the roof mean high cost for business and for work family we will not make those mistake that be why the fiscal rule be non negotiable and stability for this government be sacrosanct 
 be now not the right time to start try to make our own luck in that light would it not also be the right time for the chancellor to give the green light to the upgrade of the a66 between penrith and scotch corner some of traffic on that a road be freight which be twice the average for a road across the country and it be outrageous that so much of the road be single carriageway would it not be great for the economy as well as save life if the chancellor give the upgrade the green light today 
 impressive we will be consider all such scheme as part of the spending review but i agree with the hon gentleman that we need to go far and fast to grow our economy that be why we be spend £ more on capital investment in this parliament compare to the plan that we inherit which mean that we can upgrade more road rail line and energy infrastructure and build the home our country need too 
 i call the shadow minister 
 week ago the spring statement rush through change to disability benefit or pocket money to the chief secretary to the treasury to help plug the £ gap in public finance create by the labour budget now we be already in the office for budget responsibility ’s scenario on tariff and the chancellor be once again forecast to be out of room on her fiscal target what do she plan to ask the chief secretary to the treasury to do to update departmental budget in his multi year spending review in order to avoid punish business and people once again with further taxis 
 the hon gentleman be jump the gun somewhat we deliver the spring statement just week ago in which we be able to restore the fiscal headroom after the change in global bond yield we will set out the budget in the autumn move to fiscal event a year which be very different from the multiple budgets we have from the previous government we have set the spending total for the spending review and we will be set out the departmental allocation on   june 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of her tax policy on investment in home 
 while short term let and home can benefit the tourist economy we recognise that they can impact the availability and affordability of main home in some   community that be why we have enable council to charge a premium of up to on the council tax bill of home increase the high rate of stamp duty land tax on the purchase of home and abolish the furnished holiday let tax regime 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response but i believe we can go far because this be not about the politic of envy but about the politic of social justice in cornwall it can not be right that through the small business rate relief system over £ of taxpayer money have go into the pocket of holiday homeowner in the last year many of those homeowner have flip their home into the small business rating system to take advantage of that loophole will the minister meet i so that we can find a more equitable way of spend public money that go into home rather than home 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his remark i agree with he about the importance of take the right action to tackle home i understand he have a meeting with the minister for housing and planning last week and i would be happy to follow up any item that arise from that our plan to build more home include new home in every year in cornwall and i hope he will support those building plan too 
 i wish to add my voice as an mp from cornwall to say that some of the action the government have take so far on home have be really helpful the renters rights bill will help with those eviction when people be flip their house i also ask that we look at the loophole between council tax and business rate and at the registration or licensing scheme on home which the government will hopefully bring in soon 
 i appreciate the concern that home owner may move to the business rate system i emphasise that there be requirement that must be meet before property can be assess for business rate those have recently be strengthen but we will keep they under review 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase the affordability of new home 
 the prime minister and the deputy prime minister have set out our ambition to build home during this parliament as part of our plan for change at the spring statement i announce step towards that ambition with an additional £ investment in social and affordable housing next year as a down payment on further investment at the spending review in june 
 i welcome the chancellor ’s build build build policy but with temporary housing in london cost £ a day soar rent and a frozen local housing allowance it be no wonder that london council fear go bankrupt and have to rehouse people from   outside the capital where only of home be affordable in the comprehensive spending review will my right hon friend look into possibly uprate this stingy tory legacy so that londoner be not force out of london 
 the key thing we need to do be build the home our country desperately need that be why i put £ of investment into create additional place for people to learn the construction skill we need and into good job pay decent wage and build the home we need that be also why we be reform the planning system so that we can actually get those home build we be back the builder not the blocker which be what the conservatives do 
 at the weekend the times reveal the problem in the retirement housing market in term of both new build and resale and many of my constituent have be experience a loss on the house and flat that they have inherit do the chancellor consider the housing market to be adequately provide decent affordable home for those who be downsize as well as time buyer 
 i would be very happy to arrange a meeting for the hon lady with the relevant minister to discuss some of those specific issue around retirement property she make a really important point we need to make it easy for people to downsize to free up those property include in the private sector so that more home be available for family 
 what step she be take to increase economic growth in the north east 
 secure economic growth across the country be the government ’s no mission we be work in partnership with the mayor of the north east provide the north east combine authority with an integrated funding settlement from and work with it on its local growth plan 
 the combined authority have identify a key growth corridor sweep across my constituency but a historical lack of investment to upgrade the moor farm and seaton burn roundabout cause relentless disruption and hold back growth investment and opportunity there be a business plan in the north east growth plan and in the road investment strategy do the minister agree that that be exactly the sort of scheme that this labour government should support to boost economic growth in every region 
 the government be commit to improve road we agree a £ settlement for national highways and fund a £ uplift for local road in this financial year funding for the ris3 programme which my hon friend mention will be consider in phase of the spending review and i encourage she to continue to engage with the minister for road on this issue 
 rise 
 i presume mr lamont think it be north east scotland rather than north east england 
 this government decide to cancel the a1 upgrade which will harm the economy not just in the north east of england but in the south of scotland what economic impact assessment do the government make before decide to cancel that vital road link 
 nice try in term of north east growth i have already say that we be work very closely with the mayor of the north east combine authority i suggest that the hon gentleman ask question about road relevant to his part of the country at transport question 
 i now call the minister to answer alistair carmichael ’s question on the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on farmer which be omit in error from early version of the order paper 
 if she will meet farming representative to discuss the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on farmer 
 as the minister with responsibility for the uk tax system i have have several meeting with organisation on this matter since the autumn budget last year on   february i and the minister for food security and rural affairs meet the national farmers union the tenant farmers association the country land and business association the central association of agricultural valuers the ulster farmers union nfu cymru nfu scotland and the farmers union of wales 
 i thank the chancellor ’s human shield for that answer but the fact that the chancellor who be sit on the front bench be not prepared to stand up and answer for herself demonstrate a distinct lack of respect for farmer border on contempt will she not meet the farming union the bank the professional organisation and even the supermarket themselves to hear why they all think her calculation be wrong if the minister want to ask she before he stand up i be sure we will all allow he a or 
 that be not the most dignified question from the right hon gentleman on the chancellor ’s behalf i have meet numerous organisation about this matter include those i list a moment ago i meet the right hon gentleman himself when he come to the treasury and of course there have be extensive debate in this place we may not agree on the way forward but i do not think anyone can accuse we of not have listen 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the uk international investment summit on level of foreign investment 
 increase investment in the uk both public and private be the government ’s absolute priority it be the route to restart badly need productivity and wage growth as the hon member will know at the international investment summit company commit to a record break £ worth of investment which be set to help to create around job 
 i thank the minister for that answer i particularly thank he for say that investment be the government ’s top priority because the government announce on   october   that they have secure this £ we have hear from the chancellor that she be go to act decisively so i just want to check her track record on that the government have have month and £ how much money have go out of the door for those oven ready project across the country 
 the hon member will be excited to know that the business secretary will be announce in the come week that shovel be already in the ground or will be go into the ground for some project i be a very good colleague to ministers so i be not go to pre empt that announcement today 
 a recent pwc survey show that the uk be now the most attractive investment destination among global chief executive ahead of country such as china germany and india that show that the government ’s careful stewardship of our economy have lead to stability within the global landscape do the minister agree that the uk be now open for business after year of conservative chaos 
 my hon friend consistently ask good question that go to the heart of the matter if i look back over the past year i see that british business investment have be the low in the g7 year after year we be go to put that right 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase economic growth through new transport infrastructure 
 the growth mission be the central mission of this government at the budget we deliver a £ cash increase to the transport budget for compare with represent a real term increase we will set out further spending plan for transport in june 
 what value do my right hon friend expect that the recently announce and much anticipate portishead and pill railway line will add to the local economy of my constituency of north somerset 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his campaigning on this issue as i represent the neighbour constituency i declare that the project may have some indirect benefit for my constituent i can confirm to the house that the project support regional and national strategic objective the west of england be the most productive city region outside of london and it be set to continue to grow an efficient and reliable rail link between bristol and portishead will support a range of large and small site for housing and employment across the region halve journey time and open a wide range of job and leisure opportunity for the resident of north somerset 
 if steel production cease or be curtail at the scunthorpe steelwork there will be a massive impact on the wide economy in northern lincolnshire can the minister give an assurance that contingency plan include improvement to transport infrastructure be in place should the bad happen 
 we recognise how important this issue be for the hon member ’s constituency the region and indeed the national economy my ministerial colleague in the department for business and trade be in discussion on this particular issue but in our infrastructure strategy we be consider as he would expect the good value for align investment between housing rail energy and other type of infrastructure to deliver growth for everyone in every region of the country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we know that the energy secretary be against airport expansion unless it be in doncaster and we know that many labour mp be against airport expansion unless it be in pakistan to be fair at least the chancellor want airport expansion actually in this country but at the same time she be jack up air passenger duty by as much as only this chancellor could be pro airport but anti passenger labour ’s climate change committee want to see air passenger number fall by so i ask the minister do he 
 no 
 what step she be take through the national wealth fund to increase regional economic growth

 i visit stockport with my hon friend and the mayor of greater manchester last year to see the regeneration work happen there link new investment in housing with transport infrastructure i thank my hon friend for his leadership last month alongside the increase in defence spending to of gdp we also set the national wealth fund ’s strategic direction with a focus on support for the defence sector through dual use technology create more good job in all part of the country include stockport 
 economic policy should benefit all region of britain include rural county such as lincolnshire where we grow a disproportionate amount of the food that feed the nation do the chancellor recognise that in an age when the big economy in the world be protect their industry include agriculture the time have come to reinvest in manufacturing and to consume more of what we produce here in britain to echo the call of the liberal democrats spokesperson we should buy british that mean use government procurement to back british job british project and british worker

 what discussion have the chancellor have with the northern ireland executive to ensure that the national wealth fund be use to promote economic growth in northern ireland do she not agree that the big impediment to growth be the fact that she be tax business to death 
 the office for budget responsibility have revise growth upwards from next year and expect the economy to be big at the end of the forecast period than it think at the time of the budget last year we be use the national wealth fund the british business bank and uk export finance to support business throughout the uk and we be recently able to announce significant investment at thales in belfast to create job in the defence industry there for the export of good to ukraine 
 what fiscal step she be take to support pensioner with the cost of living 
 the government ’s top priority for pensioner be to raise the state pension and to rescue the nhs this week more than pensioner see their state pension rise by well ahead of inflation that be worth an extra £ a year for someone on the full new state pension and £ a year for those on the full basic state pension 
 i have piece of outstanding casework relate to the winter fuel payment an elderly constituent email i during the winter enclose a picture show that her thermometer be at ° and say that she have to remain in bed for as long as possible each day to stay warm give that energy bill be now increase do the minister agree that the decision to cut the winter fuel payment have already have serious consequence for the welfare of pensioner throughout the country 
 what the government be do be raise the state pension extend the warm home discount and ensure that an extra people have have access to pension credit over the last month when member talk about mistake that have have lasting consequence for pensioner i look back to the coalition government ’s decision to cut the rate of energy installation by pensioner be live with that legacy in leaky home day in day out but this government be get on with insulate home throughout the country 
 the increase in the new state pension will make a huge difference to pensioner in my constituency what more be the government do to tackle the cost of living crisis leave by the last government 
 i thank my hon friend for be a regular attender at treasury question and indeed as far as i can work out at every other departmental question session he be right to suggest that we will do more because we be not just increase pension above the rate of inflation this year but do so throughout the current parliament and that should raise the state pension by up to £ by the end of the parliament

 we have hear from uk business that our regulatory system often hold back growth and investment we recently publish a regulation action plan and commit to cut the administrative cost of regulation for business by by the end of this parliament we be go far fast than ever before to streamline regulation and make britain the good place in the world to do business 
 the minister will know that both domestic and international investor be often influence by decision take by multiple agency regulator and indeed government departments which be why consistency be key can the minister update the house on how the treasury be support a whole of government and whole of regulator approach to deliver coherent uk regulatory framework that strike a balance between protect consumer and boost the global competitiveness of the uk economy 
 this be a whole of government approach and we have secure commitment from key regulator to improve the business environment the government be streamline regulation and strip back its duplication to ultimately deliver a regulatory system that encourage new investment innovation and growth 
 inward investment project in scotland grow by in compare with across the rest of the united kingdom see record investment in scotland which maintain its position as the top perform area of the uk for the year run international business want to locate in scotland because they understand that gdp per person in scotland have grow by compare with in the rest of the uk since what impact do the chancellor think her fiscal intervention since october will have on the attractiveness of scotland as a destination and what discussion have she have with the scottish government about the jeopardy that she have place our economy in 
 the chancellor deliver the big ever settlement for scotland in october and i think the answer be thank you 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there be a great deal of speculation about the future of the cash individual saving account as we know it be an important saving mechanism for many saver across the country all of whom will be dismay at the loss of a significant cash saving opportunity just as importantly cut cash isa will deprive building society of important fund for their balance sheet reduce the amount of capital available for the residential mortgage market this point have be raise with i by the mutual society give that the loss of the cash isa would have a profound effect on mutual ability to raise debt capital what research have the government undertake to establish the extent of the damage that such a measure might inflict on the residential mortgage market which be not just important for all our constituent but crucial for the new home that the government propose build 
 i work closely with the mutual and other financial service firm and i think the hon member be slightly jump the gun if he do not mind my saying so we be consider option to reform isa but we need to get the balance right between cash and equity we know that many people have investment in cash isa who could think about invest in our capital market which would be a win for they through high return and also for the economy however we absolutely understand the role that cash saving play in people have money for a rainy day 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to support people on the low income follow the spring statement 
 help people into good work and financial independence be at the heart of our approach to support people on the low income that be why we have increase the national living wage by which be equal to £ this year for someone work full time our plan to make work pay will tackle the poor job security and working condition that have be hold back our economy and the pathway to work green paper announce an additional £ investment in employment health and skill support 
 it be all very well for the minister to talk about help people into work but be he aware of the many million of people on personal independence payment who rely on they in order to work yet that pip will be slash as a consequence of the spring statement be he also aware that very many people would prefer the government not to balance their book on the back of some of the poor and most vulnerable people in our society why be the government reject a tax of just on people with asset of over £ which would raise over £ 
 at the autumn budget last year the chancellor announce a series of reform to fix the public finance in as fair a way as possible and make sure that the wealthy in society pay their share of tax the welfare reform announce in the spring statement be principle reform to help get people back into work because work be the good way out of poverty the reform also provide support for those who need it and make sure that the system be sustainable for the future 
 early this year i speak to member of my local christians against poverty debt support team in guildford and they explain to i that they support many low income individual out of debt but they be no soon out of debt than they start accrue it again because universal credit be insufficient to cover their basic need due to the cost of live in area such as guildford what work have the minister do to assess whether universal credit level be sufficient to cover the varied and increase basic living cost across the country and to prevent people on the low income from get far into difficulty and debt 
 the government have already take action on the fair repayment rate lower the cap on deduction from universal credit to 15%—it be before the autumn budget last year that will benefit household by an average of £ a year and of the poor family with child will benefit 
 i call the shadow minister 
 business have just be hit by the chancellor ’s £ job tax which will cost work family £ also business rate be nearly double for hospitality and retail business how do impose taxis that the office for budget responsibility say will result in low wage high price and few job help growth and those on the low income and will the chancellor keep she promise not to come back with more taxis in this parliament 
 the shadow minister talk about business rate support i remind he that if we have carry on with the plan inherit from the conservative party business rate relief would have end entirely this month it be only thank to a decision of this government that rat relief be continue for this year ahead of permanent reform that will permanently lower tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure premise on the high street from april that be thank to a decision this government make 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential merit of introduce a wealth tax 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential implication for her policy of the finding of oxfam ’s poll on taxation publish on march 
 this government be commit to ensure that the wealthy in our society pay their fair share of tax the chancellor announce a series of reform at autumn    budget to help fix the public finance as fairly as possible those reform include increase the rate of capital gain tax increase air passenger duty for private jet and raise stamp duty for buyer of or more home 
 analysis from a number of disability group show that the pathway to work green paper will have a detrimental effect on more than people while polling from oxfam show that of the public would rather the uk government increase taxis on the very rich than cut the benefit of the poor in society should we not be look at raise fund from those with the broad shoulder 
 as i make clear early the government have already make change to make the tax system fairer and to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share the reform to the welfare system be principle reform to tackle perverse incentive that encourage inactivity we need to support those in most need get people back into work wherever possible and protect the sustainability of the welfare system 
 let we be frank and not spin it for year we see austerity that rip the heart out of community we then have a global pandemic during which inequality be accelerate and we be still feel the effect of a cost of living crisis that be make ordinary people poor the public do not want cut or austerity they want an annual wealth tax on the very wealthy in society be it not time we have a government who do something different give people what they want and be willing to redistribute wealth for the benefit of many in society and to improve living standard 
 i politely suggest that if my hon friend think we be impose austerity he have not read the budget very carefully it contain increase to revenue spending in all department across the public spending envelope and an increase in capital investment we be ensure that we build for the future while protect our fiscal rule let i be clear those fiscal rule be not a nice to have addition to the way we approach the economy fiscal irresponsibility have a huge cost as we see under the previous government 
 we support the government in try to determine a fair level of tax especially for the very wealthy however will the minister establish if he can the number of people who might leave the country as a result of a wealth tax and therefore pay no income tax whatsoever 
 the hon gentleman make an important point we need to ensure that the wealthy in society pay their fair share while also attract talent from around the world to the uk to work invest and help to grow our economy it be on the back of that investment and economic growth that we will make people across the uk well off and get more money into their pocket 
 what step she be take to ensure rural community have access to banking hub 
 what step she be take to help protect in person banking 
 the government understand the importance of in person banking to community and be work closely with the industry to roll out banking hub across the uk more than hub have already be announce of which more than be already open 
 rural community such as settle in north yorkshire be really struggle with the loss of face to face banking service link hub be route for they to replace the bank that be close i urge ministers to do what they can with link i accept that it be an independent organisation to help it to relax the criterion for rural community allow they more face to face banking service 
 i would be very happy to meet the right hon gentleman if he want to discuss a specific banking hub that be be consider we work very closely with link as he will know his government pass the financial services and markets act under which the financial conduct authority link and the financial service sector ultimately have power over the criterion which be not something we be plan to change 
 how do the minister plan to make it easy to establish banking hub in community that have lose all of their bank i do have a meeting set up with the previous minister but she leave government before that meeting could take place will this minister agree to meet i so that i can discuss the establishment of a banking hub in the town of cheshunt in my broxbourne constituency 
 i be always happy to meet colleague and will be happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 the criterion apply by link be too strict and bank be be able to walk away from their customer in eltham we have have a salami slicing process of bank gradually leave the high street but because we have a building society we can not ask for a hub will the minister undertake to review link ’s approach because it be make it difficult for customer to carry out their banking business 
 as i say in my previous answer we do not have any plan to change the link criterion those be a matter for link however there be some flexibility in the way that it apply the criterion depend on the local population travel time to nearby bank branch and indeed the number of small business in an area i would be happy to meet my hon friend if that be of concern to he 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 mr speaker you shock i by move to topical question so quickly but i have now find my page and be ready to answer they 
 you need to get a new watch 
 from ferry to the national care service we have see failure after failure from the snp in scotland include a track record of waste in contrast this labour government be tackle waste and invest in frontline service such as our national health service which have see waiting list fall for each of the past month in england we hope that the people of scotland will soon have the opportunity to experience such a transformation 
 the chancellor set out in the spring statement a clear plan to drive well value for taxpayer include through the transformation fund which will transform frontline delivery while make saving in the long term do he agree that that be in stark contrast to the snp scottish government ’s record of waste 
 as my hon friend know we have give the scottish government the large increase in spending since devolution begin the people of scotland expect that money to be spend well which we be do in england by transform public service and improve the national health service however give that snp members be not present in the chamber today the people of scotland need to know that they will have to elect a labour government in scotland later next year for that to happen 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 it be obvious to many before the emergency budget that the president of the united states be go to be slap tariff on our export may i therefore ask the chancellor why it be that she come forward at the emergency budget with a recklessly slender slither of headroom the same headroom that she have at the time of the autumn budget which prove then to be entirely inadequate she blow that headroom and more due to her disastrous economic choice 
 i be sorry to disappoint the shadow chancellor but i be afraid that because of the ordering of question he be stick with i to answer his question he will have see at the budget that we increase the fiscal headroom back to our agreement of £ which be more than the headroom that we inherit from the conservative party the key difference be that this be a government who take economic and political stability seriously because when a government lose control of the economy they lose control of family finance and ultimately end up in opposition 
 just to correct the record the order paper have not change at all in topical 
 you be quite right about that mr speaker as you be about everything indeed the right hon gentleman be completely wrong when he say that he inherit less headroom than be the case at the autumn budget he inherit on the current budget £   and he take it down to £ to be precise he also loosen the fiscal target which be why he be not underwater already on the target that we have when we be in government 
 may i ask he this the fiscal target be look like they will be under a great deal of pressure come the autumn there be a great deal of speculation and uncertainty among business as to whether this will lead to tax increase can he take away that uncertainty now particularly give the tariff and all the uncertainty that be vest in that to make it clear at that dispatch box that there will be no further increase in taxation on business this parliament 
 my apology mr speaker it be our ordering that cause the problem not the ordering of question in the house 
 the right hon gentleman know that tight decision be take at the budget but we have be very clear that we be work hand in glove with business to be able to bring growth back to the economy and to ensure that investment private sector and public sector be come forward as he will know from his time of swim underwater this government be take a different approach to fiscal discipline and he should welcome that 
 the defence sector be a vital part of our local economy in derby particularly with the landmark £ deal strike with rolls royce which be support the royal navy ’s submarine and provide a major job boost do the chancellor agree that national security go hand in hand with economic security and in turn financial security for household 
 the duty of any government be to keep the nation safe that be why we be increase defence spending as a share of gdp to 2.5%—the big sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war derby have a vital role to play within the uk ’s defence sector particularly in nuclear engineering and aerospace as demonstrate by the landmark £ deal with rolls royce which will create up to job in the city and protect thousand more 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the fast action by the government to convene the automotive industry in reaction to president trump ’s damage tariff but the measure in and of themselves will not create new export market or stimulate demand here in the uk will ministers look at liberal democrat call to reintroduce the plug in car grant and equalise vat for electric vehicle pavement charging will the government instruct the valuation office to scrap business rate for ev charging bay until the transition be complete 
 the support that we announce yesterday on the phase out of internal combustion engine car be very much welcome by the automotive sector it will give much more flexibility around the allowance and around plug in hybrid vehicle all of that be welcome but we be keep a watching brief as well as try to   ensure that there be new market for car make in britain in other country around the world by secure more trade deal 
 what be the chancellor do to support business and boost wage in town such as burney padiham and brierfield which be forget for year under the previous government 
 my hon friend be do great work support local business in burnley include the digital marketing start up door4 which i know he have be champion 
 i have be contact by many local business include the cross keys pub in the holt heath nature reserve and the bear café in wimborne they be different venue in different location but both tell i that these be the most extreme trading condition ever see in hospitality with national insurance minimum wage and energy and food cost will the chancellor consider a reduction in vat on hospitality sale to protect high street and local producer and to save our community 
 i be unclear give the hon lady ’s remark whether she be oppose to the increase in the national minimum wage but she should know that we have extend support for business in business rate relief this year which would have be end entirely under the plan we inherit from the previous government and there will be permanently low multiplier for retail hospitality and leisure premise on the high street from april 
 as a north london mp i know that tackle the high housing cost in this city be a priority for my constituent it be my belief that route to that be invest in the country as a whole so that we be not just fly on london shape engine to that end do you know mr speaker that leeds be the large city in western europe that do not have a tram or a mass transit system that be a damn indictment of decade of economic failure will the chancellor do all she can to ensure that the leeds tram be build as fast as possible so that her constituent and mine can be well off 
 hear hear i have well declare an interest as a proud member of parliament for leeds west and pudsey west yorkshire combine authority be receive £ for transport spending through round of the city region sustainable transport settlement that include £ for the development of a mass transport system for too long leeds have lack this this government will put that investment in and get those tram run 
 with the job tax and the increase in business rate and as a result of us tariff it be vital that we stimulate the uk economy what be the chancellor ’s plan and can she expect we to see interest rate fall perhaps if she be listen to the question she would be able to answer 
 i think that be a question about business rate reform as the right hon lady will know we publish a discussion paper on transform business rate i be sure that the right hon lady will have read and respond to that so i will look out for her consultation response in what we have receive transform business rate be about ensure that we make the business rate system fit for the future to support investment and business growth right across the uk 
 will the minister join i in congratulate goodwin international which be build a multimillion pound production unit in newstead in stoke on trent south create up to job in defence manufacturing do he agree that increase investment in defence spending will have a tangible impact on my constituent fuel job and local investment 
 yes and i congratulate my hon friend on championing job and business in her constituency as she know the prime minister and the chancellor have confirm that defence spending will increase to of gdp by and that a minimum of of the ministry of defence equipment budget will now be spend on novel technology such as drone and artificial intelligence which will create highly skilled job and drive benefit to the wide economy include in her constituency of stoke on trent south 
 early in response to my hon friend the member for grantham and bourne gareth davies the chief secretary reject labour ’s climate change committee ’s advice regard aviation policy that also go directly against what the energy secretary have commit to who in government should we believe when it come to aviation policy 
 the right hon member know that we be support airport expansion alongside investment in thing like sustainable aviation fuel to be able to reduce carbon emission from long haul flight as well as support investment into decarbonise surface transport to help people get around the country and to their airport opposition members might want to welcome investment into this country as oppose to talk it down 
 will the minister introduce a month delay to the incoming change in taxation for double cab pick up truck the manufacturer and their commercial customer feel that they have have insufficient time to adjust to the new change this month can he share with we any impact assessment work carry out on the reclassification of double cab pick up and what effect it would have on the sector in britain 
 we have engage with the automotive sector on this issue and there be generous transitional arrangement in place to mitigate the impact the government have have to take difficult decision but at the autumn budget we prioritise long term support for growth drive sector include more than £ over year to support the automotive sector 
 ineffective energy trading with the eu be a major barrier for global investor accord to energy uk we be lose out on £ of investment in interconnector alone what will the government do to improve our energy trading with the eu to unlock this vital opportunity 
 the prime minister ’s plan for change set out our ambitious but achievable target of clean power by the clean power action plan demonstrate the significant investment requirement to reach that target include in renewable infrastructure and the action that we will take to facilitate that we have already take action to remove the de facto ban on onshore wind in england approve major solar project and deliver a record break renewable auction 
 the last government leave child in poverty but like many colleague i be alarmed that the impact assessment of the spring statement suggest that that number will rise not fall will the minister tell i when we can expect the result of the child poverty taskforce will they be deliver in time to influence decision in the spending review 
 my hon friend know that the government be commit to reduce child poverty and that we will be bring forward a child poverty strategy later this year it will look at lever that support household to increase their income such as support parent into secure employment support progression in the labour market and consider social security reform i confirm that the work of the taskforce be feed into the spending review 
 the chancellor talk early about the government ’s response to the new us trade policy but what be the government do about china ’s abuse of the world trade system in particular what will they do to challenge china ’s status as a develop country at the world trade organisation that be the mean by which china dodge so many of the rule impose on country such as britain and other in the west 
 trade issue be for the secretary of state for business and trade but i will say this there be rightly concern about global trade imbalance but the response of the united states by put tariff on all country include the uk which do not have a trade surplus be a disproportionate response to a genuine problem of global trade imbalance 
 i very much welcome the chancellor ’s commitment to invest in life science in this country may i encourage she to support the bid for a national mental health diagnostic and research centre in my constituency not least because poor mental health be estimate to cost this country up to £ a year in lose economic production 
 yesterday the prime minister announce reform to speed up clinical trial to ensure that the good new drug can come to this country benefit from our nhs on the issue of mental health treatment i agree with my hon friend about the importance of address that both for the health and wellbeing of   individual and because of the economic benefit that he speak to i be happy to arrange a meeting with the relevant minister 
 on   october the chancellor upend our economy through tax rise and punitive death taxis she have deliver a devastating blow to family farm and small family business the very backbone of our economy when will the chancellor recognise that she be elect by the people for the people every day that she avoid engage with the farming community be another day of wilful neglect our farmer be be drive out not by market force but by a government blind to their struggle and deaf to their voice when will she listen and speak with they 
 as the hon lady and i have discuss in several debate in recent month the decision we take on agricultural property relief and business property relief be difficult but it be the right and balance to ensure we protect family farm and small business while fix the public finance in a fair way fix the public finance be in the interest of every member of this house and all the constituent we represent because it underpin the investment we be put into the future of this country and into get the economy grow 
 many thousand of my constituent in paisley and renfrewshire south work in and rely on public service that be on their knee after year of under investment by the snp government at holyrood will my right hon friend set out how the view of my constituent will be reflect in the spending review 
 because of the decision that we make in the budget last year we be able to provide a record settlement for scotland wales and northern ireland it be a shame that the snp mps be not in the chamber today it be now the snp ’s responsibility to spend that money wisely and invest in public service we be bring down nhs waiting list in england and wales the same can not be say of scotland 
 in july my constituent alison claim a refund of overpay tax that be mistakenly pay twice in february she be tell that her claim would be assess by   march in july she be tell that it would be by   october and in december she be tell that she could not have a date but that the department have definitely receive she   claim month previously she have hear nothing since will the chancellor agree to meet i to discuss this very vexed situation for someone who have very little money give that this claim be nearly month delay 
 i be sorry to hear about the hon lady ’s constituent ’s experience with i assume his majesty ’s revenue and customs even though as the minister with responsibility for hmrc i can not get directly involve in individual case i be happy to raise it with hmrc and make sure that it give the matter proper attention to try and resolve it 
 local business have huge potential to create local growth in our community it be fantastic to see my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury visit derby south early this year and engage with business leader do the minister agree that continue engagement with business leader be absolutely key to build the business confidence that we so desperately need and which be shatter by the previous government 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for the invitation to join he in his constituency i very much enjoy the regional reception with business leader as i have do in every region and nation across the country during the spending review we will continue to work hand in glove with they to unlock investment create job and create growth for everybody across the whole country 
 early when the chancellor be talk about the impact of tariff she pledge that the government would act in our national interest how can it be in the whole national interest so long as the trade law govern northern ireland be not the trade law of the uk but those of a foreign jurisdiction namely the eu 
 we have an urgent question shortly 
 we inherit the settlement make by the previous government as the hon and learn member will know there be a summit between the uk and the eu on   may   where we will be look to reduce the barrier to trade between the whole of the united kingdom and the european union we recognise the specific issue around northern ireland particularly in regard to the response to the tariff and we will continue to work with the executive there to ensure that we get the good outcome for the people of northern ireland 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland if he will update the house on the likely impact on the northern irish economy of eu tariff on the us 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question as the prime minister have say tariff be not good news for anyone and no want a trade war the government be do everything possible to keep britain secure during this new era of global instability and we will always act in the good interest of business in northern ireland as part of our custom territory and internal market northern ireland exporter be face a general us tariff and a tariff on steel aluminium and car like other exporter across the united kingdom northern ireland be not therefore uniquely disadvantaged we be of course prepare for the eu ’s next move and any possible retaliatory tariff that it may or may not introduce as well as consider the impact that new eu tariff would have on northern ireland business import from the united states of america because under the windsor framework the eu tariff would apply 
 as hon member will know however because of the windsor framework business can reclaim any such tariff through the exist duty reimbursement scheme in case where us import into northern ireland do not then enter the european union the custom duty waiver scheme also allow duty to be waive entirely subject to an overall limit these scheme work in our national interest and his majesty ’s revenue and customs be continue to talk to and support any business that might be affect to help they understand how to use the duty reimbursement and custom duty waiver scheme the minister for the cabinet office have talk about all this with eu counterpart in recent day because the government be fully aware of how sensitive this issue be for business in northern ireland what we need in these circumstance be a calm and consider response and that be what the government will continue to provide 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you very much mr speaker for grant this urgent question it be incredibly important that this house have the opportunity to question the government on this issue before the easter break and before the implementation of these tariff i have enormous respect for my opposite number in the northern ireland office but it be totally unacceptable that we should have get to this stage in proceeding without a minister come to the house to update we on the likely impact on business in northern ireland of this emerge tariff war between the us and the eu as the house will know this come off the back of the considerable damage do to the economy in northern ireland by the budget last year by the increase in national insurance contribution and by the change to the national minimum wage which have completely undermine business confidence and which be drive unemployment in the region 
 i ask the right hon gentleman to answer the follow question a week on from the united states announcement and some time after the eu ’s publication of a page draft of its tariff response have the government now do an impact assessment of what this mean for the northern irish economy and for business in northern ireland and will he publish it 
 secondly he rightly mention the duty reimbursement scheme which would allow business take good from great britain to northern ireland and have to pay the eu tariff to reclaim that tariff that scheme be now go to be put under enormous pressure it be go to have to deal with volume not foresee when it be originally put together do the secretary of state have complete confidence that it will be able to reimburse business in a timely fashion so as not to disrupt trade 
 thirdly and finally because northern ireland remain within the eu custom code affect northern ireland business buy affect good will have to pay eu tariff but the same competitive business in gb will not what be the government go to do to ensure that such business be not leave disadvantaged and that we do not see serious distortion of trade with that in mind will the secretary of state confirm to the house that in the event that we see a major diversion of trade his government will be prepared to use article of the windsor framework which allow the government to take decision to ensure that business in northern ireland be not damage it be incredibly important that business hear from the secretary of state that the government be prepared to protect they in the event that this tariff war create a diversion of trade for business there 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question i be slightly surprised by his initial comment because of course we touch on this matter in northern ireland oral question 
 only because i raise it 
 indeed but we touch on this matter in northern ireland oral last week and the business secretary make a statement to the house last week 
 to answer the hon gentleman ’s question of course the government have be prepare for and look at all eventuality but until we know what the eu retaliatory tariff be it do not make much sense to publish speculation about their potential impact 
 on the duty reimbursement scheme i have meet hmrc official because i agree with the hon gentleman that it be important that the scheme work effectively depend on the number of northern ireland business that be affect to reimburse tariff i would just say however that northern ireland import about £ worth of good from the united states of america which be about of northern ireland ’s total purchase that impact upon his question we be go to have to take this a stage at a time the prime minister have make it quite clear that he will do what be in the national interest to protect our business our company and our economic future but it be precisely because of the windsor framework that the duty reimbursement scheme exist 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the eu be currently consult its member state on the good that it may target in response to the us tariff the secretary of state have speak about there be no need to make an assessment yet but in advance of the eu impose retaliatory measure have he make any assessment at all if there be any point be he engage with the european commission to ensure that the interest of northern ireland business and consumer be fully take into account in determine how the eu respond to the us tariff 
 as i indicate in answer to the opposition spokesperson of course the government have be prepare for all eventuality but as i also indicate there be no point in publish something that be not base on the actual tariff that the eu decide to impose therefore it be sensible to wait until that moment arrive 
 secondly the eu will take such action as it determine to be in its interest in response to the tariff that the united states of america have impose on the eu in addition to the tariff on steel aluminium and car let we not forget that the windsor framework give northern ireland business unique access to the european market which be not something that be enjoy by business in great britain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as the financial times report at the weekend and as i think the secretary of state have just confirm in the event of eu retaliatory tariff good import from the united states into northern ireland will by default be effectively force down the red lane that of course mean additional custom check time and red tape and in the event of their imposition eu tariff rate for good come into northern ireland irrespective of their ultimate destination that risk a scenario where northern ireland importer be penalise more than almost any other business in either the uk or the eu at the border and then in administer the reclamation of those cost 
 let we be clear this chaotic situation be entirely the consequence of donald trump ’s destructive trade war what be the government do to ensure that president trump and the us administration be alert to the deeply destabilising effect of their tariff policy on the good friday agreement and the prospect of peace in northern ireland what active step be the government take to mitigate the potential disruption to northern ireland business that be now unwittingly catch up in donald trump ’s trade war 
 the single most important thing we can do for those business in northern ireland be as i indicate a moment ago to ensure that the duty reimbursement scheme work speedily and effectively provide that those business can demonstrate that their good be not move into the european union for the obvious reason that otherwise northern ireland would become a back door for good seek to avoid the retaliatory tariff the government will take all necessary step to protect british business in the very difficult circumstance that we be face include by continue to seek to negotiate an economic deal with the united states of    america which we have be engage in for week now what come out of that remain to be see but it be part of the government ’s calm and consider approach 
 the complexity of trade relationship on the island of ireland be a result of brexit work north south be as important as work east west do the secretary of state agree that strengthen relationship not just with the european union but with the republic of ireland government can put northern ireland into a pivotal position to navigate this new uncertainty 
 we be all have to navigate this new uncertainty as a result of the decision that the us administration have make it be certainly true that leave the european union have create new complexity the reason why there be a windsor framework be that there be entity the united kingdom and the european union with different trading rule but an open border and some method therefore have to be find to deal with the consequence of that as i have say to the house before try to wish away that basic fact have not really work 
 it be important that we keep cool head there will be attempt subsequent to my question to relitigate the brexit war the fact of the matter be that the brexit deal and the windsor framework give northern ireland a unique competitive advantage export and access to the single market will the secretary of state consider a rapid automatic reimbursement scheme as the shadow secretary of state allude to that scheme be at the centre of ease tension should there be retaliation on the eu side 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the benefit that the windsor framework have give business in northern ireland in term of access to the eu market i would just say to he that in the event of eu retaliatory tariff rapid automatic do not quite square with the need of business in northern ireland that import american good because they have to demonstrate that those good be not then move on to the european union that require they to provide evidence to hmrc in order to get the tariff reimburse 
 i thank the secretary of state for his initial response to the urgent question of course this situation be a reminder that the people of northern ireland be absolutely right to oppose brexit in that referendum i be really disappointed that the shadow secretary of state start his supplementary question by complain about the lowest pay worker in northern ireland get a pay rise absolutely incredible the secretary of state touch on the trade negotiation between the uk and the united states can he reassure we that the situation in northern ireland be absolutely at the heart of those negotiation 
 i be very happy to assure my hon friend that the interest of all part of the united kingdom include northern ireland be uppermost in the mind of all ministers in try to deal with the situation we now find ourselves in 
 the secretary of state say that the eu will take action on tariff in its good interest but business in northern ireland expect the government to take action in the good interest of the united kingdom include northern ireland which be part of the united kingdom he talk about how this can all be resolve by the reimbursement scheme the fact of the matter be that the reimbursement scheme have fail business have to produce mass of information and there be delay in payment some business have to wait for hundred of thousand of pound to be reimburse in taxis that be not the answer surely the answer be for the uk to collect the taxis that we impose on american good and leave the eu to collect the taxis that it impose 
 what the right hon gentleman propose ignore the reality that face northern ireland as a result of the united kingdom ’s decision to leave the european union and the fact that there be a problem that have to be solve the duty reimbursement scheme owe its existence to the windsor framework it be important as i have say to the house that the scheme work effectively but business do need to provide information to demonstrate that the good have not subsequently move into the european union for reason that i think he understand 
 i be particularly concerned about the cash flow of small business in northern ireland in the event that the eu increase its tariff in his discussion with hmrc have the secretary of state establish what the average waiting time be for the duty reimbursement scheme to kick in be there any prospect of shortening that time if the amount of money out of the door increase in the event of eu tariff 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point for business in northern ireland as he would expect i have have precisely that discussion with hmrc the honest answer to the question of how long it take be that it depend on how quickly business provide the necessary information to demonstrate that good have remain in the united kingdom and have not move to the eu once that information be provide the scheme should work effectively it may help he if i point out that the customs duty waiver scheme a separate scheme allow up to € per company over a year rolling average which will obviously benefit small business if they come within that heading they do not have to pay the tariff up front 
 sadly i have hear nothing today that will give business in my constituency any reassurance that the uk government be prepared to protect they i recognise that it be not good practice to comment on speculation but it be and would be good practice to leave business in no doubt that the government their government to whom they pay hefty taxis will protect they from eu tariff we can not be leave in a scenario where business be reliant on a duty reimbursement scheme that do not work it take month to get repayment will the secretary of state give more clarity to business in upper bann that he will protect they 
 i have do my level well to set out the situation we all understand the reason northern ireland gain from the windsor framework because of its access—[interruption well it do gain from access to the eu market that other part of the united kingdom do not enjoy but there be a consequence which be what we be discuss in relation to the imposition of tariff by the united states of america that be a decision that the us administration have take and we all have to deal with the consequence hmrc have of course already be talk to business that might be affect to ensure that they understand how the tariff reimbursement scheme and the customs duty waiver scheme work 
 the government ’s advice to northern ireland business seem to be keep calm and carry on well that create an awful lot of uncertainty for small and medium sized enterprise in northern ireland will the secretary of state put a little more meat on the bone in relation to what the government be do as he say the eu will take action in its interest but that action may not be in the interest of northern ireland business or consumer what will the government do 
 in the circumstance in which this country and many country around the world find themselves we be have this discussion because of a decision that the united states administration have take we do not control that what we do have to seek to control be our response to it i have try to lay out for the house today what the position be and what be available to support business that may be affect by the eu tariff once we understand what those be we will see how extensive they may or may not be and then business will start to work out for themselves what be the consequence and how we can use the mechanism of the reimbursement scheme in the windsor framework to get back the money that they have to pay in a tariff 
 business require clarity and certainty will the secretary of state undertake to come back to the house as soon as we have that clarity and certainty will he ensure that the eu understand that the open border he keep talk about be an unclosable border and try to give business more certainty so that they can develop in the future 
 notwithstanding what we have be discuss today northern ireland import about £ worth of good from the united states of america which be about of the total purchase make by northern ireland the rest—98 of the purchase be unaffected by any eu retaliatory tariff relate to good bring into northern ireland as i travel round northern ireland i see that there be great business opportunity and lot of investment come in as i say to the house last week northern ireland have a high rate of growth than the uk as a whole and the low unemployment
