i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to amend the scotland act to transfer the power to legislate for a scottish independence referendum to the scottish parliament to provide that that power may only be exercise where the scottish public have demonstrate its support for the holding of such a referendum to provide that no such referendum may be hold soon than year after the previous such referendum and for connected purpose 
 madam deputy speaker 
 i ’m stand up for the right of self determination i ’m stand up for our territory i ’m stand up for our people i ’m stand up for international law i ’m stand up for all those territory those small territory and people the world over 
 those be the word of then prime minister margaret thatcher recount in her memoir the downing street years she go on to say 
 the principle of self determination have become a fundamental component of international law and be enshrine in the un charter 
 that principle she speak of the principle of the self determination of people be enshrine in the united nations charter when prime minister winston churchill sign the atlantic charter any notion that scot freely enter into the union by an act of self determination have no credibility whatsoever in a majority of scottish parliamentarian may have be persuade but the people be never consult the act of union in between england and scotland create the kingdom of great britain establish a single political entity yet preserve the territorial legal and institutional integrity of each partner country 
 the uk ’s constitution be not codify in a single document so the question of whether the act of union can be unilaterally dissolve by party be not clear however the accept position hitherto be that the union be a voluntary association of equal partner and that scotland have an unquestione right of self determination scotland ’s distinct constitutional tradition be well express by lord cooper in the case of maccormick v. lord advocate 
 the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of parliament be a distinctively english principle which have no counterpart in scottish constitutional law 
 in the pleading of   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry   in her prorogation case to the uk supreme court it be note that the parliamentary union between england and scotland may have create a new state but do not create nation in recent year the uk state have steadfastly refuse to acknowledge or honour that principle or the democratic wish of the scottish electorate accord to the distinguished academic and legal practitioner in international law professor robert mccorquodale 
 the people of scotland be distinct within the uk and have a right to self determination and as the people of scotland be a people for the purpose of the right to self determination the choice of the mean to exercise it be for the people to decide and not for the state 
 these be not obscure or arcane point of law they be precise and purposeful and accord to professor mccorquodale such treaty obligation be 
 bind under international law on all state 
 the question of whether the ancient nation of scotland should be an independent country once again continue to be the subject of much debate in short with current support sit at across the population and above among young people the matter be far from settle it be entirely proper for any country to review such important matter because scotland will only become independent as and when a majority of the people of scotland choose that path this demand the use of a democratic mechanism that be constitutional and satisfy international legal precedent this bill seek to standardise and codify such a requirement in line with the motion pass by this house that endorse the principle of the claim of right and acknowledge the sovereign right of the scottish people to determine the form of government well suit to their need 
 at that time the claim of right be support by every political party save the tories in particular liberal democrat mp such as ray michie and charles kennedy be forthright in their support for the principle of scottish sovereignty they be follow a home rule tradition in that party which never for a dispute scotland ’s right of self determination albeit they think scotland should choose a form of federalism rather than independence it would be unfortunate today if have already desert their historic commitment to the european cause the liberal democrats be to follow that by desert their historic commitment to respect scotland ’s national right this morning   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine   call this bill which favour neither side nor the other divisive and unnecessary when it be anything but it be in fact both liberal and fundamentally democratic 
 the effect of this bill should be uncontroversial for every member it merely establish in law an equivalent mechanism to the principle already concede by the uk government in relation to a border poll in northern ireland it establish that the power to legislate for a referendum require a democratic mandate from the scottish public to do so since that criterion have be meet in successive general election to the scottish parliament most recently in when a majority of msps be elect and a majority of vote be cast in favour of a manifesto commitment to deliver an independence referendum secondly the bill state that no such referendum may be hold any soon than year after any previous such referendum should members of this chamber deny scotland her legitimate claim on self determination that will put beyond doubt that the voice of the people of scotland be not welcome in this place and that a new approach must be consider 
 this bill offer both remedy and route it place the power to decide firmly where it belong in the hand of the people of scotland and it do so by transfer the power to hold a referendum on independence to the scottish parliament it be a parallel initiative to that be lead by my alba party colleague ash regan msp in the scottish parliament ms regan have bring forward a draft bill that will allow for a referendum to be hold to ask the people of scotland if they think that the scottish parliament should have the power to negotiate and legislate for independence its purpose be to consult the people of scotland on their opinion on extend the provision of their parliament to hold such a referendum a proposition support by the expert legal opinion of aidan o’neill kc both proposal   have at their heart the democratic imperative that scotland ’s political destiny must be in the hand of the people of scotland not in the hand of the westminster parliament or the supreme court how do the behaviour of the uk government or the repeatedly espouse position of the opposition party constitute access to meaningful political process as claim in the recent uk supreme court judgment 
 in the aftermath of the referendum the all party smith commission agreement be sign by all scotland ’s main political party snp labour tory and liberal democrat and it state 
 it be agree that nothing in this report prevent scotland become an independent country in the future should the people of scotland so choose 
 while each have fail to deliver on that commitment this bill provide a necessarily equitable and democratic mechanism for the people of scotland 
 in in this place the equality of the uk partner country be assert by a liberal mp william ewart gladstone when he say that 
 if i be to suppose a case in which scotland unanimously or by a clearly preponderate voice be to make the demand on the united parliament to be treat not only on the same principle but in the same manner as ireland i could not deny the title of scotland to urge such a claim ”—[official report   april vol c. 
 john major when he be prime minister say of scotland that 
 no nation could be hold irrevocably in a union against its will 
 it be increasingly apparent that this be not a union of equal the uk be wilfully subvert the will of the people of scotland by deny they their establish human right as enshrine in the un charter and in international treaty obligation that the uk state enter freely 
 i cite the word of lady thatcher at the opening of my speech but she go far 
 the scots be an historic nation with a proud past have an undoubted right to national self determination should they determine on independence no english party or politician would stand in their way however much we might regret their departure 
 whether i like it or loathe it we be in this union i hold that it be incumbent on every mp elect on an independence ticket to explore every option with courage and conviction today this chamber face a choice affirm that this be a voluntary union of equal or tell the world that scotland be a mere possession to do with as it wish this bill be a necessary condition of secure scottish democracy and i commend it to the house 
 the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker order   january and   standing order no 
 order i regret to inform the house that there be a technical fault in the audio system there be not a technical fault here in the chamber there be in my own voice but that be something to be remedie in another way but there be a technical fault which mean that our proceeding can not be broadcast apparently it be inappropriate for we to proceed without our proceeding be broadcast so with great reluctance i be require to suspend the house in the hope that this fault will very soon be rectify i be go to suspend the house for only minute in the hope that the work can be do to enable we to be broadcast to those who be listen and pay attention the house be therefore suspend for minute 
 sitting suspend 
 on resume 
 in the hope that we be now broadcast we will commence if the audio feed be not work properly please do not let anyone judge by my voice whether it be or not people observe from around the palace of westminster be more than welcome to come to sit in the gallery and member wish to observe proceeding from their office may come to observe from the chamber 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with ofgem on trend in the level of consumer energy debt 
 what recent discussion she have have with ofgem on trend in the level of consumer energy debt 
 the secretary of state be unwell and send her apology both to you madam deputy speaker and to the house 
 minister in the department regularly meet ofgem to discuss a range of issue the secretary of state meet supplier alongside ofgem in november to discuss consumer energy debt and the protection of vulnerable customer i know that many family be struggle with their energy bill this winter which be why we be provide cost of live support worth £ between and 
 i be grateful for that answer just a few day ago the office for national statistics show that the number of household who have be unable to pay their energy bill have increase by nearly do the minister on behalf of the secretary of state who i hope get well soon accept that the uk government ’s failure to listen to stakeholder such as citizens advice which be call for the £ energy bill discount to be reinstate have lead to soar energy debt among those who can least afford it such as my constituent 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he be right to highlight the issue of debt and family who be struggle this be why we be provide £ or on average £ per household between and which be of the most generous package in europe in the autumn statement we increase the national living wage which be worth £ to a full time worker and increase benefit by 6.7%—that be worth £ just last week we also deliver a tax cut for people which be worth £ for the average worker so we be take step but we recognise the reality for many people that he set out 
 in my country energy debt be rise as scottish consumer pay a premium on their energy bill it be a high price to pay to keep the light on in england in the light of that imbalance have the minister discuss abolish the not fit for purpose ofgem if not should his government not give full responsibility for energy pricing in scotland to the scottish parliament 
 we have move decisively to support family in scotland and across the rest of the uk i be pleased that the price cap have fall by half since its peak last year and we be make sure that our support be target at the most vulnerable i have already lay out many of the measure we be take precisely to ensure that people in scotland and elsewhere be support in what have be a tough time overall we be of course look to power up britain we have set out a plan to do that precisely in order to have more of our power come from britain and to remove our dependence on foreign fossil fuel i hope that the hon gentleman and his party will support we in our effort to deliver that 
 i call the scottish national party spokesman 
 the situation for bill payer this winter be even bad than it be last winter which be why the snp have call for the reinstatement of   the £ energy support scheme however the government have stubbornly refuse to sufficiently stand by householder who be freeze all over these island despite report of increase hospitalisation and the doubling of burn from hot water bottle in scotland how will the tories extend just a fraction of the interest they have show in exploit scotland ’s natural energy resource to the people of scotland who be freeze yet again this winter 
 as i set out in response to the hon gentleman ’s colleague we have act decisively offer among the most generous support of any nation in europe we can be proud of the effort we have make and i be pleased to see that the energy price cap be down so significantly 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on support the growth of the nuclear energy sector 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 last week i announce the big expansion of nuclear power for year we will deploy a fleet of small modular reactor and build up to gw of nuclear by this will ensure we have reliable cheap and low carbon power to protect consumer from price volatility and hostile foreign regime bolster our energy security 
 a new civil nuclear road map be a welcome step in grow our nuclear sector potentially create job across the united kingdom from the north of scotland to the south west peninsula and include site like wylfa what assessment have he make of the economic impact of the potential growth of the nuclear sector for the south west region particularly give the nuclear expertise at site such as devonport and hinkley point 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the nuclear sector support job across the united kingdom and it would be very welcome if government across this united kingdom be to come together and champion that industry as it grow over the next few decade the nuclear sector be vital to the economy of south west england as my hon friend know provide up to job in construction alone at hinkley point c and will go on generate highly skilled job for generation as we continue to build up this important part of our energy security 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer and the announcement of the nuclear road map small modular nuclear reactor can bring energy to our town and city across the country very quickly they be under development right now so when can we see the instal and provide power to the grid 
 my hon friend will be pleased to know we be bring forward small modular reactor and that the next phase of the live smr competition will launch within week our aim be for the competition to be the fast of its kind in the world to help facilitate final investment decision for the project be take in the next parliament and operational project be here in the uk by the 2030s the launch will mark a significant step forward for eligible company and for the uk ’s broad nuclear ambition 
 we have give away over the decade the massive advantage this country have with the calder hall development in so will my hon friend reassure i that we will regain that ground by push for more rapid development of a sensible nature as the finns have with their hole in the ground for store nuclear waste will he inform the house with which nuclear vendor the department be engage 
 my hon friend be right to refer to the proud history we have in this country when it come to civil nuclear the development at calder hall lead the world and the deep geological disposal that be happen in finland right now the plan in our nuclear road map will quadruple nuclear capacity by we be make rapid progress on sizewell c and the smr competition we continue to work closely with country such as finland with which i engage with regularly it have build and operate large scale geological disposal facility and sign up to the cop pledge to triple nuclear capacity 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to smr which be the way forward for the future of nuclear sheffield forgemasters be ideally place to produce the essential part for those reactor and have a memorandum of understanding with both rolls royce and hitachi will the minister meet the mayor of south yorkshire sheffield forgemasters and other in the consortium the consortium now have access to significant development capital so we can build the smr in south yorkshire and create the thousand of well pay job we want as well as green energy 
 i would be delighted to meet the mayor of south yorkshire through the nuclear road map we be commit not only to ensure our energy security and achieve a further drive towards our net objective but to build up the supply chain and create those high wage high skilled job at all level across the united kingdom of course i would be delighted to meet the mayor of south yorkshire and indeed anybody else who represent an area that want to invest in this future and this great exciting moment for nuclear capacity 
 i too be in favour of new nuclear it be an important part of a balanced green energy mix do the minister share my concern that much of the investment in new nuclear in the uk be come from overseas company and even the government of overseas country especially give that the emphasis be not just on reduce carbon emission but on energy security would he perhaps consider other form of renewable energy such as tidal power   for which the entire supply chain be british and which would be great for our economy as well as for tackle climate change 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i hold a contrary position i be proud of the fact that this country be open to inward investment and indeed attract attention from some of the big company in the world to invest in our future energy security and net objective of course in unveil all these exciting announcement as we do last week at the heart of what we be seek to achieve be to create those high wage high skill job as we move forward across the united kingdom build up that supply chain and tidal will be an important part of the mix as well 
 i thank the minister for that most progressive answer the progress make in nuclear safety and the need for clean energy clearly indicate that the government must invest in the security of this sector that would lower energy cost and help we to meet our green target which we all want to meet and should meet will the minister outline what progress have be make to secure this investment 
 as the hon gentleman know just last week we unveil our civil nuclear road map i commit to meet he and indeed anybody else from northern ireland to seek to build up the manufacturing and supply chain workforce in northern ireland so that all part of our united kingdom can benefit from the once in a generation investment that we be make right now 
 what recent assessment the government have make of the environmental impact of onshore wind farm cable 
 the environmental impact of onshore windfarm cable be assess through the consenting process minimise potential environmental impact of new infrastructure be a government priority we be committed to ensure that new electricity network project mitigate environmental impact at every opportunity 
 although i be a huge supporter of offshore wind there be no doubt that the trenching through my beautiful countryside be not without its own set of problem flooding agricultural run off and pollution have all be hugely exacerbate since the summer with what have happen in north norfolk what measure do we really have to force wind company to clean up and repair the countryside after the damage they cause when they trench through it 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for persistently raise these issue to make sure that we get the transmission infrastructure that we need but in a way that have the minimum negative impact on his constituent and other i will follow up his question today by look specifically at the regime make sure that the company concern not only go   through all the correct permissioning ahead of time but be properly follow up to ensure that they deliver it in a way that do not leave the problem that he have itemise 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on   november i ask the minister how many planning application for onshore wind have be lodge in england since the allege loosening of planning restriction on onshore wind in september the answer then be even now that the policy have have more time to bed down the answer i be afraid be still and i predict that it will be the next time we meet in september last year the secretary of state say that the change make in september 
 will help speed up the delivery of onshore wind project 
 do the minister think that the government have succeed 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question as he will be aware in the last contract for difference round a great deal of onshore wind be successfully bring forward and it still constitute the large single form of renewable energy in the united kingdom the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   will correct i if i have get that wrong i share with the hon gentleman a frustration in make sure that we see that pull forward so that we see more project in england as well as in the rest of the uk 
 i be glad the minister be frustrate about the complete failure of this allege policy turnaround but i be frustrate because if we have not have the absurd ban in the place the onshore wind development that would have take place would have save each family £ on their energy bill all labour be suggest be that onshore wind be treat like any other development how long will it be before the minister accept the reality and conclude that he need to go back and properly repeal the ban 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and his personal commitment to this area but he know as well as anyone the parlous performance of the previous government which his right hon friend   the member for doncaster north edward miliband   be a lead figure in less than of our electricity come from renewable as recently as it be this government that have lead the world after a flatlining in carbon emission from our electricity sector under labour we have see renewable grow and by october we will see coal entirely remove from our mix 
 i call the snp spokesman 
 new renewable energy generation demand new transmission infrastructure this government have be asleep at the wheel for year show pace ambition or grip in deliver that energy infrastructure and that be why bill be so high nevertheless we be where we be will the minister confirm to the house for the record what national grid   have say that uk government policy be that when construct new transmission infrastructure overhead line be the starting position 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question of course we have be move at pace we have have the winser review and the connection plan in the autumn statement and indeed the prime minister ’s speech in september there be so much to drive forward and change the transmission infrastructure include halve the year timeline to year we be work flat out 
 it should be note that the reason overhead line be prefer be the cost of undergrounding not only be it vastly disruptive as my hon friend   the member for north norfolk duncan baker   say either undergrounding or offshore be to time more expensive than have overhead infrastructure and sometimes even more than that that be why it be the starting presumption we want to power britain from britain and in a low cost manner so that when we get to the 2030 and we have decarbonise our electricity system we have a low cost electricity system while ensure that we install the infrastructure in a way that be friendly and supportive to community 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential merit of energy social tariff 
 the government remain focused on provide help where people need it most we be already provide a package of support total over £ or £ per household on average from to 
 last year the government promise action to help the most vulnerable with their energy bill in april the secretary of state ’s predecessor   the right hon member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps say that 
 a social tariff could be very helpful”.—[official report   april vol c. 
 nearly a year on we have hear absolutely nothing about a social tariff will the minister explain to the house why the government have abandon plan for a social tariff 
 as the hon member will know we be continue our support for vulnerable household and it be important that we help household as well we can as an example we have the £ cost of living payment and the warm home discount payment obviously we will constantly monitor where we be and will ensure that we continue to support all those vulnerable household 
 there be indeed a need for a social tariff whether it be a cost of live crisis or a lack of wage crisis give that the resolution foundation report at the beginning of december that average wage across the uk be £ low than they should be compare with other comparable country follow the past year there probably be a lack of wage crisis hit the uk 
 regardless the energy security and net committee say in our prepare for the winter report in paragraph 
 we urge the government and energy supplier to consider implement a form of social tariff and other measure to protect vulnerable household from be cut off from their energy supply 
 that be a unanimous report across labour members tory members and of course the pro scottish independence voice on the committee but will we see some movement on this from the government it be important and need by everybody and it would be particularly welcome to my constituent in na h eileanan an iar 
 as i have indicate we be do a lot of thing to help people include the most vulnerable in society it be worth point out that it be announce recently in the autumn statement that the national living wage will be worth £ for a full time worker and that benefit will increase by which be worth £ a year 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter 
 fuel poverty be devolve statistic for england be publish annually by the department the next english statistic will be publish on   february   and will include estimate of the number of household in fuel poverty in and 
 just under a of people in my jarrow constituency be now live in fuel poverty like maureen who tell i she be struggle to find an extra £ per month due to the disability price tag that will be make bad by the recent news of the energy price cap rise can the minister explain why the government still insist on give subsidy worth billion to the oil and gas industry through loophole in the windfall tax would that money not be well spend cut people ’s bill 
 i must point out the work the government have be do to help vulnerable people not only that but we have halve energy bill i have constant meeting with all stakeholder include citizens advice and all the disability group and we be ensure that we be support all vulnerable people in the cost of live crisis and as we go through this winter 
 i also have increase number of constituent with significant level of energy debt come to my office seek fuel voucher why be the government pursue the offshore petroleum licensing bill which the minister herself have say will not bring down bill when economic forecaster warn that delay in   decarbonising will leave consumer with high price be it not time the government drop the focus on fossil fuel and deliver instead the public investment in renewable energy that will bring down bill and go some way to avert the climate catastrophe 
 we be commit not only to help vulnerable people but to make sure we be provide the good energy security we can that be why we be committed to all the policy we have introduce 
 i listen very carefully to the answer the minister give to my hon friend   the member for blaydon liz twist but i be still none the wiser so i will ask again can the minister set out what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government about the social tariff which the previous secretary of state describe as very helpful 
 just to reiterate i have be have conversation with all stakeholder and when i say stakeholder that do not just mean citizens advice or disability rights uk but across government and with different devolved department 
 i be sure the minister will agree that energy security and support the most vulnerable in fuel poverty go hand in hand the way to address security be by both secure supply and cut waste can she set out what the government and her department be do to reduce the waste of energy from people ’s home 
 i want to acknowledge how hard my hon friend work for his constituent of course those be the thing we be most mindful of make sure we get energy efficiency not only in production but in the way we use that energy 
 what recent discussion she have have with business on the government ’s net target 
 what recent discussion she have have with business on the government ’s net target 
 i meet regularly with business leader and chair several group bring together government and industry so that we can drive progress towards net that include the net council which be meet next week and include member from right across the economy like i they be delighted that the uk be lead the world in tackle climate change we be the major economy to halve its emission ahead of every other major economy and we have of the most ambitious decarbonisation target in the world 
 contrary to what the minister have just say and to what he say about onshore wind this country have fall on his party ’s watch to in the world for attract investment in renewable well pay job low bill and economic growth will all follow   but only if we attract investment so why be the government enable what ey have describe as the diminishing of green policy and undermine the economic benefit of net 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question which have a sort of comic element give labour ’s monumental failure to deliver renewable when it be in power couple with the fact that it want to bring forward gb energy that as his left wing colleague   the hon member for cynon valley beth winter   just say would be public investment it would drive out private investment and destroy the transformation of the uk energy system that have happen under the conservatives it have flatline under labour we have lead the world and have now decarbonise more than any other major economy on the planet under the policy of this conservative government which major world economy be predict to decarbonise fast by this 
 if i may puncture the minister ’s rant i would like to ask he what certainty his government will give business we need a £ combined investment from the public and private sector but because target have be miss that figure will need to double or treble every year between now and accord to a public accounts committee report the government ’ chop and change in deliver what they need to do be a big problem in business have the confidence to invest that have happen on his watch so what be he do to improve the situation 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for her work on the committee in hold the government to account of course we have realise £ of investment into clean energy since and we have a plan which we set out in power up britain the labour party have only an intention to borrow £ a year put up family taxis put up bill and destroy the most investable market in europe that we have have to date we will have another £ of private investment by and the conservatives will carry on our work lead the world in transform our energy system so that we have low cost home produce energy while also deliver on net thing that signally do not happen under labour 
 uk start up newcleo and french start up naarea nuclear abundant affordable resourceful energy for all have just announce a partnership to promote small modular nuclear reactor what support be the uk government provide and what proportion of our energy mix do the minister think this kind of initiative can support 
 my right hon friend be right and it be great to see excitement across the chamber about develop nuclear it be just a shame that when it come to the secondary legislation to enable the business model labour members do not support it they say thing in place and a different thing when it come to make the law of the land i be pleased to say to he that under the conservatives the plan be to bring the job technology and opportunity of small modular reactor to this country as part the ambition for up to of our electricity to come from nuclear by 
 i have be talk with business in south ribble about achieve net business on leyland business park be explore geothermal and we also have the huge advantage of the howick cross substation bring in energy from offshore wind onshore wind in scotland and the north west and welsh nuclear fleet do my right hon friend agree that in future business will look to site themselves where there be reliable and accessible cheap energy and that south ribble be well place to take advantage of that 
 my hon friend be quite right to highlight the benefit and attraction of south ribble and indeed the wide uk economy it be not just that the area that have those service will attract business within the united kingdom by rewire and lead the world in deliver a low cost low carbon energy system we can attract more investment from abroad and have a renaissance not least in the north of england but also in wales and scotland all around the country that be a result of the net policy that uniquely this country be manage to lead the world on follow so many year of labour failure 
 the minister will know that the climate change committee have a key role in advise the government on their path to net but he will also know that month on from the resignation of lord deben as chair of that committee the government still have not announce a replacement despite application for the role have be submit and several people already have be interview be the government scar of have their record scrutinise or be they simply determined to destroy any last shred of the uk ’s climate leadership will the minister tell we now when the selection will be announce 
 give the hon lady ’s lifelong passion for this subject i find it extraordinary that she never ever recognise the unique achievement of this country in halve emission i would have think she would celebrate that as the hon lady will know the climate change committee ’s chair be not just a matter for the uk government the appointment of the chair of that committee have to be agree by the devolved administrations as well and we be move as quickly as we can 
 who be hold it up 
 the good thing as barrister know be to not ask a question unless you already know the answer because it might not suit you we be move as quickly as we can to make sure that we have a chairman in place i share the hon lady ’s belief that it be an important role and we want to have it fill as quickly as possible 
 of the most effective way in which we can hit our net target be by deliver an effective carbon capture and storage industry and i be delighted to see the government make an announcement just before christmas about the next round of that the morecambe bay net project base in my constituency could deliver a gigaton of carbon storage help some of our most energy intensive industry through this transition period i invite my right hon friend to come and visit 
 i be not the minister who lead on carbon capture usage and storage so i may have just swerve a visit but of course i be always delighted to talk to my hon friend if i can lean on my colleague in the house of lords who be responsible for that policy area i will let he know of my hon friend ’s kind offer i share his enthusiasm by capture the renewable around the uk and convert they into low cost electricity as we be also take forward hydrogen and use the natural blessing of have so much carbon capture capability we can deliver this country the job the opportunity and the low cost energy system for the future i look forward to my hon friend ’s continue support 
 i call the shadow minister 
 have share a constituency border with the former member for kingswood for year i know that he be genuine in want what be good for his constituent he know that a green transition would protect their job at rolls royce and airbus help the science park to thrive and bring opportunity for small and medium sized enterprise and the self employ he know that home insulation and clean energy would bring warm home to warmley and woodstock and low bill to bitton he resign because he have lose all hope that this government would deliver on those thing he be right be he not 
 just to spell it out because we do have to speak very slowly for the opposition front bench team we have cut our emission more than any other major economy and our plan and the expectation of the un be that we will continue to lead the world that be lead the world not talk about it not promise to borrow £ and put everyone ’s taxis up and then fluctuate on a daily basis it be about delivery we have deliver and will continue to do so 
 if we want to see the reality of labour on energy we only need to go to nottingham there labour invest in robin hood energy which go spectacularly bust a forerunner of a labour government perhaps if there ever be to be it be typical of labour to reverse all the principle of robin hood all labour do be steal from the poor in order to pay for the bailiff 
 how many home have energy efficiency measure instal in a and b 
 how many home have energy efficiency measure instal in a and b 
 because of our plan half of home now meet the government ’s energy performance certificate band c goal a significant jump from in in low cost measure be target with installation in funding shift to high cost measure to benefit low income household and less efficient home result in approximately installation last year 
 i fear that the minister may be refer rather too much to new build home the reality be that in there be insulation measure introduce into cavity wall and loft yet in in comparison there be only that have leave my constituent in reading and woodley who mainly live in victorian and century home struggle with very high bill so what be the minister go to do about that 
 the hon gentleman do not acknowledge that we have move from to because of the action of a conservative government to answer his question directly we be allocate around £ to clean heat and energy efficiency over this parliament and the next which will benefit his constituent that include our great british insulation scheme worth £ which will deliver insulation measure to around of the country ’s least energy efficient home save they £ to £ each year by march 
 i echo the observation of my hon friend   the member for reading east matt rodda i remember in long before i come into this place work endlessly with cambridge city council and energy provider on encourage people in the city to take up home insulation scheme since then we have see precisely nothing nothing have be go on labour have a huge ambition for the future what be the government ’s ambition 
 i know mathematic be not a strong point for the labour party but i will go over the figure again to over the course of the last parliaments deliver by the action of this conservative government we have a plan to continue to deliver for the least well off in those home that need more energy efficiency measure as i just say to the hon member ’s colleague we be allocate £ to clean heat mechanism over this and the next parliament and we be go to continue to deliver for the british people 
 thousand of new home be be build across the kettering constituency what be my hon friend do together with the department for levelling up housing and communities to decarbonise the future housing stock and improve energy efficiency in new build housing 
 we recently announce further detail of the £ extension that will be allocate from to this will support an extra home prioritise those who need it most but include new build and be on top of support for family to install improvement through the great british insulation scheme and the energy company obligation by march 
 what recent discussion she have have with ofgem on the compensation payment process for household that have have prepayment meter wrongfully instal 
 i have meet ofgem and supplier to reiterate my expectation that the new rule will be follow ofgem have announce   that if a supplier wrongfully install a prepayment meter it will be expect to compensate its customer appropriately 
 force the installation of prepayment meter in the home of some of our poor and most vulnerable constituent be frankly a scandal although the government rightly pause force installation last year some energy company have be allow to resume this outrageous practice under a new rule regime which the minister refer to that still face many question do the minister think that in the middle of winter in a week when we have see temperature drop dramatically we can trust energy supplier that have a history of unscrupulous practice in force fit energy meter in the home of vulnerable people to in effect self regulate will the government instead legislate to ban the scandalous force installation of prepayment meter once and for all 
 i acknowledge how awful it be that people have their home break into to force fit prepayment meter but there be also a place for prepayment meter to enable people and to support people out of debt i reassure the house that i have scrutinise every level of the regime for prepayment meter now that we be go back to reinforcement to absolutely ensure that we will not see all the scandalous practice that happen before 
 what step she be take to support the oil and gas sector 
 the north sea be a mature basin and production will naturally decline in the come year the government be commit to support our oil and gas industry and the energy transition which be why we have the north sea transition deal and have introduce the offshore petroleum licensing bill we want to protect investment the job support by the sector and the ten of billion of pound come in in taxis as well as to use the exist industry to deliver the wide energy transition 
 the government ’s action to use gas and oil reserve in the uk for the smooth transition to renewable source be important for our energy security but also offer great employment and wealth prospect in the process be the minister aware that offshore energies uk publish a workforce insight last year that highlight that the number of people work in the sector could be increase by for that to become a reality the sector need to be stable and competitive what commitment can my right hon friend offer to the stability and competitiveness of the sector 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right this be a decline basin and it be so important as we go through the transition that we do not lose the skill and job of those people who be provide the oil and gas on which we currently rely no country be do more to decarbonise than we be but we will continue to use oil and gas for decade to come as our production fall even more quickly than our demand and even more quickly than be require globally it be essential that we support the industry send the signal that my   right hon friend suggest and rebut the attitude of the labour party which would destroy those job lose the tax and put up emission 
 i welcome the fact that belatedly the government have accept that despite their net policy the oil and gas industry be important for the future in the united kingdom do the minister recognise that to benefit from the oil and gas in the north sea that will be release by the new licensing regime we need to have refinery capacity there have be little if any investment in refinery capacity because of the uncertainty of the future and the carbon taxis place on it when will the minister address that issue to ensure that we get the full benefit of the oil and gas that we extract from our shore 
 effectively we be part of a european market most of the gas that we produce be consume in the united kingdom and most of our oil be refine elsewhere in europe and contribute to european and uk energy security as it be convert into product it be join up market for historical reason and our refinery be use predominantly for oil that come from abroad as oppose to that which come from the north sea these be multi decadal investment and as part of a manage decline in demand we will see refinery capacity reduce over time we be do absolutely everything to do this in the most sensible manner possible and it be a shame that labour members would have we import more they be all in favour of oil and gas job so long as they be not in the uk and they will bring in foreign import from which we will get no job and no tax with high emission it make no sense and only   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband   could champion such an insane policy 
 what step her department be take to help energy intensive industry to decarbonise 
 as chair of the all party group on carbon capture utilisation and storage the hon member will know that the government have commit £ to support the early development of carbon capture usage and storage and up to £ for the industrial energy transformation fund to help industry to decarbonise with phase opening shortly 
 i welcome the investment in carbon capture we just need to get on and make something happen there teesside be home to some of the most energy intensive industry in the country but instead of attract more of those industry include primary steel making we be see plant close down and job lose because investor do not see any industrial strategy from the government high energy cost mean that it be cheap to import many of the good that until now we have make at home why be the government content to see this manage decline rather than back the kind of strategy that will protect exist industry and drive investment and job creation 
 this government invest throughout the country with our levelling up agenda but we have of course be invest in the steel industry and we be mindful to ensure that we have the skill that will take we forward for those future requirement 
 i call the shadow minister 
 my hon friend   the member for stockton north alex cunningham   be of course absolutely right we have see manage decline under this government with no coherent industrial strategy total failure to get the grid connect where we need it and different departments give mixed message and provide complicated process to access any support 
 on top of all that our industry have to pay twice as much on its energy bill compare with european competitor a recent report by uk steel state that our steel producer have to pay £ more per year on electricity force the government to deliver a subsidy through the supercharger which in turn raise bill for everybody else instead of such short term policy be it time for labour ’s industrial strategy labour ’s grid reform and labour ’s mission to become a clean energy superpower so that we can permanently cut bill for everyone grow our economy and give britain its future back 
 this government have demonstrate our commitment to help across the domestic and non domestic sector however we also recognise the vital role that the steel sector play in our economy in fact the net strategy reaffirm our commitment to continue to work with the steel industry on decarbonisation 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the uk be the major economy to halve its emission since the prime minister ’s speech in september we have announce the £ green industry growth accelerator help to deliver the global agreement to transition away from fossil fuel at cop28 act to protect motorist from unfair price at petrol station announce backing for major project to produce green hydrogen and commit to the big nuclear expansion in year we have a plan our plan be work and it will get we to net it will guarantee our energy security and bring consumer and the british people with we 
 my constituent have tell i they be no long eligible to receive the warm home discount which along with ofgem ’s price increase be make the cost of live even more severe in the city of durham will the minister meet i to discuss that what if any discussion have he have with the minister for disabled people health and work   the hon member for mid sussex mims davies   about the impact of fuel poverty on disabled people 
 we be provide targeted support for the most vulnerable through the warm home discount i be pleased to say that we have raise it to £ and extend it so that it now reach low income household give they a rebate on their energy bill every winter 
 kettering be of the green constituency in the country because the wind turbine and solar panel in the constituency generate enough electricity to power all home for the country as a whole what percentage of our electricity be generate from renewable when the conservatives come to power in and what be the percentage now 
 i thank my hon friend for that question he will be delighted to learn that renewable generation have increase fivefold from to it have go from a risible twh to twh some gw of renewable energy have connect to great britain ’s electricity network since since the uk have see a more than increase in the amount of renewable electricity capacity in the grid thank to this conservative government 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the past month the former prime minister who legislate for net have condemn the minister ’s oil and gas policy his colleague the former cop president have accuse the government of not be serious and the government ’s net tsar have resign his seat in disgust why do the minister think that that be 
 as we have rehearse the uk be the major economy to halve its emission it be the that be deliver more go forward it be so important that we recognise that we will continue to need oil and gas for decade to come the labour party ’s policy will do the opposite it will weaken british job reduce taxis and put up emission and that be why we remain committed work across society to ensure that we deliver 
 it be not just we who oppose the minister ’s bill but those on his own side he have lose an mp over it i know he bring down the last government over fracke he be try to do it again with his new bill that be the reason that people have lose confidence they see the hot year on record and a government backslide on net be it not the truth that the conservatives who know and care most about climate change no long support this government 
 the right hon gentleman would love to think that be the case but the conservative party be unite in drive this forward and in deliver we be power up britain from britain we have take ourselves from the abject position leave by he when he be in government which so many of my colleague have describe we must not go back to that because it would put bill up it would put emission up and it would stop we be the global net leader that we be 
 the prime minister recently visit bacton gas terminal in north norfolk which be home to a of the uk ’s gas supply and in the future could be an enormous hub for green energy production in the east of england will ministers reassure i that they will continue to consider bacton as the future home for carbon capture usage and storage technology as well as a hydrogen hub for the future in the east of england 
 i agree with my hon friend and the prime minister on the importance of bacton which like all gas terminal across the country have the potential to play a crucial role in our energy security the decarbonisation of these terminal be vital to deliver both economic growth and net the hewett field km offshore from bacton be award a licence for carbon sea storage by the north sea transition authority in i hear his loud voice it will be hear on the government benches about its potential to be a hydrogen hub as well 
 datum release last year suggest that britain have of the large queue in europe of wind and solar capacity wait to be connect to the grid will the minister provide an update on what step the department be take to reduce those waiting time 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to highlight that issue at the autumn statement we announce plan to halve the time it take to build new critical powerline as well as reduce average delay from year to no more than month the connection action plan at the more local level will release more than gw of capacity and give power to the system operator to terminate stall project we be seek across multiple department lead by this to deal with the issue that she rightly raise 
 a&p falmouth in my constituency have submit an application to the government for float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme funding in readiness to support the float offshore wind project in english water with government support it could supply electricity to home in cornwall the scheme be shovel ready pragmatic and deliverable with huge support from local stakeholder as well as be vital to build the supply chain far in the south west will my hon friend alongside department for transport colleague carefully consider the application to help i deliver that for cornwall the south west and the celtic sea cluster 
 it be incredibly encouraging to hear about what be happen at a&p falmouth as my hon friend know the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme be provide up to £ to support investment in uk port however while flowmis be still live i be afraid i can not comment on individual application 
 more than of family in my constituency live in fuel poverty with a median energy    efficiency score of just how much of the general election manifesto pledge to spend £ on improve energy efficiency have go on retrofit exist property and not on new build 
 i will have to write to the hon member with the figure but the government remain firmly committed to new build as well as to retrofit 
 many chelmsford resident have already switch to electric vehicle those who live in house with driveway pay just vat when they charge their car at home but those who live in terrace house who be often less well off have to pay vat when they use a commercial charger i fully understand that tax be a matter for the treasury ministers but do my right hon friend agree that if we could level out this tax we could make electric vehicle more affordable to all people and thus help with our transition towards a low carbon economy 
 as we make the transition it be essential that we do so fairly not least for those with less we have commit to keep the transition to electric vehicle affordable for consumer and we support innovation for those without a home charger such as cross pavement cable channel and peer to peer charging scheme i know that my right hon friend will continue to raise the vat issue as she rightly say all taxis include vat relief be keep under review by the chancellor 
 the hospitality sector be very important to chester talk to the chester business improvement district this morning and follow comment from chef gary usher it be clear that the damaging impact of sky high energy bill be still feel extremely significantly what hope can the minister offer hard press restaurateur in chester and across the country 
 i be aware of the challenge face all the industry i have ongoing talk with ukhospitality and other group there be thing that we can do such as blend and extend and we be look at the broker and ensure that party intermediary be do their job correctly 
 drive down to parliament i pass petrol station in my constituency price be 136.9p and 137.9p however at the service station they be 164.9p and 167.9p that be a massive difference which the public just will not tolerate and want something to be do about it what will the government do 
 road fuel price be down for a consecutive month petrol price be now at a level not see since early october follow our work to bring transparency to the market today we launch the consultation to require petrol station to report real time price which will mean that driver can compare price and get the good deal and price will fall through great competition 
 i be sorry to hear that the secretary of state be ill but could the minister explain why she have take money from michael hintze funder of the global warming policy foundation an organisation that peddle climate science denial do he think that be appropriate 
 i apologise for the secretary of state not be here i will write to the hon lady promptly in answer to her question 
 transparency be important in the development of the energy sector national grid be refuse to publish its assessment of bradwell as a potential landfall site for cable and interconnector it must be logical to prioritise brownfield site with exist connection to the electricity network will my right hon friend please require national grid to publish fully its assessment so far 
 when my right hon friend think that something be important she do not let it go that message will go out clearly from this chamber and i will happily work with she to see whether we can find a resolution and give she the information and insight that she require 
 follow the recent state visit from the korean president when he identify nuclear as of the key sector for future collaboration in the uk korea trade deal and the publication albeit year later than promise of the civil nuclear road map last week could the minister please detail what conversation be take place with the department for business and trade to maximise inward investment opportunity for the nuclear supply chain in warrington north and across the uk 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for her support for our nuclear road map publish last week as she know we look forward to increase the opportunity to co operate with south korea on civil nuclear include on fuel supply chain safety security non proliferation decommissioning and the development of new reactor in both country that will benefit job and the supply chain around the uk specifically where there be a strong history of a nuclear industry such as in her constituency which she champion 
 the additional power supply from offshore wind farm be create the need for further pylon yet if we double the voltage of power line from kv to kv we might not need they that be use in china and america and would stop the need for all the additional power line run up and down the country will the department look into that 
 it will be useful for we both if i write to my hon friend and set out the technical assessment constraint and issue around that because he make an interesting point 
 the government have finally commit to a carbon border adjustment mechanism to protect our energy intensive industry from be undercut by import make with dirty energy   or in more heavily pollute process will the minister explain why the government be delay that until when the eu be introduce equivalent legislation a whole year early will he speak urgently to ministerial colleague about bring that date forward both to protect our industry and reduce our carbon footprint 
 i thank the hon lady for her support for the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism this be to make sure that we do not have carbon leakage to use the jargon where carbon cost impose on company here lead to that production simply go abroad with no betterment to the planet    his majesty ’s treasury take the lead on this particular policy but i will ensure that her sentiment be pass on to my treasury colleague 
 can my hon friend confirm that give all the question about carbon accounting sustainability and value for taxpayer money the government will not be guarantee drax billion more in subsidy 
 as my hon friend know we will shortly be consult on potential support arrangement to help facilitate the transition of large scale biomass generation to power bioenergy with carbon capture and storage power bioenergy with carbon capture and storage could deliver negative emission to support our climate change target and the uk ’s energy security 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i will make a short business statement about an addition to this week ’s business follow the announcement by my right hon friend the home secretary that the government intend to proscribe hizb ut tahrir under the terrorism act the business on thursday will now be 
 thursday january a motion to approve the   draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order follow by a debate on a motion on the loan charge follow by a debate on a motion on hs2 compensation the subject for these debate be determine by the backbench business committee 
 i will announce further business in the usual way on thursday 
 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 i thank the leader of the house for update the house on the business for thursday and for advance sight of it it be good to see she announce a change in business as a statement rather than a point of order and i know that member will appreciate that proper approach 
 there have long be serious concern about the activity of hizb ut tahrir which have be exacerbate in the light of hamas ’s barbaric terrorist attack on israel on   october it be right that the government have look at the evidence and intelligence on the threat pose by the group and labour support the decision to proscribe it 
 i also welcome the fact that urgent time have be find to debate the order this week those who incite violence and promote or glorify terrorism have no place on britain ’s street in that context what progress have be make on proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps either via a statutory instrument as the government be use this week for hizb ut tahrir or by a new process to deal with hostile state actor for which there be wide cross party support in this house 
 finally i have to say that when i be notify of an emergency business statement today i do wonder whether the government be have a rethink about their safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill in the face of the usual infighting and chaos can the leader of the house take this opportunity to confirm that whether the bill be or be not amend in committee today or tomorrow there will still be as program reading at the end of tomorrow ’s business there have be some suggestion that the government may still table their own amendment and push read back to another day would that not be further proof of the prime minister ’s weakness and the fact that when it come to governing they be just make it up as they go along 
 i thank the hon lady for her support for the statutory instrument that we be bring forward the home office have take its time to consider the matter but it be very clear that the activity the   group be involve in fall into that category they need to be deal with swiftly which be why we bring forward the si at the available opportunity 
 the hon lady talk about the point of order i make last week she will fully appreciate that this be a different situation i be make a business statement today because we be change the business that be previously announce last week i be simply give member advance notice of forthcoming business because if i have wait until our exchange on thursday it would have mean an unsatisfactory amount of time for right hon and hon member to prepare amendment 
 i will certainly ensure that the home secretary   have hear the hon lady ’s query about the islamic revolutionary guard corps its activity be not restrict to what be happen overseas it be engage in activity on british soil against british citizen i know that there be a great deal of interest in that in all part of the house 
 as the hon lady will know the progress of the rwanda bill be subject to the house and i shall make further business announcement in the usual way 
 as a member of the defence committee i know that it be an open secret that iran be paymaster to and help to train hamas hezbollah and the houthi rebel in yemen there be no doubt about that throughout the international intelligence community i warmly welcome the decision to proscribe hizb ut tahrir however give what i have just say and give the action that we have take against the houthi rebel in order to maintain freedom of navigation on the sea can the leader of the house foresee any circumstance in which she could return to the house in the near future to make a similar announcement about proscribe the irgc 
 i thank my right hon friend for his very helpful question i know that this be an issue of great concern to many member he will appreciate that the home secretary and the government will want to make any future announcement in a timely way while also consider all the effect that such a course of action might bring about not least to our ship and their insurance but i shall ensure that the home secretary have hear what he have say 
 do the scottish national party spokesperson wish to ask a question 
 indicate dissent 
 i call kevin brennan 
 give that the chair of the backbench business committee be not present and that the announcement have an impact on thursday ’s backbench business can the leader of the house give we any information about the timing of the debate will there be a timetable motion as there would be if the business be take in a committee upstairs probably allow an hour and a half in normal circumstance and why have the leader of the house decide that it should be take on the floor of the house rather than upstairs 
 i apologise to the backbench business committee i know that this will eat into its time on thursday but this be an important matter that we want to deal with swiftly and we therefore feel that it be appropriate for it to be deal with on the floor of the house 
 i thank the leader of the house for the statement and welcome the intention to hold the debate on thursday in response to   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois a fellow member of the defence committee the leader of the house say that the home secretary would come back to the house in a timely way as the right hon member highlight the islamic revolutionary guard corps supply the houthis especially with drone material and it be also commit international action last night in northern iraq rather than talk of a timely way many of we in the defence committee would say time ’s up i wonder whether the leader of the house could reinforce to the home secretary the fact that across the house there be a clamour to proscribe the irgc at the soon opportunity 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that helpful question i will ensure that the home secretary have hear what he have say the action that he have describe be not new i think that on average that organisation have be behind about attack during any recent year against international shipping and people go about their daily business and as i have say it be also engage in activity in the uk as a member of the defence committee the hon gentleman will know of some the issue that surround this decision but i be sure that if and when the home secretary make his decision he will want the house to be alert at the early opportunity 
 i welcome the statement and clarification of the business for thursday the leader of the house will be aware of the high level of terrorism and the severe threat to people in northern ireland from the real ira and the new ira there be surely a connection between such terrorist group in northern ireland and those who have sympathy towards the hamas terrorist be it not wonderful how terrorist across the world come together to murder innocent people 
 with regard to the business on thursday may i ask the leader of the house ever mindful of the fact that only certain thing can be say in the house if it might be possible to indicate whether the threat from the real ira and the connection with the proscribe hamas can be clarify evidentially and if so what measure will be take to reinforce the action of step down hard on the real ira and the new ira 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this important matter as he will know it be not a matter for i in connection with the business of the house but he have characteristically make the point that he wish to make and put it on the record and i shall ensure that the home secretary have hear it 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker last week i attend a committee consider a statutory instrument on the immigration health surcharge and as would be expect in such a forum i be ask question of the minister in this instance the minister for legal migration and the border   the hon member for corby tom pursglove who be unable to answer a number of those question 
 i should give credit to the minister i have alert he to my intention to raise this point of order because he have since write to i ahead of the house finally agree to the statutory instrument yesterday and i thank he for that courtesy however that be not the time that i have be in a statutory instrument committee and ministers have be unable to answer question in this case it be off the back of a detailed impact assessment conduct by the home office but on other occasion minister have be unable to supply answer on fairly basic information 
 i want to raise the matter with you madam deputy speaker because it seem to i that this be an inadequate and inopportune way for the house to operate we be there to scrutinise the legislation of the government of the day and we be hamper in do so if ministers be unable to give we answer and instead promise variously to write to we or tell we about the issue involve at a later stage or sometimes even brush off the question i wonder whether you would like to say anything on this matter madam deputy speaker 
 i thank the hon lady for her point of order and for give i notice of it i assume that she do inform the minister that she intend to raise it 
 obviously minister be responsible for their own reply to member in delegated legislation committees as they be in the chamber i note that the hon lady say that the minister do she the courtesy of writing after the event but i think we would all believe and it be certainly my view that ministers should have all the relevant information to hand when respond to a debate the leader of the house be here and have clearly listen carefully to what the hon lady have say i be sure that she will take that point back as will other on the treasury bench 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker i can tell the house that this be not an isolated incident in statutory instrument committees but surely it be not good enough because the ministers who be answer question about an impact assessment have sign that impact assessment and date it to confirm that they be responsible and fully aware of its content if ministers be indeed sign off impact assessment on statutory instrument and present they to committees without know the content that be an extremely troubling revelation 
 i note the point that the hon gentleman have make let i say again that this be up to individual minister we can not test they from the chair before they respond to a debate on a statutory instrument 
 rise 
 i sense that the leader of the house might like to provide a brief response 
 far to the point of order madam deputy speaker we take these matter very seriously and i will ensure that the point that member have raise be bring to the attention of the departments that have be mention 
 i would just add that a great deal of work have be do by the select committee on statutory instruments which have be look into how we can improve these process the quality of impact assessment and so forth and a large training programme take place in department my noble friend lord true and i have also undertake session with ministers deal with statutory instrument involve training and improve the quality of what be put forward to enable the house to scrutinise legislation properly 
 there will be incident i be sure particularly with complex brief where someone can not recall the information while at the dispatch box but as the textbook example set out by   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier   with regard to my hon friend the minister for legal migration and the border show when those situation arise ministers be very aware of their responsibility to get back to hon member before those statutory instrument come into effect 
 in that helpful intervention the leader of the house have outline the programme that be in train and i be sure that right hon and hon member will keep their beady eye on the situation and ministers will ensure that they be as well prepared as possible

 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday january and to be print bill 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no pm 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to amend the scotland act to transfer the power to legislate for a scottish independence referendum to the scottish parliament to provide that that power may only be exercise where the scottish public have demonstrate its support for the holding of such a referendum to provide that no such referendum may be hold soon than year after the previous such referendum and for connected purpose 
 madam deputy speaker 
 i ’m stand up for the right of self determination i ’m stand up for our territory i ’m stand up for our people i ’m stand up for international law i ’m stand up for all those territory those small territory and people the world over 
 those be the word of then prime minister margaret thatcher recount in her memoir the downing street years she go on to say 
 the principle of self determination have become a fundamental component of international law and be enshrine in the un charter 
 that principle she speak of the principle of the self determination of people be enshrine in the united nations charter when prime minister winston churchill sign the atlantic charter any notion that scot freely enter into the union by an act of self determination have no credibility whatsoever in a majority of scottish parliamentarian may have be persuade but the people be never consult the act of union in between england and scotland create the kingdom of great britain establish a single political entity yet preserve the territorial legal and institutional integrity of each partner country 
 the uk ’s constitution be not codify in a single document so the question of whether the act of union can be unilaterally dissolve by party be not clear however the accept position hitherto be that the union be a voluntary association of equal partner and that scotland have an unquestione right of self determination scotland ’s distinct constitutional tradition be well express by lord cooper in the case of maccormick v. lord advocate 
 the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of parliament be a distinctively english principle which have no counterpart in scottish constitutional law 
 in the pleading of   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry   in her prorogation case to the uk supreme court it be note that the parliamentary union between england and scotland may have create a new state but do not create nation in recent year the uk state have steadfastly refuse to acknowledge or honour that principle or the democratic wish of the scottish electorate accord to the distinguished academic and legal practitioner in international law professor robert mccorquodale 
 the people of scotland be distinct within the uk and have a right to self determination and as the people of scotland be a people for the purpose of the right to self determination the choice of the mean to exercise it be for the people to decide and not for the state 
 these be not obscure or arcane point of law they be precise and purposeful and accord to professor mccorquodale such treaty obligation be 
 bind under international law on all state 
 the question of whether the ancient nation of scotland should be an independent country once again continue to be the subject of much debate in short with current support sit at across the population and above among young people the matter be far from settle it be entirely proper for any country to review such important matter because scotland will only become independent as and when a majority of the people of scotland choose that path this demand the use of a democratic mechanism that be constitutional and satisfy international legal precedent this bill seek to standardise and codify such a requirement in line with the motion pass by this house that endorse the principle of the claim of right and acknowledge the sovereign right of the scottish people to determine the form of government well suit to their need 
 at that time the claim of right be support by every political party save the tories in particular liberal democrat mp such as ray michie and charles kennedy be forthright in their support for the principle of scottish sovereignty they be follow a home rule tradition in that party which never for a dispute scotland ’s right of self determination albeit they think scotland should choose a form of federalism rather than independence it would be unfortunate today if have already desert their historic commitment to the european cause the liberal democrats be to follow that by desert their historic commitment to respect scotland ’s national right this morning   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine   call this bill which favour neither side nor the other divisive and unnecessary when it be anything but it be in fact both liberal and fundamentally democratic 
 the effect of this bill should be uncontroversial for every member it merely establish in law an equivalent mechanism to the principle already concede by the uk government in relation to a border poll in northern ireland it establish that the power to legislate for a referendum require a democratic mandate from the scottish public to do so since that criterion have be meet in successive general election to the scottish parliament most recently in when a majority of msps be elect and a majority of vote be cast in favour of a manifesto commitment to deliver an independence referendum secondly the bill state that no such referendum may be hold any soon than year after any previous such referendum should members of this chamber deny scotland her legitimate claim on self determination that will put beyond doubt that the voice of the people of scotland be not welcome in this place and that a new approach must be consider 
 this bill offer both remedy and route it place the power to decide firmly where it belong in the hand of the people of scotland and it do so by transfer the power to hold a referendum on independence to the scottish parliament it be a parallel initiative to that be lead by my alba party colleague ash regan msp in the scottish parliament ms regan have bring forward a draft bill that will allow for a referendum to be hold to ask the people of scotland if they think that the scottish parliament should have the power to negotiate and legislate for independence its purpose be to consult the people of scotland on their opinion on extend the provision of their parliament to hold such a referendum a proposition support by the expert legal opinion of aidan o’neill kc both proposal   have at their heart the democratic imperative that scotland ’s political destiny must be in the hand of the people of scotland not in the hand of the westminster parliament or the supreme court how do the behaviour of the uk government or the repeatedly espouse position of the opposition party constitute access to meaningful political process as claim in the recent uk supreme court judgment 
 in the aftermath of the referendum the all party smith commission agreement be sign by all scotland ’s main political party snp labour tory and liberal democrat and it state 
 it be agree that nothing in this report prevent scotland become an independent country in the future should the people of scotland so choose 
 while each have fail to deliver on that commitment this bill provide a necessarily equitable and democratic mechanism for the people of scotland 
 in in this place the equality of the uk partner country be assert by a liberal mp william ewart gladstone when he say that 
 if i be to suppose a case in which scotland unanimously or by a clearly preponderate voice be to make the demand on the united parliament to be treat not only on the same principle but in the same manner as ireland i could not deny the title of scotland to urge such a claim ”—[official report   april   vol c 
 john major when he be prime minister say of scotland that 
 no nation could be hold irrevocably in a union against its will 
 it be increasingly apparent that this be not a union of equal the uk be wilfully subvert the will of the people of scotland by deny they their establish human right as enshrine in the un charter and in international treaty obligation that the uk state enter freely 
 i cite the word of lady thatcher at the opening of my speech but she go far 
 the scots be an historic nation with a proud past have an undoubted right to national self determination should they determine on independence no english party or politician would stand in their way however much we might regret their departure 
 whether i like it or loathe it we be in this union i hold that it be incumbent on every mp elect on an independence ticket to explore every option with courage and conviction today this chamber face a choice affirm that this be a voluntary union of equal or tell the world that scotland be a mere possession to do with as it wish this bill be a necessary condition of secure scottish democracy and i commend it to the house 
 i congratulate   the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey   on secure this minute rule bill and on his knowledge of liberal political history i have to confess though that my overwhelming sentiment on hearing of this bill be oh not again surely this have be settle not just by the supreme court ruling but by the repeat occasion on which the people of scotland include i and other mps here the electorate of several constituency and the majority of people at the last general election and in the referendum make it clear that no we can not be hold in a union against our will but that our will be to stay 
 on the anniversary of parliamentary approval of the act of union in we be go over the same nationalist argument again and again an argument that be reject in the referendum and at the general election this could and should be a day when the people of this country might expect their elect representative to be consider the importance of what have go before as a result of that act what we have achieve and build and what we can continue to build and improve upon as part of the union as a liberal and a liberal democrat as the hon gentleman say i fundamentally believe in home rule for scotland i fundamentally agree that the united kingdom need to change and i agree that the people of scotland deserve incremental increase in power but that be because i believe in a federal united kingdom and have say so on numerous occasion and i will continue to do so 
 in the past year there have be referendum on scotland ’s political future on the scottish people ’s future and on the state of the constitution every single of they be facilitate by the united kingdom government and on every occasion the scottish people have benefit we have devolution as a result of the referendum and surely even devolution sceptic can see the good that have come from our parliament we have see the benefit of devolution not only in scotland but in wales and we have see great change in northern ireland and let we not forget the london assembly 
 the referendum on independence in be facilitate by the uk government who feel that the scottish parliament and scottish parliamentary election have prove that there be a mandate i know this because i work on that referendum i declare that interest and as a result we have more devolved power this country have come so far on devolution since the turn of the new century and power be now close to the people most affect by it it would be dreadful to undermine that to throw the baby out with the bath water with a separatist argument let we be clear that that be what some colleague want 
 it be not a secret that i fundamentally disagree with my colleague on the alba and snp benches about independence and where scotland should be head particularly at a time when we need to work together in this place to solve the ill that be blight people across these isle i repeat that in do so the uk government be not a block on more devolution but have work to enable it 
 whatever nationalist might tell we independence be not an answer to our problem it be not even the question that most people in scotland want to raise that question be about inflation interest rate and the cost of living my constituent constantly ask i about instability across the globe and what we will do about those issue yes they want change but they want a different government and a different approach they do not want separation and they regularly tell i that they be feed up of hear about it they be tired of the negativity and of their world and their child ’s world become small because of their government ’s mismanagement and ideological decision they want to address the problem with our education system in scotland with our nhs in scotland and with our   public service in scotland all of which have decline during the period of a nationalist government who have prioritise only independence we be suffer and we do not want to do it any more if the nationalist lift their head from their ideological manifesto on separation and if they listen a little more to the people of scotland and stop take their support for grant perhaps they would know that themselves 
 the people of scotland may not like this particular uk government and there be time when frankly i wholeheartedly agree but they can see an opportunity for change come in the next few month perhaps that be why the nationalist be put new impetus into their cause because they see that there be an opportunity for change come and that people may choose to change the government rather than the constitution
