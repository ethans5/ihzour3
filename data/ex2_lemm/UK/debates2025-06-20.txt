 on a point of order mr speaker there be report of an extremely serious incident at brize norton which be be describe as vandalism but if course may be bad will there be a statement from the ministry of defence later 
 i can say that i have be give no notice of the incident at brize norton i know nothing of the incident those on the front bench will have hear the point i would not want to interrupt today ’s proceeding if the incident be that serious and somebody be so minded we could always put something on at the end of proceeding but that would be for other not for i at this stage 
 reading 
 a huge number of member have indicate that they wish to speak in the debate i hope that member will restrict themselves to a reasonable amount of time after the opening speech i will advise on minute to enable other colleague to participate we need short speech to enable all member or as many as possible to contribute i shall make it clear that the chair retain the right to impose a formal time limit but i would rather colleague help each other after all it be an important day and we do want to hear as many view as possible 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 it be an honour and a privilege to open the debate on reading of the terminally ill adult end of life bill it have be a long journey to get here and i do not underestimate the significance of this day it be not often that we be ask to wrestle with issue of morality ethic and humanity but with great privilege in this job come great responsibility and never more so than at a time like this 
 benjamin franklin tell we that 
 in this world nothing can be say to be certain except death and taxis 
 in this house we debate the latter incessantly but here and in the country as a whole discuss death be something that we tend to shy away from yet it will come to we all and to all those we love we all have our own experience of death loss and grief there be good death and bad death i like many have experience both 
 i appreciate that for some colleague the journey to this point have be a difficult i want to pay tribute to the way in which the overwhelming majority of members have approach the subject read back in november be quite rightly see as an example of parliament at its good contribution from across the   chamber be incredibly powerful the atmosphere be respectful and people listen with care i hope that we will see the same today 
 i want to thank you mr speaker and your team along with the fantastic clerks and procedural expert who have ensure that parliamentary protocol have be follow and have guide we through the intricacy of what can be a complex parliamentary process that be steep in tradition but not always easy to follow of course process be important but it be also important to remember that we be not vote on the merit of parliamentary procedure we be vote on an issue that matter deeply to our constituent indeed the issue before we be very personal for many people so many of our constituent but many of we as well it be an issue that transcend party politic i thank colleague from across the house who have share their very personal story with i 
 i be grateful to all colleague who have study the detail of the bill it be essential that we come to a decision base on the content of what it actually say i have be pleased to work with member on all side of the debate to ensure that the legislation be something that parliament can be proud of a cogent workable bill that have simple thread run through it the need to correct the profound injustice of the status quo and to offer a compassionate and safe choice to terminally ill people who want to make it 
 i will not go into the amendment in detail as i know that be not the purpose of this debate but whether by add further safeguard and protection for patient through additional training around coercive control the addition of specialist expertise through the inclusion of multidisciplinary panel widen the provision for professional to opt out of the assist dying process provide additional employment protection or prohibit the advertising of assist dying cross party working have strengthen the bill 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for give way what level of concern do it give she that between reading and today a grow canon of professional and their independent professional body have urge great caution about this bill not on the principle but because they be oppose to the detail of this bill and believe it should be defeat 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention i think what he be say be that people have get different view and they do have different view we have different view in this house and different people in different profession have different view every royal college have a neutral position on assist dying because of that 
 i have be pleased to work with member on all side of the debate to ensure that this legislation be something that parliament can be proud of and the many safeguard in this bill ensure that only terminally ill patient who be eligible under the strict criterion and want to access assist dying can do so 
 i feel disturb by quite a lot of the email that i receive from constituent some of they who be my friend and people i like imply that we here be either too stupid or careless to care for   the most vulnerable be it not true that we all do care whatever decision we make today and that we have to continue to educate people and tell they what this bill be about 
 i thank the hon member for that intervention and she be absolutely right the detail do matter that be why i be so grateful to colleague who have engage in the detail we know that there be different view within the public and we have to take on board the concern of vulnerable group that be why the safeguard be so important but i would also say that there be no more vulnerable than someone who be die 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be just go to make some progress 
 patient must have 
 an inevitably progressive illness or disease which can not be reverse by treatment 
 and a person be not consider to be terminally ill only because they have a disability or a mental disorder these clear strict criterion plus the multiple capacity assessment exclude possible serious mental health disorder such as anorexia 
 i be also very pleased to support the change advocate for by marie curie and hospice uk which would ensure an assessment of palliative and end of life care as part of the report on the act we know from other country in no small part due to the month inquiry by the health and social care committee that palliative care and assist dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patient the care and choice they deserve in their final day it should not be an either or for die people and we need to channel our energy into support all option for terminally ill people 
 i be very grateful to the hon lady for give way as she know the lead expert in palliative care have come out to oppose the bill and they point to the fact that hospice be underfunde and do not have the same ability to serve patient i therefore gently question whether we be in a position today to make a judgment that patient truly would have a choice at the end of life 
 i thank he for his intervention but i would say as i have say previously that people work in palliative care have a mixed range of view on this subject i have meet with palliative care doctor and some be very supportive of a change in the law because of the suffering they have see 
 will my hon friend give way on that particular point 
 i be just go to make some progress if i may but as i be say it be an either or decision for we today either we vote for the safe effective workable reform contain in this bill or we say that the status quo be acceptable 
 over recent month i have hear hundred of story from people who have lose love one in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstance along with many terminally    ill people themselves i spend some time with some of these family yesterday they be real people with real story and they deserve to be hear 
 adil ’s terminally ill father take his own life by buy drug on the dark web it be his attempt and adil find he in a truly desperate state he and his sister will never get over that night nor the police investigation that follow katie wave her mum off as she make the lonely and costly journey to switzerland where she have a peaceful and dignified death but the family have no chance to say a proper goodbye and her dad make the journey home grieve and alone 
 other have have to watch their love one die harrowing death despite receive excellent end of life care warwick ’s wife ann suffer from peritoneal cancer have the maximum dose of sedative but it be not enough to stop the choking and suffocation and she beg he to help she put an end to her suffering but he do not want her last memory to be of he stand over she with a pillow there be many many more such story 
 perhaps most importantly i have speak to terminally ill people themselves we have spend a lot of time talk about they but not always with they pamela and sophie both have terminal breast cancer and they share their story yesterday pamela be a proud christian who just want to have choice when her time come sophie who be allergic to opioid want to ensure that her beautiful daughter have nothing but happy memory of their time together not support the bill today be not a neutral act it be a vote for the status quo it fill i with despair to think that mps could be here in another year time hear the same story 
 i thank my hon friend for give way she be be very kind i come into this house support the principle of assist dying and i think very carefully before vote against the bill on reading there be differ view but i want to ask my hon friend before mp put their name not to the principle of assist dying but to this bill specifically why the vast majority of primary care doctor geriatrician and group represent people with disability eat disorder and domestic violence be all opposed not to the principle but to this bill specifically some people who be supportive of the principle of assist dying do not support this specific bill can my hon friend explain their opposition 
 i think we have cover that point already these be not homogeneous group of people they have different view and opinion 
 if we look at the inconsistency in the current law it just do not make sense if someone with a terminal illness voluntarily stop eat and drink it be legal for they to starve themselves to death a competent patient have the right to refuse food and fluid even if they will die the exercising of that right be sometimes propose as an alternative to assist dying i suppose it could be argue that starve oneself to death be way of take control at the end of life but it be a deeply traumatic experience for the person and their loved one and there be people here today who have direct experience of that 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will make some progress 
 we have a system in which it legal for someone to starve themselves to death which can take day or week but where it be not legal for someone to seek assistance from a doctor to take an approve substance themselves to end their pain or suffering and take back control in their die day it be also legal in this country for someone to discharge themselves from medical care or refuse life sustain treatment such as ventilation cpr or antibiotic as long as they have the mental capacity to do so and be make the decision of their own accord without harassment from anyone else colleague might think that be fine and i agree but there be no requirement for doctor a psychiatrist and a social worker and there be no lawyer or judge it be legal yet what be be propose in this bill with so many more safeguard and protection be not it simply do not make sense 
 rise 
 i be not go to take any more intervention because lot of people want to speak 
 then there be the criminal offence that the bill introduce none of which exist now include life imprisonment for anyone who induce another person to take the approve substance and year in prison for coercion dishonesty or pressure it be a robust process that go far than any other piece of legislation in the world and it be far safe and significantly more compassionate than what we have now 
 if we look internationally there be clear well establish safe and compassionate assisted die law in existence on tuesday i join doctor from australia who use key word repeatedly choice control and relief dr greg mewett have year of experience as a gp and year as a palliative care physician and he speak about the thorough approach that he have take to ensure safety and efficacy of the assist dying process perhaps the most stand out quote from that session come from dr jacky davis chair of healthcare professionals for assisted dying who say that by introduce assist dying 
 no more people will die but far few people will suffer 
 this be not a choice between living and die it be a choice for terminally ill people about how they die i fully appreciate that some colleague would never vote for any version of this bill and i be respectful of that despite disagree with they however i say to colleague who be supportive of a change in the law but be hesitant about whether now be the time that if we do not vote for a change in the law today we will have many more year of heartbreaking story from terminally ill people and their family of pain and trauma 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be go to finish 
 there will be story of suicide attempt post traumatic stress disorder lonely trip to switzerland police investigation and everything else we have all hear of in recent month as the commission on assisted dying say in year ago 
 the current legal status of assist die in the uk be inadequate and incoherent it outsource a healthcare issue abroad especially to dignita instead of the government and parliament assume responsibility 
 that be year ago and we be in exactly the same position today thing have get to change 
 as the government ’s impact assessment state the bill will improve equity of choice ensure that terminally ill adult from all socioeconomic background can access end of life option within a regulated and safe framework 
 i will draw my comment to a close there be essentially way in which we can look at the situation we be in we can look at it through a legal lens as legislator we have a duty to change the law where it be fail and when the last director of public prosecutions tell we that the law need to change surely we have a duty to listen we need scrutiny before people die not after most importantly there be the human len which be how i approach most thing give die people choice about how they die be about compassion control dignity and bodily autonomy surely we should all have the right 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be go to finish shortly 
 surely we should all have the right to decide what happen to our body and decide when enough be enough of course give people the right to choose do not take away the right not to choose 
 today we can vote with either our heart or with our head but either way we should end up in the same lobby on a compassionate human level and as responsible lawmaker we should support this desperately need reform which be rigorous practical and safe and which be root in the principle that should underpin any legislation compassion justice and human dignity 
 i have no doubt that the vast majority in this house probably every single hon and right hon member be sympathetic to the underlying motivation of the bill which be to ease suffering in other and try to avoid suffer where possible for the most part the debate both in this chamber and in committee have be good natured and conduct in a way that we can be proud of 
 there have be wide question about the motivation of both the proponent and the opponent of the bill although this be not about any individual of we i think it be only fair that because some question have be ask i put a few thing on the record about my own position i do not come at this from a religious point of view i be an atheist i be a humanist my position be drive by my concern about the practicality of the bill rather than any religious viewpoint 
 it have be suggest particularly when people talk about their experience of talk to people who have lose love one or who be themselves terminally ill this have be say to i on a number of occasion that if we have see someone suffer we would agree with the bill i have see someone suffer early this year my close friend die painfully of oesophageal cancer and i be with he in the final week of his life 
 i come at this from a position neither of faith nor of ignorance and i hope that the house will take those factor into consideration when i say what i be about to say 
 on the tv last night they do a survey of gps the relationship between a gp and a patient be incredibly close when our child and grandchild come into the world our gp be involve when a gp have to deliver a diagnosis of terminal illness there be fear not just in the eye of the patient but in the eye of the gp the doctor the friend we all have do the right hon gentleman recognise the importance of today ’s debate and vote it will change forever that relationship of trust between the gp and the patient it will do so in a negative way and it will never change ever again 
 i will refer to the hon gentleman ’s point later in my speech i will try not to take too many intervention because many people have not have the chance to speak in the debate and i want to give they the chance to do so 
 on reading i make the point that we need to think about the detail of the bill and not just vote in accordance with the broad principle i make the point that because it be a private member ’s bill the opportunity to change it fundamentally be limited and so we have an enhance duty to get it right time we be tell on reading that a lot of the concern worry and detailed question would be resolve in committee we be promise the gold standard a judicially underpin set of protection and safeguard those protection do not make it through committee i have also hear people say where there be still problem issue and concern that the lords will do that work but none of we should think that it be right to subcontract our job to the other place 
 we be make an incredibly important and fundamental change as   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   highlight in the relationship between medical professional and those they serve if we make that change we will introduce a small but permanent question mark in the mind of every patient particularly a patient who be discuss a serious illness or terminal diagnosis what be this medical professional expecting of i what be they think where be their head whereas with the situation we have at the moment the patient know that the medical professional be dutybound to do no harm and to preserve life and dignity wherever possible 
 next tuesday will be the anniversary of my sister ’s death week prior to her death we take she to hospital because she have a blood infection despite agree to allow she into intensive care to sort out that blood infection the consultant then decide that she should not go because she have a brain tumour and be go to die she be go to die but not at that moment i be sure mr speaker that you can understand that a very big row ensue i win that row she be make well she come home and she die peacefully what do the right hon gentleman think would happen in identical circumstance if this bill pass 
 the hon lady ask i to speculate about a set of circumstance that be personal and painful i suspect that she and i both know that the outcome could have be very different and that the moment she have with her sister just like those i have with my dear friend might have be lose 
 we have to recognise that this be an important moment while i respect   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater i disagree with her assessment that it be now or never that it be this bill or no bill and that a vote against it on reading be a vote to maintain the status quo none of those thing be true there will be plenty of opportunity indeed we be dutybound stimulate by this debate which be why i do not criticise the hon lady for bring forward the bill to have a serious conversation about palliative care many people will say that these be not conflict or contradictory position but and i will crack on because otherwise you will tell i off mr speaker we know that there could be circumstance where assist dying would be on a statutory basis and the provision of palliative care would not 
 we also have to address the point that we can all pray in aid individual and institution to reinforce our position on this but we can not subcontract our decision yes we can fish around for people to come up with the perfect quote to reinforce our argument but another minute on wikipedia google or with friend of our in the medical profession will find another voice that oppose that yes it be a mixed picture in the medical profession but i be strike by the number of professional body that be neutral on the topic of assist dying in general but oppose to the provision within this bill in particular we can not just say they be neutral on assist dying and therefore this particular vehicle have to progress 
 we carry a responsibility it be what we be send here to do and we need to take it very seriously we must be rigorous on the specific detail in the bill just like the hon member for spen valley i do not have time to go through every single argument that be have on reading in committee and beyond but in order to ensure that we be rigorous there be fundamental question that we should ask ourselves not lean on our friend and colleague but ask ourselves and ensure that we answer fully and honestly 
 the right hon gentleman will remember that in he and i work cross party on identify inequality within certain community and on get they to come forward for the covid vaccination do he agree that question we parliamentarian need to ask ourselves be this how be it right that some community be deny basic healthcare within the current system how be it right that some community do not have access to good palliative care how be it right that some community still mistrust the medical profession and how be it right that we be not listen to their voice 
 the hon lady make an incredibly important point and i will touch on that briefly in my remark i be minded to take no more intervention because otherwise i will be steal time from other 
 there be question we need to ask be we happy for this bill not for the principle but for this bill as draft to become law many of the element that i have already discuss be concern in the criterion set out medical professional do not need to seek deep motivation we have say there be not a real choice between palliative care and assist dying because will have a statutory underpinning and the other will not as i say the gold standard protection be lose in committee because a number of professional body and 
 will the right hon member give way 
 i need to make progress 
 a number of professional body have say they do not have the capacity they do not have enough people to fill the slot that this bill demand of they 
 secondly in term of fundamental change be hon and right hon member genuinely happy to write the blank cheque that this bill demand it be normal for the secretary of state of a government department to decide when a piece of legislation come into force and they make their decision base on the state ’s ability to deliver that legislation commencement date matter they be not just some arbitrary date on a piece of paper i understand people ’s desire to ensure that this can not be lose down the back of the sofa when it come to government work but when the people on whom we would rely to deliver this bill say that they be not ready and that they do not feel that they will be ready they do not have enough people and they do not have enough capacity so they will have to take resource from current provision to move across to this provision which will be drive by a statutory requirement and a locked in commencement date we should listen if the people who be go to make this work and work as well as we hope it will if it become legislation say that they be not confident that they can make it happen we should be very careful about demand that they prioritise this that be what this legislation say they will prioritise this above any other work that they might otherwise do 
 thirdly the hon member for spen valley hint at this and i mention it in an intervention in an early stage of the bill on coercion on the pressure that individual put on themselves and on medical professional raise the issue we know that there be inequality in health provision already none of which will be address by the bill there be certain community and certain people in those community particularly woman who be overly deferential to man and to man in authority can we genuinely say that we have no fear whatsoever about a potentially vulnerable woman sit in front of a medical professional who raise assisted dying even if they do not imply that it be the right thing for she to do the very fact that they bring it up will have a significant influence on that woman ’s thinking we can not believe that the effect will be completely neutral across all community 
 with the safeguard that have be put in the bill there will be a panel that look at those issue and   ask question like have your doctor persuade you to do this do we honestly think that a social worker psychiatrist or lawyer be totally incapable of find coercion that be exactly what the panel be there to do and that be exactly what those safeguard will provide 
 the hon lady make an important point but i refer she to my question those body say that they do not have the people to populate those panel yet that be what the commencement date demand the principle of have a person or group of people to protect against coercion be important i be talk not just about coercion but about how people perceive people in authority but royal college and social worker have tell we that they do not believe they will be ready to put those guardrail in place by the commencement date we should listen to they 
 this be an important debate that have stimulate an important conversation which demand our full attention but i do not believe that the bill be ready to go to the other place it be interesting that there be both proponent and opponent of the bill who hope that the lords will make significant change to the bill that should surely set off alarm bell 
 ultimately because the bill be such a fundamental change we need to ensure that there be an enhanced level of scrutiny of its detail we all want to avoid and alleviate suffer wherever possible but i do not believe that we have have the opportunity to get the bill into the right shape that be why i will oppose reading and i encourage other to do likewise 
 order after the opening speech we will now have a minute limit and i hope that member will restrict themselves to up to minute the mother of the house will now give we a very good example 
 this may be the most fateful bill that we discuss this parliament it be literally a matter of life and death i have hear talk today of the injustice of the current situation what could be more unjust than someone lose their life because of poorly draft legislation 
 we hear about panel the people talk about panel presumably have not have much to do with they i would not put my life or the life of anyone dear to i in the hand of a panel of official i stress right from the beginning that it be perfectly possible to support assist dying as i do but not be prepared to vote for this bill there be so much that be problematic about it 
 as i believe be widely understand there have not be enough time to debate the bill secondly a bill of this seriousness should be give more time 
 do the right hon lady find it rather peculiar that the previous parliament spend hour discuss the death of a fox and about hour discuss the death of fellow human 
 there have be a lot of talk about there be no evidence of coercion but within the family the most powerful coercion be silence it be the failure to answer when a question be put if police can not spot coercion in domestic violence how can they be expect to spot coercion in assist dying 
 the royal college of pathologists and the former chief coroner have point out that without a role for a coroner the bill raise the possibility of foul play when an amendment be table in committee to deal with that however it be opposed the bill would allow private for profit contractor to run an assist die service with no profit cap and no transparency but when an amendment be table in committee to deal with that point it be opposed 
 we have hear and we will hear over and over again in this debate about choice this bill may produce choice for those of we like almost everybody in this house who have for the entirety of their adult life be confident in deal with authority and institution but even then the bill would need amendment but what choice do the bill hold for someone who all their life have lack agency particularly in a family context which may be particularly the case in certain culture and community and what choice do the bill offer to those who lack access to good palliative care 
 as the former prime minister gordon brown have put it our law should not 
 focus on the few who wish for assist dying and do too little to support the majority of those face their final day who want and deserve access to the good of palliative care 
 what choice be it for those who think that because their doctor raise it with they at all they be be guide in that direction an amendment that might have address that issue be reject in committee it be a possibility that proponent of the bill do not take seriously at all but anyone who know how institution work should be watchful of it 
 i come to this house to be a voice for the voiceless that have not always be favour by my own leadership but that be why i come to the house who could be more voiceless than somebody who be in their sick bed and believe that they be die i ask members in this debate to speak up for the voiceless more time there be no doubt that if the bill be pass in its current form there will be people among the most vulnerable and marginalise in our society who lose their life unnecessarily i therefore implore the house to reject this bill not because i be oppose to assist dying in principle but because my concern be for vulnerable and marginalised person and community 
 rise 
 order i reiterate the admonition that mr speaker have offer this be of the most far reach consideration that the house even those of we who have be here for a very long time can remember it be understandable that a lot of member will wish to take part from across the house and on both side of the argument but look around it be quite clear that we can not accommodate everybody this mean there will inevitably be a considerable number of intervention all i would say gently be that intervention will be take into account when consider the order of priority in which member be call 
 i start off by say a huge thank you to   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   for the extraordinary amount of work she have do across this whole debate 
 this be the time i have speak in this debate and like many member whose speech i have hear i come to it through personal experience i have hear many story of people whose relation have die in my case it be my mother who die in she be diagnose with pancreatic cancer my father in law be a consultant so i phone he up and ask what that mean and he say that she have a chance of die i be prepare for it but eventually the time come when i get the call say that her health have start to deteriorate so i go down to see she i speak to the whips and take time off work here and watch the start of the decline from something as painful and difficult as pancreatic cancer which as those who have witness it will know be not a nice moment 
 my mother be not frightened of die at all she would talk about it she know that she be go to die however she be terrify of the pain and on many occasion she ask i and caroline my wife if we could make it end we could not of course she have very very good care from the nhs the nurse come twice a day she be on a morphine driver and the gp come to see she so she be look after well however as she deteriorate we could see that she be in indignity and a huge amount of pain until eventually she die it be of course not of the happy moment of my life 
 contrary to that experience or year ago i find myself go to the memorial service of of my constituent who be a truly wonderful person she too have die of pancreatic cancer but because she have be in spain at the time she spend quite a lot of time in spain with her husband she have the opportunity to go through the state provide assisted die programme that be provide there i speak to her widower very briefly and it be fascinating to talk to he about it he say it be an extraordinary incredibly sad thing to have go through but that it be something that make she suffer much less it be almost a sort of quiet sunday afternoon when it happen 
 i see those people my mother who have the indignity and the pain and the suffering that she be terrify of and my constituent who have the opportunity to end it in a dignified way and when i come to this debate i be absolutely convinced that this be the right thing to do i have spend the past or month engage as hard as i could with those who i hop would be able to persuade i of a different decision to try to persuade i that i be wrong in my assumption i have speak to a huge number of people i have join in meeting with campaigner i have read every email that have come in and i have speak to doctor and religious leader and i have yet to be persuade that this be a bad thing to do 
 there have be a huge amount of debate here over hour of debate when we add it all together there have be load of amendment and people on both side of the debate have be incredibly thoughtful but be we possibly get rid of the good in try to find the perfect i do not know i be not the world ’s great legislator but have listen to these debate and give what i have see at hand at the end of the day i can only go through the aye lobby to support the hon member for spen valley in all this extraordinary hard work the time have come when we need to end    suffering where suffering can be put aside rather than try to do something super perfect and allow too many more people to suffer in the future 
 i start by thank my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater all the member who serve on the committee and indeed the whole house for the approach that everyone have take to this bill 
 i want to make it clear that i come to this bill with an open mind like many i support it in principle at glance but this debate be no long about the principle of assist death that be not the decision before we today it be not the issue on which we will walk through the lobby when we decide to vote for or against this bill our responsibility in this place be to make sure that the bill be safe workable and effective that be the test that will lead we to vote for or against the bill today as the bill stand it present a public safety issue 
 i speak to the hon lady beforehand and i understand her concern they be the same concern i have on behalf of those who have anorexia those with mental health condition troubled people those who would be vulnerable when this idea be present to they do she think like i do that this bill do not in any way address the issue of those who be vulnerable when it come to assist dying 
 i thank the hon member for his intervention i think he might have read some of my speech which i will carry on with 
 i will set out why the bill be not safe and speak about the amendment that i table amendment which we have nod through today and amendment which we will not get the chance to vote on amendment deal with the issue of voluntarily stop eating and drinking or vsed which have be use as a bridge to assist death in other jurisdiction i be pleased that my hon friend the member for spen valley accept that amendment but let i be very clear this do not close the anorexia loophole that be the subject of another amendment voluntarily stop eating and drinking be not what happen to people with anorexia people with anorexia stop eat and drink because they have a psychiatric illness those be categorically different issue i must make it absolutely clear that even though amendment have pass today it do not address concern about anorexia or close that loophole 
 member in the other place be already raise the concern that because this be a private member ’s bill they do not believe that they can provide all the necessary safeguard if we give a reading today to a bill that be not safe to be deliver to the public at least woman with anorexia in multiple country have die by assist death when they need treatment not help to die every of they be assess to have capacity by doctor 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will make some progress 
 hundred of eat disorder expert doctor lawyer charity family member and people with live experience urge parliament to close this loophole and support amendment as a committee we fail to heed their warning we have now learn that the remain amendment that could protect people with eat disorder will not even be vote on 
 our responsibility be to make the bill safe we know what happen when politician think they know well than the expert let we make it clear the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of physicians the royal college of pathologists palliative care doctor the british geriatrics society almost every eat disorder charity and almost every disabled people ’s group do not support this bill that be not because they do not believe in the principle they be warn we about the danger of this bill and of get this wrong 
 our job be not to be activist to fight until our last breath for the principle whatever shape or form it be deliver in of course we believe in cause that be why each and every of we be in parliament but we legislator must listen to the expert heed the evidence scrutinise and debate the idea that be before we and deliver for our constituent law that be safe workable and effective we have a proud history the like of florence nightingale the lady with the lamp break every barrier possible to heal the wounded provide care for the vulnerable and reduce the chance of death those be the principle that our great nhs be found on we must ask ourselves whether those fundamental principle will still be intact if the bill pass will they be there to protect those who face a postcode lottery in healthcare and palliative care the most vulnerable and those who have face the great hardship in life and feel like a burden will those principle be there to protect those who feel like give up but whom we could help back up and push towards a well life instead we will be give they a way to give up even if they could have survive 
 this be the question for all member what be the margin of error that we be willing to risk today when it come to something as serious as death i urge member to vote against this bill 
 the mother of the house   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott be absolutely right to stress the importance of give a voice to the voiceless that be a role that many member in this house take deeply seriously include proponent of this bill no be more voiceless in this debate than those terminally ill adult who suffer painful traumatic and undignified death under the current system as well as their family nothing that i could say make the case for this bill not just the principle but this bill more powerfully than this letter from my constituent which be adapt to protect her anonymity 
 follow a diagnosis of an aggressive tumour my partner ’s final day be agony he struggle to breathe and swallow and lose his ability to speak he be incontinent developed painful bedsore he repeatedly ask for help to end his life i enter his room to see that he have stuff yard of his top sheet into his mouth in an attempt to suffocate it be the most distressing sight and i will never forget i live with this image and can not share it with our child this could have be avoid with an assist die law 
 i agree with the hon member that people in those circumstance should be able to seek an assisted death however the bill allow someone to say to a doctor on a panel i want to go because i do not want to be a burden even if they be not suffer at that point in time it also allow they to say i want to go now so that my family have a large inheritance why should we support a bill this afternoon that allow those thing 
 the hon member will be aware that the bill create a criminal offence that would punish those who would coerce a relative in such a way hon member self coerce there be folk who talk about the concept of self coercion but other would frame such a decision as a choice self coercion be a choice 
 my constituent say 
 this could have be avoid with an assisted die law my partner be from a jurisdiction where such a law exist a relative use that law they be able to gather their family say a proper goodbye and die in peace and with dignity before lose all physical and mental capacity 
 will the hon member give way on that point 
 i will not to give other the chance to speak after i 
 my constituent go on to say 
 the procedure to enable this be protract and have several safeguard which would prevent much of the concern we hear about by those oppose i urge you to support this bill 
 the bill and not just the principle i will do so because the status quo be completely unacceptable and must be reform 
 as a young doctor i would have find the measure that we be debate completely unconscionable but now that i be an old doctor i feel sure that this be an essential change that be because of what i have see over year in hospital our patient be at the centre of my thought as we consider this profound change 
 we must of course invest in palliative care and we have some of the good palliative care in the world in this country some will say that there be no limit to the comfort that expert palliative care can deliver but that have not be my observation particularly as i think about some of my patient with advanced disfigure head and neck cancer and about the terrible loss of dignity and autonomy that i have see that be what people fear and that be why i believe that we be right to give people a choice a final autonomous choice 
 i applaud the bill committee and thank the many witness who contribute for this be not easy work the house have spend hour debate the amendment the panel of the legal expert the social worker and the psychiatrist will ensure oversight and scrutiny and i have no doubt that this be well than a single judge no matter how distinguished or wise family circumstance free will and mental state will all be consider i do not think we will see coercion to undergo assist dying family be more likely to talk patient out of it 
 i call this a bill to assist people who be die the measure be not for people who be not die people who be terminally ill may live for a long time they be not yet die and the measure be for they until they be all of we must make the very good of every day whether our life be long or short of course that be especially true for those with a terminal diagnosis 
 the vulnerable must be protect and i believe that the bill will indeed protect they people who be disable and who have mental health disorder profound sadness as our life be end be quite normal and clinical depression should be treat but my observation be that the patient we be talk about be clear headed and very rational the idea that we risk open a floodgate or some sort of mission creep be quite wrong people will have a choice and will make arrangement to be use only if need that will give final peace of mind it be a final insurance policy 
 let i come back to the patient i have treat over my long career and to the wise word of the nurse who have be my compassionate colleague for many year she say this be an essential change there be the matron who recall the carotid blow out of her patient as a student many year ago an image that never leave she there be the absolute sanctity of human life but we be not deal with a choice between life and death we be deal with death or death there be also the sanctity of human dignity and fundamental to that be surely choice who be we to deny that to the dying 
 many members present will look forward to the day when it be possible for people in this country to die in peace with dignity and at a time of their choosing the opportunity to bring that about be close than ever before but it can happen only if member vote against the bill today the express will of the house as reflect in the reading vote the momentum generate by the bill and the support of the prime minister as we understand it to change the law have create a moment when it be possible to grasp the chance to bring in assist die legislation but i warn member that if this bill pass the case for assist dying will be fatally undermine and it will put back their cause for a generation 
 i have sit through committee and report listen to the oral evidence and participate in the debate this bill if it pass will be challenge in the court it will be subject to endless attempt to amend it in parliament it will be difficult to implement effectively and ultimately it will lose the confidence of the public 
 it be immensely challenging to properly debate the bill in committee because we frequently find ourselves need an understanding of medical practice or point of law that mp be not typically expert in we spend many hour for example debate whether or not the provision of the mental capacity act be sufficient for someone who be make the decision to die of course we consult expert and some say the provision be sufficient some say they be not i do not believe that this particular decision be that politician be well place to make 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be sorry but i will make progress we would all have be well serve by ask a team of expert to evaluate the evidence draw on their professional experience and come to a settle consensus among themselves on this point about mental capacity and likewise the question we have about how good to approach anorexia within the context of assist dying and whether the bill provide a suitable framework for the provision and control of drug design for the ending of a life 
 these be not political decision they have however be decide by politician and we have approach they in our usual adversarial way where the right answer be not the arrive at after careful thought consideration and consultation but the that can muster the most vote we have therefore reach a most unsatisfactory conclusion 
 this legislation impose duty and responsibility on professional who do not think they compatible with their expert practice it be amend in committee to require that a panel approve an application for assisted dying and that the panel include a psychiatrist the royal college of psychiatrists have state that it oppose this legislation 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will not give way sorry assist die under this legislation can not be implement without psychiatrist but they would be act outside the advice and guidance of their professional body 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be not give way will there be sufficient psychiatrist prepare to implement the provision of this legislation against the advice of their professional body to ensure that enough panel can be convene for the purpose of facilitate assist dying it be hard to see how there could be 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be not give way by contrast many decision be expressly reserve for politician should the limited resource of the nhs be use to deliver an assist die service or should it be possible to offer the service as a profit make enterprise what information should be collect and report about assist dying who should oversee and regulate its practitioner member of parliament be to have no say over any of those matter at all those be all power to be reserve to the secretary of state to be decide behind close door once again this legislation grant these responsibility to people who do not want they 
 neither the current health secretary nor the current justice secretary be supporter of this bill after today the house of commons will be shut out of further decision making on this bill even though many of the decision still to be make be rightfully ours to make the lack of professional consensus or acceptance of the requirement of this legislation couple with a lack of political scrutiny of many of its more important provision create an unstable foundation upon which to build an assist die service for such a service to succeed it   need professional willing to deliver it who can have confidence that they be act within the law and will be support by their professional peer and by society at large i do not see how this legislation can deliver that 
 it be instructive to compare this piece of legislation with the abortion act that too be a private member ’s bill bring to this house by the liberal mp david steel but it be precede by a medical advisory committee chair by the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists which approve the bill the professional who would be need to enact the legislation have indicate their support for the bill before it reach the commons the bill only delegate power to the secretary of state the legislation be hotly debate then as now but once it be pass it come into force within month 
 remarkably with the exception of amendment require to bring it into line with successive human fertilisation and embryology acts and to extend its provision to northern ireland the provision that the abortion act bring into law have remain almost entirely unchanged in year until just this week in fact the careful consideration of the issue that take place before the legislation come to the commons combine with the fact that all its provision be include within the primary legislation to be debate and vote on in go have enable a settle consensus to develop around abortion provision in this country in contrast to other jurisdiction it have enable vulnerable woman to seek the help they need and give healthcare worker the confidence and support they require to meet those need that be what we need if we want to deliver a successful assist die service and this legislation can not deliver that 
 if member want assist dying vote against this bill and make the most of the moment to press for a well approach that can deliver a sustainable framework accept and support by the medical profession and in which the public can have confidence if people ’s life be go to be end prematurely as a result of this legislation that we pass we can not take risk we can not afford to pass this bill 
 this be my speech in this chamber since the general election and if i be honest i wish i be not speak in this debate as i wish this legislation be not be put forward i have not always be oppose to assist dying indeed in i vote in favour of the bill put forward by rob marris mp but that be before i serve year as shadow minister for disabled people during that time i speak to hundred of disabled people and the organisation that support they they be and remain extremely fearful of assist dying 
 i take on that role at the start of the covid pandemic disabled people be disproportionately affect by the pandemic nearly in every people who die be disable many have do not resuscitate notice unilaterally paste on their medical record without they be inform it make they fear for their life it make they fear that the authority think that their life be worth less it also make they fearful of what would happen if assist die be bring forward that be why disability rights uk and other disabled   people ’s organisation have move from the neutral position they have in to a position of opposition now 
 i do not claim that every disabled person oppose assist dying but i do claim that the vast majority of disabled people and their organisation oppose it they need the health and social care system fix they want we as parliamentarian to assist they to live not to die 
 disabled people ’s voice matter in this debate and yet as i have watch the bill progress the absence of disabled people ’s voice have be astonishing they have want to engage indeed they have be cry out to be include yet the engagement have be negligible i believe that only disabled people ’s organisation be give the opportunity to provide evidence to the committee furthermore throughout committee and at the initial publication stage of the bill accessible format be not available a large print version of the bill be publish several week after the original but no other format such as easy read and british sign language have be make available these be basic thing that we should be do when consult on such important piece of legislation make it accessible so that everyone ’s voice and view can be hear 
 many of those expect to deliver this legislation also do not want it they believe that it could destroy the doctor patient relationship the expert have all be clear the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of physicians gps disability charity mental health charity and domestic abuse charity have all warn that the safeguard in the bill be insufficient and will put vulnerable people in harm ’s way 
 i will finish by say that i be not oppose to the principle of assist dying but until we have a system that support the right to life i can not support it until we ensure that all safeguard be in place i can not support it and until the vast majority of disabled people and their organisation support the legislation that be be bring forward i can not support it we be not vote on principle today this be real and we have to protect those people who be susceptible to coercion who already feel like society do not value they who often feel like a burden to the state society and their family i urge anyone in this chamber who have any doubt that this bill do not protect they who have any worry and concern please do not vote for it today let we fix our nhs social care and wide society and then consider this topic again in the future when the time be right 
 i have not speak so far in these debate but i have listen and attend on pretty much all occasion i be move to speak today because i be concern this be the point that   the hon member for lewisham north vicky foxcroft   make but what be this debate today about this debate be not about the principle of what we believe in when it come to assist dying whether we be oppose to it or in favour of it we have that debate on reading as the mother of the house   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott make very clear in what i must say be an excellent speech and as other   have too today ’s reading debate be about what we be about to pass on to the house of lords which will become law and the single question we have to ask ourselves be be this genuinely workable now 
 the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater who move the motion know that i have a high regard for she i have work with she on other thing but i honestly have to say that i simply can not see how we in this house can pass this piece of legislation through to the other house in the vague hope that somehow it will do well than we and make change such that it will become a workable piece of legislation and that be because this be a private member ’s bill if a government be to introduce a bill like this we would see a great deal more input and a huge amount more checking with all those body for example we be tell on reading that the safeguard and protection we be send to committee would somehow become the most robust and strong in the world in fact in committee they get weaken not strengthen and that be the problem in all this 
 will the right hon gentleman give way on that point 
 if the hon lady will forgive i i understand that many other want to speak so i be go make a bit of progress if she do not mind 
 the other important point when we think about what our vote today be all about be the behaviour of the professional body that have be consult on this which have come out for the most part very strongly opposed to this legislation 
 every medical college have retain a neutral position by my count—[interruption i will go on by my count or medical college have say expressly that they welcome specific amendment to the bill and all mp will have receive the letter from senior psychiatrist who include a former president of the college who say 
 we believe the draft legislation be workable safe and compassionate 
 a number of safeguard have be include in the bill do the right hon gentleman recognise that additional safeguard have be include and have be welcome by various royal college 
 i simply do not agree with the hon lady on that reading the professional body be completely divided and most have come out in opposition to the nature of this legislation it be all very well for she to say that and i appreciate she right to say it and i hope she get to speak later but i just do not agree with it 
 as be say early in the debate the whole issue of mental capacity be not deal with properly in the structure of this bill the hon member for spen valley talk about this early and she be absolutely right even the amendment that be propose be not always accept and we be leave now with some area that will be deeply troubling we simply can not accept that the lords must make these change for we for we have to make they that be the key 
 the big important area here i absolutely agree with my constituency neighbour the health secretary on this be that we talk a lot about choice in dying but   how be that choice inform if palliative care in the uk be simply not good enough again the mother of the house speak about this and there be so many people affect the most vulnerable the people furthest away from institution and the one who understand least how to work the health service or their local authority and who rely mostly on we to try and break through they will be face with this problem more than almost anybody else because they look in fear on these institution 
 i help to set up a child ’s hospice which i think be the in london there have be many more since but child ’s hospice as we know be really badly treat by government spending pretty much no matter who be in power they have less than anybody else haven house which i help to set up and raise money for have give a very strong quote which i think represent much of what most of those hospice have say 
 we would fully agree that a change in the law would have very significant consequence for the delivery of palliative care service and would be challenge give the exist resource pressure that we face the hospice sector be experience significant financial pressure and the exceptional palliative care service we provide be not financially sustainable the introduction of assist dying would create new and demanding requirement for palliative care service and hospice in particular it be therefore vital whether or not the current legislation be pass that the government take urgent action to resolve 
 this matter 
 that be the case today we can not just say well that ’s not our problem palliative care can be change the trouble be that we have be unable to make the necessary change to palliative care because we take such parti pris position that be the problem we face 
 i will end with this i will vote against the bill mostly because i believe it be fundamentally unworkable and will lead to huge problem we have see what have happen elsewhere internationally canada oregon and various other place where legislation slide and slide again as more and more amendment have to be make because these thing be not workable to those who have any doubt i simply say this this be reading it be not reading it be not an in principle debate we have that debate and now we have to decide whether we should send this unworkable piece of legislation to another place which be unelecte to make the decision for we because we can not come to a conclusion we can not let this go through 
 i rise to speak in support of the bill on reading because at its very heart be terminally ill adult people who be die people who have less than month to live people who have try to stay alive to beat a terrible disease with expert medical treatment but to no avail now they face the inevitable that they will die in fact that be the only thing any of we know we will ever do really 
 i be sure that most of we think about and desire a peaceful pain free death where we slip off in our sleep at a ripe old age have live a good life but the reality be that all of we and all our citizen those for whom we legislate in this place could face a painful and undignified   death that be why i believe that in the century like a grow number of other country we should change the law to permit choice at the end of life or rather choice towards the end of death so that die people can opt to have a death in the manner of their choosing and have an element of control over those last day 
 yougov polling publish yesterday again show that the public the citizen we serve back it too with support assist dying in principle and support the bill as it stand as a co sponsor of the bill and have serve on the bill committee i be pleased that it be have more scrutiny challenge and debate than almost any other piece of legislation over hour in fact 
 will the hon member give way 
 i be sorry but we be short of time 
 the change that have be make include many propose by member who do not support a change in the law but which have be adopt by the promoter of the bill my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater as well as those propose during the process she have lead in response to evidence submit during the scrutiny process have lead to a well bill the bill have great safeguard for more vulnerable people with mandatory training requirement include in relation to coercion and capacity the bill ensure judicial oversight of decision making by a range of expert include psychiatrist social worker and senior legal professional the bill will set out statutory protection for those worker who do not wish to take part in the assisted dying process on the basis of conscience and quite right too 
 the bill will provide for of the tight safest assist die law in the world importantly the bill have compassion at its core by afford die people choice at the end of life i thank every of my constituent who share their view with i whether for or against a change in the law i particularly thank all those who have disagree with i because good democracy and the right to disagree respectfully be hugely important perhaps it be a debate for another time 
 i also thank all those who have share their personal story of love one death some brutal painful and traumatic a stark reminder that the status quo be simply unacceptable other have share experience with love one who in other jurisdiction such as australia be able to have a peaceful death surround by love one and at a time of their choosing 
 as i come to a close although not everyone would want to choose an assisted death i believe that everyone should have the opportunity to choose if they so wish it really be time that this house take the important compassionate and humane step towards make that a reality by vote for the terminally ill adult end of life bill 
 that be a minute speech thank you very much i now call the father of the house 
 i have serve for many year with   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott   and dare i say it we have not agree on everything over the year but we have publish a few article on this topic those article have always start with the fundamental principle of the nhs some of we maybe myself include have be rather critical of the nhs over the year but at least when we go into the nhs we know that everybody be really try their good to preserve life that be the fundamental principle 
 the reason why the right hon lady and i both oppose the bill be that as have be say several time we be not talk about just a principle here we be talk about an actual bill i know some people will criticise i and say oh you would oppose this because of your religious view and all the rest of it actually i take quite a sensible and i hope pragmatic approach to this i have listen to all these debate and we have hear so many harrowing story of people ’s last hour i think we should treat people on both side of this argument with respect understand their point of view and respect the dignity of die people 
 i have always take the view that we should open up this debate actually i have bring forward a minute rule bill which of course will be object to at half past this afternoon say that we should have a full study lead by the department of health and social care by health professional to work out how we can help people in their final hour i have be to many hospice and care home and talk to many palliative care specialist who assure i that they have the resource and skill nowadays to make those final hour pain free and bearable but we have hear testimony from other say that that be not possible if they could convince i that there be some extreme case where people be die in agony totally lack in dignity in their final hour then i would listen to those argument but i do not think that be the bill that we have before we today 
 i therefore urge member to remember that we will be vote on a bill and i think that the bill be so riddled through with difficulty and inconsistency i think it will be subject to human right legislation it be very difficult to argue that we can ask somebody to assist in a person ’s death when they be within month of dying of cancer although there be no universal testimony or acceptance about how we work out those month but not if they be suffer from some appalling degenerative disease or be a quadriplegic or have no quality of life so i think there be actually an argument that if we pass this bill today we will move in the direction of canada and we will have death on demand 
 i will end on this point before vote for this bill just pause for a moment and think would not it be well we have hear about the many hour on the abortion bill and the universality of clinical acceptance of it before we vote for this bill do we not think that we should ask the health department to have a profound and knowledgeable study work with the royal college on whether it be possible to have decent palliative care not just in our wonderful hospice but in all our hospital there be no doubt that in recent year particularly since shipman there have be a fear among many nhs health   professional about provide that degree of palliative care that degree of morphine fentanyl or these hugely effective modern drug 
 so just pause and think we be not vote on a principle we can come back to this and at a later date we can get consensus and we can have a really good bill that will allow everybody to die in dignity 
 i will speak briefly and cover just point i do not expect to persuade those commit to oppose the bill to change their mind i hope that i do not persuade those support it to change theirs this be the time to put our conclude thought on the record before seek their lordship opinion 
 i start where i finish my speech on reading agency since that debate last november i have continue to meet constituent on both side of the argument and answer hundred of letter and email i be sure that other hon member have do the same i have meet mainly with group that oppose the bill include faith group because they have seek to change my mind i have not change my mind i be still drive by the plight of those suffer unnecessarily at the end of life 
 i wholly respect the decision of those who would not want assist die for themselves but i can not accept their right to deny that choice to those who would for the most profound reason use the provision of the bill to end their life the pain suffering indignity and degradation of a slow painful torture death be something none of we would wish on a friend or relative on anyone if that suffer at the end of life in the narrow circumstance prescribe by the bill can be avoid who be we to deny that 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be not go to give way 
 the obvious qualification to what should be a clear and personal choice to leave life in a matter and at a time of ’s choosing be the risk of coercion and that have rightly dominate much of the debate for the past month there be point to be make here 
 great effort have be expend and be reflect in amendment to the bill to make the safeguard as comprehensive and watertight as possible learn from and go beyond practice in other jurisdiction compliance with the provision of the bill be a rigorous process but it be also a practical it be design to be transparent and to test the intent of the person seek an assisted death 
 secondly some say that that be still not enough but with what be they compare it the answer at good and in some case be the status quo which may involve an investigation post mortem as to whether assistance have be give put a caring love at risk of prosecution but do nothing to prevent those of malign intent 
 finally although i have try to see both side on every issue there be point on which the opponent of the bill be in my opinion just wrong whether the bill have thus far see due process i have be in   parliament for a month over year and i can think of few bills of this length and scope that have receive so much scrutiny and so many hour in committee or on which so much evidence have be submit and comment make 
 member will vote against the bill for many reason even though by do so they restrict the choice of other they should compare the regime pre and post legislation and i hope decide that the bill give great protection but i ask they not to vote against it because we have lack the time or information to make a decision we have not or because we do not as a country have the ability to resource the bill we do a great trust and great opportunity have be give to the member of this parliament this be the moment of decision and we should discharge it to the good of our ability 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to speak for the time on this bill i do not vote on reading in november 
 in her opening speech this morning   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   say that we could choose to vote with our head or with our heart and i have be grapple with that tension and conflict over the past few month i be afraid that i can not agree with the chair of the justice committee   the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter that the bill be strong now than it be on reading
