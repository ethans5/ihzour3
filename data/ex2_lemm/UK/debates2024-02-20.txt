the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to ensure that people leave prison be provide with support to help prevent reoffende 
 what step he be take to help reduce reoffende 
 what step his department be take to help reduce rate of reoffende by people release from prison 
 since crime have fall and so have reoffende with the overall prove rate of reoffende down from over in to in that mean that few innocent member of the public be suffer from the misery of fall victim to crime we have go far build up initiative include a new prison education service expand access to incentivise substance free living wing for drug recovery and the groundbreaking guarantee of week post release accommodation to secure that essential period of stability for offender to turn their life around 
 with the reoffende rate at over rise to nearly for burglary reoffende be cost the country £ a year and the service be fail to keep we safe if just a small fraction of that cost be invest in probation staff to address the problem cause by day lose through sickness and people leave each year it could be transformative will the justice secretary back operation protect the campaign spearhead by the justice union and ensure that there be a comprehensive workforce plan to recruit retain and return the staff need to prevent reoffende 
 the hon lady be right we want to drive the offend rate down and it be good news that it be down from about in to now but we do believe in invest in probation that be why the baseline be up by £ and it be why we have add trainee since since the reunification of probation service the number have rise by probation officer keep society safe and we will back they all   the way 
 i recently raise the issue of social medium use in prison allegedly by of those responsible for the murder of jack woodley the son of my constituent zoey mcgill we have a local campaign against knife crime and at the late working group meeting we discuss deterrent zoey would like to understand what consequence be suffer by this individual for the post that he send but also why he should be wear a designer t shirt and apparently lead a cushy life prison need to be see as a deterrent but if inmate be have it easy with designer wear and no consequence how be that a deterrent may i ask the secretary of state what be be do to address this and to make prison the deterrent that it should be 
 i know that the whole house will want to send its deep sympathy to zoey mcgill follow the shocking murder of her son in it be a dreadful crime of which man be convict and for which they receive life sentence the use of social medium in prison be not acceptable and this content be remove from the social medium platform we have be invest £ in prison security and new technology include x ray scanner to tackle the smuggling of contraband mobile phone those who be catch can face loss of privilege more time in custody and even a referral to the police and the crown prosecution service for consideration of further charge 
 last year i be grateful for the government ’s support for my private member ’s bill to limit friday release for vulnerable prisoner it be an important measure and be now an act but it be only of the measure that we should be take to reduce reoffende and help people get back on their foot when they leave prison the excellent charity switchback have suggest that at the very minimum people should be leave prison with access to id and an internet enable mobile phone just to get their life in order so that they can access universal credit and other service what consideration have my right hon and learn friend give to those suggestion 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his excellent work in successfully champion the limit on friday prison release the change for which he call come into force last november and be exceptionally helpful and he deserve great credit for that he be also right to point to the brilliant work of switchback which have support our resettlement work that work include the roll out of week guarantee accommodation and the introduction of resettlement passport which contain precisely the basic information to which my hon friend refer such as a prisoner ’s name date of birth national insurance number and release date they help prisoner to access essential service such as housing and healthcare and contribute to the driving down of reoffending which as be recognise by   the hon member for york central rachael maskell be significantly low than it be in 
 the wife of a remand prisoner at wormwood scrubs write to i recently to say that the prison be so cold that prisoner be shake that they have to choose between work social time and showering and that the food be lack in basic nutrition i can explore these matter with the prisons minister in a couple of week time during our   joint visit to the scrubs but do the secretary of state agree that such condition be not conducive to rehabilitation 
 this be an important point we do deprive people of liberty and sometimes we have to do so in the case of those on remand but the condition must be safe decent and humane austere yes but humane as well i commend the hon gentleman for go to see the scrubs with the prisons minister my right hon friend   the member for charnwood edward argar and i shall be very interested to hear his view thereafter 
 i call shadow minister ruth cadbury 
 we need to tackle the revolving door of reoffende in our justice system yet the reoffende rate as a proportion of those leave prison continue to rise whatever the secretary of state may say i have hear time and again that the lack of secure housing adequate and appropriate healthcare education job training and job support mean that prisoner be be leave to fail after they be release it be the victim of crime who suffer when ex prisoner reoffend can the secretary of state announce when the government expect the reoffende rate to go down 
 it be important to note that reoffende be down compare with under the last labour government the hon lady shake her head but can dispute opinion in this house but not fact the reoffende rate in be around it be now that mean few people fall victim to crime 
 the hon lady refer to accommodation and she be right to do so what she do not advert to be this government ’s decision to provide week guarantee accommodation which do not happen under a labour government when i go to luton and dunstable i speak to a probation officer who have do the job for year and do you know what he say it be the single most effective measure to drive down reoffende who do that not the labour party but we 
 what step he be take to increase sentence for dangerous offender 
 measure in the sentencing bill will ensure that those who commit the bad crime will receive the most severe punishment the bill create a duty for the court to impose a whole life order for murder currently subject to a whole life order start point and for those that involve sexual or sadistic conduct unless there be exceptional circumstance the bill will also ensure that convict rapist must serve of their custodial term in prison follow by a licence period 
 i thank the minister for his answer and welcome those measure the bad case i have have to deal with as an mp be where woman be brutally murder by a partner or ex partner what be the government go to do in response to the clare wade review to increase sentence for people who commit those awful vile offence 
 my hon friend be quite right to raise the issue of domestic homicide we be determined to act to protect the victim of domestic abuse and ensure that the appropriate punishment be in place for perpetrator that be why follow clare wade kc ’s review we be increase sentence by introduce statutory aggravating factor for murder that be precede by control or coercive behaviour involve overkill or be connect with the end of a relationship 
 do the minister agree that wide society ’s confidence in the judicial system be often determine by how dangerous offender be treat do he agree that it be vital that we get the message out there both to wide society and to potential offender that there be the ultimate price to pay which be a long sentence in prison for criminal offence such as these 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i agree with those sentiment entirely 
 with reference to his oral statement of december on hillsborough bishop james jones report column if he will bring forward legislative proposal to introduce a legal duty of candour on public body 
 in his excellent report the patronising disposition of unaccountable power bishop james jones call for the creation of the hillsborough charter for bereaved family as well as for the imposition of a duty of candour on police officer we agree wholeheartedly which be why the government have sign the charter alongside the crown prosecution service the national police chiefs council and other and impose a   duty of candour on the police we be also legislate   to create a strong permanent and independent public advocate to speak up for victim and their family and to rigorously hold signatory to the charter to account we stand ready to discuss what further step may be necessary 
 the parent of zane gbangbola be in the public gallery today zane be just when he die follow flood year ago this month the fire brigade detect hydrogen cyanide multiple time his parent kye and nicole have be fight for the truth about their son ’s death ever since and a duty of candour would have help they to get it in lieu of that will the government establish an independent panel inquiry with full disclosure so that all the evidence can be review by expert we can finally get the truth about what happen to an innocent year old boy and justice can be do 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this deeply upsetting case and i know the whole house will be think of kye and nicole as they continue to mourn the loss of zane the hon gentleman raise a critically important case may i suggest that he and i discuss it and see what further step can properly be take in this difficult case 
 i call shadow minister kevin brennan 
 i welcome the meeting that the secretary of state have just offer 
 the problem with the government ’s response be that it ought to be centre on the experience of family not on the convenience of state bureaucracy in order to ensure that they be never repeat there be nothing in what we have see so far from the government that go as far as we and more importantly the family believe be necessary to require public authority to act with candour and transparency why be the secretary of state persist with a piecemeal approach instead of commit to a clear compelling and comprehensive duty of candour as propose in the hillsborough law 
 as i say the recommendation of bishop james jones ’s report which we have consider extremely carefully contain the charter for bereaved family and it be worth reflect on what paragraph of the report say it require the public body to 
 approach form of public scrutiny include public inquiry and inquest with candour in an open honest and transparent way make full disclosure of relevant document material and fact 
 take together with the power that exist under the inquiries act there be potentially criminal culpability misconduct in a public office and pervert the course of justice but of course we will keep this under review we want to make sure that public body do what they should that is act transparently and we will always consider what further step can be take 
 what step he be take to exonerate sub postmaster who be prosecute due to error in the post office horizon system 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to exonerate sub postmaster who be convict due to error in the post office horizon system 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to exonerate sub postmaster who be convict due to error in the post office horizon system 
 in september a public inquiry be set up into the failing associate with the post office horizon it system and it be expect to report back later this year in addition over £ have already be pay out in compensation across scheme 
 however in its december letter the independent horizon compensation advisory board express concern that the pace of exoneration be too slow not least because evidence have be lose and many be simply too traumatised to come forward that be why the prime minister have decide to bring forward legislation to quash the relevant conviction and the department for business and trade will be announce detail shortly these wholly exceptional circumstance have lead to this wholly exceptional course 
 while i welcome the government ’s commitment to quash the wrongful conviction of sub postmaster catch up in the horizon scandal i also recognise that this be a complex area of law that could even raise constitutional issue give that some sub postmaster have be suffer for an extremely long time do my right hon and learn friend agree that any legislation should deal with these issue swiftly and avoid any further delay 
 i thank my hon friend for the careful and thoughtful way in which he address this significant issue the judiciary and court have deal swiftly with the case before they but the scale and circumstance of the prosecution failure mean that this demand an unprecedented response and that be why the prime minister announce this major step forward in response to the horizon scandal we be keen to ensure that the legislation achieve its goal of bring prompt justice to all those who be wrongfully convict follow by rapid financial redress it be not right that wholly innocent people could potentially go to their graf with the mark and stigma of a conviction hang over they 
 every day we hear further revelation about the post office and today ’s shocking well it should be shocking bbc story state that the swift review note that the post office have always know about the balance transaction capability of horizon and that the government know in that a deloitte investigation into all horizon transaction be under way and that this investigation be suddenly halt after sub postmaster begin legal action will the secretary of state confirm whether the ministry of justice be aware of this and do he believe that that apparent non disclosure to the inquiry be a threat to judicial freedom and independence 
 in come up to year ago now an independent inquiry be set up under mr justice wyn williams that be expect to report later this year and it will go into properly exhaustive detail about who know what and when we be absolutely clear that there have be an egregious failure of prosecution conduct frankly that bring shame on those involve and it be absolutely right that that inquiry should get to the bottom of what take place and who know what and when 
 the current chief executive of the post office say in evidence to the business and trade committee last month that despite various audits and investigation we still do not know the full scope of the money overclaime through horizon or where it go even the auditor be unable to give a firm figure postmaster such as my constituent roger have suffer incredible stress and worry as well as significant financial loss but the prospect of get to the truth on these figure still seem far off 
 will the secretary of state commit to work with the secretary of state for business and trade and set out a timetable for update the house on how much the post office take and what it do with the money so that constituent like mine can start to get the answer and the justice that they deserve 
 my heart go out to roger and people like he i have constituent who be affect as i be sure everyone in this house do we be a fair minded nation which be why it strike we to the core the hon lady ask i to liaise with the department for business and trade of course the moj will do everything it properly can but dbt be lead on this it be also worth reflect that £ have already be pay out across the scheme and there be a very important swift and robust approach of pay £ to those who have their conviction quash that be the right approach it be exceptional but these be exceptional circumstance 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 my right hon and learn friend will know that only last week the court of appeal criminal division preside over by the lady chief justice quash in bulk a number of horizon appeal on the basis of a half hour hearing when the case get to court the court can deal with they swiftly 
 do my right hon and learn friend agree that in frame any legislation because of the constitutional implication it be important that we bear in mind that the failure be the failure of a prosecutor to do their duty or perhaps the failure of the state to come to the aid of victim but they be not the failure of the court which always act entirely properly on the material put before they by the party at the time it be a failure of the party not of the court 
 as always my hon friend get to the heart of it this be a failure of the post office which be an emanation of the state and it be the duty of the state to put it right the court have approach this entirely properly the post office fail to discharge the solemn obligation on any prosecutor to act fairly and to comply with their obligation under section of the criminal procedure and investigations act to disclose material that might reasonably be consider capable of undermine the case of the prosecution or of assist the case of the defence when i be prosecute the rule be that we do not seek a conviction at all cost which be an important principle that the post office fail to appreciate 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 whistleblower have come forward to provide information that fujitsu be give an additional contract by the post office in to re platform transaction datum that be previously hold on an external storage system that be consider to be the gold standard it be replace by a system that make it virtually impossible to investigate financial transaction in a forensic audit do the justice secretary share our concern that this decision effectively destroy evidence prevent exactly the sort of audit trail that would exonerate those sub postmaster who be convict 
 the department for business and trade be well place to answer those specific point but i would say thing as a matter of sacred principle if material come into a prosecutor ’s possession that might be consider capable of undermine the case of the prosecution that material should be disclose   to the defence that be of the thing that have be consider by sir wyn williams ’s inquiry what do the post office know when do it know it and what do it do with the material before it across the house we want to get to the bottom of those question 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the rapid deployment community payback pilot 
 it be a pleasure to respond to my question from the hon gentleman since his election 
 as part of the government ’s antisocial behaviour action plan community payback team be work in partnership with local authority to rapidly clean up antisocial behaviour in the community the pilot start in july and we be in the process of analyse the outcome initial observation point to the pilot have be successful with thousand of hour of reparative work be do by hundred of people on probation within hour of local authority notification allow the public to see justice do 
 these rapid deployment community payback scheme pilot be suppose to pave the way for the accelerated roll out of exactly the kind of swift transparent restorative justice that victim of crime in my constituency be desperate to see unfortunately i understand that of a plan hour of work only hour have be deliver by the pilot can the minister reveal whether that be the case if so what can be learn from the clear barrier to success 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman but the clue be in the word pilot these pilot be carry out in area over month in the run up to christmas and people complete around hour of unpaid work we be analyse the outcome of those pilot and base on what that analysis say i look forward to explore how we can roll this out more widely across the country 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the length of time that prisoner spend in their cell on reoffende rate 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the length of time that prisoner spend in their cell on reoffende rate 
 we know that activity such as education and training can help to give prisoner skill that they need to get a job on release thus reduce the likelihood of reoffende that be why we launch our new national regime model for prisoner last month it set out core expectation for regime delivery so that prison be get the most out of the work day and aid the rehabilitation of prisoner of course we be also see improve staffing number to facilitate those regime 
 reoffende cost £ a year but there be not just the financial cost but the impact on society in general as well as on the individual some young prisoner be still get only hour out of their cell so there be no time for rehabilitation they can perhaps do a little exercise but that be not the same how confident be the minister that all young prisoner will get the re education that he have outline when do he think all young prisoner if these people have to be in prison will get proper rehabilitation and the support they need when they come out of prison to get a home to have somewhere to stay and to go into further training will he please give i some reassurance that well time be come not just for young offender but for society as a whole 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for that as she know i have a huge amount of respect for she and she raise a hugely important point we have hear from the lord chancellor that reoffende rate have come down from to since so we be make progress but we want to drive they down far she also rightly highlight the importance of purposeful activity lead to the opportunity on release for employment accommodation and so on that be central to the opportunity for prisoner to rehabilitate themselves 
 we have see significant progress make in our youth estate the hon lady talk about young prisoner and rightly say that we need to go far but we believe the national regime model that we launch in january will go a long way to do that the additional staff we have recruit into his majesty ’s prison and probation service be central to do that as they enable that regime to be put in place however she be absolutely right to highlight this issue 
 i welcome the minister ’s acknow ledgement that more education in prison mean cut the reoffende rate and that clear link to crime i welcome the national regime model and will be interested to see how it play out because i have see chronic staff shortage and sickness absence in particular at prison such as hmp wandsworth which i have visit those thing mean that prisoner be entirely miss out on any education training and working opportunity when will i be able to go back to hmp wandsworth and see the increase in staff and retention that be need there when will the government get a grip on the prison officer recruitment and retention crisis 
 again i have a lot of respect for the hon lady but i be afraid that what she be suggest do not entirely reflect the fact if we compare the figure for and for band to prison officer we see that there be over more now which be an increase of in hmpps sick rate be down in the past year when just over people join and left again that reflect an increase we be invest in our prison officer and increase their number and that be be reflect in retention i pay tribute to they for the work they do we should be talk they up not down 
 i be encourage by my right hon friend ’s comment about the number of additional prison officer recruit i have see many of they and the fantastic work they do both at   hmp aylesbury and across the prison estate will he say a little more about how we can ensure that we retain they once they have be train and they go on to the wing this be an incredibly important career it be key to reduce reoffende and prison officer deserve credit and the support of everybody in this house 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that he be absolutely right about the importance of not just recruit new prison officer but retain experienced one in our prison that be why the pay deal do last year with hmpps staff be hugely important in recognise the important work that prison officer do day in day out it be also reflect in the fact that the leave rate for prison officer be down in from where it be in however there be more to do and we will continue to do it 
 i call the shadow justice secretary 
 prisoner be spend up to hour a day lock up in their cell as a direct result of overcrowding and the prison capacity crisis cause by this government however i hear congratulation be in order follow an announcement last month not on the government actually deliver any of the new prison they have promise or on even get spade in the ground but on their submit yet another planning application for the leicestershire prison that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have already rule on once be not about time that the minister rename the new prison programme the no prison programme 
 for a moment i think the shadow justice secretary be refer to her own party ’s record when in government—7,500 prison place in titan prison that fail to be build whereas we be commit to build new modern prison have be build be be build at the moment and have planning permission 
 while prisoner be serve their sentence they be not be allow to leave their cell but ironically the government be also release some of they early despite a multitude of letter question and even a point blank request from the justice committee the government be refuse to tell we how many prisoner be be release early and from where the public and parliament have a right to know so will the minister finally come clean on how the early release scheme have be use so far if not can he tell the house what he have to hide 
 as the shadow justice secretary will know my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor have make clear that in line with other statistic for example death in custody statistic we will publish those figure on an annual basis 
 i be sure my right hon friend will agree with i that the rehabilitation of offender can be greatly assist by activity and work outdoors in particular on farm and at horticultural establishment will the minister reassure i that he be committed to increase the quantity of work available outdoors and let i know what have happen to the prison estate in recent year 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of a range of purposeful activity for those in prison from skilled industrial work in workshop to outside work a good example mention recently on itv racing of all thing be about get farrier and those work in the equine world into prison the example be a prison in solihull to teach prisoner about job opportunity in the equine world there be a range of opportunity out there and it be important that they be available to those in our custody 
 what progress his department have make on reduce the backlog of case in the crown court 
 we remain committed to reduce the crown court outstanding case load and have introduce a range of measure to achieve the same we fund over sitting day last year and plan to deliver the same again this year we have recruit over judge over all jurisdiction and plan to do the same again this year thank to the intervention of the lord chancellor we have secure £ for essential modernisation repair work over the next year as well as retain nightingale court the investment will also see new courtroom 
 the fact be that the crown court how have a backlog of over case if that be not bad enough expert say the court capacity to deal with processing case will not keep pace with demand do the minister agree that that lead to too many victim unfortunately give up on our justice system 
 no i do not accept that that mean we be give up on the system the government continue to invest in every single lever that we can pull to increase capacity in our criminal justice system give the additional work that the judiciary be do the disposal rate in our crown court be up and we be see record level of disposal so we will start to see the criminal justice system heal because we be still recover from covid and the criminal bar association strike 
 i call the shadow minister 
 rape and serious sexual assault case have increase to of all crown court case and with nearly of they they make up in of the backlog the average wait time for a trial after charge have rise to month we also know from the criminal bar association that there have be a tenfold increase in adjourn case due to the fall in the number of rape and serious sexual offence prosecution or defence barrister with the crown prosecution service now employ king ’s counsel to fill the gap add to that the many legal aid desert due to the shortage of solicitor and we have a major staffing crisis across the criminal justice system how be that go to be fix 
 the figure that the hon gentleman quote for the average time for a rasso case be simply not true the government have continue to invest in ensure that rasso case be bring forward list be a matter for the judiciary and they take great care to   ensure that vulnerable victim be deal with expeditiously in addition we continue to invest in the legal aid system the lord chancellor recently increase the fee to ensure that there be people able to perform rasso case and section video recording on top of that we continue to engage with the criminal legal aid review to see how we can continue to invest in and incentivise criminal defence barrister in the right part of the system 
 what step his department be take through the criminal justice system to support victim of crime 
 since we have ramp up support for victim in main way we have drive down reoffende from around to so that few people suffer the misery of become a victim of crime in the place secondly we have create new offence such as stalking coercive and control behaviour revenge pornography upskirting and non fatal strangulation so that those who betray trust and shatter life can be hold to account thirdly we have quadruple victim funding enable massive investment in resource such as independent domestic violence adviser which be up from barely exist in to more than today and we will go far with the groundbreaking victims and prisoners bill as well 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for all the sterling work that he have just outline which be make such a huge difference to victim everywhere i wish to talk about a case that be raise with i at an advice surgery after see an advert on the tube my constituent a man of very good standing invest in what turn out to be a fraudulent company to the tune of £ he be clearly a victim of crime and mercifully his bank reimburse his life saving after some challenge he do get financial restitution but the whole experience have wide devastating impact those behind the company be register in serbia and to the good of our knowledge have never be bring to justice as my constituent do not go through the full criminal justice system may i ask how victim such as he can be support in case like this 
 i thank my hon friend for raise her constituent ’s case fraud be a pernicious cruel crime and it can have an appalling impact as i know from my own experience of prosecute for the serious fraud office to support victim in recover lose fund the financial services and markets act give the payment systems regulator further power to mandate reimbursement where need and i be glad that that take place in this case but to bring wrongdoer to justice prosecutor include the cps the financial conduct authority and the sfo regularly co operate with their international counterpart to make arrest and secure evidence overseas so that in appropriate case defendant can be extradite to face trial in the uk the other critical point be that the victim code have be expand so that people such as her constituent can get the support they need i would invite he perhaps through the hon lady ’s good office to look at the support that be available online 
 be the secretary of state aware of a new crime that be spread throughout the north of england include in your constituency mr speaker and in mine a group be prey on people who have cavity wall insulation those people get themselves into the legal process and find the expense be so high that they have to sell their home it be an epidemic it be also rather like the post office scandal this be an early warning of a major scandal will the secretary of state agree to look into this matter as it be very important especially in the north of england 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that matter on the floor of the house he will understand i know that he well appreciate this that it be not for the secretary of state to be order investigation but plainly the matter he raise be serious i invite the police and prosecutor to take all appropriate step to investigate it if that be what be require 
 if he will make an estimate of the cost to the public purse of judicial process under joint enterprise relate to violent crime in each year since 
 although the ministry of justice collate statistic nationally on the principal criminal offence for which a perpetrator be prosecute convict or sentence include datum on their ethnicity it do not collate datum on whether the crime that they commit be part of joint enterprise so unfortunately i be unable to provide the information that the hon lady request however we be consider whether such datum could be collect as part of the common platform programme which aim to provide a single case management system that would enable the sharing of such evidence and case information across the criminal justice system 
 i welcome that response but the minister will know that manchester metropolitan university have recently carry out some research into the cost of prosecute under joint enterprise some £ be spend process joint enterprise case and an extra £ be spend incarcerate the just over people who be convict those be eye watering amount of money so do the minister agree that we need to review the doctrine of joint enterprise to ensure that only those who be responsible for significant contribution to a crime be punish for it 
 there be a cost to justice people who be find guilty of crime base on the evidence present to a court of law have be sentence and there be a cost to their incarceration simply put the cost of incarcerate people be not a reason to review the law 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of devolving responsibility for justice to the welsh government 
 the government be clear that it be in the good interest of the people of wales for justice to remain a reserved matter the current arrangement work well and allow wales to benefit from be part of a large world renowne justice system devolve justice to wales would mean lose those benefit and would be extremely expensive and complex require the duplication of function 
 follow the publication last month of the final report by the independent commission on the constitutional future of wales the minister of wales confirm unambiguously that it be the policy of the welsh government and indeed of the welsh labour party to support the devolution of the justice system in pursue the devolution of the probation service he say 
 we will have to explore governance financial arrangement 
 and the interface between welsh and english service when will the minister meet the counsel general for wales to discuss the devolution of justice 
 if the representative for the welsh government wish to meet i i be more than happy to explain why wales be part of the english and welsh legal system remain the preferred option for this government why would wales want to leave the most successful legal service system in the world 
 what step his department be take to protect the privacy right of rape victim in criminal justice process 
 what step his department be take to protect the privacy right of rape victim in criminal justice process 
 it be paramount that victim come forward without fear that their privacy will be violate that be why we be take step through the victims and prisoners bill to create a statutory restriction that limit police request to party material that be necessary and proportionate and to inform victim of why such material be be request the government have also ask the law commission to undertake a review on the use of evidence in sexual offence prosecution and it be due to report later this year 
 my constituent have all her counselling record use against she in a harrowing trial that she say be bad than the crime itself will the victims and prisoners bill be sufficiently amend so that medical and social service record be not use against victim in court and family court be not use to perpetuate such abuse against the victim particularly with the use of the term parental alienation 
 i be truly sorry to hear of what happen to the hon lady ’s constituent i hope that i can reassure she by say that new regulation will be publish under the victims and prisoners bill to create a code of   practice set out the principle that the police should apply to all party request include for counselling therapy and medical note the police will be require to complete a new request form that set out the purpose and impact of their request the crown prosecution service also have a robust case file review process to ensure that guidance on necessary and proportionate request be comply with the cps pre trial therapy guideline make it crystal clear that victim must not delay therapy for criminal investigation and prosecution 
 recently i be able to visit the gwent rape investigation unit and see what an excellent job the police officer there be do however can the minister explain why the government think it be appropriate to boast about the so call progress on the rape review when the proportion of case be charge have halve since and the key adviser quit because of the lack of drive to improve outcome for victim 
 i have also hear very good report of the work that gwent police be do so i be glad to hear what the hon lady say i must push back very slightly on what have happen since we launch the end to end rape review we be prosecute more rape case than we be in conviction rate be high and perpetrator be go to prison for almost long than they be in the average sentence increase from and a half year to and a half year i accept that the last independent adviser to the rape review go but last week we announce the appointment of professor katrin hohl a legal academic who pioneer operation soteria which i think every member of this house agree have transform the way in which police investigate and prosecute rape and be lead to well criminal justice outcome for victim 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the use of non disclosure agreement in judicial process 
 non disclosure agreement can not prevent any disclosure that be require or protect by law nor can they preclude an individual from assert statutory right the court and judiciary apply the law in relation to nda as appropriate in individual case and where necessary determine whether or not they should be enforceable 
 last year the legal services board state that incident of misconduct by lawyer deal with non disclosure agreement be a cause for concern and that there be a strong case for a strengthened and harmonise regulatory approach do the minister agree that there be a need for strong regulation in this area and will he support the bill table by my hon friend   the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran which would end the misuse of non disclosure agreement in the workplace 
 i be more than happy to have a discussion with the hon lady but my understanding be that the solicitors regulation authority have already publish a   warning notice remind solicitor and law firm that potential professional misconduct by a person or a firm should be report to the regulator if she believe that there be still gap in that warning notice or that more need to be do i be more than happy to have a meeting 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last justice question i have meet with the family of those kill by valdo calocane barnaby webber grace o’malley kumar and ian coates they deserve answer and a series of review be take place include by the attorney general on refer the sentence in that case to the court of appeal 
 we have announce an early legal advice pilot to help family agree child arrangement quickly i have visit leeds to see how £ be be spend to roll out state of the art courtroom as part of our £ investment in the court estate i have travel to the usa to meet my counterpart to discuss how russia can be hold financially and legally to account and i be fit with a gps tag to experience for myself how effective modern technology be in hold offender and justice secretaries to account a constant physical reminder that debt to society must be repay court order must be observe and transgressor face the very real risk of the clang of a prison gate hon member do you have it on now no i do not 
 as my right hon and learn friend just mention he spend a day wear a gps tag along with jack elsom from the sun could he outline what he learn from that experience and say whether he think gps tag be a robust and effective mean of monitor and punish low level offender will he reveal to the house who else from the lobby be on his list to be tag 
 i remind member that these be topical question 
 i thank my hon friend for his question there be a serious point here our modern gps tag act as a constant physical reminder that debt to society must be repay and that breach of a court order will be detect so that a person who step over the line literally or metaphorically and enter an area from which he be bar know that he be liable to be return to court and send to prison we could put the entire lobby on alcohol tag but i think that would deal a fatal blow to the uk drink industry 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i recently visit cookham wood young offender institution there officer tell i about the challenge they face include a staffing shortage and shocking recruitment issue which have lead to rise level of violence can the minister say when he last visit cookham wood and why this government continue to be unable to solve those crucial problem 
 i have visit cookham wood i can not remember the precise date but the really important statistic to note be that in the period up to the end of september last year we recruit an additional prison officer the number be go up and the attrition rate be go down interruption hold on that be because we have introduce measure such as the new colleague mentor scheme roll out £ on security and so on we recognise that the safety of our prison be in large measure down to the quality and quantity of our staff and we be improve on both count 
 there be an interesting debate in the house of lords last night in which lord hoffmann confirm my understanding that the european court of human rights be wrong to impose a rule injunction to stop flight to rwanda and that we could safely ignore such an injunction will the secretary of state confirm that that be his understanding of the law and if we get the bill through parliament and have flight on the ground will he ignore such an injunction and would that not be a good issue on which to fight the election 
 order sir edward you should know well this be topical you be a member of the panel of chairs as well you be mean to set an example not abuse your position 
 i do not have the advantage of have listen to lord hoffmann but we do not think that the strasbourg court will need to intervene give that our domestic court will have carefully assess whether anyone we intend to remove to rwanda would suffer serious and irreversible harm 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 unison of which i be a proud member have criticise government plan to reintroduce employment tribunal fee on the ground that the 
 only people who would benefit from their reintroduction be unscrupulous boss 
 the resolution foundation have find that the lowest pay worker be least likely to bring a claim so how can the justice secretary defend plan to reintroduce employment tribunal fee which will disproportionately affect those on low wage and present an obstacle to justice for those who need it most 
 the £ claim issue fee be modest and this be completely different from the previous fee scheme so i simply do not accept the hon gentleman ’s characterisation i be quite happy to defend that small reasonable fee as necessary to help defray the cost of our system 
 what percentage of the backlog in crown court case be due to foreign national offender and what have be do to reduce that 
 datum on foreign national offender be collect at the point when an individual become an offender in other word at the point of conviction but in addition the ministry of justice record the number   in custody await trial who be fno and that stand at approximately on drive the figure down the home office be work to increase take up of conditional caution which lead to fno be expel from the uk in place of prosecution in appropriate case 
 the vagrancy act be year old this year yes it be supposedly repeal in but it remain in force the criminal justice bill unamended represent a genuine danger to rough sleeper everywhere when will conservative member stop this madness and when will we see that year old piece of legislation take off the book 
 i think the hon lady for her question the criminal justice bill deal with repeal provision for the vagrancy act and we be bring the bill back on report with more on rough sleeping 
 i welcome the fact that nightingale courtroom have be set up around the country to boost capacity but none of they appear to be in the east of england i know we be all well behave in the east but have we be forget 
 i can reassure my hon friend that we would not dream of forget about he we have see an increase particularly on special educational need and disability of over in receipt and with the increase number of judge and panel member we be see a increase in disposal this year we be try to address the issue of send with the department for education and if my hon friend think there be a problem in this area i be more than happy to meet he to discuss it 
 i have hear the minister defend the reintroduction of employment tribunal fee but the last time the government bring they in there be a drop in application how many people will be deny access to justice this time 
 the hon gentleman be compare apple with orange the fee be completely different in term of quantum a £ claim issue fee be a small contribution towards the tribunal which cost we £ a year to run i do not think that that be unreasonable 
 this week we celebrate the anniversary of my civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act complete its parliamentary stage but it be also the anniversary of the government take no action to enforce clause which give coroner the power to investigate stillbirth there have be some progress on   december after week they have produce the result of that consultation but there have be no government response when will we have a government response and what be the government ’s problem with get on with something that be overwhelmingly support 
 i appreciate that my hon friend be increasingly agitated about the implementation of aspect of the bill however the consultation be not conclusive and the stillbirth landscape have change those issue have to be address if the bill be to be introduce correctly 
 accord to a report produce by the national audit office last week housing legal aid be out of reach for many people who be struggle to keep a roof over their head countless people face the threat of eviction and repossession have recently contact i for help with the cost of live crisis and rise interest rate it be crucial that people can access legal help with their housing issue what be the minister do to ensure that housing legal aid be available to those who can not afford legal help 
 we be invest an initial £ to make sure that legal aid be available for exactly those problem 
 under the homelessness reduction act there be a solemn duty on prison governor to prepare ex offender for life outside prison year on from the introduction of that duty they be still not do what they be require to do we want reoffende end and if people be prepare properly for when they leave prison we increase the chance of prevent reoffende what action be my right hon and learn friend take   on this 
 my hon friend have do spectacular work on this issue his majesty ’s prison and probation service publish a policy framework set out the step prison and probation service must take to meet their duty to refer those at risk of homelessness i be read it this morning and it contain template referral form and many other aid that be to be fill out at prescribe point in the prisoner journey governor be now hold to account as my hon friend rightly indicate for their record on prepare prisoner for life post release which be why i be able to say that in some of prisoner be accommodate on the night of release that be up from in 
 i know that question be on the order paper to be take before topical but if the justice secretary could shorten his answer to make sure everyone have time in topical that would help i and other 
 last week i visit ida independent domestic abuse services which be an outstanding organisation support survivor of domestic and sexual violence they highlight that parent fear of have their child remove be prevent victim from present a case in full and be prevent justice how will the minister ensure that power imbalance in the family court be address 
 i be grateful for the hon lady ’s question she will know how much we be do on victim support particularly in term of sexual and domestic abuse i would like to speak to she about this issue and about   parental responsibility in the family court so i think we should have a meeting i ask she to write to my office after question to arrange it 
 last week colin pitchfork the double child rapist and murderer successfully apply for a reconsideration of the parole board ’s decision not to release he on the ground that the decision be irrational i have issue a survey across my south leicestershire constituency on parole board reform will the secretary of state meet i urgently to discuss the parole board rule as amend in 
 i certainly will meet my hon friend he have be assiduous for many year in raise this matter on behalf of his constituent the parole board do an exceptionally good job there be case in which decision appear to have be overturn because they be irrational and that be why i be meet the parole board tomorrow 
 the justice secretary mention the duty of candour that he impose on the police have he consider legislate to introduce the same for all public body 
 i can say that we want to extend that duty to healthcare setting because we do not want health professional closing rank when something go wrong it be important to say that since hillsborough there have be so many change include through the inquiries act which mean that there can be criminal liability for those who do not do what the hon gentleman and i must think be a matter of common sense which be to tell the truth 
 wedding expert at hitched say that independent celebrant be the big trend for couple get marry this year and with the church registrar and humanist all provide additional option it be about time that we update the marriage law which be from will the government publish a substantive response to the law commission ’s report on wedding reform 
 as someone who benefit from the last wedding reform on equal marriage i can say that this government be entirely committed to ensure that we report as fast as possible on the law commission ’s review if my hon friend would like to meet my noble friend lord bellamy to discuss it far we can make that happen 
 the backlog of asylum and immigration tribunal case have soar from to in a month a result no doubt of the home office push through decision at the end of last year to clear its previous backlog what be the minister do to tackle this new backlog that they have create 
 we be increase fee for legal aid practitioner we have see a massive increase in case go through the system and that be why we be invest to make sure that legal representation be available 
 give that the exist prison in buckinghamshire can not recruit to fill staffing vacancy where do the ministry of justice   think it will magic up staff and prison officer for the mega prison that it now have plan permission for in my constituency 
 my hon friend be a champion of his constituent while we may disagree on this issue i know that he speak for a lot of his constituent and he do so vocally in this house we have highlight the increase of in the number of prison officer we be confident that we can staff all the new prison and that they be necessary to meet our obligation 
 what can i do to change the secretary of state ’s view on joint enterprise have he read lord finkelstein ’s recent and    very good article in the times please can the minister have an open mind and look at it again there be more than young man in prison on long sentence 
 joint enterprise be there to ensure that those who act as the burglary lookout those who provide the weapon in a murder and those who drive the getaway vehicle do not escape the consequence of their crime which shatter live it be already the case as in the case of jogee that the person must have help or encourage the commission of the offence and intend to do so if the labour party ’s position be that such people should escape culpability it should say so our advice on this side of the house be clear do not commit crime 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if he will make a statement on change to uk immigration rule and the security of the uk ’s border 
 the security of the uk border be a top priority for i the home secretary and the home office everything we do in this area be design to reduce risk to this country and its citizen border force perform check on of schedule passenger arrive in the uk and risk base intelligence lead check on general aviation it be deeply disturbing that information that have no basis in fact be leak by the independent chief inspector to a national newspaper before the home office have the chance to respond we be urgently investigate this breach of confidential information in full in the normal way 
 move to yesterday ’s change to the immigration rule since the launch of our ukraine scheme the uk have offer or extend sanctuary to more than ukrainians thank to the immense generosity of the british public i know that colleague across the house be grateful for all the work that have be go on in community to facilitate that support almost year on from the start of the conflict the uk government ’s commitment to the ukrainian cause remain undimmed it be right that we continue to adapt and develop our visa route to ensure that they keep pace with the rapidly shift situation in ukraine we must ensure that they remain as efficient and sustainable as possible while provide stability for those we have welcome to the uk and those who still need our sanctuary ukrainian national who may have previously be eligible to apply to come to the uk under the ukraine family scheme will remain eligible to apply for the homes for ukraine sponsorship scheme 
 separately the government remain wholeheartedly committed to reduce level of legal migration measure to curb immigration abuse and far reduce net migration be be implement range from salary increase for work and family visa to reform the shortage occupation list remove the right for overseas care worker to bring dependant and require care provider to be register with the care quality commission before hire overseas carer the rule change outline yesterday which relate to the care sector pave the way for those measure to take effect 
 it have be report today that hundred of high risk private flight have land in the uk without proper border security check have be do if the minister dispute the figure will he tell we the true one now be all the high risk private flight check or not 
 minister have be warn repeatedly about border security risk on private flight the prime minister may think it be just all his own mate but there be risk from organised crime money laundering drug and weapon smuggling trafficking and even terrorism there have be a drop in class a drug border   seizure there have be a drop in firearm seizure criminal gang be still organise dangerous boat crossing there have also be repeat failure in security check at western jet foil a drop in foreign national offender removal a drop in fail asylum seeker removal and new revelation of visa failure in the home office which issue visa to a care home that do not even exist 
 instead of get a grip what be the minister ’s response it be just to sack the border inspector and sit on his report as well as change the rule to stop ukrainian family member from come here what message of solidarity do that send to a country we be suppose to be support in the face of russian aggression 
 will the minister now publish all the outstanding inspector ’s report be it true that no inspector will be in place for the next month will he tell we the key border security fact have all high risk private flight be meet and check in the last year home office ministers promise i in this chamber that that would happen year ago if not will he tell we how many high risk flight maybe involve dangerous people and weapon have be allow into the country without proper border security check 
 the conservatives have break the asylum system bust the home office budget badly undermine britain ’s border security and put our country ’s security at risk will they ever get a grip 
 i be very disappointed with the right hon lady ’s response on the certainty provide by yesterday ’s announcement on ukraine just before the february recess we have a good debate involve colleague from across the house where there be call for certainty on the future of those visa scheme the government have come forward and provide that assurance about where we go from here 
 of course the of those visa do not expire until if we add on the month period that be an additional and a half year of certainty for individual from the here and now which i think be very welcome there will continue to be an in country and out of country approach we of course engage with our ukrainian friend and ally and will support they in any way we can we be ahead of the curve internationally in give that assurance the right hon lady should be on the front foot in welcome that because it be good positive news 
 we will publish the report by the independent chief inspector of border and immigration and our response to they that will happen soon on the right hon lady ’s question about the flight at london city airport and the information put in the public domain the home office categorically reject the claim by david neal mr neal ’s report on general aviation border check at london city airport be submit last week and undergo fact checking as be standard practice mr neal be make aware of a specific issue with the recording of datum at london city airport that mean that a large proportion of flight record as high risk should have be reclassify as low risk it be disappointing that he have choose to put mislead datum into the public domain 
 the home office ’s priority be to deliver a safe and secure border and we will never compromise on that when notify we clear of high risk general   aviation flight either remotely or in person in accordance with the ga guidance and we be commit to respond effectively use an intelligence lead approach as well as to work thoroughly with the wide law enforcement community 
 the right hon lady will appreciate that there be a report on this issue we will respond to the inspector ’s report and that response will have answer to the substantive point pose in it we will deal with it in entirely the proper way 
 it be rather ironic that the right hon lady talk about the opposition ’s stance on the security of our border because she quite happily vote against the nationality and borders act when we legislate to introduce electronic travel authorisation which be critical to the future of our border security and allow great automation for passenger they improve the passenger experience at the border while be robust on border security interruption she be chuntere away but she vote against those important measure 
 when it come to dangerous foreign criminal on our street we hear those on the opposition benches oppose removal flight the leader of the opposition and other have take that stance they would allow dangerous criminal and dangerous individual to be on the street of the united kingdom 
 this government have a credible plan to stop the small boat crossing of the channel and the risk that they present to our security as well as the wide criminality again the right hon lady have oppose all those step we have a plan and we be work through it that be the position and it be clear for all to see 
 either i misheard or the suggestion by the opposition that the measure the minister have introduce will prevent ukrainian family member from come to britain be deeply untrue and highly irresponsible be n’t it 
 my right hon friend summarise the situation neatly there will continue to be an in country opportunity for people to apply to extend their visa through the homes for ukraine scheme ukrainians will still be able to come to the uk to access the sanctuary that we proudly support we have see community across the country do an enormous amount of positive welcome work to support that national effort any suggestion that that will not be the case move forward be wrong it be deliberate scaremongering and people should stop it 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 there be a bitter irony in the uk government make change to health and social care visa a sector that be cry out for people that will make it more difficult for people to come and look after our love one they say come and look after our love one but you can not bring your own how utterly heartless the sector be dominate by woman who be more likely to have child with they what equality impact assessment have the minister carry out on these very poor plan what advice be he take from the migration advisory committee this be a crisis of the government ’s make the committee encourage the government to pay people in the health and social care sector more and commend scotland   which have less reliance on people come in because we have a workforce strategy and we pay care worker the real living wage will he do the same 
 saturday february   mark year since the escalation of russian aggression in ukraine year long than any of we would have want we be appalled that this week the uk government have make it more difficult for ukrainians to seek sanctuary here by close the ukraine family scheme with immediate effect at pm yesterday with absolutely no notice the minister talk of an month extension but for new application that have be reduce from year those who hold visa now can not sponsor so the wife who want to bring injured husband to live here presumably can no long do so how can he say that be fair how can this government say slava ukraini while close the door to those in need 
 to deal with the latter point that be not the case there continue to be a route for ukrainians to come to the united kingdom it be arguably a more effective route to facilitate sanctuary for people with all the enhance check and support that come with the homes for ukraine route there be the ability for people who be here in the uk to sustain and extend their sanctuary the hon lady should welcome that she be involve in the westminster hall debate before the recess as be i. i be proud of the government ’s work to support community to facilitate that sanctuary we will continue to be front footed and forward lean when it come to do so because it be morally critical that we be at the forefront and be give people that certainty way ahead of our international ally again she should welcome that 
 when it come to care worker as i have say on many occasion the current situation for dependant be disproportionate we see dependant come with care worker that be not sustainable in the long term that be why we be take forward these measure the hon lady mention specifically the migration advisory committee which have consistently say that migration be not the answer to workforce shortage in the social care sector that be why the government have invest £ to support the strategy for social care workforce development and to boost capacity in social care include through retention of the dedicated workforce already undertake these vital role 
 as a former minister for disabled people at the department for work and pensions i can also say that i firmly back the work the government be do to support more people domestically into work through the comprehensive back to work plan the hon lady should support those effort we be put real resourcing behind that that should be our port of call 
 i welcome the news that the ukrainian visa scheme have be extend by month that be very generous could the minister confirm that while there be a war in ukraine and while it be unsafe for these family to return they will have a home in this country 
 i know that my hon friend care deeply about provide that sanctuary for our ukrainian friend as do i colleague across government and i would argue members across this house we be all   incredibly move by what we have see in our community with people rally behind those ukrainians to support they and to provide that warm welcome we will continue to sustain that effort which we do in partnership with the ukrainian government we regularly discuss these matter with they of course we will continue to sustain that sanctuary for the duration of this invasion we be firmly on the side of the ukrainians in win this war 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 accountability and oversight be critical to the effective management of uk border security the home affairs committee have repeatedly question the government about the delay in the home office publish the chief inspector ’s report i understand there be now report outstanding we be also concerned as the chief inspector be the statutory body and there be no deputy or provision for the institution to exist without the chief inspector in post with david neal leave at the end of march will the minister update the house on what have happen to the recruitment process that end in december when will the home affairs committee get the pre appointment hearing that we be entitle to have for the new chief inspector 
 i think the chairman of the committee will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for i to comment on appointment relate matter but we will follow the proper process in appoint a chief inspector of border and immigration the shadow home secretary also ask about the laying before parliament of the government ’s response to the report as i say in response to that question it will happen soon 
 people who want to work in our care sector from other country be welcome to do so where it be appropriate however under the current model many people be pay thousand of pound to agent to contact care home owner in this country who even if there be no vacancy will allow people to come here and send they off to work in supermarket or other area the pay then go back to the agent the individual do not even get the pay will the minister take measure to combat what be clearly a criminal conspiracy and prevent it from happen people who want to come and work here be be exploit ruthlessly 
 where we see abuse of our migration route we will root that out and deal with it robustly that be of the reason the care quality commission accreditation angle have be such an important part of the package of measure we be take forward ensure that the role people come here to fulfil be credible real job in these workplace we think it be right that there be a well audit trail for those appointment not least for the very reason my hon friend highlight to minimise the risk of people be exploit cheat and sell a fake prospectus for what they be sign up to that can not be right it be right that we as a government take a robust posture over it 
 tapadh leibh mr speaker and thank you for take this urgent question as you know i table something similar after the bbc and the guardian report that the family unification route for ukrainian family have be unexpectedly close i warn the government against such mean mindedness the uk government be the mean minded in europe at the outbreak of the ukrainian war which cause a lot of work for civil servant for the government themselves and for mp all unnecessarily most importantly it cause angst for family in na h eileanan an iar and elsewhere and concern and worry for those who want to come to the island and elsewhere why i would ask they to think again can the minister confirm exactly what he have do i have a feeling he be be economical with clarity here be the bbc and the guardian wrong in what they have report 
 the position very clearly be that we have arguably be the most generous with the approach we have adopt to provide sanctuary to our ukrainian friend there will continue to be an out of country route through the homes for ukraine scheme to enable people to come here as well as the visa extension as i say we be get on the front foot early than other in provide certainty and in term of the length of those visa those be measure to be welcome not traduce 
 there be a certain irony about opposition members go on about border security when a lot of they try to prevent a load of convict criminal from be deport i welcome the income threshold go up for get visa and the change for social care worker too i have be very concerned that other country have produce evidence about how that route be abuse and it be right that we clamp down on dependant come here on the welcome change to net legal migration will the minister provide the evidence and datum soon to show the public that it be finally head in the right direction and that they be be hear i be incredibly concerned that if mainstream party such as ourselves do not get it and show the public that we get it on migration it will fuel the extreme 
 my hon friend speak with real passion and i know that people in ipswich feel very strongly about this issue that be why as a government we have a credible plan to bring the number down we believe the inflow will be reduce by take into account the change we be deliver relative to the year prior on his request on what we can do to report around that and provide information about the progress we be make that be something i be consider 
 so when do the minister expect the next independent chief inspector of border and immigration to take up the post 
 we will follow the proper process to make an appointment 
 it be obviously right that we help those in ukraine who urgently need our help but most people in stoke on trent   and wide north staffordshire think that the net migration figure have be unacceptably high and that that have put significant pressure on our local service do my hon friend the minister agree with i that it be right that those who come here and use service but have not contribute to their cost should face high visa and nationality fee 
 my hon friend be right to touch on the general feeling in stoke on trent about the net migration situation that be why we be take action the government feel that the border and migration system cost we charge people to access those service should reflect the cost we incur it should not fall to the uk taxpayer to pick up those cost it should be the individual who avail themselves of those service who cover their cost we continue to work towards that in great detail 
 aviation have be consistently flag as a danger to national security do the minister agree that the failure to check those arrive in the uk that way be put the united kingdom at risk 
 i refer the hon lady to what i say in relation to the shadow home secretary ’s early contribution and the question she ask on that issue we treat that subject with utmost seriousness we will of course respond to the icibi report in a proper and thorough way have consider the point it raise and ensure that proper fact checking be carry out for the reason i have touch on 
 if the purpose of yesterday ’s announcement be to provide some reassurance to ukrainian citizen who have seek refuge in the uk why be the government force they to go through yet another application every member of this house will have experience the problem support the initial application there will be delay different family member will get confirmation at different time and child will be drop off by mistake cause great distress my question to the minister be this should ukvi not be focus on its exist backlog rather than add unnecessary process to its workload and distress ukrainian family who be now our constituent and live in the united kingdom 
 i disagree with the hon and learn lady we think this be an appropriate approach to extend the visa it be right and proper that there be a proper process around that and there be obviously reason why visa be handle in this particular way safeguard concern come into all these matter include extension and that be why we will take the approach we take i want it to be as light touch as possible i want it to be as easy as possible all parliamentarian in this house should be provide reassurance today that the ukrainian people in our country access sanctuary will continue to be able to do so i would argue that that be the responsibility of all of we as leader in our country 
 a lot of people in this country include my constituent will be amazed that in the week of navalny ’s murder by putin and the tough time that the ukrainians be   face against russian reinforcement the government have announce restriction on ukrainian family come here i have campaign for a long time because so many wealthy russian plutocrat have be fly into this country on small private aircraft and helicopter for a long time i have ask question about that perhaps we should ask boris johnson ’s friend in the other place lord lebedev of hampton and siberia what he know about it 
 the fact be that we be provide the certainty that member across the house have be seek for the future of the ukraine scheme i do not think the hon gentleman be in the debate we have prior to the february recess i would argue that the house speak with voice say that we need to afford sanctuary for long recognise that the war remain ongoing but that the ukrainian people continue to have our firm backing in their fight against russian aggression that be precisely what we have do through this announcement i reject his characterisation of the situation the message need to go out that ukrainians who be here will continue to be able to have that sanctuary in the year ahead 
 family in all our constituency include east renfrewshire rely on the skill and compassion of those who work in the care sector the chief executive of scottish care donald macaskill yesterday describe the government ’s plan to ban overseas care worker from bring dependant as shameful and damaging say 
 treat international colleague in this manner be contemptible 
 he be right be n’t he 
 there will continue to be an opportunity for international recruitment for care purpose but we can not have a situation where dependant come with visa holder that be not justifiable that be not acceptable that be why we be take the approach we be take there will in future need to be a blend of approach to recruitment i also happen to think it be right that we should strain every sinew to support people in this country to take on these role with the proper skill and that be precisely what the back to work plan do 
 close the ukrainian family scheme almost year to the day since putin ’s illegal war begin be particularly cruel the government speak of a rationalisation of the scheme but what we really need be further measure to support family reunification give the change what reassurance can the government give to those on these scheme that they will be able to bring family member to the uk 
 we always keep under review the offer we have as part of the ukraine scheme and that will continue to be the case but i reiterate the point that what we have do through this package of change in its entirety be to sustain an out of country route to enable ukrainians to come to the uk to seek sanctuary while give certainty ahead of many other country include european union country with which the hon lady have an affinity we have get ahead of the curve and provide certainty around sanctuary in a way that i think people in this country want to see 
 the change the government keep make to the ukrainian scheme have unfortunately result in far too many ukrainians become homeless when will the minister finally as pledge by his predecessor meet glasgow members of parliament to discuss how home office policy be make refugee homeless in the city of glasgow 
 in fact the announcement have provide real certainty about the future of the ukraine scheme at an early stage and we be ahead of the curve internationally the hon gentleman know i well and we have always have a constructive work relationship i be very willing to meet he to discuss the issue of asylum accommodation and support for refugee in glasgow and i know that my colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities who lead on the accommodation side of the ukraine scheme would also be happy to engage with he 
 i thank the minister for all his helpful answer in the context of the open border may i ask what step have be take to ensure that northern ireland do not become the back door to the rest of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise that point as he have recognise we must ensure that our approach to border security be adopt properly throughout the united kingdom i be pleased to be able to have a constructive meeting about the future of the ukraine scheme with the new deputy minister of northern ireland last week as part of the conversation that be take place with the devolved government i tell she that i would be very willing to meet she again and i be delighted to see she in her place and take on those responsibility i be sure that these be matter that she will want to discuss 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker you will be aware that the northern ireland assembly be restore week ago during the period when it be not sit member of the legislative assembly be not fulfil the full range of their function and the secretary of state reduce their salary 
 i write to the leader of the house last week about a matter of which you may well also be aware madam deputy speaker the matter of the abstentionist sinn féin mps who have not fulfil the full range of their own function but have receive million of pound in representative money over not but year while they receive no salary from the house the money that they do receive be allocate on the same basis as short money namely to assist opposition party with such process as scrutiny and preparation for debate in none of which sinn féin participate i just wish to ascertain madam deputy speaker whether the leader of the house have receive my letter have as yet indicate her intention of table a motion allow we to discuss this matter 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and for give i notice of it i have have no indication that the government intend to table a motion on this matter and i believe that mr speaker have have no such indication either however the hon gentleman will have an opportunity to ask the leader of the house a question on thursday when she have announce the forthcoming business i hope that that be helpful i think that that be the direction in which he should go 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker this be not something that have happen in the last while as we have just hear from my hon friend   the member for east londonderry mr campbell it have be go on for a number of year representation have be make to the government and to the minister responsible on numerous occasion so it be disappointing that my hon friend have have to bring the matter up yet again today be it not time for the minister to come to the house make a statement and get this matter sort out 
 i do not think there be much that i can add to what i say early but i be confident that those on the treasury bench and the whip have hear what both hon gentleman have to say and i be sure that they will be report back i urge the hon gentleman to take the matter up on thursday when the leader of the house will be here 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to expand the list of sporting event that must be make available for broadcast by free to air television channel to include all qualifying match play by the scotland man ’s and woman ’s national football team in the world cup and the uefa european football championship and for connected purpose 
 like many people throughout the united kingdom i look forward to watch the european football final in june not just scotland but england and hopefully wales too will be there if they win their qualifi i be fortunate enough to attend the scotland game when the competition be hold in england in as well as go to france for the world cup in scotland be my team they represent our nation and steve clarke and his lad have do we proud we can dream of win the competition but in reality i shall be happy with our qualifying from the group we have falter and fail to do that before sometimes through bad luck although at other time it have be self inflict but in andy robertson john mcginn scott mctominay and other we have a squad who be skilled and determined as well as a canny manager 
 the tartan army who be go to germany will enjoy the spectacle while other include i will simply watch the game on television that after all be how most people watch their national team go to the game be either too difficult or too expensive or else there be simply insufficient capacity for all to attend so it be at home on their tv screen that most people follow their team for quite some time however that have not be the case for scotland fan in the qualifying match for this tournament or the qualifying match for international competition which be why this bill be necessary like the world cup final the euro final be available on free to view channel that be specify by law but scotland qualifying match be not protect they have be available only through viaplay a swedish medium company and at a cost of £ per annum in these tough financial time that be a cost that many can not afford no matter how much they would like to watch the game it be a poll tax on scots watch their national team 
 the qualifying game a number of which be enthral with win at home against spain and away against norway be not available to view for many people other than those fortunate enough to be able to go to the match itself or able to pay for viaplay that be as unfair and unjust as a refereeing error or var review which punish your team it have mean that scot fan have miss out on the well earn success of their team even bad when these euro final be past and the qualifier for the world cup in north america begin scot will again be deprive of the opportunity to watch their team on free to air tv the game go on as another competition beckon but many scot be exclude from watch their team ’s journey and that be neither right nor fair it be not the norm in europe where only country include scotland and northern ireland   be in this situation nor be it the case in england where qualifying game have be free to air on itv or channel since even in wales where right to the national team ’s qualifying fixture be also sell to viaplay in access be available free to air on s4c. 
 the charging for view extend from the major competition even to friendly fixture while they may lack the same bite as the competitive game many wish to see their hero perform or new star be give an opportunity but the friendly fixture arrange for scotland ’s warm up for germany be all to be behind a pay wall on viaplay so even these non competitive fixture will be deny to many scottish fan meanwhile england ’s warm up will be broadcast free to view on channel 
 the anomaly between scotland and england international match extend beyond the man ’s international team for the woman ’s game itv have the right to the english national team have recently take over from the bbc scotland game be show on bbc alba a channel i know and enjoy but which although free to view have neither the reach nor the resource of the big channel indeed i have see scottish and english fixture go head to head on the bbc and bbc alba why be there pan uk coverage of the england game but restrict access to the scottish similarly the bbc hold the right to england under-21 international while scotland ’s be leave to the scottish football association website which show that it be not just in respect of the man ’s team but across gender and age that scot be be deprive of the right to watch their national team those fixture also matter to fan 
 the scottish football press be once describe as fan with typewriter now it seem to be the uk broadcaster who be fan with tv station but while the scottish press support the scottish team the uk broadcaster only seem to support england uk broadcaster be reveal themselves not as uk television outlet but as team england only that be happen whether we be talk about the state fund bbc publicly own channel or the commercial itv or stv channel that have broadcast obligation beyond the border 
 some may blame the scottish football association which sell the right to viaplay let i say at the outset that i do not hold the sfa responsible culpability rest with broadcaster who have not just right but duty and who be fail scotland the sfa have a duty to the game in scotland that responsibility run from the grassroot and football simply be a game to be enjoy by youngster through develop pathway for people to continue play at whatever age or standard and on to those enter into the professional rank and ultimately the pinnacle of the national team the sfa be also require to nurture and develop not just the man ’s game but the grow woman ’s game and football among people of different age and capacity the man ’s and woman ’s international team be the pinnacle but the sfa ’s remit cover all 
 all that come at a cost however and the sfa be require to fund it money be tight for association as it be for individual broadcast money that apply in nation such as ireland when premier league game south of the border be show be deny to scotland the reason be that the uk be class as broadcasting   entity and international football divergence be of no relevance hence a cash strap sfa need to maximise income and the right to show the national team fixture be its major asset viaplay offer more it be something the sfa be require to do to promote the game from grassroot to international team 
 what about broadcaster why can the bbc channel and itv all have budget to pay for england game but not for scottish one it be not that the sfa be seek more than the fa quite the opposite the view right fee for scotland match be significantly low than for england match just as transfer fee in the scottish premier leagues be low than those in the english premier league but while uk broadcaster be prepared to pay top dollar to show england game they be not prepared to fund a bawbee for a scotland game indeed that be state by simon pitts of stv when he give evidence to the scottish affairs committee he say that there be 
 very little prospect of a large commercial return uk wide which in turn determine the level of bid 
 scot tv licence fee do not therefore matter and obligation to scots viewer count for little the licence fee pay by scot and the right give in scotland to uk broadcaster be not be match by coverage
