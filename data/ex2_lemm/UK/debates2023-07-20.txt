 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether she plan to support the uptake of outdoor swimming 
 outdoor swimming represent of the many way to stay active through the together fund sport england have provide over £ for outdoor swimming project swimming and water safety form a mandatory part of the primary pe national curriculum 
 the beccles lido do great work in promote outdoor swimming in the waveney area but it and other lido have be particularly hard hit by high energy cost and long term fix price contract often arrange by rogue energy broker the swimming pool fund be extremely welcome but i urge my right hon friend to work with lido to put in place a long term plan for their future 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the importance of swimming pool and lido we announce the swimming pool fund to help those that have be particularly struggle with high energy cost sport england also play a vital role in work with local authority on manage sustainable facility and we will shortly publish our new sport strategy which will set continued commitment in this area 
 let we go to the wild swimmer of strangford lough jim shannon laughter 
 wild swimming conjure up all sort of thing in my mind probably more emphasis on the wild 
 i thank   the hon member for waveney peter aldous   for the question and the minister for his response grow up in ballywalter in the 60 also the age i be right now there be no swimming pool and we always use the sea it be important that water have the quality and cleanliness to allow people to swim so have the minister speak to any of the council or authority in northern ireland to ensure that our water include strangford lough and the sea off ballywalter be of a standard that enable people to swim without any fear 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to highlight the importance of the quality of outdoor water and a lot of work be do to educate child in water safety i have not have the chance to speak to anybody in northern ireland yet but i understand that i may well be go there during the recess so i will take the opportunity to do just that 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the regulation of charity 
 the charity commission perform an important and effective function as the independent registrar and regulator of charity in england and wales the commission ’s annual report and account for provide a detailed analysis of the its performance and effectiveness charity law and regulation be of course devolve in both scotland and northern ireland 
 my question be about arts council england which be of course a registered charity a senior employee there recently win a tribunal claim for harassment on account of her gender critical belief in the course of the hearing it become evident that there be considerable homophobic bias among some staff at arts council england who do not wish the arts council to give grant to project initiate by lgb group unless those group accept gender identity ideology there be evidence that an lgb charity have be describe by arts council employee as a cancer and neo nazi what be the minister do to tackle the climate of prejudice and bias that have be expose at arts council england a charity that dispense over £ of public money per annum 
 i hope the hon and learn lady know that i take all form of discrimination extremely seriously and there should be no place for that she raise an individual case the arts council do not come under my portfolio but i will happily speak to my ministerial colleague about that and ensure that we write to she with an answer 
 i call the father of the house 
 my question be about the regulation of charity follow on from the question ask by   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry do my right hon friend the minister read private eye if he do he will have see the saga of the actors benevolent fund where it appear that the people who do right have be put out and the people who do wrong over and over again have be support by the charity commission could he say to the charity commission that people in parliament be watch this with some surprise 
 of course the charity commission be an independent body but i have regular meeting with it i be not a regular reader of private eye but i will make sure that i seek out that article ahead of my next meeting with the charity commission 
 what assessment she have make of the potential effect of the uk ’s departure from the eu on the uk art and culture sector 
 the uk art and culture sector have many strong exist positive relationship in europe and we be take a number of step to deepen tie the government have develop bilateral agreement with european country and the british council offer further sector specific support include the recently announce spotlight on culture between the uk and france 
 the uk trade and business commission find that the scottish art and film industry have lose € in eu funding as a consequence of brexit so will the minister ’s government make up for that shortfall and the calamity that brexit have impose on the sector 
 while the uk decide not to participate in creative europe nevertheless the uk share prosperity fund which be a uk wide funding initiative have match fund what be originally available from the eu and also give local authority and indeed nation control over how that money be spend 
 whether she have have discussion with the bbc board on its complaint procedure 
 the secretary of state and i meet with the bbc ’s leadership regularly to discuss a range of issue the bbc ’s process for handle audience complaint about its editorial content be an area of focus of the mid term review and as require by the term of reference the dcms have be consult the bbc on the review ’s finding we be seek to conclude the review at pace and to report on its finding by 
 i look forward to the conclusion of the review the minister will know my view the complaint process within the bbc be utterly inadequate and i think   he agree with i on that there be no genuine independence in that process and therefore there be a lack of confidence in how that process be work i hope he will factor those view into make sure that the outcome of the review take on board the need to have a genuinely independent complaint mechanism so that the public can have confidence in the broadcast 
 we be aware that research from ofcom bear out what the hon gentleman have say in that there be considerable dissatisfaction with the exist complaint procedure that be something about which the bbc be also aware and we be keen to address it in the mid term review so far we be make good progress in reach agreement with the bbc on how it can be strengthen in the future 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 over the last day we have see the bbc embroil in a lengthy bout of self analysis over accusation make about huw edwards for day the story lead every bulletin and i refuse all request for comment i feel i do not know enough detail i be glad i take that stance the bbc have announce an investigation but the police have now say there be no criminality as originally claim by the sun what do the secretary of state think the lesson might be perhaps politician should exercise more caution before issue condemnation about develop story maybe we should remember to treat any story in the sun with extreme caution give this further example of intrusive prurience we could all remind ourselves of why there be once widespread agreement about have an independent press regulator with tooth something the conservatives once support before get frighten off by powerful press baron 
 i say to the hon gentleman that this be a matter for the bbc although the secretary of state and i do ask to be keep inform by the bbc it be a matter for the organisation itself and as he have suggest it have establish an internal inquiry to find out whether there be any lesson to be learn with regard to the sun it be of course a member of the independent press standards organisation which have a code and if there have be breach of the code then that be a matter for ipso to adjudicate on 
 what recent discussion she have have with the bbc board on change to local radio service 
 we recognise the strength of feeling about the importance of bbc local service and we remain disappointed that the bbc be plan to reduce part of its local radio output this be a matter for the bbc but ministers have raise our concern about the bbc ’s plan previously and we will discuss this issue with the interim chair and the director general at the next opportunity 
 i think that we all think that digital technology be mean to expand choice however in recent time we have see post office bank and rail ticket office closure and the bbc be use the same argument to justify the manage decline of local radio i see today that we have be tell by the bbc that it want to reach of the population with its tv radio and online service after its digital plan be carry out but i have see in the annual report that it say that it be already at so why be it use that as a justification for the vandalism of local radio 
 the bbc obviously need to take account of the fact that more and more people be access content online and digitally and therefore it have decide to invest more in that area however it be that be already well provide for particularly in the area of local news it be important that the bbc do not lose sight of the fact that there be still a significant number of people who rely on traditional broadcasting and value local radio as i have make clear the government be disappoint by the bbc ’s decision to reduce local radio output 
 i call the chair of the culture media and sport committee 
 as you know mr speaker local radio be such a lifeline to many of the elderly vulnerable and isolated people in our community i wonder whether the minister have a view on what the word public service in the bbc ’s public service remit actually mean should that not include reach everyone with local news and information not just those who be digitally enable 
 as i say early many people still value local radio and will regret and indeed be very concerned about the reduction in local radio output that the bbc have propose particularly in the evening and at weekend i have no doubt that my hon friend will take advantage of the opportunity that she have through chair the extremely important committee oversee the bbc to raise that matter with the director general again as indeed will we 
 i would say that the bbc be very good at show empty chair but there will now be empty studio if we be not careful and we certainly do not want to see the end of radio lancashire 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the report of the independent commission for equity in cricket entitle hold up a mirror to cricket publish in june 
 discrimination have no place in sport or wide society the icec report make for difficult reading clearly the sport need to reflect carefully on the report ’s concern finding and consider how good to deliver clear and sustain cultural change across cricket the government will review the finding of the report and we welcome the england   and wales cricket board ’s commitment to bring forward a plan to tackle these serious issue which must be address in full 
 after the exposés of whistleblower such as azeem rafiq the hold up a mirror to cricket report lay bare the extent of racism sexism and classism in cricket over the past couple of year we have see scandal in cricket abuse in gymnastic a whole plethora of issue unearth by the fan lead review into football and the sport of rugby union undertake a review into its governance and i fear that sadly there will be further such example just how confident be the minister that structure be in place to deal with inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour in sport and do he now feel that there be a need to look into governance in sport more widely 
 i have make that issue a priority in the time that i have be in this role because it do need address i hold regular meeting with the national governing body of all the sport and i have lay down challenge to they we need to work together though that be why this will form an important part of the new sport strategy i know that it have take some time but i have be really clear that i want that issue to be include in it and to be a central plank of the work that we do when we publish it 
 in my constituency we have fantastic grassroot cricket club promote inclusivity in the sport during their cricket week that include club such as sidcup and national club champion bexley cricket club will my right hon friend join i in thank the club for the work that they do to promote cricket in our community especially to woman and girl and bexley cricket club for its effort to raise fund to address cardiac risk in the young 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that not everything be bad let we recognise some of the amazing work particularly of volunteer who do so much for grassroots sport he highlight a club in his constituency it be not just about encourage more people to take part in sport club also do tremendous work in the community as he have just highlight with the fundraising that that club have do 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i wish you a restful recess mr speaker i put on the record my hope that the lionesses do very well in the forthcoming world cup congratulation to the woman ’s english cricket team on a strong performance and good luck to the man ’s cricket team in try to pull off a great ashes comeback i just hope that the manchester rain hold off 
 despite the team success on the international stage the icec report show that there be a lot to do to increase diversity and participation in cricket it find that english cricket suffer from sexism elitism and racism do the government understand that they also have a role to play in address those serious finding for example what discussion have the minister have with the department for education about increase   the take up of cricket in state school and ensure well access to pitch equipment and coaching also do he agree i be sure he do that it be about time that the woman ’s team have as much access to lord ’s cricket ground as eton and harrow 
 i join the hon lady in wish the man and woman ’s england cricket team all the very good and thank they for what they have do so far as well as the lionesses i be very fortunate that i will be off to australia on monday to wave the flag in support of they interruption it be a very difficult job but someone have to do it 
 on the serious point that the hon lady raise she be absolutely right on the day of the publication of the report my right hon friend the secretary of state meet with the england and wales cricket board we have say that we will be follow the development of its plan very carefully the hon lady be right that we need to see more access to facility for woman and girl not just at lord ’s but right across the country 
 what assessment she have make of the effect of increase in the cost of live on the charity sector 
 the government understand that cost of living pressure be impact many in the charity sector which be face increase demand reduce income and high running cost that be why the government announce a funding package of just over £ for community organisation in england 
 as the snp spokesperson i be more than happy to swallow my principle and join the minister on that flight to australia on monday 
 accord to the charities aid foundation more than a of charity have have to make cut to their service due to the harm that the tory cost of living crisis have work on their finance in scottish charity be worried about struggle to survive only this government have the financial power to intervene yet they refuse to do so be the government content to let charity which all too often ameliorate the failure of the state fail too 
 i simply do not recognise that situation i have just announce that we have give £ and some of it be barnette i have not hear anything from the scottish government about what they be go to do for scottish charity maybe they should follow our example 
 the plight of so many charity would be significantly improve if the secretary of state be to raise the cap on postcode lottery sale would it not 
 i know that my hon friend have be campaign hard on this issue and we have a westminster hall debate on it very recently i have commit to   look at some of the structure but we need to see more evidence that the limit already there be not be reach at the moment i will certainly keep the matter under review 
 what step she be take to support skill and training in the creative industry 
 the creative industry sector vision set out how we will support individual to get the skill they need to work in the industry from school to t level and from apprenticeship to returner our ambition be to support more job in the creative industry by yesterday i co chair a roundtable with the education secretary to improve flexi job apprenticeship in the sector last week the cultural education plan ’s expert advisory panel meet for the time and procurement for creative skill bootcamp be now live 
 i commend my right hon friend on the recent creative industry sector vision which will help to build a pipeline of talent that will underpin the creative industry do she agree that it be vital that we invest in build the skill throughout the country recognise that many of the growth sector within the industry be outside london 
 that be right we know that creative business flourish in geographic cluster from game in leamington spa to fashion in leeds and we have already announce that we will invest a furth £ in at least new cluster create new centre of excellence that will act as magnet for inward investment and talent 
 last night be the summer reception of uk music and i be there as chair of the all party parliamentary group on music along with the shadow secretary of state and the chair of the culture media and sport select committee if ministers have be able to come they would have hear an appeal for more education in the creative sector in our school and for more support for our grassroot venue which be the research and development of the creative industry particularly the music industry and which be suffer from a crisis at the moment what more be the government go to do to support education at that level so that skill and training in our creative industry can enable they to keep flourish into the future 
 i hope the hon gentleman read the sector vision which include £ in additional funding for grassroots music venue something we discuss at the select committee we too think it be important to have those creative subject in school that be why art design and music be already in the national curriculum and remain compulsory in all maintain school up to the age of but that be not all we be do he mention music which be incredibly important that be why we have our new joint national plan for music education include £ of funding for musical instrument and equipment for school and as   i mention we have our meeting of the cultural education panel which be look at how we can ensure we help young people to get more creativity both in and outside school to ensure we have that creative excellence 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the creative industry be a powerhouse of the uk economy succeed despite the government ’s good effort to attack the institution that underpin they with the growth of the creative industry there be now a huge number of job vacancy yet it remain of the least diverse sector in the economy dominate by white middle class people even more so than banking law and medium under this government we have see a huge drop in creative subject be take at gcse will the secretary of state support labour ’s new policy to increase music drama and the art in school and transform our curriculum to meet the need of the future economy which desperately need creative skill rather than that be stick in the past 
 the shadow secretary of state will know that the prime minister have identify the creative industry as of the sector of growth that we be support as a government because they be really important she mention gcse but i do not think we should just have music and art at gcse we need they at t level we need apprenticeship and we need they in primary school she will know because i have talk about it incessantly that that be exactly what we be do and that be what be in our creative sector vision i will just point out because i be remind of it the other day that a labour secretary of state for education and employment david blunkett slimme down the statutory curriculum for creative education and tell headteacher to teach few creative subject at school 
 what progress her department have make on publish a sport strategy 
 the government have commit to deliver a refresh sport strategy that will set the long term strategic policy direction for sport the strategy will outline the government ’s future ambition and how we will support the sector to achieve they and we intend to publish it as soon as possible 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer with many more people get into sport there be also a temptation to get into image and performance enhance drug we have see an explosion in that with estimate of between half a and user and that be an underestimate from academic uk anti doping and organisation such as ukactive which i have meet with will the minister look at put a policy in the sport strategy to gather more datum on image and performance enhance drug in sport 
 i praise my hon friend for be a doughty campaigner on this important issue and thank he for that he have rightly raise this with i on a number of occasion the safety and wellbeing of everyone   take part in sport be hugely important that include look at image and performance enhance drug since i last meet he i have raise this with ukad we must bring about well collaboration across the department to ensure that we tackle this issue 
 what step she be take to tackle gambling relate harm 
 i know that the hon member have campaign on this issue for a number of year and i thank she for her ongoing engagement our white paper set out measure to tackle product and practice that can drive gambling relate harm and they include financial risk check stake limit on online slot and the new statutory levy 
 loot box in gaming be unquestionably a slippery path to normalising gambling this week ’s announcement on loot box nowhere near fulfil the commitment make in the conservative party manifesto with young people age to already class as problem gambler and ten of thousand more consider at risk why be the government neglect future generation by fail to tackle and prevent gambling disorder at its root 
 we have go a long way in the white paper to do exactly what the hon member say and we have commit to ensure that video game can be enjoy safely by everyone we convene a technical working group to improve protection on loot box and it have publish new guidance this week which we welcome if that guidance be implement it have the potential to meet our objective but i assure she that we will closely monitor what the industry do to ensure that it implement the guidance in full we will provide an update in month and keep the option of legislate open 
 we would be help in our fight against gambling relate harm if we have well datum on the number of people take their own life as a result of gambling debt there be a bill that have clear all its stage in the lords that would get coroner to record this information it would not cost the government a penny might my right hon friend lend his support across government to those responsible for that bill so that we have the datum to know what be happen and bear down on this terrible issue 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the tragic consequence for some people of the tough part of this role have be meet the family who have be affect in such a way i will look at the issue he raise but the new statutory levy enable we to have the funding to do detailed research which could contribute to that as well 
 i call the shadow minister 
 affordability check and stake limit for online gambling be of course welcome but give that the government have   already spend year review and consult on gambling law why do we need further consultation on what level they should be set at there should be no more unnecessary delay i ask the minister what exactly have the government be do all this time

 the government have make it clear that the licence fee will remain in place for the remainder of this charter period but my hon friend be right that there be challenge go forward he may be aware that the number of people pay the licence fee have fall by in the past year and it be therefore right that we look at possible alternative source of funding for the bbc in the long term that will be the focus of the funding review

 will the commission look closely at the fact that member of this house have television programme i be invite on to a television programme by member of this house and i do not accept that invitation there be surely something wrong with member in this house ask question at the same time as they be run very political campaign on television what will the hon gentleman do about that

 the hon member for midlothian represent the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission be ask 
 whether the committee have have recent discussion with the electoral commission on the transparency of political donation from overseas 
 the committee have not have a recent discussion with the commission on that issue the commission publish information about donation to ensure transparency and it have power to sanction political party that accept impermissible foreign donation it have highlight that the political finance system be vulnerable to unlawful influence from donation overseas and in the uk and it have recommend that party should be require to know not just who a donor be but where the money for the donation be come from it have also recommend that party have policy in place to manage the risk of receive money from unlawful source the commission have say that party should not be permit to accept donation from company that exceed their profit make in the uk 
 the executive director of spotlight on corruption susan hawley say that the tory uk government ’s abject failure to take decisive action on overseas donation be concern our ally she also say that election be at risk of interference from russia and other hostile state after the government oppose the move to require political party to verify and disclose the source of political donation what step be the commission take to prevent overseas donation from hostile state that undermine electoral law have the commission ask the security service to undertake a review of political finance 
 speak as a representative of the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission it would be a matter for the security service to make a full assessment of whether unlawful foreign money have be use to campaign in uk election however political party must report when they be give an unlawful donation and return it to the donor in addition the commission carry out check on permissibility on a sample of donation and have the power to sanction   political party that accept impermissible foreign donation the commission have say that it take all possible step within the current regulatory framework to prevent unlawful foreign money from enter uk politic and it publish information about donation to ensure transparency it have the power to sanction but it can not take enforcement action against organisation base outside the uk the commission will continue to recommend change to ensure that voter can have great confidence in political finance in the uk 
 the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask 
 what discussion the church of england have have with church in uganda follow the passage of the anti homosexuality act in that country 
 the archbishop of canterbury have write directly to archbishop kaziimba of uganda remind he of the commitment make by the anglican communion to treat every person with the care and respect they deserve as child of god and that the communion oppose the criminalisation of lgbt+ people the archbishop of canterbury have say that the act be a fundamental departure from the commitment to uphold the freedom and dignity of all people it be not in our resolution not in our teaching and not in the gospel of jesus we share together 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his response and for the concern share by the archbishop of canterbury what more can the church say to anglicans across the uk who do not in any way shape or form believe the death penalty for any crime be compatible with christian teaching and to those member of the lgbt community who be rightly horrify by event in uganda 
 i very much understand my hon friend ’s concern on this issue which be share by many other as i be sure he know each province of the anglican communion be autonomous in however the primate in the anglican communion reaffirm the rejection of criminal sanction against same sex attract people and commit to respect the dignity and value of every person it be hard to see how the position take by the church of uganda align with the agreement 
 if the church of england will make an assessment of the potential merit of refuse to ordain clergy who do not personally recognise the ordination of woman as diocesan bishop 
 the church of england be fully commit to all order of ministry be open equally to all without reference to gender the church be also commit to ensure that those who can not in good   conscience receive the ministry of woman priest or bishop be able to flourish the guide principle of the house of bishops be the basis for this mutual flourishing and all candidate for ordination have to assent to they 
 it be now year since we have the woman priest and year since the female bishop be appoint in our established church of england it therefore seem to i that there have be many year to adapt to treat woman as equal in the sight of god give that be it really appropriate for the church of england to continue appoint clergy as happen recently in blackburn who have not accept and who will never personally accept the ordination of woman 
 i can tell the right hon lady that a new body be establish last year to review how the guide principle be be understand implement and receive in the church and that it have a balanced membership of bishop clergy and laity who reflect all view on these matter 
 i call the father of the house 
 i speak as a supporter of watch the women and the church group the church commissioners should understand that either the church of england get rid of what ought to have be temporary exemption from the equality act or parliament will do that for it do my hon friend understand that other mp who be interested in full equality for woman would like to meet the church commissioners before we consider what other action we might take 
 i have very clearly hear what my hon friend the father of the house and indeed the very respected chair of the home affairs committee   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   have just say the church will have hear that as well and we be of course available for meeting at any time 
 what recent step the church of england have take to help protect freedom of religion and belief in other country 
 i be pleased to tell my hon friend who serve with distinction as the prime minister ’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief that the united nations security council have recently adopt a resolution to produce an annual report on freedom of religion and belief it be sponsor by the united kingdom and the united arab emirates and the resolution be base on the bishop of truro ’s review and incorporate many of his original recommendation 
 that be indeed a very positive development my hon friend will have see another report produce by former bbc reporter david campanale and other forb expert for the international religious freedom or belief alliance which i chair on the ongoing major violence in manipur india it indicate that since early   may alone hundred of church there have be destroy many burn to the ground more than people have be kill and over displace and school and seminary have be target in what look like systematic and premeditated attack with religion a key factor there have be very little report about this people there be call out for help what can the church do to draw more attention to their cry 
 my hon friend have do a great service by put this matter on the record in the house i be sure that she like i would like to see much great reporting of these issue by the bbc and other what she have tell we be truly shocking and i know that the archbishop of canterbury who visit india in to see the challenge at hand remain extremely concerned that such attack have be worsen and spread to other minority faith community so i will bring my hon friend ’s report on manipur directly to the archbishop ’s attention 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his response to   the hon member for congleton fiona bruce who do such fantastic work as the ambassador for not only the prime minister but all of we in the house 
 in february i visit pakistan with the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief far to what the hon gentleman say will he advise the house on what step the church of england be take to support the anglican ministry in pakistan and to defend the right of pakistani christians to practise their faith and express their belief without fear of repression 
 i talk early this week with dr sammy wainaina the archbishop ’s new adviser on anglican communion affair and he specifically mention pakistan so i be grateful that the hon gentleman have mention it he be right that the situation there be extremely challenging priest have be murder and the archbishop    visit quite recently i express particular gratitude to the hon member who have put these matter on the record this morning they be right to do so and i hope they continue to do so 
 to ask the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners what recent step the church of england have take to help support family relationship parenting and marriage 
 the archbishop ’s recent love matters commission on family issue make recommendation for the church of england and for the government they include support family hub develop high quality marriage preparation and build relational capability at all life stage and not just for couple who be prepare for marriage i will place a copy of that report and the previous one in the library 
 a strong and stable family unit undoubtedly provide the good environment in which to raise child what step be the church of england take to provide relationship support and guidance to those family who need it to help they to stay together 
 that be a really important question the children ’s commissioner have point out that almost a quarter of uk family be head by a lone parent that compare with an average of an of family in europe the bishop of durham who co chair the commission want to see every deanery in the church of england offer the very good marriage preparation to all couple and for the church to support their relationship at every life stage

 the provisional business for the week commence   september   include

 i thank the leader of the house for the forthcoming business but i be disappointed that piece of important house business seem to be miss there be no mention of when mps will get to debate and vote on the commission ’s proposal to introduce a new process for deal with mp accuse of violent or sexual offence the leader of the house be not able to answer i when i ask about the matter last week so i would be grateful if she could do so today she and i have work hard on this together as well as with you mr speaker the commissioner staff and the trade union we can not lose momentum i know the leader of the house agree with i that the propose new mechanism be need to reduce the risk of harm to all those who work on and visit the parliamentary estate so will she give we some clarity show all the people listen that we be make progress and tell we when the house will get the chance to vote on it 
 i be also concerned that the leader of the house have still not announce when the house will consider the standards committee ’s report on the conduct of   the right hon member for tamworth christopher pincher the finding of which be shocking colleague and staff have be ask when the house will get the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanction he have bring this house into disrepute and frankly should no long be a member of it will the leader of the house tell we whether she know if the member will be resign or if he have appeal the committee ’s sanction either way she could table the motion as a remain order even without a date attach when will she bring forward a motion so that the house can vote and move on 
 i wish all member members staff house staff and everyone who work on the parliamentary estate a very happy summer recess as we come to the end of term and head back to work in our own community it be worth reflect on what the government have achieve or not this year people i have be speak to up and down the country be simply feed up nothing work in this country any more and the tories have simply give up do anything about it i see on the order paper today that the leader of the house be due to announce the date of the next king ’s speech in a write ministerial statement perhaps i could press she to give we an early sighting of that now but the government have nowhere near finish with the last set of new law they say they be go to pass 
 the prime minister have be catch out overpromise and massively under delivering include on the renters reform bill which be initially promise year ago and so many member across the house say they want there be no transport bill no school bill and no mental health bill why do the leader of the house think that work people will believe that this government be go to make people ’s live well this time on top of all that price be still go up at staggering rate and family be bear the brunt of the tory cost of living crisis that be what the people of selby and ainsty uxbridge and south ruislip and somerton and frome will be think about when they head to the ballot box today feed up and want change 
 labour be the party of change we have a proper plan to grow our economy to bring down bills to secure the energy this country need and to tackle climate change people will have welcome the opportunity to vote labour today in constituency and send the tories a message but be it not time that we have a general election so the whole country get the chance to have their say

 turn to the issue raise by the shadow leader of the house regard the report on   the right hon member for tamworth christopher pincher she will know that he have a right of appeal that run out at the end of today so we be not able to do anything until the house return from recess as she know i do not control the timetable for that it be control by the standards committee when it publish its report that be the process as a member of the commission she know what work we have be do and i be grateful to she for acknowledge on the record my commitment to the   scheme to ensure that everyone who work on the estate be properly protect and we have good safeguard policy in place as soon as we have a settle scheme we will bring forward the debate on it

 yesterday thank to my right hon friend and team lewis i be able to meet les wateridge who as many will know spend decade keep the street of westminster clear especially around victoria tower gardens the day before anita lasker wallfisch come to parliament she be she be in the woman ’s orchestra at auschwitz and then survive bergen belsen may i invite the government the prime minister the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities and the leader of the uk holocaust memorial foundation to meet anita and hear her view on why the propose memorial in victoria tower gardens be too large for the garden and too small to be a proper memorial to those who die while she be incarcerate 
 i know that my hon friend care very deeply about this issue and the memorial as do all member of the house despite their different view as we be go into recess there will not be an opportunity for he to question either the prime minister or the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on this matter so i shall make sure that they hear of his invitation and i shall write to they on his behalf 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 this may be the last time i face the leader of the house at business question if the rumour be true she be about to be move again in yet another deckchair on the tory titanic reshuffle it be a shame she be just get the hang of business question by which i mean that like other tory ministers at the dispatch box she consistently avoid answer the question if anyone doubt that last week when i ask she about the prime minister ’s inflation and debt pledge i get a lecture in response about nuclear weapon and afternoon coffee break and then she describe i as delusional 
 there be no hope that the government will change course year of austerity and incompetence be bake in we be talk about a government who force brexit on scotland and who refuse to allow the scot even the right to choose their own future a budget that tank the economy and push the pension sector to the brink of collapse an inhuman and degrading immigration regime former prime ministers who can not even remember their phone password for a covid inquiry and a current pm who appear to think that argue with bank on behalf of an individual be the most important thing to focus on in the midst of a cost of living crisis and just a day before by election doctor nurse and teacher be all strike in england accord to the transport secretary it be now expect   that political party will pay out for the action of their donor and associate a surprising tack to take as his party can now surely expect a veritable torrent of invoice to wing their way to conservative hq in the near future 
 the people of scotland know of course that there be a well way than what we have to put up with here scotland have hope of a well way than endless westminster failure and arrogance it have hope of a future that hold real prospect of a well life for our family and community probably for the last time in the vain hope of an answer i ask a question of the leader of the house with food inflation still run at an estimate can we have a debate on how the government get we in such a hopeless mess 
 let i start by say how much i enjoy our exchange every week and how disappointed i should be if it be indeed to be our last however i feel that it be my duty to point out to the hon lady the error of what she assert she talk about deny the people of scotland a choice in respect of their future we be the government who give the scottish people as well as other resident of the united kingdom a vote on their future in respect of both scottish independence and brexit the difference between the hon lady ’s party and mine be that we honour the result of referendum 
 i know that the hon lady and her party have be campaign hard on the two- child policy this week so let i illustrate the power and the opportunity that sit in her party ’s hand it may interest she to know that the project black hole in the snp ’s budget identify by the scottish fiscal commission as a huge £ in the next year be enough money not only to reverse that policy in scotland but to reverse it for the whole of the uk as a minister at the department for work and pensions i be amazed at the length to which the snp would go not to take control over many aspect of welfare policy that we wish to devolve to it choose instead to criticise the uk government for the decision that they be make the hon lady ’s party be in power in scotland it pain i that it be in power but it be and have be for many year so it be time that its member take some responsibility 
 early this week in the pakistani province of sindh hindu temple be ransack and woman and child be take hostage by armed insurgent they be claim that until a young pakistani woman seema haider who wish to marry an indian man return to pakistan they will not release the woman and child the human rights commission of pakistan have condemn the move may i ask my right hon friend to urge the foreign secretary to make the strong possible representation to the pakistani authority to ensure that the woman and child be free and return to their home and love one immediately 
 i thank my hon friend for bring the house ’s attention to a very serious situation as he so often do he be the high attender of business question and he always raise important matter we be deeply concerned about this situation i will make sure that the foreign secretary be fully aware of it and we urge the pakistani authority to investigate any allegation fully prosecute those responsible and provide justice for the victim and their family
