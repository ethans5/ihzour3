the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of fuel poverty 
 what step his department be take to tackle fuel poverty in winter 
 the previous government ’s record on fuel poverty be absolutely woeful and we have have to inherit an incredibly challenging trajectory we be do everything we can to shift that by upgrade home for family in fuel poverty drive up standard in the rental sector so that we lift people out of fuel poverty and support over household with our warm home discount all while run with our mission for clean power 
 despite scotland be of the most energy rich nation in europe decade of mismanagement by different colour of uk government whether labour or conservative have lead to a shocking of household in scotland live in fuel poverty that number be set to rise along with energy bill the government be elect on labour ’s pledge to cut energy bill by £ but yesterday the chair of gb energy admit that that be not in its remit and be completely unable to say when bill would come down alleviate fuel poverty if this be not another broken promise from the prime minister can the secretary of state confirm exactly when in this parliamentary term consumer in scotland will see that reduction 
 fuel poverty be devolve in scotland the scottish government have have the opportunity to make a dent in this problem for almost year and they have not even now as we be ramp up upgrade to help people with fuel poverty the scottish government be raid more than £ from retrofit fund that could help family today i will take no lecture from the hon gentleman on how we tackle this problem 
 i call wendy chamberlain she be not here i call frank mcnally 
 i commend the minister for the announcement of support for those in most need this winter give scotland ’s cold climate do the minister share my view that as she have just express the scottish government ’s decision to cut £ from the retrofitting budget be fail people in coatbridge and bellshill and across scotland and that with record funding from this uk government in the budget they should reverse that cut 
 my hon friend be completely right there be no justification for raid retrofitting budget because we know that be the route by which we upgrade people ’s home to deliver home that be warm and cheap to run we be do our bit to drive down energy bill and deliver clean power which be the route to energy security and financial security the scottish government need to crack on and do their bit 
 what step he be take to support worker right in the renewable energy sector 
 the government come into office month ago and be determined to ensure that clean energy job be high quality well pay and secure with strong trade union i want to take this opportunity to commend edf renewables for its recent recognition agreement with trade union through the office for clean energy jobs we be work with industry and trade union to support fair pay and worker right and ensure that worker across the country can benefit from the economic opportunity of the net transition 
 datum centre at blackpool ’s propose high performance datum centre campus silicon sands will be power by renewable energy and cool by liquid immersion technique with the excess heat repurpose into neighbourhood building and home silicon sands could lead the way in an environmentally friendly approach to data centre while create thousand of well pay job for my home town will the minister meet i to discuss how the department can support my vision to build a well blackpool 
 i would of course be delighted to meet my hon friend to talk about this great project silicon sands which will bring job and be really innovative for his area the wide point be really important for too long our coastal and industrial community have not have the job opportunity they deserve we be determined to change that 
 can the minister assure the house that her ambition for renewable energy can be achieve without chinese slave labour 
 yes of course we ensure that the high standard be keep in all these thing the government ’s position be to make sure that we be very careful about they the right hon gentleman may be refer to solar which be a particular issue that people have raise we have a solar taskforce which have be set up exactly to look at those point 
 rise 
 order i know that member will find it unusual that mr speaker have leave the chair during question it be because he be go to attend the memorial service for lord hoyle so i be sure that the whole house want to send our good wish to he 
 what discussion he have have with energy supplier on support for consumer during winter 
 what discussion he have have with energy supplier on support for consumer during winter 
 what discussion he have have with energy supplier on support for consumer during winter 
 what discussion he have have with energy supplier on support for consumer during winter 
 we know that this winter have be difficult for many people who be struggle with high energy bill we agree the winter support package with industry and energy uk to get support to the people who need it and £ be be provide through industry when combine with the support that we be provide through the warm home discount that amount to £ for the family who we know need help this winter 
 as well as resident business in the ceramics sector struggle with high energy bill and face many other pressure sadly only yesterday more than worker in my constituency lose their job when royal stafford a historic ceramic manufacturer for nearly year go into liquidation a devastating blow for the worker and their family will the secretary of state meet gmb official ceramics uk and i as a matter of urgency to explain how the government will support the ceramics sector protect job and tackle the serious difficulty that energy intensive industry face in decarbonise 
 my hon friend be right to point out that we need to reduce energy bill for business include those in energy intensive industry i be sorry to hear about the job loss in his constituency and of the ministerial team will be happy to meet he i must add however that this be exactly why we be run our clean power mission we see that the route through which we can drive down bill be break our dependence on global fossil fuel market over which we have no control in order to take ourselves off the rollercoaster of price rise and price hike that be so damaging to business while we do that we be work with ofgem and industry to ensure that business be   not be lock into expensive contract and to ensure that they have much strong redress when thing go wrong 
 i thank the minister for all her work in this area i know from conversation with my constituent that energy cost be a large part of the cost of live crisis for they follow the conservative party ’s failure to protect our energy system and invest in home grow clean power can the minister give we an update on what step be be take to tackle my constituent high energy bill 
 my hon friend be right the reason we be so expose as a country to global fossil fuel market and the rollercoaster that be damage business and hurt consumer be the conservative party ’s failure to invest in home grow clean power and to upgrade people 's home to insulate they from high price that be a record of which the conservatives should be ashamed and it be a record that we be determined to change 
 many household in my constituency be struggle with high energy bill because the last government leave we expose to the unpredictable fossil fuel market do the minister agree that the only way in which to protect resident in my constituency and across the country permanently be to unlock clean power that we control here in the uk 
 my hon friend be completely right every solar panel and every wind turbine that we put up take we close to deliver the energy security that we need to achieve financial security for family that combine with our drive to upgrade people ’s home be what will protect household in the long term it be the central mission of this team this department and this government and it be why we be run at clean power by 
 in anticipation of the energy market reform that the last government neglect to carry out i look forward to hear confirmation from my colleague on the front bench that we may be able to find a way of insulate people in the long term for the transition to decarbonise heat for example can my hon friend confirm that in future we may be able to have a social tariff that protect the most vulnerable from the excess of energy price 
 i agree with my hon friend that we urgently need to tackle the challenge of affordability energy be not a luxury good it be foundational and for too many people this essential good be not affordable a social tariff be mechanism of respond to this and there be different way in which that can be implement we be look at all the option to ensure that family can get this essential good at more affordable price 
 people live in rural location disproportionately live in housing stock that be old and colder and do not have gas in the minister ’s discussion with energy supplier will she please not forget to talk to the supplier of liquefy petroleum gas and oil since many of our constituent particularly with the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment be suffer a great deal 
 we be very alive to the issue in rural community and we be work to ensure that there be solution for all type of home we have record application to our boiler upgrade scheme for heat pump a large number of which be from rural household we be very clear as we roll out our plan that there will be a solution for every single household so that everyone can benefit from home that be warm and cheap to run 
 this winter many of my constituent be concerned about energy outage last thursday the cooper school and glory farm school have to close for the entire day when they lose all electricity supply will the minister meet i to discuss how we can ensure the grid have the capacity to avoid these outage which be so damaging to home business and critical public service 
 yes we will meet the hon gentleman we be work to ensure that outage be not the norm this be obviously link to weather issue that we be have to respond to but the team have be work to ensure that household be not put in a difficult situation and when they be that we be respond as quickly as possible 
 what would help bill payer be the £ cut to energy bill that the labour party promise in its manifesto instead bill go up £ in october they go up £ in january and they be go up again by £ in april can the minister explain where the source of this departmental ineptitude lie and would she like to apologise to the people of these island for write cheque that her party can not cash 
 the hon member explain exactly why we need to wean ourselves off fossil fuel market that be why it be critical that we deliver clean power by that be the central mission of this team and we be run at it the scottish government do have the lever to protect household in fuel poverty before the hon member criticise we they should get their house in order and get on with the job 
 prior to the election the secretary of state promise to cut my constituent energy bill by £ would the minister repeat that promise at the dispatch box 
 we have a manifesto commitment to reduce energy bill by £ we be do everything we can we have a legacy of record high energy bill we be run at clean power because we think that be the route to deliver low energy cost we be upgrade people ’s home because we know that be the route to deliver home that be warm and clean to run we be do everything we can the conservative party oversee a crisis for household so before its member start lecture we on what we should do they should be hang their head in shame 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on opportunity for industry under the national wealth fund 
 the national wealth fund be an essential part of our clean energy and growth mission recent investment include £ of investment into xlcc a subsea cable manufacturer to develop a new facility in scotland create job £ of investment into cornish metals to finance lithium production support more than local job and £ work with barclays and lloyds to upgrade social housing give people warm home and low bill 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer in the liverpool bay area just off the coast of my southport constituency we already have a number of wind farm include the burbo bank scheme can he outline to the house what more his department be do to ensure that as we put up these wind farm job be create in constituency like mine 
 my hon friend ask a really important question which member from right across this house will agree with the situation we have inherit from the last government be that germany have almost twice as many renewable job per capita as britain sweden almost time as many and denmark almost time as many through a combination of great british energy the national wealth fund and a clean industry bonus we be make sure that we do not just build offshore wind in this country but reap the huge industrial opportunity from it 
 will the secretary of state confirm that the court of session ’s judgment on rosebank and jackdaw be to do with their consent not their licence when he come to consider his decision on those consent he should do so on the basis that these be exist not new licence 
 that be an individual planning case so i will be careful about what i say what i will say to the hon lady be that the last government make an unlawful decision accord to the court we be go to follow due process 
 gb nuclear be about to make decision on small modular reactor and i know my right hon friend will agree that those smr and their supply chain should be build here in the uk although we have the capability in sheffield we do not necessarily have the capacity so will he work with i my colleague and business in sheffield to look at proposal for a nuclear manufacture centre of excellence 
 i welcome that question from my right hon friend who be a fantastic champion of these issue we will look at any proposal in detail but she make such an important point which i would make to all member of this house people will have different view on this issue but clean energy be the economic opportunity of the century whether it be small modular reactor offshore wind hydrogen or carbon capture in our month this government have show what it mean to deliver at pace on the investment that this country need 
 have the secretary of state engage in any discussion with northern ireland industry on the strategic use of the sovereign wealth fund 
 the hon gentleman make an important point i discuss this issue in detail in advance of the preparation of the great british energy bill and it be also relevant to the national wealth fund we want our institution to serve all country in our united kingdom and i encourage he and industry in his constituency to make application to the national wealth fund which be there to support people and industry across the uk 
 the government policy to decarbonise the grid by rest on the national energy system operator ’s assumption of a £ per tonne carbon price but manufacturer be line up to tell the energy secretary that it would destroy british industry will he guarantee today that for the remainder of this parliament we will have a low carbon price than europe 
 neso make that assumption but it do not reflect our assumption that the carbon price will be significantly low i will not start predict market price what i will say to the hon gentleman be that the difference between he and we be that he believe that we should double down on fossil fuel as the answer to the problem face the country whereas we know that clean energy be the way forward 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean power by 
 since this government come into office we have take a series of step to deliver clean home grow power for britain include lift the onshore wind ban consent to nearly gw of solar and oversee the most successful renewable auction in history in december we publish our clean power action plan which have be widely welcome by business as provide the route map that simply do not exist under the previous government 
 energy project in east anglia will be crucial for generate the clean cheap power that this country need to grow from wind and solar farm to nuclear power station include the much need sizewell c. these project will bring high skilled job to east anglia include in my constituency of bury st edmunds and stowmarket what action be the government take to ensure that the infrastructure improvement to connect these project to the grid will not be hamstring by the planning process 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and congratulate he on his advocacy member across the house have a decision to make here as the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh say early we be expose to fossil fuel and we see what be happen in global market with price go up if we want to change that and have clean home grow power that we can control we have   to build the infrastructure we need i congratulate my hon friend   the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley   on support it and on support our planning reform and i urge member across this house to do the same 
 give that the british taxpayer be pay billion of pound in subsidy to fall tree in canada and ship the wood across the atlantic to burn in the drax power station can the secretary of state tell the house where the clean energy lie within that have he read the kpmg report if he have will he come to the house and make a statement on his assessment of it 
 the last government consult on what if any future support there should be for biomass power station we be study that consultation and we will make a statement in due course 
 community energy project can help we achieve clean energy by darley abbey community energy be surge ahead with plan for kw archimede screw on the river derwent the same river that power the world ’s factory year ago the project could generate enough hydroelectricity to power all the business at darley abbey mills but there be hurdle in place include planning permission insurance cost and the need for up front capital what can the government do to support local renewable community project such as these to succeed 
 my hon friend make a fantastically important point which be that we often think about plan reform as be about the large scale project but it be also about unblock the small scale project have a national energy policy statement that include work with local authority and make sure there be enough planner to make the decision all those thing can all make a difference i congratulate my hon friend on her advocacy for this work and i congratulate the local community on this project 
 expert be clear that the saving from the government ’s clean power action plan will be wipe out by if airport expansion at heathrow gatwick and luton go ahead and that rely on so call sustainable aviation fuel would use up to half the uk ’s agricultural land do the secretary of state agree with the scientist that while ambitious clean power plan be hugely welcome if this government also back airport expansion they be not go to meet their climate obligation 
 as the chancellor say last week any aviation expansion have to take place within carbon budget and environmental limit i would also point out that this government have achieve more in month than the last government do in year we have lift the onshore wind ban consent nearly gw of solar set up gb energy and the national wealth fund and hold the most successful renewable auction in history this government be deliver on clean power 
 i call the shadow minister 
 to achieve his clean power plan can the secretary of state say exactly what local community need to do to convince he that solar farm on agricultural land be not appropriate in their area 
 it be quite extraordinary we be absolutely expose as a country yet the conservatives oppose clean power they have a blanket opposition to clean power so let every person in the country know that when energy bill remain high they be oppose the thing that will bring they down it be quite extraordinary this be the conservative party that lose the last general election its bad defeat in year yet if anything since the election conservative members have get bad and learn nothing 
 the secretary of state recently approve a hectare solar farm in lincolnshire a farm link to dale vince a £ donor to the labour party the public have a right to be certain that this decision be carry out properly so will the secretary of state refer his conduct of this application to the independent adviser on ministerial standard yes or no 
 i be glad the hon lady ask because i take no part in this decision i recuse myself interruption here we go they have nothing to say about the country just desperate scraping of the barrel let the whole house hear that they oppose a solar plan that will put up solar panel throughout the country and give clean power to the british people the state of the conservative party be something to behold 
 what step he be take to support off grid community with energy price 
 what step he be take to support off grid community with energy price 
 our commitment to make britain a clean energy superpower be the only way to protect bill payer permanently the government be determined to support all household with their energy cost include those that be off grid and eligible low income household be be support with the warm home discount i urge household off the gas grid to contact their electricity supplier if they have to see what support they can receive 
 many of my constituent as well as be off grid have home build of non standard material clunch or wattle and daub and those home be also often list what support will the minister provide to my constituent who be look to retrofit their home to move away from oil and improve insulation 
 the hon lady be right that particularly in rural area certain house type be often much more difficult to heat due to much old building material and a lack of insulation the minister for consumers my hon friend   the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh be work to make sure our warm home plan can reach all community and all type of household   and i encourage   the hon member for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane   to feed in any idea for how we can do that for these rural and off grid household 
 every winter altnaharra in my constituency be the cold place in the uk i can think of lot of pensioner who be face with the invidious decision of whether to switch off and shiver or to run into debt it occur to i that the department for work and pensions may well have a database of these people so will his majesty ’s government get the dwp to work with the department for energy security and net to identify they and give a help hand 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that helpful point where we can co ordinate information and datum across government to identify people who need more support we will do so my department be currently work with the department for work and pensions to release as much of that information as possible and we hope that we will be able to make progress in due course 
 do the minister agree that new oil and gas development will not give we energy security as the fossil fuel they produce will be sell internationally they will not lower bill and they will undermine our climate commitment 
 my hon friend be of course right to say that even if oil and gas be extract from the continental shelf they be sell on the international market the company that extract the oil and gas be in the business of try to make as much profit as possible and will sell to the high bidder so it do not protect price for consumer in this country we be clear in our manifesto that we will not issue licence for new exploration and new field but that we will continue to support those licence that have already be issue our future do not lie in more oil and gas it lie in clean power which be why we be move at pace to deliver that 
 what step he be take to introduce the warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce the warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce the warm home plan 
 the warm home plan will upgrade up to home with low carbon solution such as heat pump solar and insulation to deliver home that be warm and cheap to run we have already kick start delivery with up to home be upgrade this year alone we will set out our plan in the spring on how we will ramp this up 
 in it emerge that a number of substandard retrofitting work be carry out as part of government scheme in some case property be leave with structural damage when household seek redress they find that many of the authorised contractor have fold and they have be leave to pick up the bill will the minister assure i and my constituent in shipley that under the warm home plan sufficient safeguard will be put in place to protect household from rogue company 
 my hon friend raise an important point we be aware of too many case where home upgrade have not be do to the require standard we be very clear that the ad hoc fragmented system of regulate home upgrade that we inherit from the last government be in dire need of reform we will overhaul that system so that when people have home upgrade they can be confident that they will be of the high standard and that when thing go wrong they will have as much protection as possible and redress within the system 
 the previous government be content to sit back and allow developer to build home that have lock people into year of expensive and dirty gas heating how will the minister ensure that the new home the government will deliver will not keep people dependent on outdated and costly gas heating system 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the new home we build must be fit for the future and must be decent home that comply with our carbon standard we be work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to bring forward the future home standard and we will set out our plan for that in due course 
 i have be shock by the number of mouldy and damp home that i have visit in my constituency no should be force to live in such condition we have some of the leaky home in europe as a result of the last government ’s failure to deal with the problem will the minister tell i how our warm home plan will improve housing condition and bring down bill for my constituent in bournemouth west 
 cold damp home that be hard to heat be the reality for too many household in this country that be the legacy of the party opposite and a legacy that we be absolutely determined to turn around we be committed to upgrade home in the rental sector with our minimum energy efficiency standard so that we can make cold draughty home a thing of the past we will ramp up our warm home plan so that my hon friend ’s constituent and constituent across the country will benefit from home that be warm and bill that be low 
 will the minister acknowledge the amazing contribution of group such as new forest friends of the earth which this very morning have be lobby their mps in parliament square on warm home initiative they will be come to the government with some possibly   costly proposal but i hope that the government despite the economic legacy that they allegedly inherit will give they a sympathetic hearing 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for remind we about our economic inheritance we be reach out to organisation and stakeholder across the country industry charity and sector organisation to feed into our warm home plan so we be keen to hear idea we be conscious that we have an ambitious programme and we need to do a big scaling up of home upgrade across the country so we be definitely in the market for hear from and reach out to organisation that can come up with idea 
 be it not a fact that regardless of how much money be put into a warm home scheme social tariff or whatever consumer can never be insulate against the massive cost of the mad net policy that will require thousand of new turbine acre of solar farm and mile of new transmission line all at a cost to the consumer how on earth do the minister believe that we will deal with the issue of fuel poverty in this country with that cost 
 i will say to the right hon gentleman that at the moment family be not insulate from fossil fuel market we have see of the bad energy crisis which have have a huge impact on the cost of living the status quo be not tenable we already have record high energy price and the only way that we be go to bear down on that be through clean power the alternative be to do nothing but we have see the impact of do nothing over the last year and consumer and constituent across the country be the one be impact we will absolutely drive forward with clean power by because that be our route to provide an energy system that deliver energy security and that can deliver financial security 
 the minister come to the house previously and give we some encouragement about the warm home scheme and how it have be discuss with the region the northern ireland assembly in particular since that statement have she have the opportunity to speak to the relevant minister in the department of enterprise trade and investment in northern ireland to ensure that we can all gain from the warm home scheme which the minister be propose in a positive fashion 
 we be speak to all the devolved administration we be constantly engage with they include in our inter ministerial group on this specific issue of home upgrade and how we drive up standard we be work with the scottish the welsh and the northern ireland administrations 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of government fund home insulation scheme 
 home insulation deliver warm home and low bill i have visit government back scheme across the country and see their impact on household and consumer but we   also know that there be too many example of home not be upgrade to the require standard we be not happy or comfortable with that we be commit to overhaul system so that when people have home upgrade they can be confident that they will be of the high standard and that if thing go wrong they will have redress so that we can take they on this journey with we 
 far to the question raise by   the hon member for shipley anna dixon   and several other hon member i too have pick up numerous case in my constituency of government sponsor defective home insulation work and of extortionate poor quality and defective work of unscrupulous cowboy contractor who masquerade as operate under government scheme this include mrs king in helston in my constituency who have pay out £ to have insulation instal and then remove i be pleased with the minister ’s response but surely the government need to do more to give householder confidence that these project be both cost effective and provide proper redress 
 the hon gentleman be right it be just not good enough for any householder to get a home upgrade that be not up to standard i be sorry to hear about the example of mrs king we be work with member across the house on support a number of individual case if it be a government back scheme that be at fault mechanism be in place for the work to be remediate at low cost but at the end of the day we have acknowledge that the system require root and branch reform so that when consumer opt for upgrade they can have the confidence of know that they will deliver what we be say warm home that be cheap to run 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 next week the select committee will be hear from some of the victim of the botched solid wall insulation instal under the previous government ’s energy company obligation and gb insulation scheme that include people whose home may well have to be rebuild as the cost of repair the damage may be high will the minister tell we how such a thing could have happen and will she confirm that she be happy to come back to the select committee to add to the comment that she have already make about rebuild consumer confidence after the disaster under the previous government 
 what be clear to we as a new government be that the system of regulate home upgrade be too ad hoc and too fragmented accountability be not clear enough and consumer be not at the heart of the system we be committed to turn around that system put simply when someone have a home upgrade they need to have the confidence that it will work for they and that when thing go wrong redress will be put in place i be commit to update the select committee on the progress that we be make on get a grip of what we have inherit and on make sure that such a thing never happen again for consumer 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as we have be hear dickensian condition of cold damp and mouldy home be shamefully on the increase in my constituency more than household be have to make that difficult decision between eating and heating because of the previous government ’s dither and delay on insulation however even now local authority and family be in limbo anxiously await confirmation of the funding for eco4 and the great british insulation scheme through a ministerial statement will the minister act with the urgency that be need to bring those scheme and the warm home scheme forward to tackle fuel poverty 
 i thank the hon member for point out the inheritance and the legacy that be material because it be the backdrop to everything we be try to do we be clear that we need to drive forward with momentum and pace that be why we be already upgrade up to home this year alone it be also why we be work with local authority and social housing provider to deliver warm home that be cheap to run for community across the country we be absolutely move at pace with our warm home plan we will be set out that plan and at its heart be an ambition to ramp up the number of upgrade massively so that more family across the country can benefit from what we know work warm home and low bill 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of recent trend in level of stand charge for electricity bill 
 we know that people be frustrate with standing charge and we be commit as a government to reduce they as an initial step the regulator ofgem be consult on give people the option of no standing charge tariff within the price cap and we will continue to work with the regulator to ensure that we lower standing charge in the fairest way possible 
 lesley from tring be of my constituent who just miss out on the winter fuel allowance she say she will be 
 spend most of the winter in bed 
 because she be struggle with energy cost while so many be struggle with the cost of energy stand charge disproportionately affect those on low income such as lesley will the government meet ofgem to discuss those disparity and prepare detailed action to review standing charge for a fair system 
 i be sorry to hear about the case of lesley and i know there be people across the country who have this frustration with standing charge i reassure the house that we have a commitment to reduce they we be work with ofgem on a set of option our challenge be to ensure that standing charge do not penalise some household and that they be as   fair as possible that be what we be commit to do and that be what we be work every day to deliver 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of energy base development proposal in mid buckinghamshire constituency 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman not just on this question but on secure an adjournment debate last night on exactly the same subject as i state last night clean power project in his constituency and across the country be vital to achieve our clean power mission which will give we energy security and bring down bill for family of course all proposal be assess on their individual merit through the planning system and where community host infrastructure the government believe they should directly benefit from it 
 in answer my hon friend   the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey   early the secretary of state completely dismiss the legitimate concern of rural community and farmer who be be ask to take on energy project yet last night in the adjournment debate the under secretary find a more reasonable tone accept the point on cumulative impact in constituency such as mine that be be ask to take up to acre of project will the under secretary go into more detail about how the government will put in mitigation on cumulative impact to protect community such as mine 
 i would be test the patience of the deputy speaker if i be to go into more detail than i could in an adjournment debate the point i make clearly to the hon gentleman be that it be not a credible position for he to take that there should be absolutely no infrastructure build anywhere in his constituency the reality be we need to build new infrastructure not just energy infrastructure but right across the public sector i have say clearly that the work we be take forward on the strategic spatial energy plan and on the land use framework by colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs be about try to ensure that we manage the good use of land but we will have to build new infrastructure and community will have to host it 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of establish a great british energy office in every region 
 we announce that great british energy ’s headquarters will be in aberdeen recognise the decade of experience in that city as the energy capital of europe and our determination to invest in good well pay job in the city with £ worth of investment behind great british energy it will deliver economic value and job right across the supply chain across all part of the country    include in my hon friend ’s constituency great british energy be the right idea for our time public ownership investment in supply chain and the reindustrialisation of our nation 
 i commend the minister on the progress he have make on set up great british energy can he outline to the house what opportunitie our publicly own champion will bring to southend east and rochford and the wide south east region 
 my hon friend be right of course the great british energy legislation be still go through parliament at the moment we hope that process will conclude soon but in the meantime hard work have be take place to identify all the opportunity for great british energy to invest both opposition party the snp and the conservatives seem to oppose great british energy every single investment that it make every job that it create and every part of the supply chain that it incentivise will be deliver by great british energy against the snp and the conservatives who have oppose it at every single stage i ask they to rethink their position on what be a publicly own champion to deliver for community create good well pay job and deliver the clean power future that we need as a country 
 we hear from the chief executive officer of great british energy the other day he say that it be not in his brief to cut bill by £ what be great british energy for then it turn out that the job be not go to materialise either so how will the government make sure that we do not have some bureaucrat job creation scheme in every region of the country as the minister ’s back benchers be call for but actually have a company that invest in thing that otherwise would not be invest in technology such as wind and solar be already investable so will great british energy focus on those thing that need to be bring close to market 
 the right hon gentleman strongly make the case for the importance of a publicly own energy champion invest in part of the energy system that be not currently get that investment i appreciate his recognition of that what the interim chair of great british energy say very clearly of course it have not appoint a ceo yet and what we have say consistently be that great british energy ’s headquarters in aberdeen will of course create job but the majority of the job that will be create by that investment will come from the investment that great british energy make in supply chain in project and in develop the clean power that we need great british energy will champion the industry that the right hon gentleman speak about and deliver job in this country to reindustrialise community and conservative members will have to explain why they be against those job when they be create include if they be create in the right hon gentleman ’s constituency 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it be refreshing yesterday to have some clarity on great british energy ’s plan not from the secretary   of state or from ministers that would be ask far too much but from the manchester base chairman of the aberdeen base company juergen maier he state that cut energy bill be a very long term project”—not £ by the next election then and that the aberdeen headquarters if we can call it that will employ only to people far from the initially promise although that may come in year time on behalf of the ten of thousand of energy worker worry for their future and indeed the million watch their energy bill rise yet again can i ask the minister whether he agree with the now very interim chairman 
 the shadow minister must be the only member of parliament represent aberdeenshire who be against investment in aberdeenshire he will have to explain to his constituent and business right across his community why he stand up and oppose investment in his constituency of course in do so he misunderstand the role that great british energy will play the key point of it be that it will invest £ over the lifetime of this parliament in clean power project right across the country help to unlock private sector investment and create supply chain in this country the shadow minister have now turn his face against all of those job that will be create in aberdeen which be a question he will have to answer for his constituent 
 the minister have a right cheek to come to this chamber and talk about protect job in aberdeenshire when ten of thousand of energy worker be go to lose their job because of this government ’s decision on the north sea the british people be promise low bill by the next election now they have be give a vague assurance that in the very long term bill might come down and they be mean to be grateful for that 
 the arrogance of this government be staggering if not surprising they be so drive by ideology that they will not even allow government lawyer to defend licence issue for rosebank and jackdaw and be willing to see import of fracked gas increase as long as they go down in history as the government who shut down the north sea while pensioner freeze as the minister ’s government strip they of the winter fuel allowance and as people be make unemployed due to his government ’s position on the north sea can the minister see why people across this country be quite miff that the government get to waste £ of their money on the gb energy white elephant 
 let we be absolutely clear that great british energy will invest in clean power project right across the country include in the shadow minister ’s constituency secondly he have an absolute cheek to come to this chamber and talk about job in oil and gas when more than job be lose in north sea industry over the past decade the shadow minister be in the energy department for at least a chunk of that time the truth be that a transition be under way in the north sea conservative members be quite happy to bury their head in the sand and pretend that it be not happen as thousand of people lose their job this government be determined to build what come next the shadow minister stand opposed to that and he will have to explain to his constituent and the people of scotland why he do not support that investment 
 that bring we to topical and question and answer will have to be very brief 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 in recent week we have see continue rise in price in global fossil fuel market with wholesale gas price last month high than a year ago which be cause by a number of factor i want to be clear with the house as long as britain remain so dependent on fossil fuel we will be in the grip of these global market control by petrostate and dictator with direct impact here at home the only way to get off this rollercoaster be with clean home grow power that we control and that be what the government ’s clean energy mission be all about 
 the scottish borders have some of the most beautiful countryside in the whole of the united kingdom but it be go to be destroy by the massive pylon be build by scottishpower energy networks in pursuit of scottish government and uk government policy do the secretary of state think it be right to charge ahead with these plan which be firmly oppose by local community 
 i say to the hon gentleman and i have say it throughout this question time that local community should have a say but we have a decision to make as a country do we build the clean energy infrastructure to protect we from volatile fossil fuel market or do business family and the public finances—£94 be spend during the energy bill crisis remain exposed i know what i would choose we protect ourselves 
 green energy be the economic opportunity of the century and in an ever more unstable world home grow renewable be critical to our security and self sufficiency what will the secretary of state do to make sure that burnley padiham and brierfield and place like those benefit from new green job growth 
 my hon friend ask a really important question the whole point of our clean industry bonus be to incentivise british manufacturing that be so important for the country and it be not do by the last government we be determined that his constituent and constituent across the country will benefit 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this government ’s ideological obsession with intermittent renewable at the expense of stable clean baseload nuclear power will we think be their great mistake they have delay the small modular reactor down selection competition and we have not hear a peep about the final investment decision on sizewell c. however none of that come close to the monumental act of self harm of decide to throw away and bury out   of reach underground—20 year of nuclear grade plutonium which could be use to drive forward a nuclear revolution in this country how do the secretary of state think this will play with the pro growth pro nuclear mps in his own party who be already worried about he be a drag on growth 
 may i take this opportunity i know we be short of time madam deputy speaker to congratulate the permanent shadow energy secretary   the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho on the birth of her baby boy i be sure the whole house will want to join i in congratulate she i also congratulate the hon gentleman on his temporary elevation 
 on the issue of plutonium disposition and the decision i and my hon friend have make we be act on the good advice we have inside government it have the potential to create thousand of job thousand of long term job and it be the right thing to do not just for job but for nuclear safety 
 stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency have world lead specialist capability to produce high grade steel part currently use in aerospace i be proud of this government ’s steel strategy which will ensure we buy british for new infrastructure and great british energy provide an ambitious opportunity to bring down bill and ensure energy security will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the potential for use specialist steel capacity at liberty steel in stocksbridge for new net energy infrastructure 
 south yorkshire have a proud history of steelmaking as i see for myself when i be at sheffield forgemasters last week we see a huge reduction in steel production in this country on the last government ’s watch and we want to turn that around which be why we be deliver a steel strategy as ever i would of course be delighted to meet my hon friend to talk about how we can make this work 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 while we eagerly await progress on bring community energy into the great british energy bill when it come back to this house will ministers reassure community group around the country that they will enlarge and expand the community energy fund of £ which be so successful that it be currently oversubscribe 
 i know that the hon lady have have long discussion with the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks on these issue we be absolutely determined that as part of great british energy community energy will be massively expand that be our manifesto commitment and that be what we will deliver hon member around the chamber have ask how their community can benefit and community energy will be an essential part 
 in my constituency of newport west and islwyn we have ever expand semiconductor facility and data centre the primary mission of this government be growth but that growth could be stifle if there be not sufficient grid capacity alongside these exciting innovation what be the minister do to make sure that south wales have sufficient grid capacity to support these advance and facilitate much need growth 
 my hon friend make a very important point although we be clearly on the sprint to deliver clean power by demand for electricity in this country be likely to double by our reform around connection to the grid be important they will make sure that there be space for demand project such as datum centre to connect but so be build the grid for the future so that we have capacity in our network to deliver on our growth aspiration 
 can the minister assure the house that as the government push to decarbonise the electricity grid the vast majority of new electricity generation and transmission infrastructure will be build in the uk not import from foreign country include china 
 we be absolutely determined to build the manufacturing base in this country i mention the investment in xlcc that be a crucial part of build the supply chain the supply chain have be erode over a decade or we be determined to build they up 
 look around the car park in parliament i notice that we have only charge port both occupy by support the installation of more charge port in parliament and other workplace across the country we can encourage more people to make the environmentally friendly switch to electric vehicle what measure be the government take to promote the installation of charge port in workplace 
 i can not speak on behalf of the house of commons authority but under the building regulation of all new non residential building and those undergo major renovation must install charge infrastructure in government along with colleague in the department for transport i host roundtable yesterday and i will host another today on how we can unlock much more investment in charge infrastructure because that be critical in support the transition to electric vehicle 
 i take part in last week ’s very successful nuclear week in parliament and be pleased to see so many official from the department for energy security and net engage in it but the dark cloud on the horizon for i and my constituent be that the scottish national party government in scotland still use the planning system to block new nuclear development and the job and economic opportunity that it bring what can the uk government do to promote new nuclear development in scotland 
 i have huge respect for the right hon gentleman and completely concur with he on this issue nuclear be an essential part of our clean energy future the demand for electricity in the year ahead there will be a increase by and demand will probably be double if not more by mean that we need all the technology at our disposal renewable nuclear and other the snp be in the wrong place on this but i be glad to say that scottish labour be in the right place 
 when i visit birkby junior school i see that tackle climate change and pollution be of its key priority do the minister agree that set a strong nationally determine contribution at cop29 and commit to an ambitious clean power target be important in demonstrate that the government be intent on tackle climate change especially at a time when other global leader be not 
 last week the uk formally submit its ndc to the united nations framework convention on climate change it be a world lead ambitious target that we hope will demonstrate ambition to other country in that ndc we have a youth clause for the time and i be very keen to talk to member across the house about how we can well engage with school community and young people to bring they on board with we as we seek to achieve our ambition 
 will the minister agree to meet the wonderful cumbria action for sustainability and i to address some of the imperfection in the government home insulation programme it do not properly support old rural community property that be single skin not so easy to insulate and therefore not so easy to keep heat cheaply 
 i be happy to meet the hon gentleman we know that we have a job to do to ensure that all insulation be up to standard and that we have the right measure for every type of household i be keen to engage with he and member across the house 
 the uk have a fantastic £ clean tech sector lead the way in innovation and carbon reduction for everything from clean power to sustainable agriculture however all too often red tape and bureaucracy be lock in dependency on fossil fuel and foreign oil and gas how can we work across government to cut back on this unnecessary red tape and ensure that our scheme support the lead tech and innovation that our good of british producer be bring forward 
 there be huge potential and with my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology i will chair an artificial intelligence energy council look at not only how we can meet the future demand of ai but how ai and technology can help we deliver the infrastructure and energy system of the future my hon friend   the member for hitchin alistair strathern   make an important point which we will take away 
 in the village of shapwick in my constituency of mid dorset and north poole of property have be lie empty because their owner aster housing association and the national trust can not afford to bring they up to standard national trust home be typically solid wall thatch not on main gas and list what plan be there to support the owner in achieve energy efficiency so that we can get those property occupy 
 let we be frank the big prize that have elude past government for a long time be a proper plan to upgrade all type of building not just residential property the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the hon member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh and i be work on that closely with colleague from across government it be part of a big version of the warm home plan which be also about building we will definitely take away the experience that the hon lady raise 
 what engagement have the minister have with the convention of scottish local authorities council leader on local power plan do he agree that a partnership approach by government council and community organisation such as the west lothian climate action network be key to the success of local power plan 
 i agree with my hon friend the local power plan be a key part of what great british energy will deliver it will give community the power to develop local power project wherever possible and to achieve the social and economic benefit of do so we be engage with a number of stakeholder across the uk because of the devolution settlement our main contact will be with the scottish government who have their relationship with cosla but we be determined that local government across the uk will help drive this forward and will have the capacity to support community in do so 
 i thank the minister with responsibility for energy consumer for agree to convene a roundtable tomorrow on the subject of radio teleswitching switch off at the end of june the problem will be particularly acute in community like mine we be well behind the rest of the country when it come to smart meter roll out when she come to the meeting will she have a target for get we the number of smart meter that we need 
 the right hon member be right to raise this issue we have to deliver on the teleswitching transition we be behind where we need to be but we be work with industry and ofgem to make sure that household be not leave in the dark and that everyone can upgrade to smart meter which will be much well for they i be keen to work with he and member from all part of the house to make sure that we get this right for his community and other community that be affect 
 the government procurement budget be around £ can the minister please tell we what percentage of his allocation   will go to british business will he confirm that where we have to import no modern slavery will be import into this country 
 on the question i completely agree with my hon friend who be an eloquent champion for tackle modern slavery i know member from all part of the house share her view we need to do well as a government in term of the guideline inherit from the last government and the solar taskforce be look at those issue her question relate to something that we be discuss with our colleague in government the economic and social value we can get as a country from the procurement budget be huge and untapped and we need to do something about it 
 the £ swimming pool support fund to help make pool more energy efficient be face a significant underspend before it expire in a few month time will the minister urgently meet eastbourne borough council better and i to discuss unlock this national underspend to help fund solar panel and pool cover at eastbourne sovereign centre where i learn to swim 
 i be massively in favour of solar panel on swimming pool and lido i be an occasional lido user myself so i be fully on board with the hon gentleman ’s point i will pass it on to colleague in government 
 southampton itchen have many victorian and inter war home that be poorly insulate and therefore expensiveto heat especially    as the conservative party drag its foot and do not invest in clean or affordable energy what step be the minister take to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of my constituent home 
 this be hard partly because of the fiscal backdrop but we be work on a comprehensive plan so that we can help not just the poor we want to help those in fuel poverty but people across the income spectrum through a more universal offer if we can get fund for up front investment there will be massive payback that be the chance we all know that it be a hard nut to crack but we be do our good to do so 
 final question richard tice 
 energy supplier be now forecast that the energy price cap will go up in april by another make for some since last summer will the secretary of state tell the house when bill will come down or will net stupid mean that they will only ever go up 
 it be a particular pleasure to end with the hon gentleman here it be a decision for all member of the house to make we be on the rollercoaster of the fossil fuel market we have no control over they the mission of this government be to take back control with clean home grow power i urge he and members across the house to support take back control 
 with permission i wish to make a statement on the national cancer plan today be world cancer day almost everyone in our country have be affect by cancer either themselves or through a friend or relative have lose both my parent to cancer i be so grateful to the prime minister for give i this job he have give i the chance of a lifetime to do my parent proud by create the kind of compassionate and humane healthcare that all our constituent deserve 
 i be also pleased to be lead by a survivor of kidney cancer my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care his experience as a patient will be invaluable to we in the month ahead i pay tribute to the amazing cancer charity who do fantastic work to help people live with cancer support bereaved family and drive vital research in this area macmillan cancer research uk cancer52 and marie curie to name just a few 
 lord darzi ’s investigation set out the scale of the challenge that we face in fix the nhs and how desperately we need to improve cancer diagnosis rate wait and outcome he find that 
 the uk have substantially high rate than our european neighbour nordic country and country that predominantly speak english 
 there be close to more case of cancer in than in while survival rate at year year and year have all improve the rate of improvement slow substantially during the 2010s 
 lord darzi also note important inequality in the provision of cancer care people in the most underserved area be more likely to present as an emergency as cancer research uk point out in its submission to the investigation the day target for referral to treatment have not be meet for almost year last may performance be at just under with more than of patient wait long than day to start radical radiotherapy 
 for all those reason and more we do not have a to waste that be why the prime minister kick off this year with our elective reform plan set out how we will cut the long waiting time from month to week from march next year around more people every year will be tell if they have cancer or not within day and around more people will begin treatment within month of diagnosis that be why this year we will spend £ on replace old radiotherapy machine with new more efficient model that be why in the king ’s speech we put forward an improved tobacco and vapes bill help to reduce around preventable death and put we on track to a smoke free uk 
 while around of cancer be cause by avoidable factor such as smoking the backdrop be of an age society cancer research uk have forecast half a cancer case each year by we be prepare for the future now with our year health plan for the nhs the plan will set out the framework of reform that we need to ensure well outcome and to meet the grow challenge that we face in the fight against this dreadful disease the plan will play to britain ’s strength   as a global leader in the development of advanced therapy use our strong academic and life science industry 
 we should remember that the nhs be the health service in europe to commission car t cellular therapy for blood cancer patient on this world cancer day i can announce that we will build on that legacy by invest in a cutting edge world lead trial to transform breast cancer care through artificial intelligence nearly woman will take part in this trial test how cutting edge ai tool can be use to catch breast cancer case early testing site across the country will be enhance with the late digital ai technology ready to invite woman already book in for routine screening on the nhs to take part 
 the technology will assist radiologist by screen patient to identify change in breast tissue that show possible sign of cancer with referral for further investigation if require if the trial be successful it have immense potential to free up hundred of radiologist and other specialist across the country to see more patient tackle rise cancer rate and save more life it be just example of how british scientist be at the forefront of transform cancer care and of the promising potential of cut edge innovation to tackle of the uk ’s big killer 
 this government know that unless we do thing differently our nhs will remain in the dire state in which we inherit it that mean proper reform from do away with burdensome process that hold back frontline staff to hand more power to local leader so that they can deliver for the community they know well it also mean embrace new technology include ai to transform the way we deliver care and to improve patient outcome today ’s trial be yet more evidence of this government take action to bring in the reform that be desperately need as the prime minister set out last month our plan for change will put the uk on the front foot unleash ai to drive up health service and shift the nhs from analogue to digital as part of our year plan 
 our year plan will ensure that the nhs be there for our grandchild and future generation but we believe that the increase number of cancer case and the complexity of cancer care mean that we need a specific approach to cancer we be determine both to bring down the number of life cut short by cancer and to ensure that many more people go on to lead a full life after their treatment that be why i be today announce a call for evidence for our new national cancer plan that we will publish follow the year plan in the half of this year we will look at the full range of factor and tool that will allow we to transform outcome for cancer patient while improve their experience of treatment and care we will make the united kingdom a world leader in cancer survival by fight the disease on all front through well research diagnosis screening treatment and prevention however we can not do this alone and that be why we be launch this call for evidence from patient doctor nurse scientist our key partner and other member of the public on what should be include 
 to support that work we will relaunch the child and young people ’s cancer taskforce co chair by   the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage   and professor darren hargrave with dr sharna   shanmugavadivel as vice chair i ’ve put my tooth in apology if i pronounce that wrong the taskforce will bring together the country ’s top expert to set out plan to improve treatment detection and research for cancer in child which will feed into the plan at every stage we will ensure that patient voice be hear i look forward to update the house on the progress of the plan the taskforce and the trial throughout the year 
 many of we on the government benches remember with pride the previous labour government ’s record in the fight against cancer we introduce landmark legislation to ban smoking in public place protect a generation of child from the harm of hand smoke while put record sum into smoking cessation programme at the dawn of the millennium we launch a national cancer plan which lead to fast cancer diagnosis and treatment time increase funding for cancer service equip the national health service with radiotherapy machine many of which be still there and expand cancer research funding so that a new generation of scientist could answer the call what do that plan lead to survival rate go up the number of patient diagnose and treat on time go up the number of life live well after cancer go up that be our record in government and we will do it again i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement and i thank all the nhs worker charity scientist and other work to help those with cancer 
 we can all agree that tackle cancer should be a top priority for the nhs from diagnose people quickly to start treatment quickly and use the late technology and drug we all want to see improvement the recent trend in cancer survival rate be positive the year survival rate for cancer increase by between and and the year survival rate increase by in the same period despite those improvement we be not yet where we want to be and we will be up front about that 
 in government we take action to catch cancer soon and boost survival rate with initiative such as lung cancer screening and prostate cancer trial and we welcome that labour be continue with that mission we will work constructively with the government on that as we all want to achieve the same positive outcome however the statement as a whole be rather disappointing the minister have tell we that this be a cancer plan but it be not it be a statement that there be to be the government say that they want cancer survival rate to increase and that they be go to have a plan do not make it so we need the plan itself 
 the announcement of the ai trial in breast cancer be a welcome approach artificial intelligence have the capacity to revolutionise the way we diagnose disease and i be delighted that the government wish to explore those opportunity we also very much welcome the relaunch of the child and young people ’s cancer taskforce and be pleased it will be able to continue its valuable   work under the co chairmanship of my hon friend   the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage   and professor darren hargrave it be just a shame that the labour government waste month by suspend the conservative taskforce only to reinstate it now 
 i note the minister ’s comment about wait time to start treatment and we agree that these must improve i be sure it will not have escape his notice that nhs wales which have be under a labour administration for year have a poor performance and i be certain he would not want party politic to affect such an issue can he tell the house what conversation he be have with his welsh counterpart to improve cancer care there 
 i be also concerned that last month the government appear to quietly abandon the target of ensure that patient receive treatment a maximum of day from an urgent referral of suspect cancer despite the health secretary have say before the election that a labour government would meet that target within the term will the minister clarify his commitment to the day target 
 more scanner be of course welcome but what be the government do to ensure that there be enough train professional to interpret the result of the scan effectively 
 with charity such as macmillan and marie curie be hit with devastating increase in national insurance contribution what help will be provide so that they do not have to cut back the vital support and guidance service they provide to cancer patient 
 anyone who have face cancer will know that time be of the essence the half of the year if it be not until december could be quite a long time from now will the minister therefore be more clear about when he intend to publish the plan may i recommend use the evidence collect in our call for evidence as well as the policy of the interim major condition strategy publish in to speed up the plan the quick the government act the more life they will be able to save 
 i start by genuinely thank the shadow minister for the co operation she have pledge as we seek to improve the outcome for people with cancer this be not a party political issue we all want people to be diagnose more quickly and to be put on the effective treatment pathway as quickly as possible and we all want people to have well outcome i would just remind she however that while progress be make over the past decade as i refer to in the statement lord darzi clearly set out that the rate of progress be much slow than in comparator country and that we could and should have be on a much well trajectory 
 that be why we be committed to a new national cancer plan something for which the sector have be call for some time we be go to consult on that plan i hope the shadow minister be not suggest that we should just pull a plan out of thin air without any consultation with the sector patient or anybody with any interest in cancer 
 of course thing have change over recent year new technology have advance and scientific progress be advance although there be still some area where stubbornly there be not enough research we need to build up the case for research and get the funding in   i think especially of brain tumour where quite frankly thing have not progress at all we need to ensure that in the year cancer plan we really drive forward in some of those area use the late technology and scientific advance 
 the shadow minister ask about target i just say to she that we have actually strengthen target rather than set new one for cancer currently the nhs be on track to deliver against its cancer target for this year yes we should be ambitious where we can and that be exactly what this labour government be go to do 
 i be delighted to announce to the house that we will be open a drug trial for glioblastoma brain tumour in may in memory of my late sister margaret hon member hear hear but for how long will progress on this depend on people bake cake run marathon and organise dinner when will the nhs and the national institute for health and care research get their act together and do something for the people who will be diagnose with this dreadful illness this year 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for her question those of we who know margaret miss she very much she be such a tower figure in the labour party for so many year and we on the labour benches have a lot to thank she and indeed my hon friend for 
 my hon friend be absolutely right on research this be area where quite frankly we have not do well enough we have not make any progress i know she will continue to champion more research with our new national cancer plan i hope that she will be push on an open door because this be area we absolutely have to do much well in 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 nearly every family have a cancer story whether it be a personal fight or that of a love a year plan from the government be a welcome step as the previous government break their promise to implement a year cancer strategy that would have make a real difference to patient we on the liberal democrat benches be very proud that our cancer campaigner my hon friend   the member for wokingham clive jones secure from the government a commitment to introduce such a plan 
 testing for cancer diagnose and start treatment quickly reduce stress and anxiety also if the cancer be catch early it be more likely to be treat successfully yet the target of of people receive their diagnosis and start treatment within day of an urgent referral have not be meet since december in my constituency of case fall short of that target and family lose a love every year to this cruel disease 
 lord darzi ’s review lay out very clearly that the uk have appreciably high cancer mortality rate than other country and that more than of patient be wait long than day for radical radiotherapy a quarter of england ’s radiotherapy machine be now operate   beyond their recommend year lifespan and in some area such as west sussex there be no access to radiotherapy at all that be why we welcome the £ investment announce in october to start to replace the old radiotherapy machine 
 will the minister confirm whether there will be further round of funding to keep pace with available radiotherapy technology will he look to support those at the mercy of a postcode lottery by ensure that radiotherapy be available in all area what be the expect timeline for reverse the damage do by the previous government and when can all patient expect to start their treatment within the day urgent referral target 
 reason we think a national cancer plan be so important be precisely to get the investment in the area we need so that we can tackle those health inequality there be very real inequality when it come to the diagnosis of cancer and more importantly the treatment and therefore the outcome i be really keen that we focus on that in the plan to ensure that all part of the country achieve the good outcome for people who have be diagnose with cancer 
 part of the plan be the roll out of community diagnostic centre so that we can get diagnosis much early that then put great pressure on get people through the front door for treatment so that be why as part of the recovery plan that the prime minister and the health secretary announce we be seek to get more people treat more quickly on those treatment pathway hopefully that will get the desire outcome we want it be a commitment that we will seek to restore the national health service to its constitutional standard that be a priority of this government 
 on radiotherapy machine the £ investment will fund about or so machine the criterion for evaluate bid be the age of the machine the proportion of machine age over year and the performance against the day standard for radiotherapy with poor performer prioritise on future round of funding the cancer plan will feed into spending review and future budgets it be our priority to ensure that we reach the cancer target so hopefully we can make the case to the treasury for future investment in further year 
 as someone who lose his wife to cancer i know the dire circumstance that a cancer diagnosis can bring it be right that cancer plan should focus on the good outcome improve the amount of time that people live for or have a cure i would like to raise with the minister the specific issue of pain relief management as part of the plan will he ensure that there be an investigation into how pain relief management can be improve for cancer patient and that it be give not just during the week but at weekend too 
 absolutely my hon friend raise a really important point about how people receive pain relief and how that be manage there be some really good example out there of how it be do really well and shockingly there be some that be less good we want to learn from the good as my right hon friend the   secretary of state say it be about take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs absolutely that should form part of the plan 
 like many people in this house i have see up close and personal the devastating impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on people and family i have also see the difference between an early diagnosis and a later diagnosis which be why i very much welcome the use of ai in early diagnosis positive by product of have a long stand national health service be that we have in the uk a very large database of historical tissue sample will the minister consider use ai to do a retrospective analysis of those historical tissue sample to try to spot pattern that could inform future speedy diagnosis across a whole range of cancer 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that suggestion and will ask my official to look into it i be very keen that we maximise the late advance in technology genomic life science and research to ensure that we identify people who be at risk of cancer preferably before they develop cancer so that we can get they on appropriate treatment where necessary and they avoid the pain and misery that cancer can bring 
 on this world cancer day will my hon friend the public health minister tell i what effort he be make to raise awareness of the sign and symptom of ovarian cancer such as a bloated tummy lack of appetite or feel full tummy pain or need to pee more often in order to increase lifesave early diagnosis 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for all the work that she have do on ovarian cancer since become an mp she know the rest of the house might not that i lose my mum to ovarian cancer i be when my mum die and she be only my age today she have a late diagnosis they basically open she up to perform a hysterectomy and the cancer have spread all the way through her body they sew she back up and she die at the end of a hospital ward day later in pain and agony have awareness of those symptom be so important my mum be fob off by her gp because she work in a shop and lift box she have a bad back and be bloated and so on the gp say it be down to her work rather than err on the side of caution and get she check out we must ensure that woman today be hear by gps and more importantly that we err on the side of caution and get people on to treatment 
 the minister be absolutely right to focus on this i warmly welcome the reinstatement of the child and young people ’s cancer taskforce i take this opportunity to pay tribute to my constituent charlotte fairall who be pivotal in the work to bring the taskforce together in the place charlotte ’s daughter sophie die of rhabdomyosarcoma when she be just year old i know the minister meet charlotte to discuss this issue unfortunately sophie be not alone around child and young people die of cancer every year in the uk it   be the big cause of death by illness of child under the age of sophie have a wish list of thing that she want to achieve before she die include cook with gordon ramsay and wear high heeled shoe but she also want to meaningfully change the way we detect treat and care for child with cancer do the minister agree that the taskforce be a great step in that direction 
 it absolutely be and i thank the hon lady for agree to co chair the re formed taskforce i know that she care passionately about this issue and it be lovely to meet charlotte some time before christmas 
 cancer be terrible and cancer affect child even more so as the hon lady know we pause the taskforce because the general election get in the way we want to carry out a real time stocktake to establish whether we need all these different taskforce but along with charlotte she convince i and convince the secretary of state that the work of this taskforce will be crucial to inform our national cancer plan and i wish she all the good in secure the outcome that both she and i want to see 
 do the minister agree that the move from analogue to digital will be key to cancer research especially in the field of rare cancer such as the brain tumour that we have be hear about 
 i absolutely do that shift to analogue to digital and the use of the late advantage in technology science and research will push the boundary of what be possible when it come to diagnose and treat some of the rarer cancer on which we have make virtually progress in recent year i think that with the right direction the right commitment and the right drive we can really start to make inroad in this area 
 may i invite the minister and indeed everyone here to join we in room m after these exchange when radiotherapy uk will have a drop in session with most important our patron bryan robson england ’s captain fantastic i thank he for mention radiotherapy in his statement which be crucial step forward but may i suggest that he and the government need to show exponentially great ambition to get this right the uk spend of its cancer budget on radiotherapy while the oecd average be which be why the uk be at the bottom of the survival league for so many cancer will the minister commit himself to put that right 
 i be not sure that i will be able to attend the hon gentleman ’s meeting but i will certainly be in westminster hall for his debate later this afternoon i understand exactly the concern of people who be champion the need for increase access to radiotherapy treatment my dad benefit from radiotherapy at the christie which probably give he an extra couple of year of life with his family i will be forever grateful for that i get it i understand it we need to make the case 
 i thank the minister for his welcome statement and join he in thank all the organisation that do the vital work of   help and support those with cancer and their family he be right to talk about health inequality which as he will know continue to worsen in constituency such as mine where on average people live year less than other in more affluent area and last year more than be wait for diagnostic test will he join i in commend the work of eccleshill community diagnostic centre in bradford essential and the of its kind which be speed up the detection of life threaten condition such as cancer and will he assure i that as part of his national action plan more support will be give to place such as bradford and the eccleshill community diagnostic centre so that no be leave behind when it come to their treatment 
 as my hon friend say tackle health inequality be a key priority for this government in relation to our health mission but also more generally when it come to some of the big condition such as cancer in area such as his and mine the prevalence of cancer be great because of the industrial legacy and also because the prevalence of smoking be still much high than the national average i commend the work of his local diagnostic team and we need much more of that good practice to be spread across the area that need it the most 
 i welcome the minister 's statement he will be aware that a routine prostate cancer screening programme would save many life can he give any indication of when it will be introduce 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for that question and also for the write parliamentary question about prostate cancer that he and a number of other member have table accord to the current guidance screen for prostate cancer be not recommend in the uk because of the inaccuracy of the current good test for prostate specific antigen indeed it could actually harm man as some might be diagnose with a cancer that would not have cause they problem during their life however i be look at this carefully and i know that further information have go to the national institute for health and care research so that it can perhaps reach a different conclusion obviously as technology and other mechanism advance this may well be an area where we can make inroad but i be happy to work with the hon gentleman to ensure that every opportunity be meet 
 i welcome this plan i note that it be a recommendation from the health and social care committee in the last parliament and as a member of that committee i hope that it set a precedent 
 week ago i lose my brother alex english to high grade acinic cell carcinoma while i pay tribute to all those who give he care can the minister confirm that we will look at rare cancer and make sure that we research some of they and find treatment 
 may i send my condolence to my hon friend and his family on the loss of his brother alex 
 of course rare cancer be important and they be a crucial part of what will be in the national cancer plan it be in these area that we must focus our effort on diagnosis treatment and more importantly get the research do so that we can find way of tackle some of the very rare but deadly cancer that affect many family include my hon friend ’s 
 in the number of breast cancer case in woman under top for the time but routine breast cancer screening be give only to woman age and over will the department review that and ensure that when appropriate initial appointment can be give to young woman while i be at it although the minister might not have time to attend may i invite everyone else to swing by my drop in event this afternoon to discuss local health inequality in breast cancer 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for the work that she do in this regard the decision on whom to screen be make by the uk national screening committee and their advice come to ministers but i be aware of the case that she have make screen woman early for breast cancer should perhaps be look at and i will ensure that my official look into whether we can make some progress on that for she 
 rise 
 order i know that some of these contribution be quite emotional and if people need to leave the chamber after they have speak that be okay by i 
 ethan be just and study for his gcse when he be diagnose with a brain tumour sadly he pass away year later i have the privilege of meet his mum nikki this weekend at event organise to raise money for brain tumour research in ethan ’s memory will the minister commit himself to improve outcome for people with brain tumour through the national cancer plan 
 through my hon friend i would like to pass my condolence on to nikki for the loss of ethan as i have say we have not make anything like the progress we would want to make on treatment and survival rate for brain tumour that will form an integral part of our national cancer plan and we will utilise all the late advance in technology and science to try to get the well outcome that we so desperately want 
 i genuinely welcome the minister ’s commitment to the upgrading of radiotherapy machine but i share the concern of the chairman of the all party parliamentary group on radiotherapy   the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron about the scale of the ambition in defeat this horrible disease technology and innovation be our friend what be the minister ’s ambition for minimally invasive cancer therapy in the national cancer plan these technology be come along every day but awareness of they and the ability to get they roll out on the frontline be slapdash at well will he commit to look at those emerge therapy and get they roll out as soon as possible
