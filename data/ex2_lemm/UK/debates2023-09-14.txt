i wish to inform the house that i have receive a letter from   the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood   inform i of his resignation as chair of the defence committee i therefore declare the chair vacant i will announce the arrangement for the election of a new chair in due course 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of her department ’s implementation of policy support level up 
 i warmly welcome the new shadow ministerial team it be a slimme down team from what we have be use to but i welcome they all my department be focus on grow the economy by attract global investment promote export and create the right regulatory business environment over the past year we have support more than foreign direct investment project create more than new job across the uk just last week the department for business and trade support stellantis ’s £ investment in an electric vehicle production plant in ellesmere port show the direct role we play in help to level up across the region and nation of the uk 
 like many hon member during the recess i visit various site in my constituency include langthwaite business park which be an immensely successful business park with more than business now employ almost people it be adjacent to former pit village south elmsall and south kirkby where deprivation be still deeply rooted the people who live in those village be not able to take advantage of the job create by wakefield council mohan de silva and karen harrison what government programme have the secretary of state put in place or can she put in place to ensure there be a linkage between area of deprivation and   new job 
 i think you need an adjournment debate 
 there be a lot that we be do and i be sorry to hear that the hon gentleman feel that village in his constituency still be not able to access much of what we have give the west yorkshire devolution deal provide about £ of investment and we also have a share prosperity fund across west yorkshire i urge he to speak to his local council because that be the vehicle through which many of these opportunity will be provide but if he have a specific business issue that he think be affect those company and those village we be happy to look at it in more detail 
 i call the shadow minister 
 my home city of manchester be build on export and trade but as a result of the tories mismanagement of the economy apathy towards the export industry and neglect of everywhere outside the m25 the value of export from london be more than time that of the north west do the secretary of state honestly believe that she and her colleague be commit to level up the whole of the uk or will she admit that the tories do not care about the benefit of trade reach everyone in the united kingdom 
 i fundamentally disagree with the hon gentleman he mention manchester since october we have invest £ into project across england and agree landmark devolution deal for greater manchester he should be speak to the mayor of greater manchester to find out exactly why all that we be do be not reach the people in his constituency 
 what step her department be take to support the steel industry 
 i be in constant conversation with specific company to do with steel include british steel in my hon friend ’s constituency but of course those conversation be often commercially sensitive i be delighted to speak at the event she host in parliament to celebrate the launch of the government ’s update steel procurement policy note which will help to make opportunity more visible and maintain a level playing field for uk steel producer in the financial year relevant public procurer buy around £ worth of uk produce steel furthermore the government have provide around £ in energy cost relief to the sector since 
 can my hon friend set out specifically what be be do to ensure the continued production of virgin steel in the uk 
 steel be vital to the uk but we know that the industry need to decarbonise for a sustainable future the paris agreement make it clear that the sector have to reduce its global emission by by the government be actively engage with the sector on   how good to achieve that but decarbonisation pathway for specific site will be commercial decision for individual company industrial sector include steel company can bid into government fund worth hundred of million of pound to help they go green as i mention we have do a huge amount to support energy intensive industry 
 the uk be the only major steel produce nation where production be fall but the minister and her colleague have be tell we for month that they can not guarantee the use of uk make steel in government contract especially in the military the thing be that the steel producer say that they can make whatever their customer ask by change the production line will the minister confirm that the reason we have a problem with steel in this country be the government ’s refusal to view it as a strategically important industry the conservatives stick plaster politic have fail steelworker as we have see at port talbot 
 i fundamentally disagree with the question well it be more of a statement i make it clear when i take on this role that we would assess the level of steel in procurement contract and we have put together the steel procurement policy note which will address how much steel be be procure in our contract in the uk we be do a huge amount to ensure that the different type of steel that be need be produce we know how valuable the sector be which be why we provide support with high energy cost and why we have a decarbonisation budget that the industry can link into i fundamentally disagree with the hon gentleman ’s proposition 
 i call shadow minister sarah jones and welcome she to her new position 
 in wales it be report that this government will spend half a pound to make thousand of port talbot steelworker redundant head north to derby to a train assembly plant where thousand more job be under threat because this government bungle high speed head around the uk coastline and the government have manage to misjudge industry so much that they secure offshore wind contract that be a uk tour of almighty conservative incompetence labour will harness this country ’s talent will the minister explain how many job the government be lose we at tata steel how many job they be lose we in derby how many job they be lose we in offshore wind and why they be so intent on level down our great british industry 
 i welcome the hon member to her post but i suggest that lead on story in the paper be not a good way forward that be all speculation we do not comment on commercial decision the reality be that there be £ in support with energy cost and more than £ of support with decarbonisation she talk about plan well i be not sure if the labour party ’s plan stand for anything because it flip flop so often it be not just i who say that let we reflect on a statement make by a union leader they say that labour be not only just an 80 tribute act but that it tend to sit on a wobbly fence who know what labour will say tomorrow after a statement make today 
 what step her department be take to support the shipbuilding sector 
 my hon friend ask a timely question because this be london international shipping week and i have engage with the uk chamber of shipping and maritime uk this week i be at the international maritime organisation which be host an exhibition call rewrite woman into maritime history sponsor by the lloyd ’s register foundation i mention in particular nicola good and erne janine who make i this scarf reflect on woman in maritime we be do a huge amount include launch the shipbuilding credit guarantee scheme to support our shipyard here in the uk 
 i be most grateful to my hon friend for that answer the disappointing outcome of last week ’s contract for difference auction in respect of offshore wind be a wake up call that clear strategy be require if we be to retain our position as a global leader in that industry that include support for the supply chain of which service operation vessel be a vital component can she confirm that the national shipbuilding strategy will be review to fully take into account this great opportunity 
 we be proud of the uk ’s reputation as a leader in the offshore wind sector together with industry we have deliver the large operational wind farm in the world the national shipbuilding office have do a huge amount of work in that area and will do even more with the new shipbuilding guarantee scheme i think my hon friend ’s other question relate to the department for energy security and net this be london international shipping week and our offshore wind farm and all our vessel be be promote heavily 
 may i draw the minister ’s attention to the fact that the fleet solid support vessel for the royal navy be massive equivalent to aircraft carrier have she discuss with the ministry of defence why they will be build mostly in spanish shipyard rather than in british shipyard by british worker to sustain our shipbuilding industry do she know of any other shipbuilding country that behave like this 
 i have indeed discuss it with the ministry of defence and the national shipbuilding office we want to make sure not only that the contract for the work be manage here in the uk but that we be use uk steel 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase international investment in northern ireland 
 just yesterday i be in belfast where my department deliver the northern ireland investment   summit in partnership with the northern ireland office and invest northern ireland i would like to take the opportunity to thank the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities and for northern ireland for their support in make it a success delegate include investor from country around the world attend to see at hand the unique opportunity for inward investment in northern ireland across a range of sector include life science and advanced manufacturing 
 what consideration have my right hon friend give to create an investment zone that cover the whole of northern ireland to bring much need investment to that much loved part of the united kingdom 
 it be a very interesting idea investment zone policy be own by the department for levelling up housing and communities so i will raise it with the secretary of state there and the secretary of state for northern ireland official from the uk government and the northern ireland civil service continue to work closely to explore develop investment zone policy in the country the lack of a function executive there have of course limit the scope and nature of engagement on investment zone if the executive be restore we will work together to progress an investment zone at pace and if it be not form we will set out different plan in due course 
 i thank the secretary of state and the government for the investment conference they hold in belfast over the last day it clearly show a commitment to northern ireland and i be very pleased to see that when it come to international investment we be happy to see in northern ireland that harland wolff which have specialise in ship repair and shipbuilde for some year have recruit almost people in the last few month what discussion have the secretary of state have with the relevant department back home to ensure that northern ireland can play its part in the uk shipbuilding industry and therefore benefit from that investment 
 the hon gentleman be quite right this be an area where northern ireland have a comparative advantage as we host the summit we all look out on the dock and we could see that shipbuilding be integral to the country uk export finance be support many of the company that build ship and want to export this magnificent uk product all across the world my hon friend the minister for industry and economic security speak about the uk shipbuilding guarantee we have be talk about this all week maritime investment be key and if the hon gentleman would like further detail on what we be do that have an impact on his constituency we can provide he with that information 
 i welcome the shadow minister to her new position 
 thank you mr speaker business investment be low in the uk than in any other g7 country and we rank out of oecd country ahead of only poland luxembourg and greece more than half a pound worth of   under investment by government and business have leave our economy trap in a growth doom loop what be the secretary of state do to undo this damage 
 what the hon lady do not say be that business investment be increase at a fast rate than in other country she be right that investment have be low here but that be why the chancellor bring in policy such as full expensing to tackle this issue she also do not mention the fact that we be the top destination for investment across financial service and many other area the uk be actually do very well when it come to inward investment and we will continue to create policy that ensure we stay at the top of the pack 
 what recent progress she have make on regulatory reform 
 my department be make it easy to do business every single day our smart regulation programme which include implementation of the reform recommend in the report by the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform co author by my right hon friend   the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers be reduce regulatory burden for business and reduce cost for consumer we have announce reform to employment law wine regulation and product safety regulation and further reform will be announce soon 
 i thank the minister for his answer but can we have more urgency across departments on regulatory reform use our brexit freedom to modernise our regulation be a key way to grow the economy and raise living standard so can we see more progress on reform regulation in area such as personal datum clinical trial agri tech and satellite 
 my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet be absolutely right to push we on this issue we be work across government to implement reform so far we have deliver of the recommendation identify in the tigrr report in area such as offshore wind and reform to the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency delivery of a further be ongoing in high profile area such as artificial intelligence reform ease clinical trial pension the ability to invest in venture capital the general data protection regulation and the seed enterprise investment scheme all of which be save business billion of pound my right hon friend the secretary of state will shortly write to my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet to confirm all those point 
 what step her department be take to support business export 
 what step her department be take to support business export 
 what step her department be take to support business export 
 business be at the heart of the government ’s export strategy make in the uk sell to the world and of our share ambition to reach £ in annual export by in the past year the uk have become the large exporter of good and service in the world just last week i personally lead a delegation of business to the seas summit in romania connect with over representative to help secure contract work and export opportunity in the region ’s member state 
 in my constituency company such as eyeol lindal valve peli biothermal friction and signature flatbread all export globally along with small business that export through amazon yet apparently only of company export what more can we do to get business to export not just to europe but globally apparently business that export pay high wage so this be part of level up too 
 my hon friend be a great champion for his business and help they to export he be absolutely right that free trade agreement and memorandum of understanding be open up new market for we but of course we want to make sure that everyone make the most of those opportunity that be why we be ensure that uk exporter have the skill they need through our innovative export academy the information they need to capitalise on new deal through the fta utilisation strategy the advice they need through the export support service and the financial backing they need through uk export finance my hon friend also make the very powerful point that company that export pay high wage 
 anglesey ’s freeport be a fantastic opportunity to boost the economic prosperity of my constituency of ynys môn work with the institute of export and international trade bangor university and grŵp llandrillo menai our anglesey freeport be set to create the welsh trade centre of excellence do the minister agree that that trade centre be central to local people have the skill to take advantage of the high skill high wage employment opportunity that the freeport will deliver and that it will be the start of anglesey ’s economic renaissance 
 i think we can all agree that my hon friend have campaign powerfully to secure that freeport and the opportunity it will create for many of her constituent good news be already come in with westinghouse say that it will headquarter there create job and opportunity of course we be look forward to get more detail and ensure that the trade centre for excellence be locate there too which will provide another win for my hon friend 
 i run export programme in my business career before come to this place and i always talk to the company i meet about whether they be export and what more can be do 
 rise 
 steady i have n’t ask my question yet the message from that experience be that perceive barrier can deter activity perhaps perceive risk or complexity what more can be do to link potential exporter with mentor who can share their experience overcome those perception and get more company export 
 my hon friend have a huge amount of experience in this area and i be very grateful for all the advice he provide he make a very good point that be why our campaign make in the uk sell to the world use localise marketing for small business across the country to help they make the good of their ability to my hon friend ’s point we have a grow cohort of over successful champion across the uk entrepreneur and business leader who can share their experience and inspire new firm to become exporter 
 new analysis from the house of commons library that i be publish today show that since our trade with dictatorship have grow by over £ and that it be grow twice as fast as our trade with the free world trade dependence on dictatorship be a risk so when will the minister set out a plan to define and de risk our critical supply chain and begin grow our trade with nation that be free 
 i be responsible for supply chain and critical mineral too several month ago i refresh our critical mineral strategy we be look at how we ensure that we be build resilience and ensure that our supply chain be stable 
 i be also work with a number of industry representative to put in place an import supply chain strategy as well we know that there be kink in supply chain and that there be issue of economic coercion around the world we want to ensure that we have stable supply chain to protect our advanced manufacturing sector interruption from a sedentary position my right hon friend the secretary of state point out that i be also the sanction minister we be ensure that that work be now co ordinated not only across whitehall but internationally 
 those of we on the business and trade committee be very much aware of the sterling work do by official in furtherance of the trade deal with india however in the revelation at the g20 summit of the partnership for global infrastructure investment the counter to china ’s belt and road project through a us back trade corridor to speed up link between europe the middle east and india there be no mention of the uk do our government decline to be involve or be we not invite 
 i be in front of the select committee that session would have be afterwards i have just be inform that the prime minister be very much focused on secure a trade deal and on the other detail that the hon gentleman raise because it be a select committee issue i will make sure that he get all the detail in writing 
 during the recess i visit heathcoat fabrics an innovative export business in tiverton its achievement include sell to nasa a device that help land the mars rover on the surface of mars early this year hmrc reject heathcoat ’s research and development claim without so much as a meeting will the minister talk with colleague at the treasury to establish why heathcoat fabrics and other innovative export business be have r&d claim reject this year 
 i say simply that yes i will 
 we now come to the shadow minister 
 accord to the international monetary fund british export to france and germany since be down by to france and to germany us export to both be up by canada ’s be up by and italy ’s be up by minister will not back an industrial strategy have cut funding to get business to trade show and will not negotiate a veterinary agreement why do this minister think that everyone else have get so much well recently at sell thing to our near neighbour 
 member choose which number they want to throw out but those do not necessarily reflect reality i think it be fantastic that we be now the large manufacturer in the world i believe that we leap frog france leap frog the french be always good to get on the record 
 actually export be most definitely up in the month to june uk export rise by £ an increase of once adjust for inflation in the same period good export reach £ an increase when adjust for inflation perhaps we should reflect on the opportunity for all the business in our constituency 
 what recent discussion she have have with a ngos and b charity on the inclusion of human right consideration in trade negotiation 
 the government be commit to universal human right the rule of law free speech and fairness those value guide all aspect of our international policy include our approach to trade 
 as trade talk continue with many country that have deplorable human right record and as discussion continue with india will the minister ensure that we receive bind commitment on human right particularly in relation to labour practice rather than simply warm word and that discussion continue with ngos which be well place and often well place than the foreign commonwealth and development office on what be go on 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question the uk will continue to show global leadership in encourage all state to uphold international human   right obligation and to hold those who violate or abuse human right to account the uk have successfully include labour environment and gender provision in the free trade agreement that we have sign with australia and new zealand for example those both contain dedicated chapter on trade gender equality labour and the environment they uphold human right but crucially also level the play field for our uk business 
 what recent assessment she have make of the impact of her trade policy on the cost of food 
 food price be drive by many pressure include the global economic climate we recognise the important role that trade can play in improve food security through diversification of supply chain our programme of free trade agreement be secure access to global supply chain remove barrier and lower cost for trader furthermore in of agricultural and food import enter the uk tariff free by deliver trade deal and work with international partner we be ensure that british consumer have access to good quality and good value food 
 will the minister explain how the government ’s plan for a £ inspection fee on each consignment of food import from the european union represent barrier free trade can she tell small food retailer restaurant and their customer in glasgow north when or whether they will have to pay this brexit tax and the high price it will lead to can she also remind the house whether high food price as a result of brexit be part of the leave campaign prospectus 
 i know the hon member want to put all these anxiety on brexit and forget about all the opportunity we be secure with trade agreement around the world the issue he raise fundamentally sit at the doorstep of the cabinet office and the department for environment food and rural affairs and we be work very closely with they to resolve it 
 i call the scottish national party spokes- person 
 as if the future stoke of inflation through extra brexit red tape be not bad enough business be already have to cope with uncertainty the lack of a level playing field and the threat to our own food safety and security through the failure to introduce check of our own give that ministers be say as recently as april that those check will begin on   march can the minister explain how business be expect to get to grip with all this turmoil in government policy give their tendency to keep kick the can down the road over border check 
 food inflation be a global issue it be not a problem just here in the uk many factor influence food price globally notably energy cost global wholesale food price have be fall since march and sometimes   that can take time to reach consumer in july uk food inflation be just over down from the hon gentleman do not specify which issue he be touch on but if it be to do with sanitary and phytosanitary control for good from the eu that will be introduce and in place by   january 
 the government could stop make exist global problem even bad when they apply to the uk i be follow up on the question from my hon friend   the member for glasgow north patrick grady   about the cost of check on import food but the only thing bad than bad border check be no border check at all we be no long impose sps check on food come in from the eu be the minister proud that under the guise of take back control she be part of a government who have give away control instead 
 i reference in my previous response the sps control they be not in place when we be in the eu so i be not sure exactly what the hon gentleman ’s anxiety be 
 what plan she have for accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership 
 i sign the uk ’s accession protocol to the cptpp in new zealand in july we be now take the necessary step to ratify our accession agreement at the early opportunity we expect it to enter into force in the half of next year 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response the cptpp contain investor state dispute settlement provision which allow corporation as she know to sue national government through a largely secretive parallel legal system if they consider that government policy threaten their future profit of the new agreement member state canadian country have use the isds particularly aggressively bring case the majority of which have be bring by mining and fossil fuel firm against the energy and environmental policy of various government will the government consider negotiate a side letter with canada as they already have with new zealand and australia to disapply the isds provision in order to ensure the uk government ’s right to regulate be not constrain by powerful investor and corporation 
 we have pass the stage where we will be make any change we be now try to ratify the protocol but the right hon gentleman should be reassure the government have always be clear that when we negotiate investment protection we do so in a way that do not hinder our right to regulate in the public interest the uk already have investment agreement contain isds provision with of the cptpp country and we have never receive a successful claim from any investor of cptpp country or in fact investor of any other country with which we have isds commitment 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on the progress make with cptpp can she outline what plan the department have to make uk company aware of the opportunity that the agreement open up for they 
 my hon friend raise an important point because most of the time people ask i what cptpp stand for let alone what it be and how they can use it—[interruption well not my hon friend   the member for lichfield michael fabricant we would like to make sure that people be aware of it so they can utilise this free trade agreement as soon as it be on our statute book and ratify across the country that be something that our export commission and support service in the department for business and trade will be carry out and we will also be support mp in their constituency during international trade week to highlight opportunity that come from all our free trade agreement 
 what step her department be take to support business export to the us 
 interruption pardon i for there be a technical failure the us be our large trading partner with trade reach more than £ we have already succeed in agree a solution to the section tariff on uk steel and aluminium and remove the long stand us ban on uk lamb in fact just yesterday i be speak to president biden ’s special envoy joe kennedy about how we can increase trade and investment in northern ireland we also have an sme dialogue next month between our country support uk and us business to find export opportunity in each other ’s market 
 that be really good news actually in other good news i learn this morning that britain have overtake france as a manufacturing country in order to take full advantage of that how can we use the trade representative in the united states at our embassy and our consulate even more to encourage bilateral trade 
 my hon friend be right we have trade ambassador and trade envoy work to ensure that we be fully utilise the opportunity that exist across our relationship with the us in fact our envoy to the us have be help and support with a memorandum of understanding with florida which we be hop to conclude shortly if there be specific thing he think we can do to assist i would be happy to meet he and organise even more engagement that will help facilitate uk us trade 
 what step she be take to increase trade with european country 
 europe remain a vital destination for british export uk business export more than   £ in the year to march up in current price on the previous year we be engage extensively with key european partner this weekend my right hon friend the trade secretary will attend the annual uk italy bilateral conference to advance the landmark ministerial dialogue on export and investment promotion launch in february the agree between the uk and any eu country 
 here be an issue that could be discuss at that meeting the youth group travel sector be worth £ to the uk economy but that way trade have collapse since brexit the prime minister make a vague commitment in march that there would be an agreement for french school group to visit the uk we have hear no more detail and anyway we need a wide agreement to include other country when will the government sort out this problem 
 i think this matter sit not just with our department but with the department for education if the hon gentleman will allow i will write to he formally and make sure he get an update on this issue 
 whether she have have recent discussion with a cabinet colleague and b the scottish government on support for scotland ’s hospitality sector 
 as the hon member will be aware hospitality support be devolve we continue to provide energy support via the energy bill discount scheme benefit hospitality business across the uk i would be happy to meet she and any of her colleague to see how we can help hospitality business across the whole uk 
 that be excellent to hear because the hospitality sector play a crucial role in scotland ’s economy but it have consistently be let down by the uk government who repeatedly fail to support the industry with the unique challenge it face business across scotland be grapple with inflationary pressure labour and skill shortage and the ever increase complexity of trading rule with country we once trade with freely why will the minister not accept that brexit lie at the heart of these problem 
 if the hon lady look again she will find that the scottish government lie at the heart of these problem in england all eligible business can get relief on their rate subject to a cap of £ while in scotland rate relief be available only to small business and could be as low as between and for individual property with rateable value from £ there be far more support available for english business than for scottish business i think she should go back and look again at the fact 
 whether she have have discussion with courier service on delivery to isolated rural area 
 i appreciate the hon member ’s interest in ensure a fair deal for his constituent the government ’s universal service obligation on royal mail guarantee delivery of parcel at uniform rate throughout the uk without any geographical restriction where other courier business decide to serve should be a commercial decision for they 
 a constituent who visit my surgery recently complain that courier service in particular would not deliver to his isolated rural property the choice of courier be of course currently a matter for retailer do the government agree though that there be a case for say that large retailer could offer the consumer the choice of which courier service should be use that would empower consumer and hopefully improve performance via competition 
 the hon member raise a very important point competition play a role in this of course it be absolutely right that retail business should look at this and try to get the low cost for their customer in term of courier charge it be as he acknowledge a commercial decision for individual retailer but i absolutely applaud the point he raise these business should be aware of those cost because they can add significantly to the cost of the product they be sell 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the windows update be now complete at the dispatch box mr speaker 
 as secretary of state for business and trade my priority be to support inward investment into all region and nation of the uk this week the department for business and trade in partnership with the northern ireland office and invest northern ireland deliver the investment summit which i refer to early this momentous event showcase to more than international investor the wealth of opportunity and talent that exist across the breadth of northern ireland a young and talented workforce competitive operating cost and unparalleled access to global economy make it an exceptional place to grow a successful business i meet representative from us own aerospace manufacturer spirit and several financial service company that have establish a base there from derry londonderry base tech firm to belfast bud creative company we boast a thriving ecosystem of world class business across numerous sector 
 this weekend like most weekend i will visit wilko in newcastle city centre should i explain to the fantastic staff there and their appreciative customer that mass redundancy and empty shopfront be what the conservatives mean by level up 
 we be all very sad that a well know business such as wilko with a strong presence on many high street across our constituency have have to enter administration and my thought be with employee   who have be make redundant our department have be not just support the business but discuss the good way forward with union we have be support by help to find bidder the fact be that sometimes these thing do happen it be not a reflection of the government in fact make sure that people have somewhere to go to be how this government be provide support 
 do minister agree that delegate to the parliamentary partnership assembly which be set up under the trade and co operation agreement with the eu should be there to promote britain ’s interest overseas and that those who do not want to do so and who simply want to be apologist for brexit and to act against the uk ’s interest should leave the ppa 
 my right hon friend raise an important point the parliamentary partnership assembly create under the trade and co operation agreement be a parliamentary body independent of government the government value its work and its role support a mature and constructive relationship with the eu root in share value and deliver on share interest she be right that we should look forward not backwards 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the loss of wilko be a significant blow to the nation ’s high street however more concern be that no rescue have prove possible because several bidder have say that town centre retail be no long a viable business model in the light of that do the government really believe that their current policy environment be sufficient for british high street to thrive 
 we be very concerned for the family affect by wilko ’s demise the world of retail be a very competitive marketplace i do not accept the hon gentleman ’s premise that the high street be dead not at all it be reshape itself and while it do so we will help it such as with the £ of rate relief over the next year 
 minister answer do not match the scale of the problem wilko worker alone be at risk of redundancy labour ’s plan for the high street be about reform business rate tackle late payment crack down on antisocial behaviour and stop premise be leave empty with council have more power the problem demand a response from ministers base on their answer today this government have simply give up on the british high street 
 that be complete nonsense this week i meet helen dickenson from the retail sector council to discuss this matter closely there be certain situation in certain company of course i guard the hon gentleman against political opportunism on the back of those job many of which have be pick up by other retailer such as poundland in rescue of store on his point about business rate which i hear time and again all the labour party have   do be say that it will cancel £ of business rate without say how it will replace those taxation receipt where be the money come from 
 the secretary of state and the prime minister have both be in india recently and have the opportunity to negotiate far on the wonderful trade deal that we wish to do her predecessor but or promise a trade deal with india by diwali of course they do not mention which year diwali this year be later than normal what confidence do she have that we will have it in place by diwali this year 
 with a question that long we will be celebrate the next 
 my hon friend be keen for a deal by diwali but as the prime minister and i have be at pain to say it be about the deal not the day we be work as much as we can to get a deal but we will not do so by sacrifice british interest the deal have to work for both the uk and india i meet the indian commerce and finance ministers to ensure that we create a mutually beneficial deal 
 recent figure show that small business in the uk be owe more than £ in late payment when couple with a rise in energy cost and other inflationary pressure that i mention before that be make run small business in my constituency impossible on tuesday the eu set out its sme relief package which will help to tackle the problem what be the minister do to combat late payment for sme 
 the hon lady raise an important point that be why we launch a payment and cash flow review early this year which be due to report very shortly we be ambitious to make sure that small business get pay more quickly through put more pressure on large company the result of which will be announce very shortly 
 in august i be lucky to be invite to the anniversary of caterpillar be found in my constituency it be the place outside the us it set up a base in and it now employ people make thing such as the electric backhoe loader will my hon friend congratulate caterpillar on its investment here from where it export across the world would she like to come and see exactly what it do in bosworth 
 i join my hon friend a great champion of bosworth in congratulate caterpillar on year and employee that be fantastic i look forward to go along and have a go on the electric digger 
 the loss of wilko be devastating in particular for the thousand of worker who will lose their livelihood will the secretary of state confirm that she will seek answer from wilko management about why clear warning be ignore and the business be drive into the ground at the same time that shareholder collect   hundred of million in dividend will she meet i and the gmb trade union to assure we that those basic failure will not be repeat 
 the hon member raise an important point there be certainly as part of the administration process an obligation on the administrator to look at the circumstance that lead to the demise of that company and report to the insolvency service i be sure that she like i will be very interested in the outcome of that investigation 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group for event can i highlight the huge benefit the sector bring we in promote trade export and inward investment will the department do more to promote the uk worldwide as a great place to bring international event business meeting and conference

 that be an excellent question because it raise something fundamental the transition to net will change the nature of the uk supply chain and as i say early this week china pose a systemic challenge here the path to net create a risk of even great reliance on china especially when it come to the battery manufacturing need for emission vehicle we can not be naive about that that be why i be work hard to ensure not only that business competitiveness be at the heart of our transition but that british national interest come we can not depend on a single country we must protect our national security so we be work with like minded ally my hon friend the minister for industry and economic security have speak about our critical mineral strategy and we be work to diversify and build those supply chain that be what the atlantic declaration which i mention early be also about we be very aware of this point but i think it be important to reinforce it

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the flood in libya 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise this issue which i know be a source of concern across the house it be important that we discuss it today 
 the situation be very concerning and i send sincere condolence on behalf of the government to the people of libya i be sure that be true for everyone in the house on wednesday eastern administration official report that the death toll have rise to at least and newspaper report this morning suggest the number could reach 
 storm daniel hit libya on   sunday september   after cause flood and chaos in bulgaria greece and turkey and then early on monday morning dam burst which we know cause major flooding that submerge part of the city and wipe out entire neighbourhood the attempt to recover the situation have be make bad by a lack of road access and by communication channel be down we stand ready to help as good we can 
 the uk have commit to support libya follow these devastating flood and yesterday the foreign secretary announce an initial package worth up to £ to provide life save assistance to meet the immediate need of those most affect by the flood the un central emergency response fund to which the uk be the large donor have announce that it will deliver $ of support to libya we be also work with trust partner on the ground to identify the most urgent basic need include shelter healthcare and sanitation we stand ready to provide further support 
 the uk remain in close contact with authority across libya to help respond to this tragic crisis and lord ahmad the minister for the middle east and north africa have reiterate the uk ’s commitment to libya in a call with the chair of libya ’s presidential council un official have say that the western and eastern government be work together and communicate on this which will be important and we stand ready to help the people of libya in these very challenging time 
 the horror of the catastrophic flood in libya be hard to imagine love one sweep away within arm ’s reach drown in mud and crush under rubble the city of derna have be utterly devastate and as the minister say estimate now range above life lose the grief and worry of those with no knowledge of their love one fate must be simply unbearable our thought be with they and with all the people of libya 
 as the minister say assistance have struggle to reach the city and the scale of urgency of need be immense many area have reportedly receive no help and there be no hope of rescue for anyone leave alive trap under mud and rubble there be obviously a terrible threat from disease with authority lack enough body bag to cope with the scale of death 
 in the minister ’s estimation how many people be now lack shelter clean water and medical care i know the government be support the united nations central emergency response fund but be the minister confident that that will support co ordinated effort and reach those who be truly in dire need 
 surely the scale of this disaster be link to libya ’s many year of conflict and chaos political paralysis diplomatic failure and neglect we know that climate heating be make extreme weather such as storm daniel more intense we must help to prevent these horror where we can build resilience to a change climate and support libya on the path to stability and peace that will take strategic action on diplomacy security and development and we must make sure the humanitarian response which be desperately need right now be deliver 
 as usual the hon lady have make important point with her characteristic compassion and passion i reiterate that we share those sentiment and we be work hard to address the situation let i update the house by say that the un be currently finalise its need assessment and we hope to see that this afternoon the foreign secretary have already set out that we be ready to provide support and we have put some initial support on the table i reiterate to the hon lady and the house that we will continue to keep in close contact with the un and we be reiterate our support to it we will continue to monitor the situation on the ground and we stand ready to offer further assistance the point she make be crucial this support need to reach the people affect too often in various country there have be blockage in get support to the frontline i understand that the group in libya be work together or at least talk which be encouraging that be go to be crucial in make sure that there be a flow of fund and more importantly that support be provide on the ground she also talk about future support clearly we need to focus on the humanitarian issue right now but give the challenge of climate change there will be urgent need associate with infrastructure to address however that be for another day and i be sure we will continue that conversation 
 this be an awful situation and both front benchers have get it absolutely right issue be that libya be a country that have such an appalling history when we give money as a nation and as government we will have to be careful that the corrupt influence in that country do not siphon it off as it be mean for the people who have suffer so badly will the minister please assure the house that every effort will be make by his department and the government to ensure that that money go to the people who need it now and that we help to alleviate their suffering 
 my hon friend make important point which i hope be listen to by those involve in the situation in libya the support absolutely need to get to the frontline if nothing else we hope that this moment of severe crisis in that country will bring sometimes war faction and group who have different opinion together in common cause that be vital there come a point where human interest and humanitarian concern be the most important factor as be the case   right now 
 i call the scottish national party spoke person 
 of course we join both front benchers in send our deep condolence to the family of those who have lose love one in these devastating flood the scale of the destruction be utterly unimaginable and libya need international solidarity as it move from the search and rescue phase to the recovery phase as climate change bite hard and we see more fierce natural disaster it will so often be the case that those least able to cope with the effect of climate change be impact to the great extent so will the uk government invest much more in international loss and damage funding as the scottish government have champion worldwide of course we will support the government in any support they offer libya however give the drastic cut of in the international aid budget and the catastrophic impact it have have on our ability to be a global player and react to the need of country hit by climate change disaster such as we see in libya right now what more support can the libyans expect from the government 
 i thank the hon member for his support the action that be be take in the short term be the top priority right now he make important point about how we be work to affect those who be climate vulnerable we will continue to do that but i reassure he that in this moment in time we have find support we will continue to monitor the situation and we will provide whatever other support we need to provide our funding through the un be pivotal at this time 
 i thank my hon friend for the update clearly the most important thing right now be humanitarian aid but there will be a requirement for long term rebuilding of the structure that have be destroy the british people will want to be generous but as my hon friend   the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger   mention there be a risk that fund will be divert to improper us when a fund be set up to which the british people can contribute will my hon friend make sure that the british people know how to contribute to it and that it go to the people who need it 
 my hon friend make a good point which have be reiterate by other member the money need to get to the frontline we will do everything we can certainly with those fund provide by the uk government and through the un that will be a key focus the fact that so many colleague be raise the issue help we to make that point with conviction 
 on his wide point the primary focus right now be humanitarian need but go forward libya need to move down a pathway to free and fair election that will help the country in the long term but humanitarian aid and support be our key focus right now 
 i join colleague in offer my condolence to all those who have lose love one in the devastation in libya in my constituency and in many other part of the country there be strong libyan diaspora community watch on in despair unsure about the whereabout of their love one will   the minister confirm what support be available to libyan community and other in the uk to gain information about friend and family in libya 
 our embassy staff be work closely with people on the ground keep in touch with what be go on and our consular support team be keep in touch with dual national in libya provide the support they need they will continue to do that our condolence go not only to the people of libya but to the wide diaspora as well we will continue to do everything we can as hon member on all side of the house have urge that message have be well receive today 
 i fully support the fact that the uk government have provide international assistance to the people of libya but what be we do specifically to ensure humanitarian assistance be urgently get to people on the ground today 
 as i say we have make our initial offer of support we continue to have an active dialogue with the libyan authority and the un as i say to the opposition spokesperson   the hon member for west ham ms brown the key thing today be that we be wait for the un need assessment so we can then give our good assessment of what sort of support we need to help to provide 
 the tragic scene we be witness in libya be utterly horrifying my thought and prayer be with all those affect during the earthquake in syria and turkey my noble friend lord purvis ask 
 why the government ’s humanitarian crisis reserve which recently stand at £ have now be deplete to only £ which mean that the uk ’s response to any other emergency or disaster will be greatly reduce ”—[official report house of lords   march vol c. 
 have that significant reduction in a crisis reserve for humanitarian assistance affect our ability to help those in libya 
 i think hon member will agree that we respond fast to the situation in morocco it be very sad that this tragedy follow so quickly afterwards and we want to respond to it quickly too part of the challenge have be understand the situation on the ground we know the macro picture but the exact detail that the government and hon member want to see be difficult to ascertain because of problem with communication link and transportation but we will get a well assessment this afternoon 
 what have happen in libya be an absolute catastrophe and it be awful for all those people who have be kill or affect as well as life lose infrastructure have be damage as well as heritage and culture that part of libya be home to a wealth of heritage and history include the unesco site of cyrene satellite image show that road to cyrene have be badly damage and wash away what assessment have the government make and what conversation have they have with unesco about those world heritage site and what be the government do to protect and restore the world heritage site that have be damage 
 i know that my hon friend have a real interest in the history and heritage of north africa clearly any damage to a unesco world heritage site would be a cause of great concern right now as member on both side of the house have say our focus have to be on what we can do to help preserve life and also to protect british national none the less we will work with partner through unesco on the matter that he have raise 
 this be a devastating tragedy and it have unquestionably be exacerbate by libya ’s poor warning and evacuation system and by its substandard planning and design standard i welcome the financial support that the minister have outline but can he assure i that we will also look to provide whatever technical expertise be necessary to bring about improvement in these area for the rebuilding of libya both now and into the future 
 the hon member make a really important point about the medium term and we will certainly examine what technical support we can provide that will be important give the infrastructure issue i also gently urge all party in libya to recognise that this be about prioritisation if they can move away from conflict and think about how they can work in the interest of their own population that would also help the situation we stand ready to help but once we get through this immediate humanitarian crisis other party will need to work out how they can help move the country forward 
 i appreciate what the minister be say the humanitarian response to what have be describe as apocalyptic scene have to be the priority i go to kashmir in my term as an mp follow the devastating earthquake there and see how the way that school building have be construct lend itself to roof collapse on child and other horrific scene we talk about how the uk could lend its expertise in that area to make sure that follow the reconstruction effort kashmir would be more resilient to future shock be we still involve in such programme can we use that expertise to ensure that when it come to rebuild libya and other affected country they be far more resilient 
 i recognise the hon member ’s interest and expertise in this area from her previous visit and through her work in parliament she make an important    point similar to that make by   the hon member for stretford and urmston andrew western we do need to look at what technical expertise we can provide i will take that away and work on it with lord ahmad it be a good point 
 the scene come out of libya be just horrific my thought and prayer be add to those from across the house to all the family affect the minister in response to my hon friend on the front bench say that communication have be take out and that that be hamper effort to get humanitarian aid to where it be need what can the uk government do to help get those communication back up and run 
 that be a really important point hopefully our expertise can help there we need to see what the un want we to do in a co ordinated way we will play our part and the call from member in this house will spur we on and help we in our negotiation to get urgent access to do what we can to help i wish to thank all member for their contribution today it have be an important conversation and call to action 
 i thank the minister for his deep and sincere interest and for his commitment which be what all of we in this house wish to see our government and our ministers have never be find want when it come to help and we appreciate that he have outline the devastation and loss of life from storm daniel like other my thought and prayer be with those family who have lose love one charity such as christian aid alongside church group in my constituency of strangford and across northern ireland be already set up a page it be clear that there be a desire to help how can the minister and the government work alongside the charity and the church to get aid to the right place as soon as humanly possible 
 the response from uk charity include those that the hon member have mention be always greatly value as be their expertise and capability to deliver we need to get the impact assessment from the un today let we then co ordinate our effort with partner not just across government but with non governmental organisation to get the good possible outcome the call to action be clear and we need to move fast 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to make a statement on the voter identification scheme 
 we be pleased and encourage by the roll out of voter identification at the local election in england in may the datum gather in polling station show that the vast majority of electors—99.75%—were able to cast their vote successfully and adapt well to the roll out of the change we be grateful to local authority and other partner for their work to deliver the change in requirement 
 the government commit in legislation to conduct an evaluation of the implementation of voter identification at the local election in may and at the next uk parliamentary general election our intention be that the of those report evaluate the implementation at may ’s local election will be publish in november yesterday the government publish document that demonstrate that we be make clear progress with the evaluation and that provide more detail on the evidence upon which it will be base we be determined to ensure that we fully understand how the policy have operate in practice what have go well and any idea for improvement 
 there be few task more important in public life than maintain the integrity of our democratic process and the british public ’s trust in they we be not just commit to do so we be act to achieve that the government have take seriously the important recommendation make by the independent electoral commission by international electoral observer and by sir eric pickles now lord pickles in his report into electoral fraud and we have be commit in the year since to address what have be a staggering vulnerability in our electoral system it be previously far too easy to commit the crime of electoral fraud in the polling station and almost impossible to detect it i be immensely proud that we have now deliver this new process and fulfil our manifesto commitment 
 i suspect that the minister and i be read different report because the report card on the roll out of voter identification in england be out and they be not good the electoral commission ’s report the result of extensive work monitoring and analyse the recent election warn that disabled people and the unemployed find it hard to show accept voter id as well as young people and people from ethnic minority it also report that on average more deprived area have a high proportion turn away compare with less deprive area the local government information unit report that approximately voter be not give a ballot paper because they could not show an accepted form of id and significantly more be deter from voting because of the id requirement 
 this be not just about england because the next election be uk wide it will affect my constituent in north east fife hundred of thousand of people risk   be turn away at the next election at a cost to the taxpayer of £ over the next decade and all of that to combat level of voter fraud that at the last election stand at case talk about use a sledgehammer to crack a nut a general election be perhaps no more than a year away but it be clear from read the report that we be teeter on the cliff edge of a democratic travesty not just because the roll out of voter id have be botch many of we believe that it should never have be implement in the place but because of the government ’s apparent refusal to listen to the concern of member of the public and member of this house that be what they do in the run up to the local election when take up of voter authority certificate be pitiful and local authority be warn that they be unprepared and that be what the government be do now 
 i be hugely dishearten that in both the minister ’s response and the write statement publish yesterday the government seem to be take a stance of blindly ignore the warn sign so far i see no evidence to suggest that that stance will change in the government ’s evaluation report in november i hope that the minister will use the opportunity to start set thing right will the government ensure that the evaluation report in november be truly independent what measure be under consideration to ensure that voter will not be turn away at the general election as the lgiu report warn how do the government intend to expand the roll out of voter authority certificate ahead of the general election and will they expand the list of acceptable form of identification 
 i thank the hon lady for her comment but i remind all member in this chamber that we have already pass the elections act it pass the scrutiny of both houses and be now law if she refer to the debate in hansard she have treat we to a compilation of the liberal democrats great hit and that be no surprise because as always they do thing and say another if she be so opposed to the principle of electoral identification and photographic identification why do her party support its introduction in northern ireland at that time the liberal democrat front bench spokes- person tell parliament that 
 we accept the need for a bill the liberal democrats welcome the government ’s intention to introduce an electoral identity card”—[official report   july vol c. 
 that legislation pass reading without a vote if we separate the point of substance and process from re run the battle of the past of course we take the recommendation of the independent electoral commission extremely seriously as we set out in detail in the report and as i set out in my remark early 
 the minister have rightly distinguish the political from the practical the electoral commission itself recommend photographic id and it have now come forward with other comment 
 we must recognise that the big deficit be the inadequacy in the completeness of the electoral roll and the fact that of people do not vote in general election and up to third do not vote in local election we ought to spend as much time on that issue as we do on this 
 we ought to consider the suggestion of attestation where someone in a household who do not have voter id can have their identity attest by a person in the same household who do perhaps neighbour ought to be able to do that and other people with some kind of stand in society might be able to do the same thing for people who find they can not vote on the day it seem to i that we can improve what we have without throw out the whole system of photographic id which as the minister have say be support by all party when it be bring in for northern ireland 
 i thank my hon friend the father of the house for those very sensible and proportionate comment he be right that as political party we all have a responsibility to ensure that our constituent and those voter take part in our democratic process that be what this process be about i be afraid that the kind of scaremongere comment that we have just hear from the liberal democrats and that no doubt we will hear from all the other opposition party be damage the important cause that we all stand behind ensure the safety of our precious democracy which now more than at any other time could potentially be at risk i be proud to be part of a government who be take sensible step to protect our democracy from the kind of interference that we all fear could happen in this day and age 
 i welcome the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker i echo the concern raise by   the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain   in her urgent question and by the father of the house in his sensible remark the minister should be promote confidence in our electoral system and concentrate on get the million of people who be not register to vote on to the register instead she have try to pull the wool over our eye this morning by present the electoral commission ’s report as a ringing endorsement of her government ’s dangerous policy 
 the reality be far from that this extremely concern report bring into sharp focus the consequence of the tories fail photo id regulation by introduce such strict regulation against the advice of expert and equality group the conservatives have snatch away the ability of legitimate voter to have their say on service and society former minister   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg admit that this partisan scheme be design to rig the rule and lock voter out of democracy the minister claim that she be concern with protect our democracy so will she agree to the entirely reasonable electoral commission reform and the widening of the list of id that people can use to vote or will she commit to introduce a vouch rule for those without voter id 
 give that the electoral commission say that the rule risk widespread disenfranchisement at the general election will the minister commit now to publish the evidence to prove the commission wrong that should not be a problem if she have nothing to hide 
 be the minister concern by the watchdog ’s finding that the law could have a disproportionate impact on people from minority ethnic background when the independent review conclude will she commit to make a statement to the house 
 may i take this opportunity to warmly welcome the hon lady to her place and to thank she for her comment on the substantive non political point that she make i have be extremely clear and be happy to repeat the assurance that we be work carefully with the independent electoral commission which itself recommend the introduction of photographic id to safeguard our precious democracy we be look at all its recommendation we will of course naturally come forward for scrutiny when the finding be publish as we do as a matter of course 
 on the substantive point be the hon lady really say that the labour party will repeal the elections act should it come into government what exactly have the labour party do to raise confidence among labour voter or be this just a case of labour members stand on the sideline make shrill scaremongere claim time and again labour have make such claim ahead of the sensible and proportionate pilot scheme that we have roll out but none of the thing that labour member have warn about have happened—[interruption perhaps she would like to listen to my remark 
 the new shadow secretary of state for levelling up   the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner warn of shortage of electoral staff lack of venue and funding uncertainty ahead of the local election in may the mayor of london sadiq khan warn that elderly people and ethnic minority would not visit polling station none of those thing have happen the electoral commission—[interruption opposition member be chuntere from sedentary position but perhaps they should listen to the word of the independent electoral commission not my word which find that 
 the poll be deliver safely and successfully 
 and that change put in place by the uk government the commission and electoral administrator help to support and reassure voter and campaigner 
 i think it important to make this final point the hon lady talk about ethnic minority be disenfranchised and discriminate against but we know from the type of heinous behaviour that we see in tower hamlets and birmingham that ethnic minority voter be most disenfranchised and disadvantage by not have security in our election 
 the crime of personation have be notoriously difficult to prove we have function on the basis of trust that people who go to the polling station be who they say they be the sad reality be that when i be elect in we find after the election that score perhaps hundred of people who have vote in my constituency be actually abroad at the time the police refuse to do anything about it people impersonate those voter i do not how they vote but clearly those vote be steal from people voter id ensure that that sort of activity can not happen will my hon friend also take up the issue of postal and proxy voting to ensure that their proper policing be integral to our system 
 my hon friend be totally right the suggestion from the opposition party be that we should just wait and see whether something bad happen and then take action that be the wrong way to go about safeguard our democracy which we should all be   proud of he make the extremely valid point that it be impossible to detect impersonation when it have be detect such as in tower hamlets and birmingham the opposition do not like i mention it people have be take to court and find guilty of these offence he be also right to raise the issue of postal and proxy voting and he will know that we be commence provision to safeguard some of those process which be the right thing to do 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the incredibly hard work team at the electoral commission be far too polite to say we tell you so but that would be a pretty easy way to sum up most of what be in this report practically every concern about the introduction of photo id that be raise during the passage of the elections bill have be bear out in the by election and local election that have take place since it become law 
 the government say that they want to increase democratic participation and not suppress turnout among minority and disadvantaged community but the evidence suggest that that be exactly what be happen few vote from section of society that it just so happen be less likely to vote tory what step will the government take in advance of the general election to remove barrier to voting establish by the elections act will they expand the list of acceptable id will they make sure that as the father of the house suggest people can vote on polling day through attestation will they make sure that the electoral commission and local authority be properly resource to fulfil their function they already have to deal with boundary change and polling district redraw and now they have to deal with the elections act will the government look to scotland as well where with vote for and year old refugee and eu citizen we be seek to expand not restrict the franchise 
 i be not sure that the hon gentleman listen to the response that i have give multiple time but i be happy to repeat it in case he be read his brief at the time we be work with the electoral commission on all the recommendation it have make it make several recommendation and we be look closely at they i hope that we all share the same objective of make sure that this change be roll out successfully 
 if the hon gentleman do not like our proposal i be sure he do not because he want to break up the united kingdom could he explain why they be work so well in northern ireland the incredibly hard work people as he put it from the electoral commission have observe there 
 since the introduction of photo id in northern ireland there have be no reported case of personation voter confidence that election be well run in northern ireland be consistently high than in great britain and there be virtually no allegation of electoral fraud at polling station 
 why be it perfectly acceptable for we to listen to the electoral commission in northern ireland england and wales but not in scotland 
 of the problem be that people take id that have run out such as drive licence and passport do the minister agree that if a document have recently run out as long as it have a photograph of the person it be admissible furthermore could the amount of id that can be show be broaden slightly so that people have a bit more choice in what they can use 
 i thank my hon friend for his suggestion it be right that we look at all the practical barrier that have be encounter at polling station that be why we be work closely with the sector to listen to its feedback and to representation from civil society disability charity and other we know that where voter identification be trialle in pilot the proportion of people who agree that electoral fraud be not a problem increase from to we know that most people be able to vote successfully in both the pilot and the last local election but it be right to look at all the detail and we will be do so in line with the electoral commission ’s recommendation 
 if we be to have voter id at the next general election which we will will the minister seriously look at extend the amount of id that be acceptable it be unfathomable that a concessionary bus pass be acceptable but an year old ’s bus pass be not 
 i would like the hon gentleman to look carefully at the eligibility for year old oyster card and plus oyster card because they be different eligibility for the plus card involve significantly more requirement include a passport or drive licence of course when we try to expand the form of identification that can be use we be go to say yes in some instance and no in other if the eligibility be different 
 despite what we be hear from opposition members my experience at the local election in may be that when people be turn away they do indeed return they be use to provide identification when deal with so many other service and they find it quite acceptable we need to recognise that the public at large be very supportive of the policy but echo other comment could the minister give an assurance that the postal vote system will be thoroughly examine there be genuine cause for concern about that system 
 my hon friend make an accurate observation and he be right that the vast majority of the general public support the policy i remind opposition members that we be elect on a manifesto commitment to introduce these measure they have be thoroughly debate in both houses and have receive very serious parliamentary scrutiny opposition member be ask the same question that they have ask time and time again and i remind they that prior to the introduction of this policy it be hard to take out a library book or collect a parcel from a post office than it be to vote in someone else ’s name this government do not agree that that be an acceptable state of affair in great britain today and i find it quite astounding that member of opposition party do 
 if we as a country truly value democracy it should be in the interest of the state that as many people as possible vote rather than deliberately turn they away as this conservative government have do since the minister have choose to attack the liberal democrats legitimate concern rather than answer question i will start again and ask she to answer a specific question what measure be under consideration to ensure that voter will not be turn away at the next general election 
 for the hon lady ’s benefit i will repeat the specific answer i have already give we know that the vast majority of people be able to vote successfully so i have nothing to do other than remind she that the liberal democrats of which she be a member support the introduction of photographic identification in northern ireland it be quite astonishing to i that the liberal democrats continue to oppose introduce sensible measure in england that they support and vote for in northern ireland which be part of our united kingdom 
 on the day of the local election i remember knock on the door of a constituent who tell i that she usually vote but be not go to because she realise that she do not have the necessary voter id that break my heart her democratic right which she have exercise time and time again be take away and of course she will not appear in that figure of people who be turn away 
 the electoral commission say that ethnic minority and unemployed voter be more likely to be turn away at the polling station when we show our constituent around this house we talk about the struggle for the universal franchise let we remember that the establishment that the conservative party represent do not want woman or the work class to have the vote will the minister reflect on our journey towards increase participation in democracy and on how this rotten arrangement be rob people of their hard win democratic right 
 i will respond to that by ask the hon gentleman to reflect on his comment be he seriously suggest that the introduction of photographic identification be not suitable do he seriously think that it should be hard to take out a library book than to vote in his constituency today if he be seriously suggest that that more than anything else give we evidence that the labour party be in no way ready for government it be not a serious party it do not take seriously the threat to our democracy from international actor and would do nothing to tackle the very real issue experience by ethnic minority in tower hamlets and birmingham who be be systematically disenfranchise by the corrupt practice of certain people in their local area 
 i might be a lone voice on the opposition side of the chamber but i reinforce what the minister have say the electoral voter id system for northern ireland have be a tremendous success as be prove at every election it show that the system can work 
 a short time ago along with my chief of staff i visit the electoral office for northern ireland to be constructive and suggest how we could perhaps do   some thing well the electoral commission be agree to set up hub across northern ireland constituency give people the opportunity to get their voter id in person that have not always be possible in area of my constituency so i welcome that commitment which will be announce i understand in early october will the minister consider something similar for the united kingdom so that everyone can have the advantage of get their voter id in person in their own constituency 
 i thank the hon gentleman for share his really practical and useful wisdom from the policy that have be roll out in northern ireland a value part of our united kingdom where it have be work very well for many year i note that a much small list of document be use in northern ireland and that that have work effectively in the electoral commission ’s recent public opinion tracker survey not a single respondent from northern ireland report that they do not have id and have find themselves unable to vote 
 of course we must always look at the sensible and practical recommendation from the electoral commission we will continue to do that before this roll out we put a significant amount of investment into work with civil society and charity we have make funding available for communication campaign it be just a shame that the labour party and liberal democrats do not take the opportunity to amplify our message among their own constituent we all have a share responsibility in this place to amplify message and communicate effectively particularly to ethnic minority and disabled voter i know that be what i do ahead of local election i wonder what they do
