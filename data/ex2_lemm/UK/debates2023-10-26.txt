the hon gentleman make a fair point the wait time for theory drive test be within target he be absolutely right to draw the house ’s attention to the fact that there be currently a long wait time for practical driving test that be why both i and the road minister the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for north west durham mr holden have task the driver and vehicle licensing agency which have a plan to get back within target in the next few month exactly to help those constituent of the hon gentleman who be keen to get their practical test and get on the road so that they can take advantage of the freedom that be able to drive offer 
 i be sure the hon lady my neighbour welcome the news yesterday evening that go north east and unite the union have manage to reach a   settlement in the north east that be quite good news i be sure she will also welcome the £ that we have put into bus service improvement plan which include the option to do bus franchising this government have be happy to make that available to all local authority 
 i just do not accept that at all i give a run through of a list of the £ that be be put back into local project include £ extra for the north east that could for example be an option for the leamside line to be reopen i would have think that rather than state that none of this be go to happen the hon member would be hold we to account to make sure it do and that she might actually support investment there will be as much investment indeed more in all area 
 i be sorry to hear about that incident it must have be incredibly distress for my hon friend ’s constituent i will raise that case specifically with british transport police and i would be pleased to meet my hon friend to discuss it far

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the cost of bus fare 
 the government be invest nearly £ to introduce a £ fare cap on single bus fare in england outside london we have introduce it on   january   to help passenger to save on their regular travel cost but the prime minister announce recently that it would be extend until the end of just this week the government also announce an indicative additional bus service improvement plan worth more than £ for west yorkshire 
 i warmly welcome the government ’s support which be make bus journey across keighley and our wide area much more affordable as a result of the bus service improvement plan as from last month we have a new £ zone in keighley make travel around the town much more affordable with the k3 and k7 service become more frequent moreover a single ticket for other journey cost just £ thank to the government do my hon friend agree that this demonstrate that our conservative government recognise the importance of local affordable travel link that help to support our community 
 this government certainly do i thank my hon friend for raise our commitment to support bus service not just in his constituency but right across the country this be just a small part of the £ we have invest in bus service with much more to come include our recent announcement of another £ for the bus service improvement plan from the money for network north start next year 
 the department ’s data show that between june and june bus fare drop by in england outside london whereas in london wales and scotland where bus be devolve fare have increase by and respectively 
 let i put this in context in south yorkshire since bus passenger mile have drop by which be a catastrophic fall in the use of our bus service the cut to service mean that many community be now cut off completely 
 when the government come to allocate the recent funding which be welcome do they take account of the fact that south yorkshire have previously have no bsip funding whatsoever add the current funding to the previous funding south yorkshire have have far less per passenger head than other part of the country why have the government so discriminated against south yorkshire and my constituent 
 i think you need an adjournment debate 
 i would welcome an adjournment debate on south yorkshire bus if   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts   be to put in for 
 i speak to the mayor of south yorkshire just this week and he say that the authority will need around £ next year to put back all the service that have be remove over the past few year in our network north allocation it be get £ next year on top of that he be get another £ in bsip fund next year with all the extra cash this government be provide he should be able to provide exactly what the hon gentleman suggest that be in addition to the get around for £ fare scheme which will benefit any of his constituent who can use a bus 
 what comparative assessment he have make of the economic impact of network north and the phase of high speed 
 before i answer this question mr speaker may i put on record on behalf of the government side of the house and myself that i share your congratulation to jim on his service so far and still to come it sound like quentin letts be rather kind to he than he often be to many of we 
 as the cost of hs2 have increase the relative benefit have dwindle every penny of the £ that would have be spend on phase of hs2 will be reinveste into local infrastructure and transport scheme across the country include £ on project across the north that investment will support thousand of new job on top of the thousand already support by the construction of phase from birmingham to london euston 
 we know how vital rail infrastructure be for economic growth connectivity and inward investment per cent of the project announce in network north be previously promise commit to or subject to approval if those project have not be deliver in the year that this rabble have have in government why should my constituent trust that this be not a case of the north yet again have to choose and get neither while london get hs1 hs2 crossrail crossrail and a fully integrate and department for transport subsidise public transport system 
 i think the hon lady be miss the fact that every single penny that we be not spend on phase of hs2 in the north be being—[interruption no she raise a good point every penny of what be go to be spend in the north be be spend in the north and every single penny that be go to be spend in the midland be be reinveste in the midland it be the money that have be free up from our more ambitious development project at euston that will be spend in the rest of the country the north of england be get exactly the same amount of money it be just   be spend on transport project that be well fit to what people actually need rather than phase of hs2 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 in a recent episode of the green signals podcast the former chair of the strategic rail authority sir richard bowker claim that no government include in the business case for hs2 the economic value of additional passenger and freight service that would run on the classic line enable by hs2 may i ask my right hon friend to investigate whether this be the case and if it be why it have not be properly evaluate 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the phase benefit cost ratio process for hs2 capture some of the benefit of release capacity include new demand for exist service it do not include all the benefit from new service but i know that the rail minister will be happy to meet he to discuss that in more detail 
 a new city centre station and a fast rail connection to manchester be vital to unlock bradford ’s economic potential and i welcome their inclusion in the government ’s network north strategy however the prime minister have since state that many project in the strategy be not final but illustrative so will the minister confirm that this government will at long last firmly commit to a new high speed high capacity line without interchange between manchester and bradford 
 yes i can confirm that the day after the party conference i go to bradford and meet the leader of the council and the west yorkshire mayor to talk about our plan for the station at bradford their ambitious plan for the growth of bradford and the new rail line they very much welcome the plan we have make i hope that the hon gentleman do too and it would be nice if the opposition front benchers share the same view as their party colleague 
 i welcome the almost £ that tees valley will receive from network north what advice can the minister give i to ensure that darlington secure the £ for the northern link road and £ for the north road station 
 my hon friend be a great champion for transport scheme in his constituency and i welcome his recognition of the funding we have allocate to the tees valley combined authority under network north i encourage he to raise the issue of those scheme with the combine authority which will be able to use the money allocate to it to focus on the transport project that matter most across the combine authority particularly in his constituency 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in june ministers be reportedly tell by the new chairman that hs2 be billion over budget and year behind schedule yet as mps in this house debate the   reading of the high speed rail west midlands crewe bill on   july   none of that be make clear to parliamentarian do the secretary of state agree that if the true cost be hide from parliament that would represent an outrageous breach of the ministerial code will he say right now whether that be the case 
 let i welcome the hon gentleman to his position on the opposition front bench obviously at the time he mention i be not in the government i be sure that all of my ministerial—[interruption if   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh   would allow i to answer the question rather than chuntere from a sedentary position that would be welcome as i say i be not in the government at that time but i be sure that all of my ministerial colleague both past and present be well aware of their responsibility under the ministerial code and that they give truthful answer to parliament at the time 
 i call the scottish national party spokes- person 
 many of we question this government ’s moral compass but the network north plan give rise to concern about their actual compass with the provision for plymouth and bristol the recommendation in the union connectivity review back 
 invest in the west coast main line north of crewe to properly use hs2 and its fast journey time and capacity to serve connectivity between scotland and england 
 yet network north justifie continue with hs2 phase 
 as it provide the most effective solution to constraint on the congested southern end of the west coast main line 
 so when will the secretary of state deliver the upgrade north of crewe to unblock the bottleneck to the scottish economy and that of the north of england include chorley 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have make it clear that we be go to make sure that high speed train can still continue past birmingham on to the west coast main line we have already have a debate in this house and i believe we have this debate at length when i make my statement after the house return last week about the capacity on the west coast main line the southern section be the most congested part which be why we be continue with phase there be a debate to be have and people can have different view about where demand will go over the next year the view we have take be that the priority be to focus on the transport need of people now—[interruption well in the north of england we be reinveste £ of the £ we have save so we be put the money where it would have be invest but on transport project that be more relevant to people ’s everyday need 
 what plan he have to support transport project in the east of england 
 the network north announcement include commitment to rail improvement at ely and haughley junction which be a key priority for the east and also for railfreight we be also commit to the a10 scheme north of cambridge the east will also benefit from the £ announce for highway maintenance funding across england 
 i warmly welcome the commitment to upgrade ely junction which will boost passenger service to king ’s lynn in my constituency as well as freight i be sure my hon friend will ensure that the scheme now proceed as rapidly as possible may i also urge ministers to approve the business case submit by norfolk county council for the a10 west winch housing access road which be essential to unlock housing reduce congestion and boost growth 
 as ever my hon friend be bang on when it come to the ely project it be a superb project which really deliver for freight and ensure that freight can travel from felixstowe across the midland rather than have to go south so i can assure hon member that we will be on that project and get it deliver 
 on my hon friend ’s point on the a10 which i welcome official be currently assess the outline business case submit by norfolk county council and will be provide advice to ministers in due course we will ensure that we be in touch with my hon friend as soon as a decision have be make 
 i call heather wheeler obe 
 what step he be take to increase the availability of electric vehicle 
 the government be commit to accelerate the transition to emission vehicle last year of new car and around of new van sell be fully electric to continue to support the uptake of emission vehicle we be as the house know introduce a world lead emission vehicle mandate that will support the future supply of emission vehicle by set a minimum percentage of manufacturer new car and van sale to be emission each year from i be delighted to say that this week we have lay the new public charge point regulation to facilitate charge for electric vehicle 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer as he know in south derbyshire in the toyota factory we have groundbreake hydrogen technology so i would ask what be the minister do to ensure that the charge infrastructure be in place across rural area for both electric and hydrogen vehicle 
 my hon friend know that the government have support the use of hydrogen in road vehicle for over a decade include the installation of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure where there be sufficient demand i should also say that notably toyota recently announce the tremendous progress that it appear   to have make in commercialise solid state battery that be a very encouraging sign across the piece not just for hydrogen but for electric 
 we have already hear that the uptake of electric vehicle be closely link to charge point when will the government close the gap in charge cost between those who have the ability to charge at home and those who rely on a public charging point 
 as the hon lady know there be wide and differ experience across the charge network many people be able to charge at home and many people be able to charge through the increasingly large public network the way in which electricity price have change have tend to dominate change overall but she will i be sure share my pleasure that the new charge point regulation mean that we can now have a much more competitive market for charge across all the different form of infrastructure 
 what step he be take to support bus service 
 use the saving from hs2 we will extend the £ bus fare right across england until the end of december this mean that the government have commit over £ to cap bus fare we have also announce that the government will continue to provide increase financial support to community transport operator to help they protect key service by uplift their bus service operator grant by 
 i thank the minister for that reply and for his recent visit to southend west he be very aware that last year elderly resident be leave strand literally overnight when bus withdraw the no service cut they off from southend hospital from leigh broadway and from many community group despite successfully work with bus to reroute the no bus this be not good enough it only run once every hour will he meet i and bus to make sure that southend city get the good bus service possible 
 i be delighted to visit my hon friend and also my hon friend   the member for rochford and southend east sir james duddridge i would be very happy to meet she and representative from bus her work to champion her constituent local transport need be to none i be delighted to see that that additional piece of bus funding of almost £ from central government to southend to help protect and enhance local bus service be go through but i will happily meet she to see how we can well ensure that it be spend in a way that protect her resident 
 it be not possible for people in tamworth to reach burton hospital by bus if they need to do so will the government commit to support labour ’s take back control bill which will devolve the running of bus service to local authority so that bus route that community need can be deliver by the people who know where they be need most 
 i welcome the hon lady to her place this government have put in unprecedented amount of support for bus service include £ for the midland and the north in the past week alone the bus services act which we pass allow franchising to be expand across the country it be this government who be deliver on that great reach for local authority whether it be via franchising or enhanced partnership i urge she to speak to the county council in her region and try to get it to allocate some of that money to support local service this government be put in the money but it be up to the local authority to deliver 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on monday the government pledge to deliver more bus mile but what they fail to tell the public be that this be just a drop in the ocean compare with the bus mile that they have slash over the past year in fact never before on record have bus route fall by as much as they have over the past year and this from the same party that promise bus so frequent that we would not need a timetable do this not show that while the tories and their broken bus system remain in place community will continue to see this record break decline in the bus service on which they depend 
 the hon member do not seem to recognise the fact of the situation there have be huge amount of extra cash go in whether that be through the city region sustainable transport settlement that we be see right across the country in some case that funding be be triple for some local authority or the bus service improvement plan on the statistic that those on the labour front bench trot out the they seem to forget be that in wales bus service have decline by more than twice as much in term of mileage than the rest of the country and it do not have the get around for £ fare scheme or any of the other support that the government in england be put into service because it be make the wrong decision 
 if he will take step to establish a mass transit system in leeds 
 the government ’s network north announcement include £ of investment for the west yorkshire mass transit system build on the £ already provide to the west yorkshire combined authority which be develop the business case i look forward to review that and bring the benefit of mass transit to the west yorkshire region 
 less than of the population of leeds can now reach the city centre by public transport within minute we have be promise and promise a public rail base transport system by this government for year and yet we still remain the large city in europe without will the minister tell the people of leeds why we should believe he this time 
 i will take that as a welcome for the £ commitment in network north as the hon member rightly say leeds would no long be the large city in europe without a mass transit system what we be look to do with the west yorkshire combined authority be create a network of up to line which will eventually connect leeds with huddersfield wakefield bradford and halifax work be go on because £ have already be commit i have a meeting with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities and the west yorkshire combined authority to discuss the plan and proposal the combined authority be work at pace and we be go to fund it 
 nottinghamshire previously submit a levelling up bid for a new toton link road but narrowly miss out the project 
 order of we be go to have sit down and it be not go to be i the question be on leeds unfortunately be the hon gentleman ’s supplementary link 
 indicate dissent 
 right let we move on 
 what assessment have he make of the adequacy of progress on construct the western rail link to heathrow 
 the government remain committed to improve rail access to heathrow airport and recognise the importance of the improve rail connectivity that a western rail link could provide we need to ensure that project that we take forward reflect the change shape of rail demand and be affordable i understand that as a consequence the promoter of a western rail link be update their proposal 
 you will be aware mr speaker that i have long champion a western rail link to heathrow which would connect of the uk population to within interchange of our nation ’s main airport the government commit to it over a decade ago yet not a single spade have dig into the ground sadly the government have more of a reputation for cancel rail link than for build they perhaps the rail minister who kindly meet i recently about the issue will have well news for we today what meeting have he have with heathrow airport thames valley chamber of commerce and other stakeholder to progress this vital mile rail link between slough and heathrow 
 may i thank the former shadow rail minister for the time that we have together it be true that he have be a champion of this project and indeed pretty much every other rail project that i have go to an all party parliamentary group for where he have already agree to pre fund it i assume that now he be a shadow treasury minister he might be cancel some of his previous decision in a bid for fiscal credibility 
 this particular project be due to be fund 50:50 but thing have change post pandemic for heathrow so it be right that it go back to the drawing board we will always support rail investment that can be pay for by private enterprise that be what our network north project be all about 
 what step he be take to improve rail service 
 i regularly meet with network rail and train operator to discuss rail performance and service twickenham have see positive result in the past week an average of of train across the line serve twickenham have arrive within minute of the state time 
 i thank the minister for that answer if we want to encourage more people to use our railway we need to ensure that our station be properly staff so that they be accessible and safe for all and that all complex ticket can be purchase easily yet the government be back south western railway ’s plan to slash staffing hour at station across my constituency in some case by up to in very heavily use station will the minister heed the advice of the transport committee which have say this week that ticket office closure plan be move too far too fast and his own statement that he do not expect a material reduction in hour and stop these plan in their track 
 i always take onboard the advice of the transport committee because it do a great job and always have do on ticket office these be industry proposal which pursuant to the process set out in the ticketing and settlement agreement be currently be consult on between the train operator and the passenger body we expect that consultation stage to conclude shortly i have make it clear at this dispatch box and the secretary of state have also be clear that this should be a redeployment and multi skilling of staff exercise to enhance the passenger experience 
 serious overcrowding persist on chiltern railway service serve my constituent particularly at rush hour and weekend the long term solution be whole fleet renewal but there be some short term fix that chiltern be ask for such as be permit to bring its extra set of class 68 back into use can my hon friend assure i that he be do everything possible at pace with chiltern to improve rail service for my constituent 
 my hon friend be another excellent member of the transport committee and he always champion the need for more capacity on his busy railway line he be accurate overcrowding be become an increase concern for chiltern which be assess option to mitigate the issue such as further utilisation of the class unit in and out of marylebone to maximise capacity there be issue with the diesel fleet but we want to ensure that we can continue to provide the service for his chiltern customer in the long   term i know that chiltern be work with the roll stock company provider to assess hybrid train with an aim to move away from diesel 
 i call the shadow minister 
 fresh from slash and burn hs2 while in manchester and spout crank conspiracy theory the secretary of state announce network north however that dodgy sound 1970 itv franchise do not have a single project with an approve business case and plan be value at price there be no promise to my hon friend   the member for bradford east imran hussain   a minute ago network north be literally not worth the paper it be write on be it minister 
 it most certainly be when the prime minister announce network north it be clear that we be go to see a plethora of rail project and indeed wide project we will well connect the major city of the north we will invest £ so that bradford can finally get the new station that it deserve and as i have state we will add £ to the west yorkshire mass transit system there be a huge amount of project that we should all be celebrate across party it be interesting that the opposition seem to be knock these opportunity to well connect city across the north and the country 
 when it come to business case the ely and haughley project for example have an outline business case of we know that business case be strong when there be local transport opportunity my question back to the opposition front bench team be whether they support these proposal in which case they should ride behind they and be positive about they or do they not want well transport network across the north the midland and the rest of the country 
 what recent discussion his department have have with the home office on tackle speed in rural area 
 my department take road safety for all road user include those use rural route extremely seriously we be currently consider how good to address the specific safety issue that may arise on part of the local rural network as part of our work on road safety my official regularly meet home office official to discuss issue of mutual interest i also recently meet my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire to discuss these and other matter relate to road safety include more way to tackle drink and drug driving 
 on the subject of speeding and rural safety the entry into of my primary town in north norfolk sheringham a tourist town on the norfolk coast have a fast flow road that be become more and more congested year after year what it really need be a roundabout which the minister know all about all in my community support it unfortunately the county council do not have the money not as much   as the minister now have certainly could he please find i a funding pot to bid into to build the sheringham roundabout 
 come on minister 
 my hon friend be a real champion for a sheringham roundabout in fact he have drag i there to visit the a148 junction with holway road i be delighted to do it and i will be happy to go down and see it again i understand that norfolk county council be continue preliminary design work and confirm cost and planning requirement which should put norfolk in a strong position to make a bid although there be no immediate source for this specific scheme i encourage the council to continue to work with the safe road fund because a new opportunity will arise next year 
 what step he be take to support motorist 
 what step he be take to support motorist 
 through network north we announce £ for road resurfacing the large allocation of money for local road maintenance ever and an extra £ for local road scheme in addition the plan for driver set out new measure we be take to make motorist life easy from restrain the most aggressively anti driver traffic management intervention to stop council profit from move traffic enforcement our plan show that the government be on the side of driver 
 across the country the department for transport and local administration have have great success in reduce the impact of roadwork on everyday motorist through lane rental scheme unfortunately greater manchester be not of the area make use of that highly effective tool will my right hon friend take step to ensure that greater manchester adopt a similar scheme to tackle the massive disruption cause by roadwork 
 i entirely agree with the point make by my hon friend i be pleased to report that follow his very effective representation and those of other the mayor of greater manchester ’s bee network committee recently endorse a decision to develop a proposal to introduce lane rental in greater manchester and discussion be now take place with local authority 
 i welcome the uk government ’s £ investment to electrify the north wales main line but for my ynys môn constituent the good connectivity for motorist would be a menai crossing to take the pressure off our lovely but old bridge and to make the most of anglesey freeport and of holyhead the busy roll on roll off port in the uk will my right hon friend see what the uk government can do to make that a reality for north wales now that the welsh labour government in cardiff have ban new road building 
 the uk government recognise the importance of ynys môn to the uk economy decision about the menai crossing be the responsibility of the welsh government that emphasise the damage both to the welsh economy and the uk economy be do by labour ’s decision to ban all new road building which i very much hope it will revisit 
 petrol price in barnsley be significantly high than in neighbouring area indeed it be often cheap to buy petrol in central london than it be in barnsley i do not think that motorist in barnsley should have to pay a petrol price premium do the secretary of state intend to include in the king ’s speech legislation on a fuel watchdog to help motorist in barnsley 
 i hope that the hon lady will have note the announcement that we make early this year about pumpwatch as well as the work that the government have do to ensure that the competition and markets authority look carefully at the way in which the fuel market operate to ensure that it do so in the interest of consumer as we all want 
 some plus year ago when i take my driving test there be other thing we have to do be able to afford a car i can remember pin all my £ to buy a wee mini car but that be plus year ago today of the issue for people who want to drive and be on the road be that they just can not get a practical driving test what have be do to address that so that young people who have a car and insurance can take a test and get on the road 
 the hon gentleman make a fair point the wait time for theory drive test be within target he be absolutely right to draw the house ’s attention to the fact that there be currently a long wait time for practical driving test that be why both i and the road minister the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for north west durham mr holden have task the driver and vehicle standards agency which have a plan to get back within target in the next few month exactly to help those constituent of the hon gentleman who be keen to get their practical test and get on the road so that they can take advantage of the freedom that be able to drive offer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 pothole repair halve since insurance premium up fuel price up electric charge point roll out year behind schedule £ ev charge point fund still not open year after be announce trade tariff threaten consumer and manufacturer which of those be not an example of where this government have fail driver over the last year 
 the hon gentleman have a number of thing that he purport to suggest be fact let i just pick of they the roll out of ev charging that be absolutely on track accord to the independent assessment from the national infrastructure commission the number of public charge point be up as the   minister of state my right hon friend   the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman   set out we have publish and lay before the house the legislation to implement our emission vehicle mandate which give the industry the confidence to invest in and roll out those charge point to drive the roll out of electric vehicle we be absolutely on track to do that and i be surprised that the hon gentleman do not welcome it 
 what his policy be on delivery of a runway at heathrow airport and if he will make a statement 
 as the house will know parliament have vote in principle to support a runway at london heathrow but the government have always be clear that that expansion remain a private sector project to go ahead it would be require to meet strict criterion on air quality noise and climate change as well as be privately finance it be for any scheme promoter to decide when it submit a development consent order application as part of the statutory planning process 
 i thank the minister for that answer regional airport such as leeds bradford have an important role to play in deliver the levelling up agenda with more point to point destination however do the minister agree that to deliver true global connectivity we need more slot from regional airport into our national hub which will ultimately mean more tarmac on the ground at heathrow 
 i agree with my right hon friend who have enormous experience in this area that regional airport be vital to the uk and support thousand of job across the region as well as act as a gateway for international opportunity it nevertheless be the case that as heathrow consider its expansion plan it will need to decide when to take those forward and when it do so i hope it will bear the very important issue of regional connectivity in mind 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of progress on decarbonise road transport 
 the uk have of the most ambitious decarbonisation programme of any country in the g7 in march this year the government publish a globally unprecedented level of detail on their plan to meet emission reduction commitment include those from road transport the carbon budget delivery plan set out the policy and quantify carbon reduction need to meet carbon budget and and the vast majority   of reduction need to meet our commitment into   the 2030s 
 on heavy good vehicle road transport in particular the start of the emission road freight trial be welcome but where be the low carbon fuel strategy such fuel can cut emission by the strategy will be crucial for shape the investment plan of logistic company so why be it nearly a year late and when be we go to see it 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the issue of hgv as he acknowledge last week the government announce the win project of the £ emission hgv and infrastructure competition which will roll out emission hgv and around refuelling and electric charge site this be part of a much broad strategy which be about develop different fuel alternative the technology continue to change very rapidly we have already hear some fascinating news about the development of solid state battery and the government be track and follow all these development closely 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i be still astonish at the secretary of state ’s claim that the english ev charge network be on track absolutely no think that in this country 
 push back the date for the ban on petrol and diesel car by year combine with remove what be already of europe ’s bad ev purchase incentive scheme mean that this government be send all the wrong signal to consumer mike hawes of the society of motor manufacturers and traders say that consumer require 
 a clear consistent message attractive incentive and charge infrastructure that give confidence rather than anxiety confusion and uncertainty will only hold they back 
 i have no doubt that this decision be thoroughly assess so can the minister tell we how many extra million of tonne of carbon will be emit due to this government ’s back pedalling on net 
 be it p. g. wodehouse who say that it be not difficult to see the difference between a ray of sunshine and a scotsman with a grievance how true that be in this case the truth of the matter be that there have be enormous progress in this area let i remind the hon gentleman that £ of new private investment be be plan by chargeuk that have not be affect of the lead global mandate have be lay we have just do this excellent work on charge point and i be pleased to say that the independent national infrastructure commission of this country have state that if the roll out continue to grow at the current rate we will meet our target of public charger by 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this government have make the long term decision to reinvest every penny of saving from high speed into the local journey that matter most across the country so from next week passenger on our bus will keep   save money with the £ fare cap and from next year £ of redirected hs2 funding will go to bus service across the north and midland that be part of £ of new funding to improve britain ’s most popular form of public transport 
 it mean support local authority to introduce cheap fare more regular service and new route all back by investment that would not have be possible without our decision on hs2 a project that would not have be complete until the 2040s govern be about make choice and by prioritise everyday local journey we have choose to be on the side of the majority of the british people 
 thank goodness santa travel by sleigh not train avanti have just release its new timetable with london to holyhead service up to christmas slash it be certainly no nadolig llawen for my ynys môn constituent who like i be feed up with this service avanti have a new contract what assurance can my right hon friend give to my constituent that he be do everything he can to restore the number of direct train from london to holyhead to pre pandemic level 
 the rail minister and i continue to hold avanti to account for matter within its control and i know the rail minister recently visit my hon friend ’s constituency to talk about service to holyhead the temporary change she refer to be necessary to accommodate network rail engineering work to improve and maintain the network and minimise unplanned short notice cancellation due to train crew shortage as avanti train more driver in the spirit of my hon friend ’s question give that she have mention christmas i hope she be grateful for the early christmas present from the prime minister of £ to electrify the north wales main line 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we now know that high speed be billion of pound over budget parliament may have be mislead and the government be about to waste hundred of million more on the fire sale of the land why then do the prime minister choose to dismantle the ministerial taskforce that be literally design to oversee the cost and delivery of hs2 when he enter no 
 the prime minister make the right long term decision to reinvest every penny save from hs2 in the north and midland back into transport project across the north and midland which will benefit more people in more place more quickly i know this must be a difficult time for the hon lady as her party leader   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer cast her view aside admit that the prime minister be right and say that he would follow his lead i can only thank the right hon and learn member i can only think he be disappoint that the prime minister do not go far and follow his suggestion of cancel the station at euston give his long campaign against it 
 neither the secretary of state nor the prime minister be pay attention be they they have fatally undermine confidence in hs2 and its   delivery which be why no have confidence in network north the rail minister fail to respond to my hon friend   the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane   about the fact that dozen of project in network north be unfunded because they be value in price will he publish the delivery plan and up to date cost or can we all conclude that network north be not worth the paper it be write on 
 i be very surprised that the hon lady be not welcome the massive improvement network north will make across the country include for her own constituent i be shocked mr speaker that she be not take this opportunity to welcome the electrification of the hull to sheffield line the upgrade of the sheffield to leeds line the electrification of the hope valley line or the reopening of the don valley line that be just on rail the only mode of transport that the hon lady ever raise with i it be not to mention the £ 
 order secretary of state i be be generous but such long question and answer need to come early not in topical 
 some of visitor to bournemouth travel by car they be most welcome particularly when they do not park on double yellow line but some be choose to do so for a great day by the sea they be willing to pay the £ charge which obstruct local traffic and indeed the emergency service if someone park on a double yellow in london the charge be £ that be a real deterrent so can the london charge rate for parking on yellow line please be extend to bournemouth 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question i recently meet with my right hon friend   the member for bournemouth west sir conor burns   and some member of the local council and this issue be something i would be happy to discuss far with he 
 i call imran hussain not here 
 by the time we next meet for transport oral it will have be more than year since the government consultation on pavement parking close be we ever go to see a government response or be it time that the government come clean with disability group and admit that they have put this issue in the too hard to do pile 
 it be certainly not in the too hard to do pile it be something we be look at it be of the big response we have have on any issue with ten of thousand of response so it be only right that the government take our time to ensure we get the position right in the meantime any local authority across the country can put in place a traffic regulation order and ensure those change happen on a local level 
 pothole and road repair be a key concern for many of my fellow gedle resident so i warmly welcome the recent announcement of over £ of spend on pothole   can my right hon friend assure i that money will be spend where it be need most and outline how much of it be come to the east midland 
 detail of how that £ of funding will be allocate to local authority will be publish in due course and i hope we will be able to make an announcement about that in the not too distant future to give my hon friend that reassurance it will be for each individual local highway authority to decide how to spend that money and to focus on the most important part of their network they have the local knowledge to do that and we trust they to spend that money wisely and i be sure my hon friend will make representation to they about which part of his constituency that money should be target at 
 scotland have have a far more progressive approach to encourage the switch to electric vehicle with incentive include interest free loan for electric vehicle enhance home charger grant and a far more comprehensive charge network with twice as many rapid charger per head as england the scottish government ’s cabinet secretary for net have describe the delay on ban petrol and diesel car sale as an 
 unforgiveable betrayal of current and future generation 
 put the uk on the wrong side of history on climate change she be right be n’t she 
 i do not think that for the reason we have describe there be anything to complain about in relation to the progress we be make across england charge point roll out remain very rapid—43 in the last month and there be public charge point at the moment and private and business one and new regulation and a new mandate have just be lay 
 chalkwell station in beautiful leigh on sea have steep step to get up from and down to the platform it be inaccessible i be tell last year by the treasury that work on it be part of the £ department for transport access for all programme work be suppose to start a year ago but nothing have happen the timetable have slip it be not due to be complete until march to ensure that there be no further slippage on this timetable will the minister meet with i 
 i be very happy to meet my hon friend chalkwell ockendon and southend east remain within the access for all programme we have deliver station and we will deliver those as well we have an issue with the contractor put in a cost estimate that be about double what i would expect that be why we have have to look anew but i will very happily meet my hon friend to discuss this far and she have that commitment we will deliver it 
 can the minister confirm that although hs2 or maybe hs1- and a quarter be go no far than birmingham the hs2 train will continue to run on the west coast   main line be he aware of repeat report that because the new train be not design for exist track the high- speed train to glasgow will go slow than the exist train on that line can the minister categorically assure the house that that be not the case and tell we how much time will be cut from the train journey from glasgow to birmingham 
 it come down to choice we could have choose to continue with hs2 which would not have deliver the value we need with time overrunning or we could have do as the scottish national party do when it build ferry at a shipyard that have be nationalise go time over budget and run year late alternatively we could have do as it do on the tram describe by the edinburgh tram inquiry as a litany of avoidable failure when there be choice to be make the snp plough on regardless 
 open access passenger and freight train operator have recover fast since the pandemic experience high staff morale with few strike provide well deal for passenger and cost taxpayer less too over the next to month how many new open access service do the minister expect to see approve 
 i thank my hon friend for everything he do to push for more open access it be something the secretary of state and i be keen to do i meet this week with the office of rail and road chief executive our regulator and we discuss what he can do to allow more open access application and what we can do and we then meet with another bidder there be another service plan with regard to wales on the western line and there be also in the offing that could work on crosscountry plus for the channel tunnel i hope my hon friend will keep on work with i we want to deliver they 
 the government ’s mishandling of hs2 be and be absolutely staggering but their attempt to pull the wool over northern eye with network north be a farce do the minister really believe the people of the north east be fall for his fag end fake network to nowhere 
 i just do not accept that at all i give a run through of a list of the £ that be be put back into local project include £ extra for the north east that could for example be an option for the leamside line to be reopen i would have think that rather than state that none of this be go to happen the hon member would be hold we to account to make sure it do and that she might actually support investment there will be as much investment indeed more in all areas.[official report   november vol c. 1mc 
 the fight against pothole be much like our own fight to   stay healthy if we do nothing about it we deteriorate fast i therefore thank the minister for the additional £ allocate to local authority for pothole repair will he join i in praise dudley council ’s new approach of move away from traditional reactive quick win towards a proactive high quality structural maintenance service 
 i certainly be delighted to praise dudley council for its new approach spend that money wisely but also implement preventative measure for the future well plan road maintenance be essential and on   october   the prime minister announce that network north would include £ for local highway maintenance right across the country the allocation of that cash will be announce very soon to help dudley but also every other council right across the country to ensure it have the high quality road 
 i be not quite sure that answer be as link as it should have be 
 the government have say that every penny that would have be spend on hs2 will now be reinveste in local and regional transport infrastructure to be clear and so that south yorkshire can get organise may i ask the minister to confirm that the city region sustainable transport settlement round uplift for south yorkshire will be £ and that he will work with the mayor and other to maximise the benefit of that investment 
 yes i can give the hon gentleman that assurance it be indeed £ of extra funding for the south yorkshire mayoral combine authority we have already have conversation with the south yorkshire mayor about the funding and his plan i and my team will continue to do so and our official will work with his to make sure we can deliver those plan 
 with the global ai summit come up next week in milton keynes it seem topical to ask what step be the department take towards the regulation of autonomous pavement delivery robot 
 of course i have visit the technology that my hon friend be describe and see it in action we must balance the safety of patient and vulnerable road user with the potential benefit of this new technology but i be very pleased to confirm that the department will be fund research to advance our understanding of the impact of this technology the result will be publish once the research have conclude 
 heavy good vehicle cause a disproportionate number of cycling death to cut the number of death of cyclist by illegal freight operator in other place will the department look at the successful london scheme and encourage partnership between local authority the driving and vehicle standards agency and police force to address this problem 
 i be always happy to look at measure to improve road safety include the measure the hon lady have suggest i regularly meet the head of the national police chiefs council on this as well as the police and crime commissioner lead we have already update the highway code to put that priority of road user there but i be happy to look at any measure we can implement to further this 
 nottinghamshire submit a levelling up fund bid for a new toton link road but narrowly miss out the project be desperately   need to ease congestion and unlock the huge potential in my constituency of broxtowe and our wide county will the secretary of state meet i to discuss this £ ready to go project especially as the east midland have the low amount per head spend per year on transport 
 with the extra £ in the crsts announcement come to my hon friend ’s new mayoral combine authority i be sure there will be plenty of opportunity to look at really important road scheme but i would also be delighted to meet he as soon as possible 
 when a memorandum of understanding on hs2 to scotland be agree by the then transport secretary philip hammond hs2 planner claim that reduce journey time between scotland and london to hour could boost passenger number by and increase rail ’s share of passenger make that journey from to reduce air travel emission what be the secretary of state ’s new prediction for rail passenger number make that journey 
 i will happily write to the hon lady with the detail she require but i restate that it come down to choice the choice that this government have make be to go forward with transport project across the entirety of the country that can deliver fast and well benefit and that have a well business case that be why this decision have be make 
 do my right hon friend think that people of the jewish faith be safe on the london underground i have to tell he that many jews in london do not feel safe do he agree that london underground employee who misuse transport for london equipment to take part in intimidatory act should not only be discipline for gross misconduct but consider for prosecution for cause harassment alarm and distress under the public order act 
 i be familiar with the case that my right hon and learn friend raise i be in contact with british transport police about it after see the disturbing footage at the weekend they have publicly say that a member of staff have be suspend but he will understand that because the british transport police be investigate whether a crime have be commit it would not be right of i to go into detail i hope he be reassure that the incident be be take seriously by both british transport police and london underground and that that will reassure both he and the jewish community 
 the huge importance of local bus service to community such as mine in blaydon have be emphasise by a dispute between go north east and its employee i very much hope that a negotiate settlement can be reach quickly be not the reality that we need well more streamlined franchising model to give community a great say on their transport offer 
 i be sure the hon lady my neighbour welcome the news yesterday evening that go north east and unite the union have manage to reach a   settlement in the north east that be quite good news i be sure she will also welcome the £ that we have put into bus service improvement plan which include the option to do bus franchising this government have be happy to make that available to all local authorities.[official report   november vol c. 1mc 
 the reopening of the skipton to colne railway line which be about mile of miss track will be fundamental in link lancashire and yorkshire back up will the minister consider progress this line to the next phase of the rail network enhancement pipeline which include draw up a full business case for reinstatement will he meet i and member include our right hon friend   the member for pendle andrew stephenson   and our hon friend   the member for burnley antony higginbotham   to discuss it far 
 i would be pleased to meet my hon friend and all right hon and hon friend the department have be work with transport for the north lancashire county council and the skipton east lancashire rail action partnership campaign group to strengthen the case for reopen that line but we will meet up and discuss that far 
 in answer to   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts the bus minister   the hon member for north west durham mr holden   say that the mayor of south yorkshire have ask for £ to restore bus service in fact the mayor ask for £ to restore bus service to level so just restore those cut in the past year will the minister take this opportunity to look again at the level of funding that south yorkshire require 
 that be exactly what they say and that be exactly what i say too as i say we be see not only £ this year but £ next year and almost £ on top of that but that be to ignore the huge amount half a pound of city region sustainable transport settlement funding go to south yorkshire for this period which will almost triple for the next period too interruption the hon lady can shout at i from a sedentary position but the truth be that she be just adopt our new position it be not really opposition anymore it be just adopt the government ’s position include on hs2 
 when do ministers anticipate be able to give lner the go ahead to extend the king ’s cross lincoln service through to cleethorpes 
 i be afraid i will have to give my hon friend the answer that minister often have to give which be that i hope to make an announcement shortly i also hope that when an announcement be make he will be able to welcome it 
 accord to the department ’s own regulation it should have report on medical licence for fisherman this week but it have not so when will the department publish the review more important when will it start listen to fisherman who be out of pocket worry about their livelihood and at risk of become uninsured 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise that question in fact i meet representative of the national federation of fishermen ’s organisations just yesterday to talk through the issue in some detail we will be able to make some announcement on policy very shortly obviously i will keep the federation inform as i will members of the house 
 my constituent very much value access to the travelcard scheme which in particular enable visitor friend and family to make the most of a trip to london they be concern to hear the mayor of london sadiq khan announce his plan to abolish the travelcard they be equally puzzled to hear that the mayor have now apparently intervene to save the scheme from his own plan can my right hon friend help i explain that conundrum to my constituent 
 like my hon friend i be surprised that have propose to cancel the travelcard scheme in the place the mayor of london be now try to take credit for cancel his own cancellation from my point of view those hon member who so stridently raise concern about the mayor of london ’s late plan to increase cost for the travel public and the department of transport official who work with transport for london to find an alternative deserve the lion ’s share of any credit 
 i declare an interest in that i sell my house in north west leicestershire to hs2 in for considerably less than i pay for it in what do the secretary of state make of the evidence give to the medium by andrew bruce the former head of land acquisition for hs2 that people be short change and not give full value for their property up and down the route 
 there be rule that specify how the safeguard land will be return those who sell their property will be offer it back at the current market value we expect those matter to take place towards the    summer with regard to the hon member ’s allegation i will discuss they far with he so that i be fully furnish of the case 
 last year my constituent be have a drink with his son have attend a manchester city match when his son be glass in the face in an unprovoked attack the assault take place in a pub outside manchester piccadilly within the jurisdiction of british transport police since then despite cctv capture a clear image of the suspect no arrest have be make my constituent feel disappoint that the transport police have not get justice for his son who suffer life- change injury will my right hon friend meet i to discuss this distressing case and more widely to consider the remit and resourcing of british transport police 
 i be sorry to hear about that incident it must have be incredibly distress for my hon friend ’s constituent i will raise that case specifically with british transport police and i would be pleased to meet my hon friend to discuss it far 
 i call dave doogan for the final question 
 thank you mr speaker while the tories get excited about get around for £ under 22 in scotland get around for free because their fare be fund by the scottish government in a strategic paradigm shift to get people modal shift over to public transport will the english government provide that same support to commuter in england or be they too proud to follow scotland ’s lead 
 the hon gentleman could do well to recognise that fare in scotland be up by over on an annualise basis whereas in area of england they be fall there be also no fare cap in scotland for those over the age of whereas my constituent many of they in low pay work or look to go to work and get job can get a £ bus fare on a recent visit to scotland i see people pay £ or £ to travel between some major town actually the scottish government would do well to follow the english government ’s example 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker you have have notice of this in prime minister ’s question time yesterday   the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock   ask the prime minister about compensation for those infected and affect by the contaminated blood scandal the prime minister respond 
 what i would say be that extensive work have be go on in government for a long time co ordinated by the minister for the cabinet office as well as interim payment of £ be make to those who be affect ”—[official report   october vol c. 
 that be factually incorrect and i hope that the record can be correct as not all those affect have receive interim payment a parent who lose a child or a child who lose a parent in the scandal have receive no such interim payment despite clear recommendation from sir brian langstaff the chair of the infected blood inquiry that such payment should be extend immediately 
 that confusion by the prime minister and his official be deeply hurtful to those who be still wait for the government to respond to sir brian langstaff ’s interim report on compensation publish in april sir brian make it clear that the compensation scheme should be set up now and should begin work this year we be nearly in november very close to the end of and there be still no clarity from the government we have no idea what progress the government have make on their work despite be tell repeatedly that it be at pace and they be work towards the original november deadline for the publication of the final report which be now due out in march surely they have some progress to report to the house 
 the government have also fail to explain why victim of the infected blood scandal be be treat differently from the victim of the post office horizon scandal who rightly have receive compensation before the public inquiry into their scandal have conclude if the government be determined to needlessly delay justice to victim of the infected blood scandal that make the need to extend interim payment to bereaved parent child and sibling as recommend by sir brian even more critical the clue be in the word they be interim payment to be make before the final compensation payment that be why what the prime minister say yesterday be so wrong there have be not word on whether the interim payment will be extend i wonder whether you might be able to assist i madam deputy speaker in get the government to tell the house of commons what they be do in relation to sir brian ’s final recommendation on compensation 
 i thank the right hon lady for her point of order and for give notice of it i know how hard she have campaign on this issue and that it be a matter of concern to member on all side of the house she have raise a number of issue some of which be ongoing and i be sure will be raise in other way 
 she say that she think the prime minister have perhaps make an incorrect statement she will know that mr speaker be always very anxious that if   any incorrect information have be say inadvertently it should be correct at the early opportunity she have also raise a number of issue about when the government might come forward with further information fortunately we have the leader of the house here who be listen closely to the right hon lady and i think she wish to respond 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker i will be brief i be sure that if there be business question the right hon lady would have ask that question i thank she for the work that she and her all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood have do the position that she set out be correct i be here yesterday and i do not think that the prime minister seek to state that it be otherwise give we do not have a business statement today i will write to the minister for the cabinet office and paymaster general my right hon friend   the member for horsham jeremy quin on the specific issue of those affect who have not receive interim compensation payment to ask that he consider what she have say today and update she and the house at the early opportunity 
 i would stress that the compensation study be set up to be concurrent with the inquiry so that we could move swiftly to make amend for this appalling injustice i know because i have meeting with my official yesterday that that be very much the view of the minister he be determined to make progress on these thing quickly and on the practical thing that we can do in the interim the right hon lady have my assurance on that my involvement be to ensure that if any legislation be need we be ready to do that i reassure the house and thank she for the opportunity to do so that this government which set up the inquiry be determined to ensure that all people infect and affected have justice 
 i thank the leader of the house for her statement i be sure that the right hon lady will follow up and there will be some liaison about how to go forward 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i provide advance notice of it to mr speaker early 
 a few day ago the sunday times report on its front page that a hamas fugitive who 
 run the group ’s terrorist operation in the west bank 
 live here in london muhammad qassem sawalha be designate by israel as a senior hamas operative in europe and accuse of flee the country with fake document he be now believe to hold uk citizenship zaher birawi live in barnet not far from sawalha he be designate by israel in as a senior hamas operative in europe he be list as a trustee of a uk register charity education aid for palestinians a publicly available video show he host a event in london title understanding hamas 
 week ago hamas launch the deadly terror attack the world have see since this house rightly vote to proscribe hamas in its entirety in november it be therefore a serious national security risk for hamas operative to be live here in london especially where at least appear to have do so through the use of fake document in obtain british citizenship   madam deputy speaker can you advise i on how i might raise this with the government as a matter of great urgency and ask if you have have any indication of a minister seek to come to the house to provide an urgent update on this matter 
 i thank the hon gentleman for notice of his point of order i hope that he will understand that i can not comment on individual case i have have no notice of a statement but he have put the issue on the record and those on the government benches will have hear his point 
 order 
 that far to the orders of   january   and   february paragraph and of the order of   december   relate to the appointment of sir roger gale as deputy speaker and to the exercise of the function of the chairman of ways and means shall continue to have effect up to and include   march .—(gagan mohindra 
 i beg to move 
 that this house have consider the matter of the menopause 
 i thank the backbench business committee for grant my hon friend   the member for swansea east carolyn harris   this important and timely debate in october which be world menopause awareness month regrettably she be unable to attend or open the debate so she have ask i as a member and the treasurer of the all party parliamentary group on menopause to open the debate in her place i be pleased and privileged to do so i hope to do justice to her work and that of the appg and its supporter in this vital area affect the life of million of woman 
 the hon gentleman say that this affect million of woman but as the husband of a menopausal woman i feel it be incredibly important that man in their role as colleague friend or family member have a deep understanding of the challenge of menopause so that they can well support the woman in their life do he agree 
 the hon member be absolutely spot on that be why the appg be work across so many area to develop people ’s understanding of menopause not just woman but importantly man as well 
 the day of whisper the word menopause and keep the change in woman ’s body a secret and just get on with it so to speak be thankfully begin to be a thing of the past the manifesto for menopause be launch last week at a celebratory breakfast in parliament to mark world menopause day alongside the publication of the group ’s manifesto for menopause the reception feature new finding from a recent survey by menopause mandate of over woman it find it be important to get this into context that of menopausal woman ’s quality of life suffer as a result of their symptom and almost take over a year to realise that they might be peri or menopausal 
 my hon friend be make a great contribution woman have tell i that when they experience symptom such as itchy skin ache bone depression and anxiety their gps advise they on how to treat those symptom although the cause could be the menopause do he agree that extra training and support could help gps to recognise menopause symptom well and could therefore help many woman across the country 
 that be a valid point and i shall be touch on it later 
 accord to the survey only of menopausal woman be diagnose by healthcare professional with a huge discover through their own research that they might be menopausal and only have have a positive gp experience among work woman say that the menopause have a negative impact on they but only of their employer have a menopause policy 
 i commend the hon gentleman for raise this issue it be a massive issue for my constituent and the personal experience through my own wife be very clear give that of woman leave work during the menopause say that they feel and have feel unsupported and unable to continue which really should not be the case do he agree that there should be a great obligation on business to help woman 
 that be another point that i will touch on later but the hon gentleman be spot on 
 anyone who happen to be in westminster hall on wednesday last week will be able to testify to the work that the appg have do more than member and other gather for a photograph to mark and celebrate world menopause day my hon friend the member for swansea east say she be not sure that visitor to westminster hall be ready to see so many woman parliamentarian and other do impromptu exercise squat however she also say that if it be a good enough location for henry viii to play real tennis it be certainly good enough for a group of menopausal woman to highlight the benefit of exercise to their physical health and mental wellbeing 
 the fact that those influential woman grassroots campaigner and clinical expert be bring together in parliament show the world that westminster be listen but listen alone be not enough while woman continue to suffer listening will not help they get a diagnosis or access to treatment or find the support they need that require action and on world menopause day the appg which be chair by my hon friend the member for swansea east launch the menopause manifesto base on evidence that the group gather by speak to those affect by the menopause and expert in the field the manifesto set out recommendation which we be urge all party to adopt in their own manifesto ahead of the next general election 
 i can not stress enough how important it be to the woman in the uk who be currently perimenopausal or menopausal and to all around they who be indirectly affect the hon member for strangford jim shannon   raise that point to know that those in power will support they the recommendation in the manifesto be for health check every time that be mention in conversation people be genuinely surprised that it do not already happen many will remember receive on turn along with the card gift and the good wish an invitation to a + nhs health check those mot monitor our weight and blood pressure and be use to assess the risk of develop condition such as diabetes heart disease and stroke what they do not include for woman at present be any question about advice on or reference to the menopause which be at good a surprise and at worst quite shocking 
 there be strong evidence show that many woman be access primary care and be treat for individual symptom because neither they nor their clinician be recognise the root cause of those symptom a point raise early by my hon friend   the member for blaenau gwent nick smith 
 by raise awareness among medical professional who can in turn help to educate woman at their plus health check we can reduce the number of   extra visit that woman make to surgery and prevent further misdiagnosis and inaccurate prescribing we can also dramatically increase the number of woman who get prompt and correct diagnosis and access to treatment pathway we know that this would save the nhs money in the long run 
 many healthcare provider be now start to include menopause in their standard package have identify the fact that patient be be send for appointment in secondary care for an array of symptom that have not be correctly diagnose as menopause by include menopause treatment as standard they be reduce the cost to the nhs of these unnecessary appointment 
 the recommendation of the appg ’s manifesto be a national formulary for hormone replacement therapy although hrt be not the answer for all woman million across the country rely on this treatment to manage their symptom we know that in a minute consultation prescriber do not have the capacity to go search for alternative treatment if a patient ’s usual product be out of stock and we have see a supply shortage for many of these product a national formulary would resolve this issue as all eligible product would be easily accessible on surgery system thus eliminate the postcode lottery and regional variation that woman be currently experience 
 the hon gentleman be most gracious in give way he mention that there be sometimes disparity from say county to county there be also regional disparity i know he accept that and the minister have take note too when it come to provide well treatment a recommendation have to be that every part of the united kingdom england scotland wales and northern ireland should have an agree strategy for help woman do he agree that there should be the same policy the same strategy and the same response everywhere 
 i agree with the hon gentleman it be crucial that woman be able to go to any surgery and although there may be marginal difference in treatment or access to treatment the substance be that they should ultimately get more or less the same access and the same treatment depend on their need 
 the recommendation also relate to prescriber the manifesto call for the inclusion of menopause as an indicator within the gp quality and outcome framework this change would help to balance the deficit in knowledge and understanding among gps by incentivise improvement in diagnosis level and treatment provision within primary care if clinician be well inform they would be more confident in discuss menopause with patient at their health check and in prescribe appropriate treatment which would greatly benefit patient who visit their gp to seek support 
 move away from healthcare i be proud to say that early this year labour commit to the recommendation mandate that all company with more than employee introduce menopause action plan to support those experience symptom that go some way to address the point raise by hon member 
 alongside this the appg would like to see the provision of specific guidance for small and medium sized enterprise and the introduction of tax incentive to encourage company to integrate menopause in their occupational   health plan there be great example of company embrace the issue and there be some excellent tool available to help such as the british standards institute ’s menstruation menstrual health and menopause in the workplace standard with research show that in woman be leave the workforce and thousand more be reduce their hour or avoid promotion it be vital that more be do to address the impact of menopause on woman ’s economic participation 
 the appg be not ask for woman to be give special treatment we be ask merely for an understanding that work arrangement and environment may need to be flexible this willingness to incorporate flexibility will benefit business boost the economy and give woman the confidence to progress in their career 
 the manifesto ’s requirement be about the licensing of testosterone for woman it have always strike i as odd that when woman reach menopausal age which be different for everyone they become deficient in hormone oestrogen progesterone and testosterone yet only the be available to woman when they be prescribe hormone replacement therapy on the nhs as my hon friend the member for swansea east have note previously if a woman want the hormone they have to pay for a private prescription the all party group be call for an evaluation of female specific testosterone treatment with a view to their be license by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency 
 in the recommendation we be call for well funding for research into the potential link between menopause and other health condition as well as the vary experience of woman from different background and ethnicity that be very important we know from the evidence that the appg have receive that those with condition such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can struggle more with their menopausal symptom and that those who have be treat for cancer often experience early menopause so it be vital that much more be do to well understand the different journey that woman from different background be experience in the past week my hon friend tell i say that she have be lucky enough to visit university in london and the other in her own home city of swansea both be keen to do more to support their staff and to bridge the significant gap in understanding around more complex menopause experience 
 i thank the hon gentleman very much for the scene he be set small and micro business be predominantly male own so the issue for they be understand how to put over the request on behalf of lady who be go through the menopause do he feel that the government and the minister should take that on board as well to ensure that those business have the relevant information and guidance to do that within the small workforce that they look after 
 the hon gentleman make a good point and set out an excellent idea i be sure that the minister as part of the expansion or integration of the manifesto can take it on board 
 as i be say my hon friend be delighted that swansea university announce last friday that it would be introduce menopause into the curriculum for all of   its medical student as well as launch a menopause clinic for staff and student i truly hope that it will be the of many university to do this future policy in this area and an improved woman ’s health strategy will be possible only if more funding be dedicate to this vital research 
 the and final part of the manifesto call for a review of the demand for specialist menopause care we need to look at exist provision evaluate where increase secondary care be need and assess other way in which woman could seek help that might for example include access to specialist nurse in primary care and pharmacist to ease the demand on gps that be another simple recommendation that would be easy to achieve while have a significant impact on the care and support that woman be able to access 
 nothing in the all party group ’s manifesto be difficult to achieve no big contract or big budget be need to make the change that will significantly improve woman ’s experience the only thing that be need be a commitment to prioritise this area of woman ’s health we need a commitment to improve support diagnosis and access to treatment for all those who need it who would not want that i know that every member of this house would want it we need a commitment to show the of the population who will directly experience menopause that they matter that they really matter 
 it be an absolute pleasure to follow my good friend   the hon member for bootle peter dowd i be originally excited to see that   the hon member for swansea east carolyn harris   be go to be open the debate simply because her enthusiasm for this subject be contagious and draw people in but he have do incredible justice to the opening of the debate 
 it be marvellous to see a number of male colleague in the chamber i grow up in a house with brother and an irish catholic mother and the word menopause would in no circumstance ever have cross her lip i then go to an all boy school and go on to do civil engineering at university there be no girl at my school and just woman on my civil engineering course in the whole of the department so my exposure to woman be somewhat limited until i finally get off the building site and into a traditional workplace there i find that man whose experience be not as shelter as mine have no great knowledge or understanding of this topic although i feel they have far less excuse 
 so when my wife begin to experience the symptom of the menopause originally neither she nor i nor her gp fully understand what be go on certainly menopause be not the initial diagnosis that highlight for i how difficult and challenging it must be for some woman they present to their gp the gp misdiagnose or misunderstand their symptom and then the problem be protract because the appropriate treatment be not identify quickly enough 
 with an understanding of that and as an mp represent the good people of willenhall bloxwich and walsall north it be important to i to engage as much as possible with people who could help we find a place for a menopause café somewhere where woman and man could come and sit down and talk about this topic over a cup of tea and a slice of cake in a relaxed   environment i think it be beholden on we particularly male colleague in our role as mps to do everything we can to ensure that everybody be as well informed as possible as i say in my intervention in our male role as family member friend and relative it be incredibly important for we to understand the symptom and the range of appropriate treatment available so that we can fully provide the necessary support 
 the hon gentleman have mention family group and work colleague do he agree that woman who go through early menopause may find it difficult to discuss the subject with their employer those conversation need to be have to ensure that woman of any age be support and enable to engage fully in all aspect of their workplace instead of be exclude perhaps unintentionally 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that intervention give that my wife myself and her gp do not fully understand what the symptom be and at what age they could arise it be completely understandable that an employer might be challenge in term of provide such support that be why it be vital that we do our good to ensure that everybody be as well informed as possible because exactly as the hon gentleman say such symptom might start to appear at any age so it be important that their root cause be identify quickly and people can provide that support 
 i be delighted to say that now that my wife have a very senior role in her company it be easy for she to drive that ethos throughout the company i pay credit to phs group for its work countrywide i have invite the hon member for swansea east to come and speak at of its office in the south of wales i hope we can arrange that soon 
 i pay tribute to all colleague in the chamber today particularly the man in our role as champion fight side by side with the woman to ensure that this topic be completely understand by as many people as possible so that we can all provide the support that be so well deserve 
 it be a pleasure to speak in this debate with my hon friend   the member for bootle peter dowd   step in to lead it so ably show that menopause be not just a woman ’s issue but a health issue that affect more than half the population as such it should be of concern to we all as be so ably highlight by   the hon member for walsall north eddie hughes whom i be pleased to follow in this debate 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for swansea east carolyn harris   for all her hard work in this area which be well know right across the house i congratulate she on secure this debate i be only sorry that she be unable to be in her place today but i know how dedicated she be to this issue and i be sure that her important work will be reflect throughout the debate because as many of we know there be no stop she when she get go 
 this be a timely debate which i will use as an opportunity to draw attention to the link between osteoporosis and the menopause the menopause be an important time for bone health when woman reach the menopause oestrogen level decrease which cause many woman to develop symptom such as hot flush and sweat the   decrease in oestrogen level also cause loss of bone density so the menopause be an important cause of osteoporosis 
 while in man develop osteoporosis in their lifetime half of all woman over will have to learn to live with it this summer the all party parliamentary group on osteoporosis and bone health which i chair have work in partnership with the royal osteoporosis society to run the better bones campaign our campaign call for a timely diagnosis for the people most of they woman who currently remain undiagnosed and untreated i be call on the government to introduce universal access to fracture liaison service the world standard for fracture prevention we know that osteoporosis be of the world ’s most urgent health issue per cent of people miss out on anti osteoporosis medication be woman that be why the fawcett society and the british menopause society be among the many charity and organisation support the better bones campaign
