i thank the hon member for his question many of these issue be raise when the statutory instrument pass through parliament the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who be the court minister have write to the senior president of tribunals to convey those concern and i think that be in part why my noble and learn friend be meet the senior president of tribunals tomorrow 
 i want to provide some reassurance to the shadow minister under our scheme no sexual offender no terrorist offender and nobody who have be convict of a serious violent crime or be convict for year or more will be eligible for early release i would just remind he that the slight distinction between our scheme and that conduct under the last labour government between and be that we have a governor lock that mean that the governor of any prison can prevent an individual prisoner from be release early if they do not think that it be suitable to do so and that be not the case under the last labour government 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the number of child be remand to custody 
 custody be reserve for those convict or accuse of the most grave offence and the total number of child in detention have fall by since before a child can be remand the court must be satisfied that it be very likely that the defendant will receive a custodial sentence and must have explicitly consider and reject the option of remand he or she into local authority care 
 some of place in youth custody be take up by child and young people on remand who do not go on to receive a custodial sentence yet child hold in young offender institution spend most of their time lock up in their cell amid high level of violence do the minister think that that be the good place to spend time during adolescence 
 the hon lady make an important and compassionate point it be absolutely right that we should invest in the estate and i be pleased that we be invest in a new secure school which will open soon she make an important point about the decision to remand those decision be make by independent judge that be correct but i hope that she will join i in recognise that the reduction in the overall number of child in custody by since be a positive thing when i be prosecute young people be go inside for be passenger in vehicle take without consent now they be inside only for the most grave offence 
 will the lord chancellor take into consideration of the recommendation of the wade report on sentencing for murder the definition of child should be reconsider at the moment someone who be or very often might be try when they be but they be sentence as if they be a child surely the question should be the crime rather than the age 
 we have alter the sentencing regime such that the court can take into account what can be quite significant gap between the sentencing regime that apply to a year old and that which apply to an year old the court now have additional discretion to ensure that if somebody be very close to their birthday they can be treat as more mature which can mean in appropriate case that the punishment will be more severe 
 i call the shadow minister 
 almost third of child on remand in youth detention do not go on to receive a custodial sentence and be acquit mean that they be free from a criminal charge altogether it cost between £ and £ per year to keep just child on remand in youth custody do the minister view that as the good use of public money or do he feel that it could be manage in a more efficient and effective way with an alternative remand provision 
 in the total number of child in custody be over that figure be now around so there have be a significant reduction the decision of whether to remand be a matter for the judge they can remand in custody only if there be substantial ground for believe that if release on bail the child will commit further offence or indeed fail to surrender we be also invest million of pound in greater manchester for example to see whether there be other option in remand child into local authority accommodation and not necessarily into custody 
 what step his department be take to help ensure public confidence in the support provide to victim throughout the criminal justice process 
 what step his department be take to help ensure public confidence in the support provide to victim throughout the criminal justice process 
 with the victims and prisoners bill we be put the victim code on a statutory footing it include a right for any victim of crime to be signpost by the police to correct and appropriate support service we have quadruple victim fund since we take office in to over £ a year and have recruit almost independent sexual violence adviser and independent domestic violence adviser into the criminal justice system in addition we provide a range of freephone support line include a hotline for rape 
 rapist domestic abuser and stalker can not be convict if trial be not go ahead and victim be drop out after be make to wait year for justice where be the government ’s plan to tackle the record court backlog which be make victim wait year for justice 
 we be do a huge amount to drive down the backlog which be principally a result of the pandemic we have increase the fee for both solicitor and barrister by we have keep open more than nightingale court and we be do everything within our power to drive down waiting time 
 bear in mind that harrow crown court be not set to reopen for another year because of minister failure to invest in its repair early enough what confidence can victim of crime in harrow have that ministers be go to get those who be accuse of those crime to justice much more quickly than be currently the case 
 as the hon gentleman will know the issue with harrow crown court be that reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be discover in that building we be invest more than £ in the court estate because we know how much it matter not just so that the court be function but so that the building convey the right sense of dignity so that people respect the process harrow be just of court in england and wales 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the minister be right to recognise the work that be be do on the victim code and i appreciate the government ’s take on board a number of the recommendation make by the justice committee when we engage in pre legislative scrutiny of that bill 
 the minister will know however that there be a particular issue with delay in case of rape and serious sexual offence where case be take out of the list because prosecute counsel be not available they simply can not be find she rightly refer to the increase in fee for solicitor and defence counsel do she agree that there be now just piece of the jigsaw that need to be put in place to bring the fee for prosecute counsel in those case up to the same level as those for defence counsel that would take about £ will she sit down with the attorney general and talk with she about how we can do that swiftly 
 i can reassure my hon and learn friend the chair of the select committee that i speak to the chair of the bar council about exactly that issue last week but i want to provide he with further reassurance there have be correspondence between the lord chancellor and the senior preside judge about any case of rape that be more than year old that correspondence be a couple of month old and he say that all case would be list by july this year that apply to case in england and wales i also want to draw my hon and learn friend ’s attention to something i know he will be aware of that we have increase the fee for section hearing which take place in an irregular sequence in the court listing from £ to over £ 
 on monday the daily telegraph report that civil servant be try to block an amendment to the criminal justice bill that would legislate for the publication of an annual report on crime stat by nationality do the minister support the release of such a report and   what do she think civil servant be worried we will find out it be time to publish a report and restore trust among the general public 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be not aware of that but i know that an amendment have be suggest that be not within the scope of the bill my hon friend ’s suggestion be a sensible we already publish the number of foreign national offender in prison but i understand the force of her question and i be happy to meet she to discuss it far 
 more than lawyer campaigner politician and academic have write a letter in support of the anti violence against woman and girl campaigner and barrister dr charlotte proudman who be face disciplinary action after challenge a judge for take a boy club attitude in a ruling on a domestic abuse case do the minister agree that the racial gender and class base bias of the justice system must be address and that it be right to speak up against injustice will she join i in pay tribute to those who be campaign for a legal sector that genuinely represent empower and be accountable to the wide public 
 i count myself as of the people who campaign on violence against woman and there be many other right hon and hon member across this house who do the same thing the hon lady will understand i hope why i will not get involve in a disciplinary matter concern a particular barrister i know what it be say have be say and it will be for the relevant standard committee to decide whether or not the barrister be at fault 
 the minister may be aware that i use to be the victim minister and when i be in that role i try to stand up for victim whose love one have be kill by road traffic incident it be fundamentally unfair that if someone be charge with death by careless driving as compare with death by dangerous driving the case be not appealable by the victim for leniency be that something we be still look at as be the case when i be in the ministry 
 i share my right hon friend ’s profound concern about death cause by either dangerous or careless driving as he know it be the conservative government who create a criminal offence of death by careless driving 
 i will just make point on   june the maximum penalty for the offence of death by dangerous driving be increase to life previously it be year secondly we have just agree to extend the unduly lenient sentence scheme so that the complainant will have day to put in their appeal to the attorney general and the solicitor general who will have a further day to contact the court we hope that that will encourage more application and of course we keep the category of offence under careful review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 victim should have the right to know who this government be let out of jail early with today ’s news that despite minister   protestation to the contrary from the dispatch box high risk offender have be release early why should the public have any confidence that this be a government who put victim 
 i want to provide some reassurance to the shadow minister under our scheme no sexual offender no terrorist offender and nobody who have be convict of a serious violent crime or be convict for year or more will be eligible for early release i would just remind he that the slight distinction between our scheme and that conduct under the last labour government between and be that we have a governor lock that mean that the governor of any prison can prevent an individual prisoner from be release early if they do not think that it be suitable to do so and that be not the case under the last labour government.[official report   may vol c. 8wc correction 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of propose reform to employment tribunal panel 
 the employment tribunal panel composition arrangement be now a responsibility of the senior president of tribunals and i understand that he intend to publish the response to the consultation on propose reform shortly he have a statutory duty to consult my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor before make these arrangement and my noble and learn friend the parliamentary under secretary of state for justice will be meet the senior president of tribunals i think tomorrow to discuss his proposal as part of that duty 
 the introduction of tribunal fee previously lead to a drop in the number of case go forward and the scheme be deem unlawful by the supreme court so it beggar belief that the government be look at reintroduce tribunal fee and give a green light to bad employer to exploit worker who will be deter from come forward what do the minister say to the organisation include the tuc citizens advice the joseph rowntree foundation and liberty that be call on the government to reconsider the reintroduction of tribunal fee 
 i thank the hon member for his question many of these issue be raise when the statutory instrument pass through parliament the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who be the court minister have write to the senior president of tribunals to convey those concern and i think that be in part why my noble and learn friend be meet the senior president of tribunals tomorrow.[official report   may vol c. 6wc correction 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the wheel of justice certainly turn slowly under this government and hundred of thousand of people across the country be pay the price in the crown court the civil court the family court and tribunal at the end   of the employment tribunal backlog stand at more than case those be case affect worker who have be bully worker who have be deny pay and worker who have be unfairly dismiss do the minister think that worker like the government should just give up on the justice system roll over and accept what employer do to they or be there a new magic formula to sort this out 
 the thing the hon gentleman do not of course mention be the impact of the pandemic on the criminal justice system and indeed on the employment tribunal system hon member oh come on opposition front bencher do not like hear it but they can not deny the impact of shut down the system in effect for year we have massively increase the resource available and we be work through the backlog but that will take time 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 on a similar point in a cost of living crisis worker be now expect to pay to take their employer to an employment tribunal in case of wage theft unpaid redundancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal quite frankly it be outrageous that this be be levy at a time of intense pressure on family budget do the government not agree that access to justice must never be contingent on ’s ability to pay and that these propose change ought to be scrap to promote great fairness in the system 
 i thank the hon member for his question we have introduce a regional virtual court to safeguard access to justice and we will always make that available as far as it be possible to do so as i say we be work through the backlog at pace 
 if he will issue guidance to lawyer on the potential implication for the criminal justice process of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act 
 the hon lady ask about the implication for the criminal justice system of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act to be clear that act relate to immigration and potentially administrative law it do not substantially impact on the criminal law and accordingly no specific guidance be require 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response may i praise the quick response from solicitor and the community in glasgow to rwanda removal very much in the spirit of the glasgow girls and the glasgow grannies and kenmure street year ago be there a deliberate policy to remove people from scotland to england to prevent they from access legal aid as they would be able and fully entitle to do in scotland what guidance have be issue to lawyer in this respect lastly what right do mps have to intervene in case of removal because i have be tell that mps have be ask for wet signature from people who have be take to immigration removal centre in england 
 there be several question in there but the answer to the question be no that be not correct the point about legal advice be very important people should get legal advice so that they can make their point that be why we be invest heavily when the illegal migration act come into force there will be a uplift we have invest £ to reaccredit senior caseworker and we be also pay for travel time we recognise that the legislation be necessarily robust and we be also ensure people get the legal advice they need 
 i call scottish national party spokesperson 
 i listen with great interest to that answer my hon friend the members for glasgow central alison thewliss and for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin and i have constituent who have be remove from scotland to england and threaten with deportation can the secretary of state answer this question why be mp be deny access to their constituent it seem outrageous do he not agree that this be unacceptable and that lawyer and their elect representative should not be impede by arbitrary barrier when access constituent who be threaten with deportation 
 i would be more than happy to discuss that point with the hon gentleman of course mps should have access in appropriate circumstance but the critical point be for individual to get legal support i say that with no discourtesy to he as a constituency mp that legal support be important as i have say when the ima come into effect we will increase funding by pay for travel time and ensure the reaccreditation of senior caseworker that be what individual need support through legal advice and that be what we be provide 
 what recent assessment he have make of the welfare of prisoner at hmp parc 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question and also for she typically measure and sensitive contribution to yesterday ’s urgent question on this issue ensure our prison be safe and secure for both staff and prisoner remain our top priority his majesty ’s prison and probation service have be work closely with g4s the operator of hmp parc to ensure the welfare of prisoner and i visit last month to see   the work for myself i be particularly conscious of the importance of that in light of the death in hmp parc since march 
 as the minister mention yesterday i have the opportunity to raise in the house the very real concern of parent with son at parc particularly in relation to drug use when i contact the prison month ago it reply that in the year to september there have shockingly be incident of self harm in a prison of inmate do the minister accept that parent have be ask particularly for mental health support for year and it have not be happen 
 i be grateful to the hon lady again for her question the provision of mental health support be absolutely vital it be obviously something that need to be do hand in hand and in partnership with the local health board in wales we continue to work closely with the health board both on the issue she have raise and more broadly on the issue underpin some of the challenge face in parc 
 the minister will be aware of the dire indeed dangerous situation we face at chelmsford prison year ago when the prison be place in special measure he may have see the late inspection report which praise the improvement especially in be a safe and more productive place and the work do to take drug and contraband out of the prison i thank the justice secretary personally for the focus he give this issue when he be prison minister and congratulate the governor and the staff do the minister agree that the lesson from chelmsford could help other prison such as parc and that with the right approach even the bad prison can be turn around 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for her dexterity in ask her question she make a very important point in pay tribute to the work that have be do at chelmsford prison by my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state work with the team and all the staff there i also note the close interest she have take and how much that mean to the staff and the team at her local prison she rightly point out that there be opportunity to learn lesson from that which may well benefit prison such as parc 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of reoffende rate among child and young people 
 over the year to prove reoffende rate caution and conviction for child and young people have fall from to although there have be a slight uptick over the past year the fact remain that reoffende by child and young people have fall significantly under this government 
 last week i see the powerful new play punch by james graham i can not recommend it highly enough to all right hon and hon member who be welcome to come to nottingham playhouse to see it it raise important question about young man and their offend behaviour and shin a light on the potential power of restorative justice what role do the minister believe restorative justice can and should play in tackle reoffende which as he say have rise for the time in a decade among adult and child 
 i be grateful to the hon lady not just for her question but for her kind invitation to visit nottingham playhouse it be just up the road from my constituency in leicestershire so i might take she up on that in answer to her substantive question although decision on restorative justice be a matter for judge there be relevant consideration to take into account i see   restorative justice as element of a package that can help to reduce reoffende and get child and young people who commit crime back on to the straight and narrow 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of trend in the number of drug find in prison over the last year 
 the government take a tolerance approach to drug in prison as be reflect in our policy approach which have see £ worth of investment into measure to tackle the smuggling of contraband include drug into prison in the year end march there be few incident where drug be find than in the year to march reverse that pre pandemic trend there remain more to do but it be important to note that progress have be make 
 the most recent report by hm inspectorate of prison into hmp parc in find that almost half of prisoner have easy access to drug and our current welsh affairs committee inquiry into prison have receive evidence regard drug use as well as the fact that parc be understaffed and staff be inexperienced in light of that evidence and the recent death and surge in record violence in parc prison would the minister welcome a new inspection by the chief inspector give the £ cost of the contract for g4s to run the prison have he give consideration to the prison service step in to manage it as it have do with birmingham prison 
 the hon lady make a number of point in term of tackle drug in parc we have x ray body scanner and the rapiscan system and we have handheld device be roll out in respect of her specific question any inspection be a matter for the chief inspector of prison in term of the overall performance of parc it be important to remember that although there be challenge which be address in the urgent question yesterday parc be rat as perform well and its contract be perform well in the inspection it get measure of good and of reasonably good there be more to do and we will continue to work with the prison but the contract continue to perform well 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government boast as they have do just now about their investment in new body scanner to detect drug on everyone enter a prison each day yet a damn report in the times find that the body scanner at hmp bedford be not even staff what be the point in spend £ on scanner if they be not even use 
 before turn to the substance of the hon lady ’s question may i take this opportunity to wish she a happy birthday hon member hear hear 
 it be important to remember that this investment be across the estate i be in hmp wandsworth yesterday see the work be do there in the context of bedford the body scanner be use at appropriate time in an appropriate manner 
 if he will make a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of short custodial sentence and sentence serve in the community 
 ministry of justice reoffende statistic show that those serve a sentence of month or less have a reoffending rate for offender punish with suspend sentence or community order the reoffende rate be the department ’s analysis of a match cohort of over offender show low reoffende rate for those serve sentence in the community when compare with immediate custody of less than month avoid ten of thousand of potential crime 
 i agree with the bishop of gloucester that community payback scheme be often far more appropriate than short term custodial sentence particularly for woman prisoner if my hon friend agree with that do he also agree that we could expand the range of community payback activity to include for example help at good local charity such as the nelson trust and the family haven and especially during this summer season of litter pick across the country keep britain tidy 
 i thank my hon friend for that sensible question i agree that community payback offer offender an opportunity to make visible reparation to their local community with million of hour be deliver each year as an example this march for the great british spring clean offender spend thousand of hour clearing litter across the country we be trialle a new way to deliver community payback through the rapid deployment pilot which be launch last year community payback team be work in partnership with local authority to see incident clean up within hour notice and we be now expand that to all probation region 
 restorative justice in northern ireland have be an effective method of ensure that victim and perpetrator can at least come together and perhaps try to find a solution it be also a way of ensure less sentence have the minister be able to look at the community restorative justice that we have do in northern ireland to ensure that those on the mainland who offend can have a new life as well 
 i personally have not but i gather that minister of justice official be abreast of that i would like to meet the hon gentleman to hear more about that from he personally 
 what progress his department have make on deliver new prison place 
 what step he be take to increase prison capacity 
 thank to funding from the prime minister when he be chancellor we be deliver the large prison building programme since the victorian era with additional place on track to be deliver by the end of next year to secure the pipeline of further prison last october i announce an investment of £ to acquire land even far in advance to mitigate the risk of planning delay we be also deliver an additional rapid deployment cell across the estate 
 the national audit office warn the government over year ago that prison would run out of space by of the promise place it have be reveal that only just over a quarter have be deliver so as a result we see the government spend £ rent out police cell grim condition in overcrowded prison and a chaotic early release scheme why have the government prove incapable of avert this crisis 
 as a result of the record amount of investment in prison we bring on hmp fosse way and we have hmp wells i invite the hon member to visit they because these be excellent modern prison with fantastic rehabilitative condition provide an excellent opportunity to keep the public secure and prisoner rehabilitate we will also be roll out hmp millsike we have plan permission for hmp gartree we be also roll out houseblock at stocken rye hill and guys marsh and there will be further one at gartree this be a government who believe in building and we be get on with the job 
 manage prison capacity be in part about ensure that we have enough prison officer but be a prison officer can be both demanding and dangerous with of prisoner between the age of and at the peak of their physical fitness my prison officer constituent tell i that despite that the officer retirement age be mean that staff well into their 60 be deal with young and often aggressive people while it be important to retain experienced prison officer and recruit to the service what consideration have my right hon and learn friend give to reduce the retirement age in line with policing 
 prison officer be the absolute backbone of the system and it be absolutely right that we should recruit and retain i be pleased to say that in we recruit an additional officer and just as importantly the resignation rate be come down from to that be really positive on my hon friend ’s point about retirement it be worth know that the employee contribution rate to pension for prison officer be of the most competitive in the public sector that be exactly as it should be on the specific point of retirement age i will be happy to discuss that with she far 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on the use of non disclosure agreement in sexual assault harassment and misconduct case 
 it be important to flag at the outset that confidentiality clause be only ever use in the civil context rather than the criminal with that in mind we be table an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill to make any non disclosure agreement void if it purport to restrict the right of an individual to report the same act to the police or to access any kind of medical or therapeutic support a move that have be welcome by many include the law society and the bar council 
 thousand of people be silence due to non disclosure agreement and gag clause in case of allege sexual violence bullying and harassment the legal services board have report that signatory of nda suffer devastating impact due to fear of retribution pregnant then screwed have say that an estimate mother have be gag by an nda or confidentiality clause the bill table by my hon friend   the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran   would end the misuse of nda in the workplace why be the government so hesitant about support a statutory ban 
 as someone who spend more than a decade practise as an employment lawyer i can tell the hon lady that there be a role for the confidentiality clause in any kind of compromise agreement when both side resolve their dispute without go to court and without admission of liability or any finding of liability on either side we recognise that when they be use in their most extreme form particularly in the most high profile sexual harassment claim victim have tell we that they feel they could not go to the police or access counselling we have right that wrong however i will stand up for confidentiality clause and i want to correct slightly the hon lady ’s point they be only really encounter where there be a dispute concern the equality act that need to be immediately contextualise it apply only in employment education and in the provision of good and service we have take the same step in relation to student through the higher education freedom of speech act 
 what step he be take to reduce reoffende 
 reduce reoffende be a core mission of these ministers and this government that be why we have prioritise accommodation for prison leaver and why we have invest heavily in employment with prison employment lead and employment hub in every resettlement prison crucially the plan be work in the year to march the proportion of prison leaver in employment month post release more than double 
 clearly provide safe and secure accommodation for ex offender when they leave prison be the and most important part of get they on the path to rebuild their life what action be my right hon and learn friend take to ensure that that happen so that people be not tempt to reoffend 
 no in this house have do more than my hon friend to look after the plight of people who be homeless or at risk of homelessness i be proud to say that the proportion of offender in home for their night post release be that be because we have roll out week of guarantee community accommodation i go to luton and dunstable and speak to a probation officer who have work there for year and he say that be the single most significant policy roll out of his entire career it be critical to ensure that prisoner and ex offender can be rehabilitate 
 do the secretary of state agree that reoffende rate would reduce far if we have a more concentrated attack on the illicit substance that continue to go into prison as well as the massive use of prescription drug which many people in prison tell i be cause problem for people close to release 
 the hon gentleman raise an excellent point and he be right the reoffende rate be worth focus on in it be around and now it be the reason for that be a combination of focus on accommodation as we have just discuss and employment so that people have a stake in society as well as tackle substance abuse we be look at technology with great focus to ensure that people can be treat for their substance addition on the inside by the very clinician who will treat they on the outside that continuity be vital to get they off drug and rehabilitate they 
 if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of support available to juror who have be adversely affect by sit on a jury 
 jury be a vital part of our criminal justice system and jury service be an important civic duty we want to do everything we can to help juror feel support as they undertake that important role which be why the government have announce our intention to test counselling session for juror who suffer mental and emotional strain follow a trial that pilot will commence in court this summer 
 currently juror deal with extremely violent crime witness ever increasingly sophisticated and graphic material often feel that they do not have sufficient aftercare to deal with their experience they be advise to seek counselling only with their gp or the samaritans what discussion have the minister have on increase the amount of post trial support for juror when they have face potentially traumatic level of stress as a result of their experience 
 i thank the hon lady for her question which be extremely relevant as she can imagine there have be extensive discussion between the department and the judiciary about this the senior preside judge have approve the test site for the pilot that i have just discuss support of the type that we be provide in the pilot have not be provide before so the pilot itself will inform an essential part of the judgment we make on whether and how we can carry on 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of legal aid provision for immigration case 
 access to legal aid matter we have take action to broaden access in immigration and asylum case by uplift fee for work do under the illegal migration act when it commence provide up to £ this year for accreditation and re accreditation of senior caseworker conduct legal aid work allow detain duty advice scheme provider to give guidance remotely where appropriate and introduce payment for travel time between immigration removal centre and detain duty advice scheme surgery 
 the bar council of england and wales have submit its grave concern to the ministry of justice ’s review of civil legal aid cite that it be 
 not sustainable in its current form 
 and that it have significant concern 
 in relation to future availability of counsel 
 in immigration and asylum case it also note that in real term civil legal aid fee have now halve compare with what they be year ago what be the next step to ensure the future of legal aid in immigration case or be justice now for only the wealthy 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that important question we be broaden access to legal aid the mean test review when fully implement will put an additional £ into legal aid and bring an additional £ into the scope of legal aid we be roll out the housing loss prevention advice service that be another £ go in there will be up to £ go into legal aid we be also roll out the review of civil legal aid which will report later this year we will be issue a green paper in july to look at what we need to do to have a sustainable resilient and well resource system because we want high quality lawyer do civil legal aid that be vital for the kind of country we want to be 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the case backlog in the criminal and civil court 
 we remain committed to reduce the outstanding case load across our court in england and wales to enable the court to get through more case we have extend the use of nightingale    courtroom this financial year allocate £ for essential modernisation and repair work of our court building up to march next year and fund unlimited sitting day include day during the most recent financial year the high level since 
 for anyone who have be a victim of crime delay in get case into court add massively to the stress and anxiety they experience what would the secretary of state say to any member whose local magistrate court have criminal case wait to be hear at the end of december would he say that a backlog of that scale be acceptable 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important point about magistrate court it be true that case load in magistrate court which of course deal with over of crime common assault criminal damage non residential burglary and so on be significantly low than they be during the pandemic the particular pressure be in the crown court we make a decision of principle during the white heat of covid not to get rid of jury trial now i know that in scotland the snp government be a little ambivalent about jury trial but we think they be a very important part of the right of free bear britons we will hold fast to they and we will put in resource more nightingale court more judge by raise the retirement age and more legal aid we will invest in and recover the system while hold fast to our principle 
 when i be a justice minister i introduce virtual hearing so that case could proceed much more effectively will the lord chancellor kindly update the house on the progress of those hearing 
 i be delighted to hear from my right hon friend who be such a distinguished minister in this department he do indeed introduce virtual hearing in our court and time have prove how prescient he be because that be the right thing to do i welcome the recent decision by the judicial office to make remote hearing the default arrangement for bail application in a wide context a private member ’s bill introduce by my hon friend   the member for warrington south andy carter which be currently make its way through parliament will amend legislation so that magistrate and judge in magistrate county and family court will be able to hear case remotely when that be appropriate 
 what progress he have make on implement the recommendation of the national audit office report on the government ’s management of legal aid 
 the national audit office report on the management of legal aid be a valuable piece of work and we be consider its conclusion carefully the government hugely value the work of legal aid lawyer which be why we commission a review of civil legal aid to identify option for the delivery of a more effective efficient and sustainable system for legal aid provider a green paper contain policy option be plan for july this year 
 there be no provider of housing legal aid in the borough of bedford and the number of people live within km of a provider of legal aid housing advice in england and wales have fall from to in the last decade do the secretary of state agree that whatever legal redress be provide in the renters reform and leasehold and freehold reform bills will be meaningless if there be no legal aid system to enforce those reform 
 i hope that the hon gentleman will welcome the £ that be go to the housing loss prevention advisory service which be a revolutionary step to ensure that those who be at risk of eviction can access the legal aid they require in order to make their case i respectfully invite the hon gentleman to come and see i so that i can discuss this with he far and he can be a voice for his constituent signpost they to the support that be available because it be important for they to be aware of the support that the government be provide 
 what step he be take to prevent domestic abuse perpetrator from use the justice system to extend control over victim 
 the government have take significant step to prevent domestic abuser from use the justice system to extend control over their victim section of the domestic abuse act prevent they from cross examine their victim and require special measure to be available in court and we have also amend prohibition order under section 91(14 of the children act which can bar any individual from make a further application to court without permission when abusive partner be judge to be bring victim back to court without reasonable purpose 
 my hon friend take domestic abuse very seriously but be she aware that perpetrator all too frequently seek to use the civil court to perpetrate further abuse of their victim often with the support of legal aid and often use expert with no relevant qualification to make accusation of for instance parental alienation or child grooming can she please reassure i that the government be take this matter seriously to ensure that perpetrator do not continue to use our court system to retraumatise their victim 
 my right hon friend ask an excellent question but let i remind she that this be precisely the issue at which the section 91(14 prohibition order be direct moreover of the change make under the domestic abuse act give the court themselves the power to make those order of their own volition rather than wait for an application from the victim 
 as for the part of my right hon friend ’s question to the extent that we be make change to legal aid all those change be in favour of the victim we be remove illiquid and contested asset from consideration of mean all protective order can be obtain without any assessment of mean and we be undertake a legal aid mean test review to make the test much more generous to victim 
 my right hon friend ’s final point concern the so call expert who give evidence on parental alienation the government do not recognise the concept of parental alienation and do not believe that it be a syndrome capable of diagnosis we have respond to the domestic abuse commissioner on this subject in writing 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last session of justice question i have meet my g7 ministerial counterpart in italy to discuss topic range from prevent illegal migration to tackle organise crime furthermore we have announce a new offence in which incidentally my g7 colleague be very interested prohibit the creation of sexually explicit deepfake announce measure to remove parental responsibility from those convict of the rape of a child make progress with the litigation funding agreements enforceability bill in the house of lords to support access to justice for those such as the postmaster and introduce an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill to provide further protection for victim against unnecessary disclosure of counselling note 
 i have also attend the unlocking investment in ukraine conference which bring together ukrainian lawyer and eminent british jurist we in this country understand the importance of a strong legal sector to secure ukraine ’s future the british people and this parliament be determined to ensure that once it have win the war ukraine win the peace as well 
 with more than child catch up in private family law proceeding what be the secretary of state do to ensure that the welfare of child be protect 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise private family law because all too often people raise the issue of crime but family matter too i be really delighted that we have manage to secure funding from the treasury to roll out early legal advice in private family law alongside the pathfinder pilot scheme it be design to make the process of deal with private family dispute more seamless and less painful and ultimately ensure that child be put 
 people in carshalton and wallington particularly woman be be target in so call crash for cash insurance scam could my right hon and learn friend outline what support be available to victim of this sort of crime 
 if someone be the victim of a crash for cash scam they be likely to be the victim of an offence under the fraud act or potentially under the road traffic act we have quadruple the funding for victim of crime who be entitle under the victim code to be keep update about the crime to be notify about compensation and to be offer special measure    if the case get to court regardless of whether someone be the victim of crash for cash theft or any other crime the state should be there to provide the support they need 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this week the chief inspector of prison find that at hmp lewes the government ’s early release scheme be undermine safety and risk management in case a high risk prisoner be release early despite be a risk to child have a history of stalking and domestic abuse and be subject to a restraining order be this the secretary of state ’s idea of put public safety 
 i read that report with care and will be look very carefully at that specific case it be important to read precisely what the chief inspector say he say that that be an incident right at the beginning of the process and he expect that thing would bed down as we move on the critical point be that under the government ’s scheme if there be a concern about an individual who be propose to be eligible the governor can impose a veto which get the decision escalate   to a panel that be an important safeguard and it be not present under the labour scheme as the hon lady well know 
 report after report failure after failure at parc prison people have die in just month at bedford cell be flood with raw sewage at wandsworth a suspect terrorist escape last year the prison be still not secure and the governor have resign she have take responsibility when will the secretary of state 
 the hon lady be right to say there be prison where the standard be not where we want they to be there be something like prison in the estate and we be the party that create the urgent notification system so that these matter can be draw to the attention of the government but i will make the following point there be prison that have fail in the past and we have turn they around take hmp liverpool which i go to my hon and learn friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who be chair of the justice committee will remember that in there be a scathing report about the prison which have be turn around it be safe decent and rehabilitative and prisoner be do excellent work or take hmp chelmsford which have a un and have be turn around we take this issue incredibly seriously and we be the party that be invest record amount in our estate in government labour boast that it would bring in titan prison but it bring in 
 order secretary of state this be topical i have to get your colleague in and i be sure you would not want they to miss out 
 a number of my constituent in chipping barnet tell i that they continue to have problem with delay in get court judgment implement by bailiff will    the secretary of state do everything he can to tackle delay in the court and bailiff system especially for possession proceeding where there continue to be real problem cause delay and cost 
 i thank my right hon friend for that important point few than of tenancy require court action in but for difficult case that do escalate to the court the government recognise the importance of make sure that the process be smooth and efficient nearly of county court be currently list possession hearing within to week after a claim be receive on bailiff recruitment issue we be run recruitment campaign and have reduce administrative burden to free up resource for bailiff to focus on enforcement activity 
 the government ’s late panic measure to deal with the prison capacity crisis include expand the early release scheme to week have simply fuel the probation crisis instead with staff warn that many of these release be unsafe and result in recall in a matter of day can the minister confirm what specific extra resource he have recently put into this struggle service so that it can cope with the sharp rise in probation workload 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the work of probation i put on record as i know my shadow would and i know she would our gratitude to all those who work in our probation service over the long term since we have put an extra £ a year into the probation service and more staff in training she will have also see the recent announcement make by my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor in respect of the probation reset to enable probation officer to focus their time on where it make the great difference and have the great impact 
 we know that our prison be extremely full for the entirely understandable reason that the lord chancellor have set out but that often mean that they can not do the job of rehabilitation that we would all like they to will the minister look again at the proposal i put forward with the centre for social justice for a tough new sentence call the intensive control and rehabilitation order to be serve in the community but under strict condition include gps tag and compulsory course to reduce the likelihood of reoffende 
 i can confirm to my hon friend that official have review and consider icro which involve the use of electronic monitoring curfew arrangement and rehabilitative requirement target towards offender who would otherwise be in custody in june last year we begin a pilot of a scheme similar to the he propose involve intense supervision court which divert offender with complex need away from short custodial sentence and provide they with wrap around multi agency support to target the root cause of their offend behaviour 
 today at an event organise by my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain i be meet my constituent who be encourage by the solicitor firm ssb law to pursue no win no fee claim against defective cavity wall insulation provider ssb law subsequently go into administration leave my constituent with extortionate legal cost from defendant lawyer what step be the minister take to ensure that the solicitors regulation authority have the necessary power to provide my constituent with the protection compensation and justice that they deserve 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that important point on behalf of her constituent and i will write to she 
 it be now year since my constituent ellie gould be brutally murder in her own home her assailant be give a paltry and a half year sentence recently a man who kill a stranger in the street be give year but simultaneously on the same day someone who cut his wife up into hundred of piece and dispose of the part in a river be give a sentence start at only year the wade review recognise the terrible disparity between domestic murder and non domestic murder and call for that disparity to be correct will the secretary of state now tell we when he be go to reply to the wade review i hope that he will take due account of it and will equal up the sentence so that people who be guilty of domestic murder pay the same penalty as those who kill someone in the street 
 in response to the wade review we have increase sentence by introduce statutory aggravating factor for murder that be precede by control or coercive behaviour that involve overkill or that be connect with the end of a relationship we have also consult publicly on sentence starting point for murder precede by control or coercive behaviour and for murder commit with a knife or other weapon the government be carefully consider the response to the consultation and will publish their response in due course 
 the urgent notification issue last week to wandsworth prison raise the same issue find at hmp bedford month ago both reveal a horror show of violence and overcrowding in filthy environment with horrendous level of self harm and drug misuse the staff try their good but lack experience do the minister accept that it be his government ’s funding cut and policy failure that have deliver a broken justice system that offer little hope of reform for prisoner or protection for victim 
 no i do not accept the premise of the hon gentleman ’s question which may not surprise he in respect of bedford prison which he and i have speak about we continue to put the investment into both staff and the prison to make progress follow that urgent notification 
 a constituent recently attend my surgery in bishop auckland to disclose her serious concern about poor communication from both the children and family court advisory and support service and the family court appoint child ’s guardian in her case this be an extremely distressing time for she and her family so good communication be surely key how can the minister ensure that my constituent will receive the support and advice they need in a timely fashion 
 i thank my hon friend for be so assiduous in raise this important matter on behalf of her constituent we be invest heavily in the family system to deal with precisely these issue if something have go wrong in that specific case perhaps she will be kind enough to come to see i so that we can discuss it far 
 there be prisoner with indeterminate sentence for public protection languish in our prison of whom be year over their original tariff and of whom have a tariff of less than year and be now over tariff by year or more the moj ’s refresh ipp action plan clearly be not work so what do the secretary of state plan to do to fix this dire situation 
 the total number of ipp be slightly high than that but look into the datum the really significant factor be that whereas there be some ipp prisoner in the number who have not be release be down to around our action plan try to address that our reform be design to ensure that when ipp prisoner be release they do not face a licence period of year which can lead to they be recall at any time reduce it to year be a humane and sensible way of try to erase this stain on the conscience of our justice system 
 yesterday the new yorker publish a word inquiry into the lucy letby trial which raise enormous concern about both the logic and the competence of the statistical evidence that be a central part of the trial the article be block from publication on the uk internet i understand because of a court order i be sure that court order be well intended but it seem to i that it be in defiance of open justice will the lord chancellor look into this matter and report back to the house 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for raise this court order must be obey and a person can apply to the court for they to be remove that will need to take place in the normal course of event 
 on the lucy letby case i simply make the point that jury verdict must be respect if there be ground for an appeal that should take place in the normal way 
 taunton deane magistrate court have outstanding criminal case in the quarter of and the justice secretary ’s own constituency as of the end of december have these delay be let down victim their family witness and defendant while undermine public confidence in the criminal justice   system how do he plan to tackle this backlog will he provide those work tirelessly in our court with adequate support and resource to carry out their duty 
 we have increase capacity in the system we have open nightingale court include cirencester crown court in my county of gloucestershire we have increase the number of judge by we have put up to £ into legal aid we have raise the retirement age and we be ensure there be support for victim include through independent sexual violence adviser and independent domestic violence adviser and by introduce a rape support helpline and so on we be do everything we can to support victim to increase capacity in the system and to heal the damage cause by covid 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the lord chancellor will know that there be particular concern about the growth of the remand population in our prison which cause great disruption he will also know that the senior preside judge and other be take innovative measure to list remand case but will the lord chancellor confirm that to support that there will be no financial cap on sit day in the crown court 
 as always my hon and learn friend get to the heart of the matter before the pandemic around people be in custody await trial the figure be now close to which plainly have an impact it be because we do not get rid of jury trial which be the right thing to do i be grateful to the lord chief justice and the senior preside judge for consider remote hearing of bail application to ensure that more lawyer be able to do the case have enough practitioner as well as sit day be critical and both will have my attention 
 last week ’s letter to the justice secretary from the chief inspector of prison again highlight the dreadful condition in wandsworth prison will the secretary of state take urgent step to end the overcrowding 
 the hon lady be right to raise this hard hit searing report i be interested to note that although there be a full complement of officer the prison simply be not deliver the regime that it should we absolutely accept that of course the high remand population be an issue at wandsworth but cardiff and liverpool have achieve fantastic result it can be turn around so we be respond rapidly we have already invest heavily and £ have be spend we have already deploy extra staff at all grade and we will be provide support a prison standard coaching team be offer face to face coach for band officer with further deployment shortly 
 i appreciate that an inquiry be be conduct regard the horizon scandal but what be the department do to hold to account those lawyer who prosecute sub postmaster despite the evidence be to the contrary 
 anybody who appear in court but particularly prosecutor must be mindful of their solemn and sacred duty to disclose material to the defence that might reasonably be consider capable of undermine the case for the prosecution that be literally the   most important rule if they fail in this case i would expect the appropriate authority to take robust and prompt action 
 for the final question i call imran hussain 
 since i last raise this question with minister it have now be estimate that there be more than victim of the ssb law scandal as my hon friend   the member for bradford south judith cummins   say we be host an event later today to listen to those victim talk about the real impact on their life i extend an invitation to the minister will he commit to my ask of real compensation and protection for the victim of what be now a national scandal 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that kind invitation i will consider it and respond in due course 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for home department if he will make a statement on the high court judgment in belfast of   may   disapplye the illegal migration act in northern ireland 
 let i start by express the government ’s disappointment at this judgment we continue to believe that our policy be lawful that our approach be compatible with international law and specifically that the illegal migration act proposal be compatible with article of the windsor framework the government will take step to defend their position include through an appeal we have consistently make it clear that the right commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover issue such as illegal migration 
 this judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act we continue to work to get regular flight off to rwanda in the come week and nothing will distract we from that or from deliver to the timetable i have set out we must start the flight to stop the boat 
 the government have consistently apply immigration law on a uk wide basis it be important to remember that those who have be serve a notice for removal to rwanda be be consider under the nationality and borders act and the safety of rwanda act this judgment relate to the illegal migration act and so do not impact our operation or plan for rwanda 
 preparation to begin flight within week be continue at pace as the prime minister make clear nothing will distract we from the job of implement the rwanda policy we must start the flight to stop the boat that be the fair thing to do it be the right thing to do for our country and it be the humane thing to do our conviction that the rwanda scheme be lawful and necessary be unchanged we be act in the national interest and we will not be deter 
 i be grateful for that response and i thank the minister of state in the northern ireland office and the secretary of state for northern ireland for be present today but we need not be here as the issue elucidate yesterday by the high court in belfast be fairly and thoroughly explore in this house and in the other place during the passage of both the illegal migration act and the safety of rwanda act when my colleague and i raise these concern here in parliament we be tell by the government that we be wrong yet the high court in belfast say yesterday that we be right the only difference between the encroachment on the application of our sovereign immigration policy in northern ireland as of the rest of the united kingdom by the illegal migration act be that a case be advanced on the basis of that act yet a case on the safety of    rwanda act have not yet be consider however the government will know that the rationale outline yesterday by the high court for the illegal migration act will similarly apply to the safety of rwanda act as well 
 it need not be so although the government choose to dismiss the concern we outline in this house and that our colleague outline in the other place they have an opportunity to put this issue beyond doubt i table an amendment to new clause along with my colleague give the government the opportunity to put the issue to bed in order to maintain the integrity of this country ’s sovereign immigration policy and the integrity and protection of our border but they choose not to do so i be grateful that the minister have indicate his willingness to appeal but when they have the opportunity to put the issue beyond doubt why do they not do that do they recognise that in not do so they have significantly impair the uniformity of the uk ’s immigration policy 
 in long before the eu be envisage and long before the uk join and then depart the island of great britain and ireland have an integrity in immigration policy the common travel area apply what step be the government take to get a british isles solution to immigration outside the control of the eu and outside as it be the schengen area finally what step will the minister and his government take to assert parliament ’s sovereign will to protect the border of the united kingdom 
 i be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his constructive tone as he eloquently make his case i note the narrative that he have advance the government be consider judgment very carefully as you would expect mr speaker and we be take legal advice i can reconfirm as the prime minister say yesterday that the government intend to appeal the judgment 
 we have consistently make it clear that the right commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover reserved issue such as illegal migration we be equally clear that immigration be a reserved matter that have always be apply uniformly across the uk we do not accept that the good friday agreement should be read so creatively as to extend to matter such as tackle illegal migration which be a uk wide issue and not in any way relate to the original intention of the good friday agreement 
 on the specific point about the common travel area all immigration legislation provide a uk wide framework for legal and illegal migration we continue to have a constructive work relationship with the irish government when it come to ensure that abuse of the common travel area be robustly and appropriately tackle on the specific point about assert parliament ’s sovereign will around these matter i would argue that the recent safety of rwanda act clearly assert parliament ’s sovereign will while the late judgment relate to the ima we be committed to appeal it 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 this case together with the case a few month ago about the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation   act have a common theme the applicability of article of the windsor framework and the direct application of eu law what be the government go to do about that will they seek to expedite the appeal directly to the supreme court it seem to i this be a fundamental issue that need resolve far will they seek further clarification either from the joint committee on the northern ireland protocol or by other mean to clarify the situation and protect non devolved matter from be deal with in this way 
 i be always grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his contribution he speak with real authority give his professional background his role in this house and his former position as a distinguished secretary of state and lord chancellor he will recognise that the court will make its final order in week when an appeal can be bring he make a number of observation on which ministers will reflect when take decision but as i have say and as the prime minister have make very clear it be our intention to appeal this judgment we think that it be right and proper to take all step necessary to defend our position 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the conservative chaos continue it truly beggar belief that just week after the prime minister negotiate the windsor framework in february last year he promptly bring forward immigration legislation that appear to have leave northern ireland with immigration rule that be different from those for the rest of the uk concern about the illegal migration act be raise at the time by   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson as he have just point out why do the government choose to ignore his warning i do not believe that the minister answer the question that the right hon gentleman just put to he 
 we on the labour benches be utterly commit to uphold both the good friday agreement and the windsor framework in all their dimension but this government appear to be more committed to their fail illegal migration act can the minister assure the house that nothing that the government do will in any way compromise the good friday agreement or the windsor framework 
 for those who be understandably struggle to keep up with the never end stream of immigration legislation that have be flow from this government the illegal migration act be the of bills all of which have goal in mind send asylum seeker to rwanda and all of which be completely fail on their own term it have be a shamble from start to finish meanwhile we on the labour benches be clear about the problem that we face large number of desperate asylum seeker be cross continent exploit by criminal smuggling gang who operate route across the english channel and be be meet by an incompetent and clueless conservative government who have lose control of our border and be addict to headline chase gimmick 
 in contrast the labour party would never have go down the rwanda rabbit hole instead of waste taxpayer money on rwanda we would introduce a new border   security command with extra resource and new power to go after the criminal gang instead of use expensive asylum hotel we will deliver our backlog clearance plan and will have a new return unit to remove people with no right to be in the uk i once again urge the minister to stop flog this dead horse of a rwanda policy and to instead adopt labour ’s pragmatic plan to stop the tories small boat chaos and fix our broken asylum system 
 different week same rant week on week we hear the same rant about the opposition ’s position but they have no credible plan to stop the flow of people cross the channel i simply do not accept the shadow minister ’s characterisation of the situation let i be clear for he yes we will uphold our legal obligation we be committed to that but the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act do not engage the good friday agreement include the right chapter those right seek to address long stand specific issue relate to northern ireland ’s past and do not extend to matter engage by the act i should also reiterate for he because perhaps he miss this that we be operationalise the rwanda policy on the basis of the nationality and borders act 
 as for the opposition front benchers very scant alternative for tackle illegal migration which the shadow minister today again proffer to the house i can tell he that we have already double national crime agency funding for immigration and crime we already have thousand of official work on this matter in the migration and border directorate in practice his policy mean a migrant amnesty and let thousand of illegal migrant who should not be here stay in the uk indefinitely he would end the rwanda scheme the leader of the opposition have be very clear that he would end that come what may but it be already work and deter people from make crossing the opposition would allow ten of thousand of claim to be lodge from outside the united kingdom undo all the progress we have make in address the asylum backlog they would also do a deal with the european union that will not stop the boat take asylum seeker every year from eu country i do not think that be a credible offering to the country the opposition just do not get it they be try to take the public for fool fortunately we have a plan and we be get on and deliver on it we be deliver resource and we will see our plan through 
 will my hon friend indicate the extent to which the illegal migration act the windsor framework and the european union withdrawal agreement act as it relate to the sovereignty of the whole united kingdom include northern ireland could have be word sufficiently clearly and unambiguously to remove the ground for this judgment in line with the disapplication principle set out in paragraph of the supreme court judgment on rwanda from last november which be extremely clear 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his contribution i refer he and all right hon and hon member to the position that i have set out the government be clear that the will of parliament have be express on these issue the position be as i have set out and we will robustly defend it 
 we come to the snp spokesperson 
 the snp welcome the judgment from the high court of belfast and thank the northern ireland human rights commission and the individual in the other case for take this matter forward it be important that these awful piece of legislation be challenge i note to the minister that this judgment come from a domestic court not the international court that the government seem so terribly afraid of and consistently run down the court find that the illegal migration act be incompatible with article of the windsor framework and with the european convention on human right section and of the act lead to a diminution of right the court also find incompatibility between the act and the human rights act on the duty to remove obligation to potential victim of modern slavery and human trafficking and responsibility to child and their good interest all extremely serious matter that remain of concern 
 as   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   say all this be entirely predictable the government be warn about the implication for the good friday agreement throughout proceeding on the illegal migration act and the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act can the minister say why his government fail to heed the warning and expert advice why do they ignore the status of northern ireland and what now for the applicability of the rwanda act in northern ireland 
 my fellow scottish mp and i be disturb by the fact that our constituent neighbour and friend be not even afford the same right as those in northern ireland what be the implication of that decision for the union human right should be for all of we 
 i can probably answer that question fairly rapidly we fully understand the position of the scottish national party which have be consistently express during the passage of the various piece of legislation the snp do not support the government in our effort to tackle illegal migration head on the position be as i have describe i will not give a running commentary on ongoing litigation but we be determined to appeal this judgment we be take legal advice and as i have say i can be very clear that the judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act concern have be express about migrant flock to northern ireland to avoid deportation to rwanda but there be absolutely no benefit whatsoever to do so we be operationalise this policy on the basis of the nationality and borders act 
 i thank my hon friend for come to the chamber i hope he be enjoy life back at the home office in the decision the judge find that section 7a of the european union withdrawal act as amend by the windsor framework must be read as mean that northern ireland be effectively to be treat as part of the european union i believe the assurance give to i at the time but be it not patently clear now that the windsor framework have operate in a way that undermine our sovereignty   and northern ireland ’s place in the united kingdom and have fundamentally fail on its contact with reality 
 i refer my right hon and learn friend to what i have say about our determination to appeal the judgment as she know from real experience immigration be a reserved matter and policy should be apply consistently across the uk as we have do consistently to date 
 the european convention on human right be not just a key part of the uk ’s unwritten constitution but fundamental to the good friday agreement that be where the commitment to the vindication of right flow from yes brexit and the provision that have follow have underpin those right and have allow for the pursuance of a remedy perhaps those who champion the brexit project might step through the consequence of their action well in future i be glad that our region have additional protection but the ruling be very clear the illegal migration act be not compatible with human right and the declaration of incompatibility have implication in all jurisdiction be it not time that the government develop an actual strategy that focus on safe route target people smuggle gang and invest in efficient processing be it not time we have an actual plan instead of this £ performance of cruelty 
 i profoundly disagree with the hon lady ’s stance on brexit and i respectfully disagree with her interpretation and characterisation of the situation that we be discuss we have see over half a people come to this country via safe and legal route since we can all be enormously proud of that as a country but there be a moral imperative to shut down the evil criminal gang that be responsible for take people ’s money and bring they across the channel in unseaworthy vessel with no regard whatsoever for human life for whether those people arrive safely 
 we will do everything necessary within our power to put those evil criminal gang out of business to date we have make progress through the plan that have be deliver but this be the important next step in render the business model redundant i urge the hon lady to rethink her position it be not good enough to say it ’ all too difficult and just allow unlimited number of people to make those very dangerous crossing without have an alternative country to relocate people to when there be no prospect of remove they to their country of origin 
 we vote in a referendum to end the rule of eu law throughout the united kingdom include northern ireland give the muddle that the court be create be not the only way out of this an urgent short piece of legislation that assert beyond doubt that we control our own border 
 the government believe that we have a legal basis for this i recognise my right hon friend ’s determination for we to get on and deliver on the rwanda policy that be precisely what we be do on the basis of the nationality and borders act at this stage but when it come to the ima we believe that we have a strong legal basis and that be why we be appeal the judgment 
 across the united kingdom include northern ireland there be of our fellow human being who have arrive in the uk since march last year and be in limbo their claim be not even be triaged while they await a country to take they the government know that most of these folk will turn out to be genuine refugee if their case be ever assess they be nevertheless sit rot at the taxpayer ’s expense vulnerable to exploitation and unable to move on even this government admit that the majority will never go to rwanda so what be the government ’s plan for those soul 
 we be clearly commit to commence the illegal migration act as soon as possible the hon gentleman will know about the work that have go on in the home office over the last year or so that have dramatically improve asylum decision make productivity all effort that would be out of the window be those on the opposition front bench to form a government we will take appropriate decision on individual cohort i will not get into that on the floor of the house today 
 that ’s your job 
 the hon gentleman keep chuntere from a sedentary position but the fact be that we take appropriate cohort relate decision the message must be very clear that people should not be come to the united kingdom via perilous journey on small boat that be not an acceptable position to be advocate we will not advocate that position and will continue to take step to address it the message should go out very clearly to anyone think of get in a small boat do not do it 
 many in northern ireland will want to understand the practical implication of this court case if as some expect it mean that northern ireland have become a more attractive place for someone who have arrive in britain on a small boat what be the government do to investigate plan for and manage that and to ensure that it do not have cost implication for the northern ireland executive or local authority in northern ireland 
 what i can say to my right hon friend who of course take a real interest in all matter northern ireland be that we be operationalise the rwanda policy on a uk wide basis the legal foundation for that be the nationality and borders act as i say early there be no benefit to anybody who think that go to northern ireland will lead to their not be in scope for relocation to rwanda that be not the case the position be clear and we be get on and operationalise the policy use the legal footing that be already available to we 
 the government can make as many appeal promise from the dispatch box and agreement about safeguard the union as they want but the fact remain that because of the pathetic handover of northern ireland to the european union eu law now extend to and must be apply in northern ireland as the judge make clear yesterday the result be that we have another hole in the government ’s immigration policy a national immigration policy now   dictate by the eu northern ireland will become a back door in the united kingdom and that will hasten the day when we have people control as well as good control between northern ireland and gb do the minister recognise that unless we remove the source of the problem namely the commitment in the withdrawal agreement it will continue 
 there be no merit whatsoever in the suggestion that the uk would hand northern ireland over to the european union on the matter that we be debate today the judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or about the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act we continue to work to get regular flight off to rwanda in the come week and nothing will distract we from that or from deliver to the timetable that i set out we must start the flight to stop the boat i have be consistently clear that the commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover issue such as illegal migration we will take all step to defend that position include through appeal those be the word of the prime minister as i say we be operationalise the rwanda policy on a uk wide basis and we will see through the commitment that we have make 
 on the windsor framework we tell you so on the judgment itself legally all road lead not to rome but in this case to strasbourg and the european convention on human right the convention be draft for perfectly honourable reason in the aftermath of the horror of the world war but that be over year ago it have now clearly be overtake by event and international migration flow have not the time now come for a conservative government to include in our election manifesto a clear commitment to seek to negotiate that convention with our european partner and should those negotiation fail to leave it if we be not prepared to walk away they will never take we seriously 
 i refer my right hon friend to the government ’s stance on the legal position in relation to the illegal migration act i would also say that for illegal migrant all road lead to rwanda and for the people smuggler responsible for that evil criminality all road lead to prison 
 i strongly welcome the logical and inevitable judgment from the high court of northern ireland if the government want to have a national immigration policy they must repeal the illegal migration act repeal the safety of rwanda act and have a human right compliant policy back in the government of the uk and ireland make the solemn pledge to the people of northern ireland that the right of everyone reside in the community would be protect can the minister give a cast iron assurance that under no circumstance will article of the windsor framework or the good friday agreement be unpicked in the pursuit of this rabbit hole of a rwanda plan 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the position that i have set out in relation to the good friday agreement i will not give a run commentary   about the litigation which be as he will appreciate ongoing i absolutely and definitively disagree with he on the utility or sense in repeal the various piece of illegal migration legislation that he be so vehemently against i respectfully disagree with he on that that legislation be help we to make the progress that we need to put those criminal gang out of business and ultimately save life in the channel i do not think that there be anything more serious for a government than that we place it front and centre in the work that we be do 
 it be clear to i that northern ireland have just as much right as anywhere else in the uk to have a deterrent to illegal migration so aspect of this concern i a few week ago the irish government be say that they should be able to return some illegal migrant who may have go from the uk to the republic of ireland do the minister think that the irish government would be well off take that up with france if the french take the return of illegal migrant who have enter our country we would probably not have this problem in the place 
 as i say from the dispatch box last week the position be very clear we be not willing to have that relationship with the irish government and take the return of illegal migrant that would need to be progress at an eu level we think that the european union should take back those illegal migrant i think that go to the heart of the point that my hon friend have make 
 thus far the minister have not take the opportunity to respond to the query from my right hon friend   the member for belfast east gavin robinson   about why the government decline the offer make from the dup benches which would have avoid the judgment that we have hear about will he do so now he have indicate that the government plan to appeal but if the appeal fail what then 
 i do not think it wise to speculate on hypothetical situation we be determined that there be a strong legislative basis and we will defend it through the appeal as for debate that have be and go the hon gentleman will recognise that i be not the minister at that time but it be fair to say that the record will speak for itself on the debate that be have 
 we need only look at the situation in dublin to see what happen when illegal migration become an issue and be not handle correctly and to understand the strength of pursue our rwanda policy although that policy be be dismiss by some it be interesting that as i be sure the minister have notice other across europe be start to look to it for a solution to this question the question if not rwanda where do you want to remove people to have never be answer by labour 
 in the light of the judgment can the minister reassure i on a couple of point will the uk remain the uk border in term of migration policy so that there be no prospect of have any form of check on people between great britain and northern ireland which would effectively mean a border within the united   kingdom secondly will the operation of the rwanda plan be base on as he say the nationality and borders act and on the recently pass legislation the stop shop and the child age assessment which be vital in get a grip on this issue be the plan be take forward on that basis rather than on the basis of the illegal migration act which be the core point from this judgment 
 my hon friend always speak with authority when it come to these issue and he have extensive experience have be a minister in the home office i can absolutely say that we will continue to apply migration policy on a uk wide basis the uk border will remain that he be right to highlight the nationality and borders act and he should be proud of the effort that he take forward in government to help deliver it labour member consistently oppose it in answer to his question about where labour would send people which i know he ask a few week ago we be still none the wiser the truth be that the basis upon which we be able to advance the policy at this stage be the nationality and borders act he can be confident in that basis we be get on and deliver on it 
 of course this judgment have uk wide relevance because of the declaration of incompatibility under the human rights act in our report on the illegal migration act and the rwanda policy the joint committee on human rights have repeatedly warn that many aspect of the government ’s asylum policy breach the human rights act that be not just our view but the weight of the expert evidence that we hear in fact those with legal expertise who disagree with our finding be decidedly thin on the ground this judgment vindicate our position that on a number of front the government ’s asylum policy breach the human rights act particularly as regard the duty to remove as such will the minister confirm that the government will respect the rule of law and not take any step to deport anyone under the rwanda scheme until the relevant avenue of appeal in this case be exhausted and it be clarify that such removal would be lawful
