there be nothing that would make i give such drastic advice the truth about the apprenticeship levy be that of it will be spend this year we can look in the rear view mirror and there be some report   go back over time that show some underspend in the levy but they be back over time we be now spend of the levy perhaps what the hon gentleman have not appreciate be that some of the funding go to the devolved government if we examine the apprenticeship system in wales and scotland it be not a patch on what we have introduce in england 
 the progress in international reading literacy study be publish in may this year england have come among country that test child of the same age and year old in we introduce the phonic screening check test year old for their progress in reading and phonic in that year of pupil reach the expect standard by just before the pandemic the proportion have rise to follow a transformation in the teaching of phonic in nearly all primary school 
 of course the secretary of state will agree as she have just say to i we be spend record amount of funding on school the secretary of state achieve an extra £ in the autumn statement last year and we be now spend £ on school funding we have recruit more teacher this year than last year and we have a record number of teacher in the profession at but of course i be happy to talk to the hon lady and the teacher in her constituency to discuss their particular concern 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to announce the publication of the government ’s high education reform consultation response this country be of the good in the world for study in high education boast of the world ’s top university for most high education be a sound investment with graduate expect to earn on average £ more over their lifetime than those who do not go to university 
 however there be still pocket of high education provision where the promise that university education will be worthwhile do not hold true and where an unacceptable number of student do not finish their study or find a good job after graduate that can not continue it be not fair to taxpayer who subsidise that education but most of all it be not fair to those student who be be sell a promise of a well tomorrow only to be disappoint and end up pay far into the future for a degree that do not offer they good value 
 we want to make sure that student be charge a fair price for their study and that a university education offer a good return our reform be aim at achieve that objective that be why the government launch the consultation in to seek view on policy base on recommendation make by sir philip augar and his independent panel the consultation end in may and the department for education have be consider the response receive i be now able to set out the programme of reform that we be take forward 
 i believe that the traditional degree continue to hold great value but it be not the only high education pathway over the past year we have make substantial reform to ensure that the traditional route be not the only pathway to a good career high technical qualification massively enhance student skill and career prospect and deserve parity of esteem with undergraduate degree we have see a growth in degree level apprenticeship with over student enrol since their introduction in i have ask the office for student to establish a £ competitive degree apprenticeship fund to drive forward capacity building project to broaden access to degree apprenticeship over the next year 
 that drive to encourage skill be why we be also invest up to £ to help provider deliver high technical education in march we set out detailed information on how the lifelong learning entitlement will transform the way in which individual can undertake post-18 education and we continue to support that transformation through the lifelong learning higher education fee limits bill which be currently pass through the other place we anticipate that that funding couple with the introduction of the lle from will help to incentivise the take up of high technical education fill vital skill gap across the country 
 each of those reform have have simple premise that we be educate people with the skill that will enable they to have a long and fulfilling career i believe that we should have the same expectation for high education it should prepare student for life by give they the right skill and knowledge to get well pay job with the advent of the lle it be neither fair nor   right for student to use potentially quarter of their lifelong learning entitlement for a university degree that do not offer they good return that would constrain their future ability to learn earn and retrain we must shrink the part of the sector that do not deliver value and ensure that student and taxpayer be get value for money give their considerable investment 
 datum show that there be provider from which few than of graduate progress to high skilled employment or further study month after graduate that be not acceptable i will therefore issue statutory guidance to the ofs set out that it should impose recruitment limit on provision that do not meet its rigorous quality requirement for positive student outcome to help to constrain the size and growth of course that do not deliver for student we will also ask the ofs to consider how it can incorporate graduate earning into its quality regime we recognise that many factor can influence graduate earning but student have a right to expect that their investment in high education will improve their career prospect and we should rightly scrutinise course that appear to offer limited add value to student on the metric that matter most to many 
 we will work with the ofs to consider franchising arrangement in the sector all organisation that deliver high education must be hold to robust standard i be concern about some indication that franchising be act as a potential route for low quality to seep into the high education system and i be absolutely clear that lead provider have a responsibility to ensure that franchised provision be of the same quality as directly deliver provision if we find example of undesirable practice we will not hesitate to act far on franchising 
 as i have say we will ensure that student be charge a fair price for their study that be why we be also reduce to £ the fee for classroom base foundation year course such as business study and social science in line with the high standard funding rate for access to he diploma recently we have see an explosion in the growth of many such course but limited evidence that they be in the good interest of student we be not reduce the fee limit for high cost strategically important subject such as veterinary science and medicine but we want to ensure that foundation year be not use to add to the bottom line of institution at the expense of those who study they we will continue to monitor closely the growth of foundation year provision and we will not hesitate to introduce further restriction or reduction i want provider to consider whether those course add value for student and to phase out that provision in favour of a broad range of tertiary option with the advent of the lle 
 our aim be that everyone who want to benefit from high education have the opportunity to do so that be why we will not proceed at this time with a minimum requirement of academic attainment to access student finance although we will keep that option under review i be confident that the sector will respond with the ambition and focused collaboration require to deliver this package of reform i extend my wholehearte thank to those in the sector for their response to the consultation 
 this package of reform represent the next step in tackle low quality high education but it will not be the last step the government will not shy away from   further action if require and will consider all lever available to we if these quality reform do not result in the improvement we seek our high education system be admire across many country and these measure will ensure that it continue to be i commend this statement to the house 
 yes the university of buckingham have take an excellent leadership position and its year degree be very much welcome by many people we will introduce the lifelong learning entitlement which will revolutionise how and when people go to university what type of course they take for what period of time and how they make those decision over their entire career and lifetime

 hospitality and tourism be an industry worth £ a year to cumbria and it be our big employer apprenticeship be an important way into a career within that sector the problem be that t level be a useful stepping stone into apprenticeship yet the government have again kick into the long grass the t level on catering have already take out the hospitality element of that will the secretary of state meet i and representative from cumbria tourism so we can talk about how she can change that policy and so that more young people can enter that important profession 
 i be happy to meet the hon gentleman as he will know i always have a laser like focus on quality and if the quality be not good enough then i will not release the apprenticeship the apprenticeship standard or the t level too often we have have low quality qualification in this country and it be important that we work with a vast array of business to ensure that we get the quality system that they demand and that will be good for all our young people 
 may i beg the minister to pay attention to the fact that good apprenticeship and good training in any town and city must come from a blend of good university i think most of our university be good with local further education college will she take a leaf out of tony blair ’s book when he say in a recent important speech that what we need be more high class university and more polytechnic make up from the new former fe college 
 as usual we be ahead of the opposition we have already invest in institute of technology which be where a group of college and university work with employer in the area they be a great addition to the landscape along with all the other technical qualification and skill training that we have introduce since 
 i welcome the funding make available to the space system engineering degree apprenticeship and the opportunity that will provide young people in the uk ’s grow space industry what plan do minister have to fund similar apprenticeship in other emerge sector 
 it be a great pleasure to go to the space park in leicester to launch the space system engineering level degree apprenticeship on top of the level space engineering apprenticeship which i launch previously there be many different route into the space industry which be important and something that we be good at in the uk any employer or employer group wish to develop an apprenticeship standard could work with the institute for apprenticeships and technical education we have work with more than employer in the past few year and we have build more than apprenticeship standard none of which exist before we start the programme in 
 i call the shadow minister 
 new research from the house of commons library have show that the amount of the apprenticeship levy pay by employer that have be allocate to the apprenticeship budget have fall from in to just in the most recent year the truthful answer to the question from   the hon member for stroud siobhan baillie   be that the secretary of state be do nothing to reform the apprenticeship levy as she believe it be work perfectly can the minister confirm that any employer that like the hon member for stroud want great flexibility in the levy should vote labour in the next general election 
 there be nothing that would make i give such drastic advice the truth about the apprenticeship levy be that of it will be spend this year we can look in the rear view mirror and there be some report   go back over time that show some underspend in the levy but they be back over time we be now spend of the levy perhaps what the hon gentleman have not appreciate be that some of the funding go to the devolved governments.[official report   july vol c. 15mc if we examine the apprenticeship system in wales and scotland it be not a patch on what we have introduce in england 
 what step she be take to support severely absent pupil with their attendance 
 what step she be take to tackle persistent absence in secondary school 
 school attendance be important for not just a child ’s education but their wellbeing and life chance and it be a personal priority we have roll out the daily attendance datum tool launch the attendance action alliance group of system leader which include representative from health policing and social care expand the attendance hub support and deploy expert advice to work with local authority termly persistent absence fall by a from summer last year to spring this year with few persistently absent pupil but we know we still have more to do and it be a top priority for i 
 do the secretary of state agree that shut school during covid lockdown be a disaster for child and their mental health and have lead to an explosion in severely absent rate will she make sure that can not happen again by classify all education setting include school college and university as essential infrastructure to ensure they remain open during national emergency 
 school be not shut during lockdown many of our fantastic teacher be still teach key cohort support our nhs and the most vulnerable such as those with special educational need but i fully share my right hon friend ’s concern about the impact that the pandemic have have on attainment attendance and mental health she know we be work hard to recover make almost £ available for recovery i can assure she that we will always seek to minimise the disruption to education in emergency situation we all have a lot to learn from the experience during the pandemic include the impact on child of all the decision that we take which be lead by medical advice 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 it be good to hear the secretary of state prioritise get child into school alongside her welcome fund pay offer which will hopefully see an end to disruptive strike a real drive to reduce persistent absence and increase attendance would be welcome a long stand recommendation of the education committee be a statutory register of child not in school which she be well aware of and have tell we be a priority may i therefore urge she to rapidly adopt the private member ’s bill of my hon friend   the member for meon valley mrs drummond   so that we can get on with deliver on that priority 
 i thank my hon friend for his committee ’s work on this issue which really be important we have a world class education system but we need child in school to be able to take advantage of that as he know my department remain committed to legislate for statutory local authority register of child not in school and will do so at the next suitable legislative opportunity when parliamentary time allow i will work closely with my hon friend   the member for meon valley mrs drummond   on how we can well introduce that 
 i thank the secretary of state very much for her response it be obvious that she be committed to make thing well in the light of the covid home schooling period during which parent may have forget the importance of socialisation as well as academic education many may need reminding of the legal obligation to educate child have the department consider tidy up the intervention period to allow early intervention and discussion with parent where possible before any action be take 
 we be very much take a supportive approach we know that there be complex reason why some child be miss school some have lose their confidence and be anxious about school and how far they be behind so we be take a focused approach we have lead in local authority work closely with school and we be measure the impact of all the thing we be do which include attendance hub as well as look to support parent to get their child back into school where we know their outcome will be so much well 
 what progress her department have make on improve standard of attainment in mathematic in primary school 
 ofsted ’s report on school math publish last week state 
 in the last few year a resounding positive shift in mathematic education have take place in primary school 
 in the timss international survey of math attainment for year pupil england achieve its high ever score and rise from out of country in to out of country 
 it be clearly good news that of young people be achieve or exceed the expect grade at the standard assessment test measure have be take to catch up after covid which be really good news but it be important that we lie the foundation in primary school so that young people love mathematic and can continue to work on it until they be what measure be my right hon friend take to ensure that 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in addition to expand the successful math hub programme to deliver teaching for mastery to of primary school by we be increase delivery of the master number programme for reception to year which help student achieve fluency with number bond to school by we will also extend the programme into year and to bolster fluency in time table 
 what step she be take to help ensure the availability of high quality childcare 
 what step her department be take to increase the number of childcare place 
 at the spring statement we announce the single large investment in childcare in england ever by the government will be spend in excess of £ double the amount that we do now and help work family with their childcare cost 
 good quality childcare be essential to a child ’s early development to parent and to the economy the owner of the best friends day nursery and the spinney day nursery in chester have tell i of the real struggle face by so many nursery across the country despite the government ’s late funding announcement many have be force to close include nursery in the hoole area alone in year what more will the government do to alleviate the situation set out by my constituent 
 as i have mention we be put the single large ever investment into childcare over the next few year to provide funding to setting such as the she mention we be also look at thing such as workforce which we know can be a challenge make sure that we remove barrier to additional route to entry 
 south west hertfordshire be home to lot of young couple particularly those who have move out of london to start their family could the minister tell the house how her department be support new parent as they return to work 
 that be a huge priority for this government the funding that we be set out will provide parent with support worth on average £ a year from maternity leave right up to primary school we be do additional work to support thing such as wraparound care 
 i call the shadow minister 
 across the early year sector nursery and childminder be raise concern that the government have no coherent plan for the expansion of the early year workforce to meet the requirement of an expand offer the only idea on the table so far be the relaxation of ratio and a reduction in the proportion of level qualified staff plan that the sutton trust have find could lead to bad outcome for child why be this government so uninterested in the quality of childcare and the outcome that high quality early year education deliver for child 
 the government care about education standard that be see across every single result across the board whether read or math result it be this government who care about education standard over of our early year provider be rat good or outstanding we will do everything we can to keep they that way

 what step she be take to support the recruitment and retention of teacher in the further education sector 
 what recent estimate she have make of the number of teacher leave the teaching profession 
 our teacher do an incredible job and inspire child every day last week we accept the independent pay review body ’s recommendation in full give schoolteacher their large pay award for year of at least i also announce funding for the further education sector to address key priority include teacher recruitment and retention to help we get more of the top talent into teaching we be deliver on our manifesto commitment to raise the start salary for teacher to a minimum of £ that be a competitive salary that will help we to continue to build on the record number of teacher in our school in england 
 the further education sector be face a teaching crisis not fully address by the pay review body in my constituency east durham college have have teacher vacancy in engineering and a computer science position unfilled for month barrier to recruitment include high workload qualification reform excessive assessment and a huge pay disparity compare with comparable work in industry could the secretary of state tell we what step she be take to ensure that further education teaching be an attractive and viable career 
 i very much care about further education and ensure that it have the funding that be why as of last week we be invest an additional £ in the financial year and £ in to drive forward skill delivery in further education the government do not set pay for the fe sector however i have be clear that i expect that funding which be new funding to go to the frontline i hope the investment will support the fe sector to address its recruitment and retention challenge in addition we introduce bursary of £ for stem science technology engineering and math subject and the taking teaching further programme be work with industry and pay £ to attract those from industry who want to spend their career in fe teaching 
 we have see a significant increase in the number of teacher leave the profession in durham they be burn out and their unmanageable workload be make hard by support staff redundancy in school where there be an absence of furniture and equipment with child even carry chair between lesson so that there be somewhere to sit teacher say to i it be like be a baker with no flour a delivery driver without a van an it specialist without a computer when will the department provide the absolute basic for our school in durham 
 we be go even far than the basic because we will be fund education high than we have ever fund it in our history it will be £ next year but i do take workload seriously as part of our discussion with the union we have agree to set up a workload taskforce which have a target to remove hour from the school working week in addition to the hour we have already reduce last year more teacher enter the profession than leave it enter the profession and leave it if we look at the average the leaver rate have be stable since but we be invest more in our education system than ever before 
 particularly challenging area of work for teacher be special need education there be many who want to work in that field but in essex our special need school be unfortunately already full to burst that be why today i be launch a campaign for a new special need school in south essex i meet the minister for schools my right hon friend   the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb   in advance and he be very helpful will the secretary of state and the schools minister work with i and essex county council to try to get we the additional special need place in essex that parent and special need child so desperately need 
 i absolutely agree with my right hon friend this be something we have already announce we will invest £ in build more special school we be get another in sussex and many hon member be get more special educational need school in their area we would be very happy to work with he and essex county council to ensure the right provision in essex for all child who have additional need 
 i pay tribute to all the staff and teacher at my local fe college basingstoke college of technology for all the work they do to ensure that young people in my constituency be ready for work the reform of btec be cause some uncertainty when it come to staffing for the future in the college will my right hon friend join i and headteacher anthony bravo for a meeting to discuss those concern so that we can continue to ensure that the young people of basingstoke be work ready in large number 
 yes i be always happy to meet my right hon friend and her college i have have many meeting on this subject we be focus on ensure that high quality t level be introduce across the country in all college so that young people can access they we be also look side by side to see what btec qualification will sit alongside a level as part of our level offer 
 what step her department be take to help increase the number of foster care placement 
 we know that we need more foster carer that be a really important part of our plan stable homes build on love to reform the care system we be invest £ in recruitment and retention over the next year we have also increase the national minimum allowance for foster parent by as part of those plan 
 do my hon friend agree that foster carer can play a vital role in improve the health and wellbeing of a look after child and that we need to encourage more people to go into foster care by remove unnecessary bureaucratic barrier so that we can build a network of foster carer across the country to improve the life chance of child in care 
 this be a big priority for i some child end up in child ’s home when they should have end up with foster carer so we need to recruit more as i have say we be make a significant investment in recruitment and retention so that we can keep some of our brilliant experienced foster carer as well as attract more into the system 
 what step her department be take to improve standard of reading of primary age child 
 the progress in international reading literacy study be publish in may this year england have come among country that test child of the same age and year old in we introduce the phonic screening check test year old for their progress in reading and phonics.[official report   july vol c. 15mc in that year of pupil reach the expect standard by just before the pandemic the proportion have rise to follow a transformation in the teaching of phonic in nearly all primary school 
 will my right hon friend join i in thank the national literacy trust and bloomsbury publishing for include a number of school in hastings and st leonards in their pioneer new reading programme which be specifically aim at persuade more child to read for pleasure and will he encourage parent and carer to engage in a programme that be a vital part of their child ’s development 
 i recently meet jonathan douglas of the national literacy trust and i thank the trust for its enormous contribution to raise the profile of reading for pleasure in school its new programme which as my hon friend say it launch in partnership with bloomsbury involve work with brighton academies trust school throughout hastings to encourage more child to read for pleasure 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in its white paper for school publish last year the government ’s headline ambition be for of pupil leave primary school to meet the expect standard in reading writing and math why do the minister think that since that pledge ten of thousand more child have be leave primary school without meet those standard 
 as the hon gentleman will know owe to the pandemic we do see a fall in writing and math standard read standard rise and then fall by point this year however reading standard today be broadly similar to those before the pandemic and since both reading and math have improve enormously in primary school throughout the country i be confident that we will meet the target by 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 we can not talk about attainment at any level without also take into account child poverty the link between undernourishment and low reading standard and therefore attainment across the board be irrefutable when child be hungry they can not focus on learn the scottish government be currently roll out free school meal for all primary school child when will the minister take decisive step to combat child poverty and emulate the action of the scottish government 
 under this government the number of child receive free school meal have increase hugely about a of child be now eligible for either benefit relate free school meal or the universal infant free school meal introduce by our government   however the hon lady should be careful when talk about reading and education standard because standard in this country have rise significantly and i be not sure that the same can be say for scotland 
 whether her department be take step to ensure that secondary age child in sittingbourne and sheppey constituency be able to attend a local school 
 my hon friend and i have discuss education provision on the isle of sheppey many time over the year give the inadequate ofsted grading for oasis academy isle of sheppey the school be now be remove from the oasis community learning trust to a strong multi academy trust 
 i welcome that response from my very right hon friend 
 currently child a day be buss from the isle of sheppey to sittingbourne school because parent do not want to send their child to the isle of sheppey academy which mean that all sittingbourne secondary school be over subscribe and many child in the town can not get into their local school as my right hon friend say the department be in the process of transfer the academy to a new multi academy trust but with the end of the summer term fast approach island parent have no idea whether that transfer will happen or if it do what form it will take as my right hon friend know i have be work with the department on secondary education problem on the isle of sheppey for many year and i know that official be do their good but what can he do to speed up the process and end the current uncertainty 
 i pay tribute to my very hon friend for his passion for improve standard in school in his constituency the transfer of the isle of sheppey academy to a new multi academy trust be a priority for the department a strong preferred sponsor have be find and a proposal be be develop by they once those plan be complete they will be put to parent before a final decision be take by the trust and the department on the academy transfer 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on the potential impact of change to the eligibility criterion for student visa on the competitiveness of the high education sector 
 as part of our commitment to have at least student study in the uk every year we have work closely with the home office to strike the right balance between act decisively on migration be fair to the taxpayer and protect our   position as a world leader in high education we fully expect britain to remain an attractive destination for student across the world 
 i thank the minister for his answer my constituency of edinburgh south west be home to lead university heriot watt and edinburgh napier research by universities uk show that the constituency ’s net economic benefit from international student be £ the government plan to massage the net migration figure by make the uk less attractive to international student that be go to harm the economy in my constituency scotland ’s economy and our educational institution can the minister tell i be that an example of the union deliver for scotland 
 i be not quite sure what problem the hon and learn lady be try to solve i mention to she that our target be international student we have surpass that—679,000 international student be come to our country which be something we be proud of but as i say we have to be fair to not only international student and university but the taxpayer who bear the cost of the infrastructure but i agree with the hon and learn lady that international student have a huge impact on the economy of up to £ plus 
 time after time we find that every government department be short of young graduate with digital skill will my right hon friend think about make an application to the home office to encourage more visa to be grant to student who want to take digital degree in this country 
 my hon friend be learn in these matter but they be for the home office we be develop our digital skill at home with amazing digital apprenticeship half of our apprenticeship standard be in stem subject and there be t level and high technical qualification in digital we be spend on the digital skill that our local people need we have to give they the skill they need as well 
 what step she be take to increase partnership between further education college and high education institution to help increase learn   opportunity 
 we be transform tertiary education by build state of the art prestigious institute of technology college back by £ and lead by further education and high education business we have also introduce the lifelong loan entitlement it be in the house of lords at the moment that will allow high and further education to collaborate offer short course and the transfer of course between fe and he institution 
 last week i meet representative of the national farmers union at the great yorkshire show we discuss the great need for new skill and a skilled workforce in area such as agro ecology what work be his department do to link specialist agricultural college with the non specialist fe and he sector 
 the hon gentleman make an important point we have good land college and we be do everything we can to support they there be institute of technology college in yorkshire although not in his area i be sure that he will be pleased with the investment of £ in his area into fe form and the university technical college as well as a grammar school we be do a lot of work on agricultural t level as well 
 what step be my right hon friend take to work with employer local authority and jobcentre to ensure that as many adult as possible be aware of the opportunity available to they to learn and upskill 
 my right hon friend speak with huge wisdom we be transform career advice through the national careers service which be advise people on adult skill we be spend hundred of million   of pound on boot camp and on more than free level course our apprenticeship scheme offer hundred of different apprenticeship through career advice and our skill offer we be ensure that adult get the skill they need 
 as a working class kid from the constituency i now represent i be not sure where i would be today if not for the opportunity i have to study for a so call mickey mouse degree at university after today ’s medium push and the government ’s apparent crackdown on student how do the minister expect we to believe that this be not just a ruse to protect the privilege of the timothies and tabithas of the home county as oppose to working class kid 
 the hon gentleman could not be more wrong why be it right to send somebody to a high education institution take out a significant loan of £ each year to take a course that lead either to poor completion poor continuation or poor progression this government be stop that by impose recruitment cap on such course i be proud that record number of disadvantaged student be go to university more disadvantaged student be go to university than ever before 
 parent and pupil across stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke wait anxiously to find out the result of the fantastic bid make by the further education city of stoke on trent form college and the high education staffordshire university for a free school to unleash the digital skill in particular that we want to see in stoke on trent will my right hon friend lobby the schools minister and the secretary of state not only to make sure this be announce soon but to make sure it be deliver quickly so that we get the school place we so desperately need 
 i be very pleased to visit staffordshire university which be a model university that offer a brilliant policing degree apprenticeship scheme among other the secretary of state be listen carefully to the bid and i be sure she will make the announcement shortly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the introduction of the lifelong loan entitlement which we all support will inevitably require great collaboration between high education and further education provider but under the current regulatory system as the line between he and fe blur we be see significant regulatory duplication and increase burden this act as a brake on partnership do the minister not recognise the need to streamline the regulatory system to foster collaboration ahead of rather than after the introduction of the lle 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that the lifelong loan entitlement of up to £ will be transformative for million of people across the country enable they to take short or modular course at a time of their choosing we be look at regulation across the high education and further education sector and we be do all we can to reduce it but i recognise some of the issue he raise 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of tuition fee on the social mobility of young people 
 the introduction of tuition fee have not lead to few disadvantaged young people go into high education as i have already highlight the year old entry rate for disadvantaged student in england increase from in to in we see record number of disadvantaged student go into high education in with the rate for student on free school meal go up from to 
 i thank the minister for that answer but in the last academic year english student graduate with £ more debt on average than their scottish counterpart despite this both the government and the labour party refuse to follow the scottish government ’s lead by abolish tuition fee in england with more than undergraduate drop out of high education this year will this government admit that their policy be push student into debt and often out of university 
 actually we be be fair both to student and to all those taxpayer who do not go to university i might point out that low income student live away from home will qualify for more living cost support over the come year than low income student in scotland 
 the new labour dream of of young people go to university have leave many saddle with debt a of graduate unable to find graduate job and more than half of graduate never earn enough to repay their student loan so i warmly welcome the prime minister ’s announcement today of a reduction in the number of low value degree which benefit neither student nor taxpayer will the department look to go far by identify whole university that could be transform into high technical and vocational institution which   would give far more young people the opportunity and training they really need for the productive job of the future 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in the sense that the labour party be all about quantity over quality and we be about quality high standard and a good education we be already do a lot of what she want because we be introduce institute of technology which be collaboration between high education and further education that provide flagship skill and teach high technical qualification with across the country they be do exactly what she want we to do 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this week i have accept the independent review body ’s recommendation in full so our fantastic teacher will receive their high pay award for year it will be at least from september we will have deliver on our manifesto commitment by raise teacher start salary to £ to support our school leader we be provide an extra £ this year and a furth £ in this be not just about school because we will also be invest £ and £ in our further education college over the same period all union have recommend the pay award and it be fully fund i hope that teacher will join they so that we can bring an end to strike action and get our teacher do what they do well teach the next generation 
 uk student who have be offer opportunity to study abroad be wait for funding decision under the ture scheme clearly for student from less well off family this be tough as visa and accommodation have to be pay in advance will the secretary of state out of the kindness of her heart and to a man from the highland give a commitment to bring forward these decision next year to make the ture scheme more accessible to all student regardless of their background 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question the ture scheme be a great success disadvantaged student will take up third of the international study and work opportunity from september with student go to different country it be a remarkable scheme give that it have be introduce so quickly it be a new demand lead scheme but i will work with the sector to make improvement to it and make sure that people be fund in time 
 i attend a meeting of the all party parliamentary group on fishery which i normally chair where a keenness be express to encourage young people to have an interest in a career in fishing at the education stage i have hear similar plea from farmer what more can the department do to make that a reality 
 my hon friend be a true fisherman ’s friend although a lot sweet tasting than the lozenge i might add she will be pleased to know that high quality apprenticeship standard in agriculture and a level fisher apprenticeship be available we be promote apprenticeship include in agriculture in our school and through the apprenticeship support and knowledge programme and the careers enterprise company 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 minister have know since last year that strike action by teacher be likely yet after month of refuse to talk it be only last week that the secretary of state finally settle the dispute will she take this opportunity to apologise to parent for the completely needless and avoidable disruption to their child ’s education for which she be responsible 
 since i come into this job at the end of october the union ask for an extra £ and i deliver it family ask for childcare and i deliver it the school teachers review body ask for for teacher and i deliver it and that have to be fund and i have deliver it i have work to deliver every day in this job whereas the hon lady can not even decide whether she will accept or not 
 last week the institute for fiscal studies say that end private school tax break will raise up to £ in additional revenue confirm that labour ’s plan be fiscally credible we would use that money to invest in new expert teacher and well mental health support for all our young people will the secretary of state distance herself from the discredited claim of the private school lobby do the right thing and adopt labour ’s plan to drive up standard in our school 
 labour have never drive up a standard in our school most of our private school be nothing like eton or harrow they be far small and they charge a lot less many cost the same as a family holiday abroad and there be plenty of parent who choose to forgo life ’s luxury to give their child those opportunity the ifs also say 
 the effect might be large over the medium to long run there be still lot of uncertainty around these estimate 
 labour ’s tax hike be nothing more than the politic of envy as margaret thatcher once say 
 the spirit of envy can destroy it can never build 
 will the minister update my constituent on the progress be make towards open a new free school in warrington to provide well and more appropriate education for young people with autism and other special educational need

 we continue to raise standard in our school as the hon gentleman will know he should not talk down the profession this be an exciting time to join teaching it be an honour to be able to work with child and to shape the next generation this year people come into teaching a number that be broadly similar year on year because this be a good profession to join and there be a government that will support the teaching profession 
 i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for education for visit the busy bees nursery in my constituency of crawley early this month and for the £ of investment that the government be put into childcare provider do that not demonstrate that the conservative government be now deliver for work parent 
 i know that my hon friend have do a lot of work in this sector it be wonderful to visit busy bees and the fantastic team who work there as well as the £ increase for provider we have announce a £ investment to develop our universal wraparound childcare offer we be the party of work parent labour have flip flop repeatedly on childcare announce vague policy in the autumn which it quickly backtrack on its new plan which i hear be to be mean test would snatch away childcare from thousand of hard work parent we be roll out the large investment in childcare in our history labour can not even keep to its word 
 i say gently to the secretary of state that i be very generous at the beginning but that do not carry on all the way through topical i want you to set a good example in this school classroom 
 what step be the secretary of state take to improve the development of child ’s early speech and language skill especially in school such as the wonderful chester blue coat primary school where language be speak

 rate for teaching assistant be set by the local authority teach assistant be highly regard by all of we as the hon lady say they provide important pastoral care alongside the mental health support that we be roll out via the mental health support team 
 high education already publish outcome data so student choose course can compare what their chance of employment and earn power will be for each course at each college or university and make fully inform decision do the minister accept that publish outcome for further education alongside high education not only show student the good course and college but put fe and he on an equal footing for the time and push those offer low value fe and he qualification to either shape up or close down 
 i know that my hon friend be a champion of his brilliant weston college which be an example of the greatness of our fe college he will be pleased to know that the dfe publish outcome datum on further education which show statistic on the employment earning and learn outcome of further education learner we be introduce a data dashboard which be in the direction of travel in which he want to go 
 despite statutory guidance to reduce the cost of school uniform far too many school be require and up to brand item what more will the minister do to intervene to ensure that school abide by the law 
 i thank the hon member for his private member ’s bill that with the government ’s support enable we to put the guidance on a statutory footing about of headteacher be aware of that guidance and be take action to implement it if parent be still concerned that the school uniform be too expensive they can raise it with the school and go through the school ’s complaint process 
 in the absence of any ofsted oversight or regulation of multi academy trust will my right hon friend tell i what mechanism be in place for a school to escalate concern over the pooling of pupil grant funding especially in a situation where a multi academy trust give a school considerably less money than the education and skills funding agency allowance for that school 
 academy trust can pool their general annual grant to deliver key improvement and efficiency across the academy in the trust the academy trust handbook require consideration of each school ’s need and an appeal mechanism which can be escalate to the esfa 
 in my constituency of edinburgh west this week student be graduate some of they with unclassified result because of a dispute involve marking this be make it difficult for those wish to do master or phds particularly foreign student who have be tell that they will have to reapply for visa be the department   for education and the home office look at way of facilitate those student take up the place that they have be offer without the classification and avoid that problem with the visa

 the price of school meal have increase by more than a in some part of the uk yet the government and indeed the labour front benchers will not commit to universal free school meal for primary school age child the scottish government be roll out free school meal across all primary school the question be when this government will take the lead from the scottish government and act decisively to help struggle family 
 record number of pupil in england be now eligible for a free school meal under universal infant free school meal all infant pupil get a free meal a of child in our school be receive a free school meal we believe very strongly however that we should focus the funding on the child in the great need we keep the issue under review but our focus be always on the most disadvantaged 
 my hon friend   the member for worcester mr walker the chair of the education committee mention my child not in school register bill which pass its reading with support from colleague across all party and both houses the schools minister himself say before the select committee last month 
 it be important that we know where child be and can make sure that they be safe 
 therefore be it not critical that the government work with i to expedite the bill as an exist and ongoing legislation vehicle that the government can use without any further delay 
 as i have point out we do intend to legislate for the child not in school measure and put attendance on a statutory footing when the legislative timetable allow look at the sit fridays that be leave within this period the department be currently run a call for evidence on improve the support for child miss from education and that evidence will be use to inform future policy 
 do the secretary of state think that something might be go seriously wrong when child in our junior school be be indoctrinate by gender ideology at the same time as senior member of this house appear unable to define what a woman be 
 i can assure my hon friend that i be more than capable of define what a woman be it be true that some school be ask for guidance in this area so we intend to bring forward guidance i be work with my right hon friend the equalities minister to bring that forward in the near term 
 last week officer from west midlands police be recognise at the police bravery awards for form a human chain and break through the ice as fin tom jack and sam fall through in sub temperature at babbs mill lake in kingshurst i thank the minister for his time on this previously what progress have be make in revise the relationship health and sex education curriculum guideline specifically on understand the implication of cold water shock on the body 
 what happen to my hon friend ’s constituent be tragic swimming and water safety be in the national curriculum and the government be update the school sport and activity action plan which will set out action to help all pupil take part in sport and keep fit include swimming and water safety the plan will be publish this year to align with the timing of the government ’s new school sport strategy 
 the secretary of state tell the medium at the weekend that she have find the money for the pay settlement from an underspend in the department can she tell the house exactly where she find the money and what policy have not be deliver 
 i be delighted to we have a constructive relationship with the treasury whether on childcare school funding or extra budgeting and in this particular case what we have do as i have do many time in my year business career be to go through every line of the budget we spend £ on education so there be a lot of thing in that budget and we have   go through it and check every single assumption some be demand lead and some depend on the roll out of certain project we have protect the frontline and reprioritise what have change be that the treasury have allow we to keep that money to reprioritise—[interruption it be an answer the right hon lady may not understand because she do not 
 order i be not sure the secretary of state be understand i either when i say these be topical i mean that—[interruption order no i be sorry if you do not want member on your side of the house to get in please say so because that be what be go to happen and it be totally unfair to the people who be wait let we play by the rule that be what we expect from all of we 
 i recently visit the impressive national stem learning centre in york and be fortunate enough to be able to observe some of its work i would be delighted if my right hon friend could visit but in the interim can she detail what professional support be available for teacher in their continue professional development 
 we have engage in an extensive reform of teacher training introduce what we call the golden thread a high level of requirement in initial teacher training and a year early career framework for teacher just start off in their career those standard will mean that in science technology engineering and mathematic and in all subject teacher be well prepared to enter the profession 
 the chair of the govern body of primary and secondary school across the london boroughs of richmond and kingston upon thames have today write to the education secretary request an urgent meeting to discuss the crippling funding and recruitment challenge they face will she agree to meet they 
 of course the secretary of state will agree as she have just say to i we be spend record amount of funding on school the secretary of state achieve an extra £ in the autumn statement last year and we be now spend £ on school funding.[official report   july vol c. 16mc we have recruit more teacher this year than last year and we have a record number of teacher in the profession at but of course i be happy to talk to the hon lady and the teacher in her constituency to discuss their particular concern 
 rise 
 order i be sorry we have take too much time on question you will have to do without 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to announce the publication of the government ’s high education reform consultation response this country be of the good in the world for study in high education boast of the world ’s top university for most high education be a sound investment with graduate expect to earn on average £ more over their lifetime than those who do not go to university 
 however there be still pocket of high education provision where the promise that university education will be worthwhile do not hold true and where an unacceptable number of student do not finish their study or find a good job after graduate that can not continue it be not fair to taxpayer who subsidise that education but most of all it be not fair to those student who be be sell a promise of a well tomorrow only to be disappoint and end up pay far into the future for a degree that do not offer they good value 
 we want to make sure that student be charge a fair price for their study and that a university education offer a good return our reform be aim at achieve that objective that be why the government launch the consultation in to seek view on policy base on recommendation make by sir philip augar and his independent panel the consultation end in may and the department for education have be consider the response receive i be now able to set out the programme of reform that we be take forward 
 i believe that the traditional degree continue to hold great value but it be not the only high education pathway over the past year we have make substantial reform to ensure that the traditional route be not the only pathway to a good career high technical qualification massively enhance student skill and career prospect and deserve parity of esteem with undergraduate degree we have see a growth in degree level apprenticeship with over student enrol since their introduction in i have ask the office for student to establish a £ competitive degree apprenticeship fund to drive forward capacity building project to broaden access to degree apprenticeship over the next year 
 that drive to encourage skill be why we be also invest up to £ to help provider deliver high technical education in march we set out detailed information on how the lifelong learning entitlement will transform the way in which individual can undertake post-18 education and we continue to support that transformation through the lifelong learning higher education fee limits bill which be currently pass through the other place we anticipate that that funding couple with the introduction of the lle from will help to incentivise the take up of high technical education fill vital skill gap across the country 
 each of those reform have have simple premise that we be educate people with the skill that will enable they to have a long and fulfilling career i believe that we should have the same expectation for high education it should prepare student for life by give they the right skill and knowledge to get well pay job with the advent of the lle it be neither fair nor   right for student to use potentially quarter of their lifelong loan entitlement for a university degree that do not offer they good return that would constrain their future ability to learn earn and retrain we must shrink the part of the sector that do not deliver value and ensure that student and taxpayer be get value for money give their considerable investment 
 datum show that there be provider from which few than of graduate progress to high skilled employment or further study month after graduate that be not acceptable i will therefore issue statutory guidance to the ofs set out that it should impose recruitment limit on provision that do not meet its rigorous quality requirement for positive student outcome to help to constrain the size and growth of course that do not deliver for student we will also ask the ofs to consider how it can incorporate graduate earning into its quality regime we recognise that many factor can influence graduate earning but student have a right to expect that their investment in high education will improve their career prospect and we should rightly scrutinise course that appear to offer limited add value to student on the metric that matter most to many 
 we will work with the ofs to consider franchising arrangement in the sector all organisation that deliver high education must be hold to robust standard i be concern about some indication that franchising be act as a potential route for low quality to seep into the high education system and i be absolutely clear that lead provider have a responsibility to ensure that franchised provision be of the same quality as directly deliver provision if we find example of undesirable practice we will not hesitate to act far on franchising 
 as i have say we will ensure that student be charge a fair price for their study that be why we be also reduce to £ the fee for classroom base foundation year course such as business study and social science in line with the high standard funding rate for access to he diploma recently we have see an explosion in the growth of many such course but limited evidence that they be in the good interest of student we be not reduce the fee limit for high cost strategically important subject such as veterinary science and medicine but we want to ensure that foundation year be not use to add to the bottom line of institution at the expense of those who study they we will continue to monitor closely the growth of foundation year provision and we will not hesitate to introduce further restriction or reduction i want provider to consider whether those course add value for student and to phase out that provision in favour of a broad range of tertiary option with the advent of the lle 
 our aim be that everyone who want to benefit from high education have the opportunity to do so that be why we will not proceed at this time with a minimum requirement of academic attainment to access student finance although we will keep that option under review i be confident that the sector will respond with the ambition and focused collaboration require to deliver this package of reform i extend my wholehearte thank to those in the sector for their response to the consultation 
 this package of reform represent the next step in tackle low quality high education but it will not be the last step the government will not shy away from   further action if require and will consider all lever available to we if these quality reform do not result in the improvement we seek our high education system be admire across many country and these measure will ensure that it continue to be i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement 
 today ’s statement tell we several story about this government it tell a story about their priority why university and why now it tell a story about their analysis what they think be wrong and what they think be not it tell a story about their competence why these change when their own regulator have use a different approach for so long it tell a story about their prejudice about why they continue to reinforce a binary choice for young people either academic or vocational university or apprenticeship above all it tell a story about value about the choice to put cap on the aspiration and ambition of our young people about ministers for whom opportunity be for their child but not for other people ’s child about a government whose only big idea for our world lead university be to put up fresh barrier to opportunity anxious to keep young people in their place it tell you everything you need to know about the tories that this be their priority for our young people 
 this be the tories priority when we be in the middle of an urgent crisis in this country when family be struggle to make end meet when patient be face the big waiting list in nhs history when child be go to school in building that ministers themselves acknowledge be very likely to collapse and when a spiral of low productivity low growth and low wage under the tories be hold britain back it be because the prime minister be weak and he be in hock to his back benchers that we be not see action on those important priority instead after more than year in power the government have show what they really think of our university which be famous across the world be core to so many of our regional economy and be essential to our pandemic response that they be not a public good but a political battleground 
 the government ’s concept of a successful university course base on earning be not just narrow but limit i ask the secretary of state briefly to consider the case of   the right hon member for richmond yorks   rishi sunak the prime minister have a degree in politic from of our lead university yet his government lose control of almost council this year he be the choice of his own party and now he be on track to fail to deliver on the pledge he set himself publicly do the secretary of state believe that the prime minister ’s degree be in any sense a high value course 
 let we be clear what today ’s announcement be really about many of our most successful new university the fruit of the determination of successive government labour and conservative to spread opportunity in this country often draw more student from their local   community many of those area be far from london far from exist concentration of graduate job many of those student come from background where few in their family if any will have have the chance to go to university many of those young people benefit from extra support when they arrive at university to ensure they succeed we on the labour benches welcome the success of those university in widen participation and welcome more young people into high education yet today the secretary of state be tell those young people include those excited to be finish their study this year that this government believe their hard work count for nothing can the secretary of state be absolutely clear with the house and tell we which of those university course she consider to be of low value 
 the secretary of state be keen to trumpet her party ’s record on apprenticeship but let i set out what this government ’s record really be since apprenticeship start among under-19 have drop by and apprentice achievement in that age group be down by since the secretary of state enter this place the number of young people achieve an apprenticeship at any level have more than halve fail a generation of young people desperate to take on an apprenticeship 
 lastly and most importantly the value that this government have set out today be clear the conservatives be say to england ’s young people that opportunity be not for they and that choice be not for they the bizarre irony of a conservative government seek to restrict freedom and restrict choice seem entirely lose on they labour will shatter the class ceiling we will ensure that young people believe that opportunity be for they labour be the party of opportunity aspiration and freedom let we be clear too that young people want to go to university not merely to get on financially but for the chance to join the pursuit of learn to explore idea and undertake research that benefit we all that chance and that opportunity matter too our child deserve well they deserve a government whose most important mission will be to break down the barrier to opportunity and to build a country where background be no barrier they deserve a labour government 
 as usual the hon lady have more word than action none of those action be put in place either in wales where labour be run the education system or in the uk when it be run it in england we have always make the deliberate choice of quality over quantity and this be a story of a consistent drive for quality whether that be through my right hon friend the schools minister have drive up school standard so that we be the good in the west for reading and good in the world or through childcare revolutionise the apprenticeship system none of that exist before we put it in place and technical education and high education 
 i be an other people ’s child i be that kid who leave school at who go to a fail comprehensive school in knowsley i rely on the business and the college and the university that i go to i do not know their brand image and i know absolutely nobody who have ever be there i put my trust in that company and luckily it do i very well not all university and not all course have the trust brand image of oxford and cambridge which i think be where the hon lady go   along with my right hon friend the prime minister i have work with many leader all over the world in my many year in business and the prime minister be a world class leader 
 on apprenticeship it be a case of quality always over quantity what we find and this be why i introduce the quality standard be that yes the number be high but many of the people do not realise they be on an apprenticeship many of the apprenticeship last less than month and for many of they there be off the job training they be apprenticeship in name only which be what the labour party will be when it come to standard for education 
 i call the father of the house 
 i thank the secretary of state those of we with long memory know that we either ration place by number or we give people choice if she be give people the choice of be able to discriminate between the course and university on offer i congratulate she as i do especially on the lifetime learning and the degree apprenticeship expansion which have already happen with more to come 
 however can i also speak up for those who either get class degree or fail to take a degree at all include of the governors of the bank of england who go to king ’s and who come out without a degree rabi tagore leave university and many other poet painter teacher or minister of religion whether rabbi imam or minister in the christian church do not show up highly on the earning scale but they might show up highly in their contribution to society can my right hon friend please make sure that she do not let an algorithm rate college course or university 
 i thank my hon friend for his remark and i very much agree that this be about choice the lifelong loan entitlement degree apprenticeship and all of the other choice and about people understand that there be many different route to success in life we have ask the office for student to look at earning because i realise that be difficult and that some job will not earn people more however for his information year after graduate from some course people be earn less than £ that be less than the minimum wage and it be not acceptable 
 may i ask the secretary of state because she have not actually spell this out what be a low value degree 
 in relation to low value degree an example of the quality provision we have introduce for the office for students be b3 which be about whether student continue in their degree because clearly if they drop out it be not of much value whether they complete their degree because clearly if they do not complete it it be of value and whether they get a job or progress into high education afterwards those be the quality measure we look at right now the office for students be look at provider and specific area business and management and computer science because there be a massive range in what people   can expect to earn from job have follow course or other all of which seem to have the same name there be quality issue and we want to make sure that they be thoroughly investigate the office for students be do that 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 i welcome the focus on both choice and policy that my right hon friend have focus on in her statement the education committee will want to look at the detail of the proposal and at the kind of course that be affect it be crucial that in launch this approach she recognise that all our university be sell a premium product all our university be high quality institution and it would be wrong to discriminate against different university in the system when after all they be all fund on the same fundamental basis 
 i agree with my hon friend and i be proud of our university sector it be much admire all over the world but we must ensure that specific course in all institution offer the quality that people expect when people invest in these degree they will come out with £ or £ of debt and it be important that they know that and secondly that they know what they be invest in and what return they will get on that investment 
 may i beg the secretary of state not to throw the baby out with the bath water everybody want good quality degree and we all want degree to lead to good fulfilling occupation but some of we be worried about the comment that be make in an interview this morning by the secretary of state ’s ministerial colleague that we have or of the good university in the world as if all the other university be rubbish that be not the case we have diverse university and great course i ask she please not to throw the baby out with the bath water and do great damage to our high education system 
 i agree with the hon gentleman we have an excellent university system with excellent university out of the top be world class but if we broaden that to the top many other would appear in that list we have a good university sector which be why it be most important that we protect the brand image it be also very popular abroad and every year more than student choose to come here which be more than to almost every other country in the world why it be because they know they will get quality and it be very important for the sector that that quality be maintain 
 i know the secretary of state take a more than purely transactional view of high education and i be with the father of the house in hop that in her reform there will be protection for degree that do not offer an immediate commercial advantage such as theology philosophy or the study of poetry i also hope that within her reform there will be protection to allow university to innovate and introduce new course our university sector have obviously be at the forefront of   drive forward british intellectualism and thinking and not allow university to experiment with course that may not immediately fulfil the criterion that she be propose or indeed forbid or deter they from do so would set we back in world term will she reassure we that innovation will still be encourage 
 i thank my right hon friend for all the work that he do in this area yes i understand the difficulty of choose a blunt number or tool that be why i have ask the office for student to consider how such thing could be use and what approach we need to ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water or end up with unintended consequence on innovation i be absolutely encourage all our university to innovate work with business the pace of technological change across the world and what be to come in the future be immense and i want our university to work with our further education college training provider business and other to ensure that we innovate and give everybody the good opportunity for the future 
 there be no clear sign of a government who be out of idea and have run out of steam than when they re announce policy and badge they as new the office for students already have these power and have already cap specific provider rather than put down our university and cap our young people ’s aspiration why do the secretary of state not invest in they by restore maintenance grant and finally sign the dotted line on horizon membership 
 not all the thing i have bring forward today have already be announce the information on foundation degree be new and the work we be do with the ofs be also new we have ask the ofs to consider the impact of recruitment limit and how those can be introduce i personally think this be an important set of reform we need to make sure that we have access to these fantastic course at our university so that through programme such as horizon when we complete those negotiation we can continue to offer the very good in science from this country 
 i very much welcome this statement to limit the number of student that university can recruit to course that be fail the secretary of state have my full support can she tell i whether this measure will also apply to foreign student at the very least will foreign student be bar from bring dependant with they to do these course 
 the quality of the course on offer apply to everybody if we change the quality for domestic student it will then be the same quality for international student which be important because of the size of the international student sector which bring about £ to £ to our economy every year we have already address the issue of dependant for teach master ’s course in our recent change to migration visa 
 the secretary of state have confirm that the office for students already have the power to enforce on student outcome provision   so this announcement be just narrow politicking hide in the ucas figure last week be the fact that home student application be fall in this country can the secretary of state confirm that this government ’s policy be now of narrow participation 
 absolutely not no i be delighted that the hon gentleman have ask this question because our policy be about widen participation and make sure that education be high quality it be also about make sure that there be more degree apprenticeship there be now which do not exist before there be now more people who can do what i do as the only degree apprentice in the house of commons it be a fantastic route into the workplace we also have high technical qualification and boot camp there be so much investment that have all happen under this conservative government 
 do my right hon friend agree that the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson miss the opportunity to condemn the disgusting and cruel university and college union mark boycott will my right hon friend use these reform to protect young people to ensure that this never happen again and that university such as cambridge and exeter can issue degree 
 it be important young people have suffer already a lot during covid they have invest in their degree and put all the hard work in it be only right that they should have their degree mark this be a dispute between university and their lecturer but we be urge they to make sure they prioritise all those who will be graduate this year 
 i welcome the announcement today because for far too long some university cynically sell course to student even though they know the outcome be poor in qualification and employment opportunity do the minister accept that it be her party that allow the increase in fee be aware of the mismatch sometimes between course and the need of the economy and do nothing to cap those course do she not recognise that some people will be rather cynical that the tsunami of announcement we be get now be more to do with the by election rather than the ability to deliver between now and a general election
