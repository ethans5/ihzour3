 the hon member be talk about small business last week i be proud to host member of the federation of small businesses here in parliament who welcome the budget particularly the increase in the employment allowance which will see the small business benefit—25,000 of the small business well off now than they be before the budget be they wrong 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill on the cost of deliver public service 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the propose increase in employer national insurance contribution on public sector organisation 
 as we set out in the autumn statement the government have set aside funding to support the public sector with the additional cost of employer national insurance contribution the amount be £ in £ in £ in £ in and £ in the government plan to update parliament on allocation by department as soon as possible 
 labour ’s national insurance increase will cost dundee city council a minimum of £ while across scotland an additional £ will be incur rise to £ when indirect employer such as gp practice be include labour promise to reset the relationship with the devolved administration so ahead of scotland ’s budget this week will the minister confirm that the full cost of the national insurance contribution increase to the delivery of public service in scotland will be reimburse 
 the funding for the impact on public sector organisation include fund for the devolved government which be allocate through the barnett formula in the usual way it be the responsibility of the devolve government to manage devolved workforce might i say that if the bill be somewhat high in scotland that may be due to the scottish government ’s decision about the size of the public sector 
 a major housing association serve not only plympton plymstock and ivybridge in my constituency but the rest of plymouth and other part of devon and cornwall will have to shoulder quarter of a pound in increase national insurance contribution that be money that could have   be spend on new home for some of the most vulnerable in my constituency how will the minister reassure my constituent patiently wait for much need social housing when they realise that they will have to wait long because of the chancellor ’s decision 
 we recognise that the decision on national insurance contribution be a tough but we also recognise that it be necessary for the chancellor to set out a budget that include a record set of promise on home building we be set to build home over the course of this parliament invest in social and affordable housing that be what will benefit the hon member ’s constituent who need a decent home 
 the shadow chancellor be tour the tv studio this morning to say that the conservative party do nothing wrong in government will my hon friend confirm that the reason for the change to national insurance be precisely to plug the £ gap that the conservatives cause and to ensure that our constituent can get a hospital or gp appointment 
 i think that fit with the question somehow 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the problem with conservative members be that they be all happy to say that they want more funding for the nhs they be just not prepared to pay for it what they need to realise be that in government we have to take tough decision to ensure that we can fund public service and fix the public finance 
 what reassurance can the minister give to hospice such as julia ’s house which serve my constituent which be concern by the plan increase in national insurance contribution and the impact that will have on the service they provide 
 as my hon friend will know many hospice be independent charity and therefore will be able to access the employment allowance which we have double to £ a year as well as the other wide tax relief in the tax system for charity such as business rate relief and gift aid of course hospice often have statutory obligation with the nhs as well so i suggest that hospice discuss their contract with their integrate care board 
 i call the shadow minister 
 later today the house will vote on the government ’s £ national insurance tax hike to avoid any uncertainty when we vote will the minister confirm exactly which public sector organisation will be compensate 
 if the shadow minister would like to know which public sector organisation will be compensate he could look at what his government do with the health and social care levy because the definition of public sector organisation it be a regularly cite definition be set out through the office for national statistics we will reimburse departments and other public sector organisation 
 there be so little information in that response the civil service will be very proud of the minister he will not say who will be spar by the chancellor ’s tax raid but we know that work people will be make to pay the office for budget responsibility have say so the institute for fiscal studies have say so even the resolution foundation have say so and work people know so why be it that labour always leave office with unemployment high than when it enter office 
 i do not think the shadow minister listen to my response to the previous question in which i set out very clearly the definition of the public sector for the purpose of national insurance contribution look at what the obr have say yes it recognise that we be ask business to contribute more and that this will have an impact but it also say that the employment level will rise from to by mean an increase in the employment level over this parliament 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 citizens advice in st albans support some of the most vulnerable people to access public service it say that the change to national insurance contribution will 
 hit hard because we employ mostly part time staff and the change to the threshold mean we go from pay nothing to the full amount for each staff member the increase rebate be intend to offset the nic for small organisation but do not for we because so many of our staff be part time 
 will the chancellor look again at the impact of the national insurance contribution change on part time worker 
 we recognise that we have take a tough decision to increase the rate and broaden the base through change to the secondary threshold i welcome the work do by the organisation mention by the hon lady in her constituency but perhaps the need for advice would be less if public service be strong of the reason we be take these difficult decision on taxation welfare and spending be precisely to ensure that these public service can provide the service that people need 
 we all want to see strong public service accord to hightown housing association the estimate extra total cost of the national insurance contribution change will be £ per year money that would allow the association to pay the interest on a loan of around £ which would pay for around social home will the chancellor say whether she will conduct an impact assessment of these national insurance contribution change on the number of social home 
 the liberal democrat spokesperson begin her question by say that we all want public service the problem be that not all of we in this chamber be prepared to pay for they that be exactly why we have to take difficult decision to ensure that we can fund our ambitious plan for the nhs education and indeed housing the impact of the impact assessment be publish in the tax information and impact note which be publish alongside the legislation which i be sure    the hon lady will have see it come down to the basic point that we have to make tough decision on taxation if we want to fund those public service 
 what fiscal step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase the supply of affordable housing 
 at the budget the government announce major step towards deliver a once in a generation increase in social housing include a £ boost to the affordable home programme increase annual spend to £ the government will set out future grant investment beyond the current affordable home programme at phase of the spending review 
 in stoke on trent and kidsgrove there be many historic building that be lie dormant and they have do so for a very long time what step will the chancellor take to help to bring these beautiful building back into use as affordable home for local people 
 stoke on trent have a proud industrial history and some beautiful building my hon friend make an important point i will raise it with colleague at the ministry of housing communities and local government the £ boost to the affordable home programme also allow up to of that delivery to come from acquire exist home social landlord include some local authority can bid for funding to bring empty home back into use for social housing 
 many of my constituent have benefit over many year from the right to buy their council home and social housing which have give they an important step on to the ladder to home ownership the discount in staffordshire be go to be cut to £ i do not doubt that the chancellor like i want to help as many people as possible on to the path to home ownership will she pledge to review that decision with regard to the impact it will have on so many people and look at restore that discount in future 
 as the right hon gentleman will know home ownership fall under the previous government we be determined to turn that around and ensure that more people particularly family get on to the housing ladder as he have confirm the right to buy discount will continue but in future every penny of that money will go back into build new social housing so that more people can have a home of their own and a roof over their head 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential implication for her policy of the appg for investment fraud and fair financial service publication entitle report on the call for evidence about the financial conduct authority publish on november 
 i read that report with great interest and have a lot of sympathy for those who suffer however a lot of the incident describe happen a very long time ago the fca have make substantial change in response to those experience that do not mean the end of our engagement with the fca but we be continue to hold it to account and it have make change since the report come to light 
 the fca have be completely defensive in response to the report since the historical element quote by the fca major scandal have erupt i will not intrude on your time mr speaker because i be sure that you would not want i to list they all but woodford equity car finance and other have come to light since the detail come out clearly there be a need to fundamentally reform the fca so that victim of scandal be properly compensate and the industry be properly regulate in the way that we would all like to see 
 i understand that lot of people have suffer as the report explain which i say i have read however i do have confidence in the fca i have send it remit letter outline what we expect it to do to deliver on its objective the fca be look at certain thing such as its rulebook which we think be too extensive to look at rule that no long need to be apply but overall we be work with the fca closely and we believe that it be try its good it be not possible to have a system where nothing ever go wrong but we be try to minimise that and ensure that there be consumer protection the fca know that we be work together to deliver on its objective 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of funding for the money and pensions service 
 the money and pensions service play a vital role in support individual to manage their money effectively its funding level be regularly review to reflect demand inflation and evolving need 
 new research from the centre for responsible credit show that people in this country be go without the debt advice that they need we be in a cost of living crisis so service be severely stretch the money and pensions service underestimate need by exclude people who be behind with their bill that mean that the financial levy that it propose be not what it need to be since a of those who need financial help borrow from buy now pay later lender and give the delay in regulate those company will the minister meet i to look at the funding model of the financial levy and what more we can do to ensure that those profit from exploit our constituent pay to repair the damage 
 my hon friend have be a tireless campaigner on this issue we be reform buy now pay later as the economic secretary recently state in answer to my hon friend in the house the government   recognise the gap between those who need debt and those access it which be why the money and pensions service be explore way to improve accessibility include through outreach initiative we continue to keep a close eye on its funding level to ensure that they reflect demand 
 the money and pensions service do tremendous work to support people in my constituency who come to surgery in desperate need particularly those face crippling debt as do organisation such as christians against poverty would the government consider put more money behind the money and pensions service not just for staffing but for visibility and presence in local community would they consider the proposal that other have make to make our post office a shop window for government service in our community include such advice 
 as the hon gentleman know the money and pensions service commission other charity particularly to work with hard to reach vulnerable people we continue to review its funding and we keep a close eye on the evolve demand and need for its service

 amazon currently make hundred of million of pound in profit in the uk each year and often get away with pay little to no corporation tax meanwhile high street business in weymouth portland and swanage in my constituency pay their fair share to level the playing field will the chancellor consider further measure to ensure that online giant always pay their fair share of tax i fear that without action our high street will always be at an unfair disadvantage 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and support the high street be at the heart of our ambition when it come to business rate reform on reading of the finance bill last week in which i speak we set out our plan to issue permanently low tax rate for high street retail hospitality and leisure property that will be pay for through an increase in the tax rate on property with a rateable value above £ a category that include the warehouse use by many of the online giant to whom my hon friend have refer

 rural north shropshire be home to some great independent business that we be look forward to celebrate on small business saturday this week but they be hold back by the business rate system which benefit big online retailer and hold back investment not only on the high street but in the countryside will the minister consider a much more radical reform of business rate which take account of land value encourage business to invest and put high street retailer on a level playing field with online giant

 what step she be take to help ensure the sound management of public finance 
 sound management of the public finance mean spend wisely and not send money to fraudster today i have appoint the health expert tom hayhoe as our new covid counter fraud commissioner as chair of an nhs trust during the pandemic he see the urgency of get personal protective equipment to nhs staff when they need it now he be at his desk in my department start the work to investigate the billion of pound lose to fraud and underperforming contract and instead ensure that that money be where it belong in our public service 
 my constituent expect the government to treat taxpayer money with the utmost respect however during the pandemic the conservatives hand out contract to their friend and donor and fail to prevent fraud use the crisis as a cover for their greed do the chancellor agree with i that that money belong to the taxpayer 
 my hon friend ’s constituent in thurrock be right to be angry about the waste and corruption that happen under the previous government that money belong to the british people and in our public service not in the pocket of fraudster take advantage of a national emergency tom hayhoe will leave no stone unturned in investigate the carnival of fraud that the previous government preside over include in ppe contract where they recommend any attempt to reclaim that money be abandon let huge sum of taxpayer money be waste would be egregious and i will not tolerate that 
 the treasury consistently insist that only farm a year will be impact by the family farm tax however the central association for agricultural valuers calculate that the real number will be time high and will include many farm in my gordon and buchan constituency who be right the treasury or the expert 
 we have publish the detail of how that money be raise but the number from his majesty ’s revenue and customs be very clear only a quarter of estate will pay any additional tax at the moment the vast majority of agricultural property relief be enjoy by a very small number of very large and very expensive estate that be not affordable and it will not continue

 i be happy to arrange a meeting between my hon friend and the relevant minister 
 last week the chancellor tell the cbi conference that she would not come back 
 with more borrowing or more taxis 
 last wednesday the prime minister hang she out to dry and refuse to repeat those word will she repeat they today and rule out any more borrowing or any more taxis yes or no 
 at the budget in october we have to fill a £ black hole leave by the previous government we will never have to repeat a budget like this because we will not have to clear up the mess of the previous government ever again 
 i call the shadow minister 
 a cornerstone of sound management be economic certainty but this government seem to specialise in create economic uncertainty most recently they do so by delay the date for the critical multi year spending review it look like the chancellor do not have a grip on either her cabinet colleague spending plan or her own plan for public sector productivity which be it or be it both 
 the hon gentleman talk about uncertainty but he be a minister in the treasury under liz truss when huge damage be do to family and business finance frankly i will take no lesson from conservative member on how to run the economy we have already do phase of the spending review phase will begin shortly and be conclude next year when we will make multi year settlement on resource departmental expenditure limit and capital budget for the next few year 
 the chancellor may find that in her job she need to listen and learn lesson of the many criticism of the last budget be that the government fiddle the figure to borrow more money and still leave little headroom for if their forecast go wrong since the budget business confidence have collapse put further pressure on that headroom do the chancellor have a problem with balance her book and will she like oliver twist be come back for more 
 the hon gentleman will know that there be more headroom in our budget in october than be leave by the previous government the lesson i have learn be that i will never play fast and loose with the public finance as the conservative party do because when it do interest rate go through the roof and inflation top and family and business in our country be still pay the price for its disastrous economic management 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 at the budget i wipe the slate clean after year of chaos and mismanagement of our public finance and i have bring stability back to our economy so that we can get on with fulfil our promise of deliver change that mean invest to fix the nhs and rebuild britain while ensure that work people do not face high taxis in their payslip 
 only through economic growth can we deliver on the promise of change that be why we have waste no time in deliver on the government ’s no mission we have establish the national wealth fund have kick start plan reform to boost long term growth be develop an industrial strategy and be announce reform for our world lead financial service sector include in pension i be under no illusion about the size and scale of the challenge that we face and the struggle of work people that be why we choose stability and investment the conservatives however choose chaos austerity and decline 
 accord to the local government association local government spending on public service be down on what it would have be have it keep pace with demand and cost since my local authority greenwich face a £ to £ gap in commission social care cost and after year of tory austerity there be very little headroom to bridge that gap do my right hon friend agree that local authority need more assistance to bridge such gap in the december local government finance statement 
 as my hon friend will know in the autumn budget and phase of the spending review more than £ be make available to local government include £ for social care the allocation of that money will be set out in the normal way over the next few week so that local government be fund properly and can deliver the service that it need to deliver 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 what a pleasure it be to appear opposite the right hon lady for the time i be tempt to ask she how thing be go but i do not want to start out by be unkind i will instead ask this when she recently pledge to the cbi that she would not raise taxis again do she mean it 
 i welcome the right hon member to his place and look forward to many exchange with he across the dispatch box at the budget in october as he know we have to fix a £ black hole in the public finance some of that black hole come from the fact that we be the only g7 economy in which employment be low than it be before the pandemic when he be secretary of state for work and pensions so we have to raise taxis to fund our public service but never again will we have to repeat a budget like that because we have now wipe the slate clean and draw a line under the mess create by the previous government 
 i do not actually discern any answer to my question so may i put it this way no have state that it be not prepared to stand by the chancellor ’s commitment on tax be that because no change its mind or because the right hon lady speak without think 
 no chancellor of the exchequer would write year worth of budget in their month in post but i can say that we will never have to deliver a budget like that again we take decision in this budget in order to wipe the slate clean after the mismanagement decline and chaos of the previous government that require we to make difficult decision but we be right to make they so that we can get go with our plan to achieve growth and reform public service and deliver the nhs and school that our country desperately need 
 the a50 a500 and branston bridge in my constituency be just example of infrastructure project that need investment what investment be the department make to improve our road and infrastructure 
 my hon friend have campaign extensively on this issue in his constituency i understand that national highways continue to develop proposal to improve the a50 a500 corridor through uttoxeter that be part of the pipeline of project for future road investment strategy he will know that in the budget we invest £ to maintain and renew the nation ’s local road that include a £ increase in alone 
 air ambulance charity deliver life save treatment to people every single day yet they be under threat from the chancellor ’s rise in national insurance and taxis the lincolnshire nottinghamshire air ambulance alone will need to find another £ just to pay the national insurance rise week ago local right hon and hon member and i write to the chancellor on this matter but we have not yet have a reply i ask she now will she exempt these vital charity so that they can continue their vital life save work 
 the tax rise in the budget be use to provide a £ uplift in the department of health and social care budget to ensure that our nhs be properly fund the nhs will ensure that important service be properly fund and those allocation will be set out in the normal way 
 i understand that the chancellor will attend the great northern conference today in yorkshire and the humber in the light of that will she tell we how she will make the most of growth opportunity for our region 
 i will head to the great northern conference in hull later this afternoon to speak about the impact of this government ’s policy on yorkshire and the wide north of england we be support local leader and community through integrated settlement be invest in the trans pennine route upgrade east west rail and high speed and be reshape public service 
 the owner of horton pharmacy in epsom have raise concern about the financial burden that increase employer national insurance contribution will place on community pharmacy pharmacy provide frontline care and without support their viability and the accessible healthcare that they offer could be at risk that will add pressure to an already strain national health service will the chancellor reconsider and exempt community pharmacy from the increase 
 primary care provider have yearly negotiation with the department on what service they provide and what money they be entitle to more broadly the reason why we be in the budget take difficult decision about national insurance and other matter be precisely to fund the nhs so that we have the health service that our country need and deserve 
 crawley ’s public service not least its school and the nhs be set to benefit significantly from the measure set out in the budget do the minister agree that opposition party can not have it both way claim to support the investment in our local public service while reject every of the measure necessary to fund they 
 in the past week since the leader of the opposition be elect the conservatives have make £ of commitment to cut taxis but with no idea of how they would cut public service to afford   they i do not know how they will vote on national insurance but we can see pretty quickly how they end up leave we a £ black hole 
 the single most important factor in raise living standard drive income equality and improve child ’s life chance be have a job why be the chancellor disregard that fundamental truth with tax policy that will actively harm employment particularly youth employment 
 if we look at the obr forecast for this parliament employment will increase from to the right hon gentleman talk about youth employment i suggest that he read our get britain working white paper which set out in detail what we will do to help get young people and people suffer from ill health back into work 
 last week the house pass the reading of the tobacco and vapes bill and i be proud to walk through the voting lobby with my hon friend this government be commit to implement the vaping product duty which complement the bill to safeguard our young people will the minister confirm whether the government be consider use a digital platform tax for that duty 
 as my hon friend set out the government confirm the introduction of a vaping product duty to ensure that young people and non smoker do not take up vaping registration for the duty will open on the digital platform from   april and the duty will take effect from   october   that year 
 on economic black hole the labour mayor of london think that brexit punch a £ black hole in the public finance a very simple question for the chancellor have leave the eu be a net positive or a net negative for the public finance 
 the government have no overall estimate of the impact of the uk ’s exit from the eu but the obr have project a drop in productivity in the long term that be why we be start negotiation with the eu to improve trade in our mutual interest 
 the previous government leave a mess of £ for we to clean up follow their short term decision and absolute lack of investment in service this government be take a different approach with long term investment for our economic success will the chancellor work with i to find the £ of long term investment in the port of rosyth that be require to bring back a ferry between rosyth and dunkirk that would bring passenger a year to scotland and take km of freight traffic off the road and it have the support of large local employer such as mowi and amazon 
 the government recognise that port be an important route to growth which be why the national wealth fund will deploy at least £    into priority manifesto sector include port i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that specific constituency issue in due course 
 wealthtek be place into administration by the financial conduct authority after lose £ of its client money fca appoint administrator be now deduct fee from victim compensation my constituent dominic knights and his wife have between they lose thousand of pound what be the treasury do to safeguard the £ compensation limit 
 the fca be hold to account by the government and parliament but treasury ministers can not comment on individual case and the treasury have no stake in the operational issue of the fca i be very happy to meet with the right hon lady and the fca to discuss that matter but let i be clear the fca be an independent regulator 
 what   measure be the government take to support small independent retail business in town centre such as mine in mansfield and will the chancellor join i in congratulate mansfield business improvement district on its successful renewal ballot which be announce last friday 
 i happily join my hon friend in welcome mansfield ’s success we have launch a revamp fair payment code under which signatory commit to pay their supplier on time and the disability finance code for entrepreneurship that come on top of reform announce at the budget to protect small business such as double the employment allowance to £ and our commitment to maintain the small profit rate and marginal relief at their current rate and threshold as well as to freeze the small business multipli for 
 i call greg smith 
 and like my hon friend i look forward to small business saturday this week 
 order interruption no we be go to have a little talk now because this be not fair i have to get all these other member in i understand that these be set question but question and answer should be short it work both way otherwise i can not get member in and it make my job impossible please work with i 
 the owner of a acre farm in my constituency have work out that they would have to spend year pay back the money that they would have to borrow because of the change to agricultural property relief when will the chancellor start listen to farmer rather than hide behind treasury figure 
 we be take an approach that balance significant tax relief for family farm with the need to fix the public finance in as fair a way as possible the hon gentleman will have see the datum that the treasury   have put out base on claim datum from his majesty ’s revenue and customs it show how few farm will in fact be affect the measure be a fair and balanced way to fix the public finance which we desperately need to do give our inheritance from the conservative government 
 it be vital that we give value for taxpayer money yet conservative run norfolk county council ’s doom norwich western link road be cost taxpayer £ per day that be nearly £ so far for not an inch of tarmac do my hon friend agree that the norfolk tories give we liz truss not just in whitehall but in county hall 
 minister you ’re run out of road 
 the government will always support local authority to deliver good value for money road enhancement to support economic growth and improved connectivity the norwich western link road be currently the subject of a live planning application so i be afraid that i can not comment far on the specific 
 i can not help but think that this morning have make for rather depress listening we hear this repetition about a £ black hole but we be deal with very serious matter such as people ’s employment ultimately i hear the chancellor talk about a central planning agenda but it be public service that be the problem they be waste money and we must seriously consider that will the chancellor accept if the economy turn down next year which it surely will that she have make a mess of it 
 we mention the £ because that be the inheritance that the government now have to address we have publish a line by line account of the £ black hole that the previous government leave we be now grow the economy through our national wealth fund our planning reform and our pension reform and we be reform our public service so that we can deliver for the people we come here to represent 
 as the treasury team may be aware there be a grow body of evidence that the growth of the financial sector beyond a certain size have an impact on the economy particularly the productive economy over a year period it have cost the rest of the economy £ so how will the chancellor ensure that a grow financial sector will not harm the government ’s wide mission and the productive economy 
 my hon friend will know that there be a long stand debate about the relationship between financial and real economy growth on which there be no consensus the government be clear that we see the financial service sector as a key part of our future economic success the growth of the uk economy and our wide mission will not be achieve if we do not champion of our big asset the growth of the uk ’s financial service sector and mobilise it towards achieve those goal 
 achieve for children be the arm ’s length body of richmond council that deliver its vital child ’s service yet because of the rise in employer ’s national insurance it now face a staggering bill of £ because the employee be not directly employ by richmond council when the chancellor look at her local government settlement will she build in reimbursement for council such as richmond or indeed exempt arm ’s length body 
 as the hon member will know we announce in the budget an increase in local government funding of next year and the chancellor announce extra funding for early year provider to deliver government fund childcare place mean that total funding will be over £ in i look forward to the hon member ’s support for all that extra funding 
 today be international day of persons with disability with a disability employment gap of nearly and a disability pay gap of nearly how be the chancellor help to address those inequality 
 just today the government launch the disability finance code for entrepreneurship something champion by my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade to ensure that people from all type of background include those with disability can start and grow their own business 
 when the windsor framework be introduce it be accompany by the boast that access to the eu single market would result in a huge increase in investment in northern ireland be the chancellor aware that invest ni have report that there have be no upturn and be that not because of the barrier present by the irish sea border to the bringing of raw material into northern ireland from great britain 
 the government be commit to increase the flow of investment to every nation and region of the united kingdom and we will continue to work with the northern ireland executive to deliver that for the people of northern ireland 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the war in ukraine 
 the uk ’s support for ukraine to defend itself against russian aggression be ironclad in july this year the government commit to provide ukraine with £ of military aid every year for as long as need in october we announce that the uk government would provide a furth £ as the uk ’s contribution to the $ g7 loan earmark as budgetary support for ukraine ’s military spending this will be provide in addition to our bilateral military aid we be also step up and speed up delivery of our military support 
 the uk be also lead the way in term of pressure on russia and putin ’s war machine to date we have sanction over individual and entity under the russia sanction regime sanction have deprive russia of over $ since february equivalent to more year of funding for the invasion putin ’s problem be grow with casualty to date voluntary recruitment down and an unsustainable war economy russia have be force to rely on iran for missile and on the democratic people ’s republic of korea for foot soldier 
 our support to ukraine be a core uk national interest a russian victory would diminish the west ’s global standing create a zone of instability on our eastern flank and embolden putin and other autocrat this could require cold war level of defence spending on   november we pass a grim milestone—1,000 day since putin launch his full scale invasion million of ukrainians have be displace from their home or force into exile and as we know from our constituency we have home full of ukrainian family 
 the prime minister have make it clear that we need to double down on our support for ukraine as the foreign secretary tell the united nations security council last month we stand with the people of ukraine during this terrible period of its history it be wonderful to have cross party support for that and for the support that the uk will deliver for as long as it take until ukraine prevail to ensure that this can never happen again 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question follow the prime minister ’s comment yesterday we need some clarity from the government on their approach to ukraine at the lord mayor ’s banquet the prime minister say that it be important to 
 put ukraine in the strong possible position for negotiation so that they can secure a just and last peace on their term 
 we can all agree that ukrainians must be able to determine their own future i be sure the minister recognise that the language use by the prime minister yesterday evening at the lord mayor ’s banquet about negotiation be new 
 on   november   in the house the prime minister make no reference to negotiation for peace state 
 we have consistently say that we will do what it take to support ukraine and put it in the good possible position go into the winter 
 and that 
 russia could roll back its force and end this war tomorrow ”—[official report   november vol c. 
 as the minister point out the foreign secretary state here on   november 
 the final truth be that putin have no interest in a just peace ”—[official report   november vol c. 
 we all agree that put ukraine in the strong possible position to counter russia ’s illegal invasion be right we be all proud in this house across this government and the previous government of how we have lead on that support to ukraine and its people however if the government be frame that through the lens of negotiation do the minister believe that that represent a departure from the current approach and from the statement issue in this house 
 the minister will herself have see president zelensky ’s late remark about nato membership it be important for nato to speak with voice on these matter and this unity be absolutely crucial so can the minister update the house on the government ’s current position on ukraine accede to nato 
 we all continue to see more appalling brutality from putin with his pummelling of civilian and ukraine ’s energy system constantly as winter kick in which be start to hurt the people of ukraine the misery that that could inflict be the most atrocious form of psychological and physical warfare the uk have lead so much on ukraine so can the minister confirm whether the government be look at what more can be do to protect ukraine ’s energy infrastructure can she reassure the house that we will keep on do everything we can do to support the defence of freedom in ukraine 
 i reassure the right hon lady that there be no change in the uk position we have always say that we will support ukraine to achieve a just peace on its own term the pm have be clear include in his speech last night that 
 we must continue to back ukraine and do what it take to support self defence for as long as it take 
 because it be for ukraine to determine its position in any future discussion putin can not be trust russia have violate multiple previous agreement and the clear path to peace be for russia to withdraw its troop from ukraine tomorrow and respect ukrainian border 
 on the nato membership question that the right hon lady pose ukraine ’s place be in nato the ally agree in washington on   july   that ukraine be on an 
 irreversible path to full euro atlantic integration include nato membership 
 and the uk fully support that goal 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 while europeans spend barely the cost of cup of coffee a week on support for the war in ukraine of russia ’s total expenditure be spend on the war   they have have to cut social security and raise taxis to pay for the war effort while speculation about the future of the war be understandable in the current circumstance it be really important that we remain firm do my hon friend agree that we must remain steadfast in our support for ukraine we stand with ukraine 
 the chair of the foreign affairs committee and its member hear from the foreign secretary last week about the uk ’s steadfast support for ukraine and our strong friendship i be sure my right hon friend the select committee chair be aware of that give all the ukrainians who be base in home in her constituency and i reassure she that we will be steadfast and keep the support go for as long as it take 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we be watch with grave concern the most recent development in ukraine and the attack on its energy network at the weekend show that putin have no concern for non combatant the use by russia of a hypersonic missile and the allege change in russia ’s nuclear doctrine be clear effort to intimidate ukraine ’s partner do the minister agree that we must stand firm in our support for ukraine 
 president elect trump have say that he will end the war within hour and vice president elect vance have say that ukraine must give up its territory in negotiation but cede any territory will only give the wrong signal to other autocratic regime around the world we must urgently repair our broken relationship with our european ally to ensure that we act unite in support of ukraine regardless of trump ’s potential action what be be do to strengthen the uk ’s commitment and contribution to european collective security to support ukraine 
 we support the bill to release the interest on frozen russian asset that be hold in the uk to help ukraine but will the minister commit to work with ally to mobilise the principal not the interest on more than $ of asset so that there be a plan b if america withdraw financial support 
 i thank the hon lady for her meaty contribution on energy the uk have provide more than £ for energy security and resilience in ukraine through grant in kind support and loan guarantee that include £ to support ukraine to repair protect and replace energy infrastructure target by russian strike there be nothing bad than see family in darkness during conflict 
 on russian asset we be pleased that our sanction regime have respect across the globe that begin under the previous government and enjoy cross party support throughout the last parliament and it continue to enjoy support our good legal mind be design out the fraud and kleptocracy that for so many year have dog our economy that be a personal priority of the foreign secretary right down to the proceed of chelsea football club we be fight every inch to ensure that money from those asset go straight back into support ukrainians 
 i agree wholeheartedly with the prime minister ’s comment last night that we need a just and last peace for ukraine on its term and in any negotiation that should be the central position follow the election of president trump what discussion have the government have with our international partner about the potential impact of that on ukraine especially give report from kursk in russia that certain troop be hold on to their position wait on the outcome of the incoming trump administration ’s thought on negotiation 
 i thank the chair of the defence committee for his question we be all watch closely what be happen in kursk and we be extremely concerned by the additional force from the democratic people ’s republic of korea who be estimate to be around in number it be so sad to see the strong potential for those young man to be victim of this war we be also aware that it will be a tough few month while we re establish our joint work with all partner across the us the uk and europe but of this we can be sure it be not a good sign or a good message for anyone to see that an aggressive invasion such as putin ’s invasion across the border of ukraine can somehow be the right thing or that it can be successful we must use all our diplomatic tool across the chamber to speak to friend in the uk and the us who have great friendship with the people of ukraine and to continue to make the case for the man woman and child of ukraine 
 it be excellent to see all front bench spokesman include the minister so united on this question do she accept that putin have make his attitude to the independence of ukraine namely that it should cease to exist as an independent nation crystal clear and therefore any enforce treaty to which he be a signatory be utterly and completely worthless 
 the right hon gentleman make an important point about the psychology of this conflict it be why it be so important particularly in these desperate winter month that we remain firm i commend he and other for all their work on the all party parliamentary group on ukraine and all their work on security and intelligence to provide that important dedicated cross party support to ukraine in the end we know that it be for ukraine to determine its position on its future its just peace and its vision for its own people but we will be behind the ukrainians so that they know we can be rely on 
 i be hearten to hear the minister say that we would support the self defence of ukraine for as long as it take of the most important aspect of that be the development of new military technology particularly through joint venture between the uk and ukraine on area such as drone and unmanned aerial vehicle such example be the black arrow project the stage of that project have be complete and the drone have be manufacture but they have be stick here since may this year because no export control licence have be grant will the minister implore her colleague in the department for business and trade to facilitate   those licence quickly as those drone will help not just the defence of ukraine but our sovereign manufacturing capability for defence 
 i commend the chair of the all party parliamentary group on ukraine not just for his very long train trip across ukraine to visit and offer his support but for his technical knowledge if he will give i permission i will write to he with detail of exactly where the project be at so that he can give reassurance to all of his many follower in ukraine 
 today the bbc be report a russian submarine sailing between japanese island and close to taiwan last month we have report of a russian ship be monitor by hms cattistock near our own uk water how concerned should we be that russia be flex its muscle will the uk be step up its direct support to ukraine and make our troop particularly our royal navy ready for additional patrol and potential direct involvement to defend our ally and our shore 
 i thank the hon lady for her detailed knowledge and her question we know that the euro atlantic and indo pacific work closely together on all these navy question i would not want to give anything specific away at the dispatch box that might help president putin but it be good to see that she be monitor that it be so important that we continue to work together whether that be through the training of force on the ground air defence or navy asset 
 it be clearly more important than ever that the uk work closely with our european friend and ally as we face the common threat of russian aggression can my hon friend outline how the government intend to strengthen co operation with the eu on the security challenge that we all face 
 my hon friend will be aware that just last week germany make an important announcement about continue military support there have be a step change particularly in light of the importance of the defence of europe have a war on european soil be so instructive and i think people be slowly come to the table it be clear that the uk have a real leadership position and that be why the eu uk security pact work be so important the europe minister my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty be work hard to develop that as member will be aware we have just announce more collaboration with germany where possible and specifically in relation to ukraine in general the uk have so much to offer the eu in that regard we know that the ongoing conversation we be have more holistically about eu uk relation be enrich by our defence capability 
 i congratulate the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel on secure this urgent question and i thank the minister for her statement we be just past the anniversary of when ukraine vote for independence to remind everybody every single part of ukraine vote for independence do she   agree and will she remind any incoming administration anywhere perhaps in the united states that the territorial integrity of ukraine be set in international law and must be respect 
 the key word be respect border and that be where the neocolonial philosophy of president putin as he lay out originally in that seminal essay before the war show how completely at odd with the modern viewpoint he be yes we will support ukraine on its vision of its own border its own strength and its own sovereignty 
 it can feel with russian submarine reccee our water with north korean troop fight for russia and with iranian drone cause the death of ukrainians that russia want a big war we must deter it that be why we must absolutely drive a victory for ukraine a total victory do the minister agree with i and general george marshall that the good way to win a war be to prevent it in the place 
 i thank my hon and gallant friend for his service to the uk and for his intimate knowledge of what it actually mean to be at war and therefore to talk about deterrence i be commit as be the whole front bench team to work as closely as possible on all the international friendship and treaty and the pressure that we can bring to bear so that we can achieve a last peace together and be behind ukraine as it step forward into a very uncertain future 
 aspect of support that the uk could offer ukraine be expire medical equipment and dressing a charity base in axminster in my constituency call medics4ukraine have just get back from odesa it have be train municipal worker and it say that it need dressing haemostatic dressing and gauze will she speak to her counterpart in the department of health and social care to see whether some of the expired item could be release for that purpose 
 i refer the hon and gallant gentleman to the discussion in the adjournment debate last night on medical assistance in conflict the uk have an enormous amount of resource in that area i will certainly look into what be possible and write to he with what we be already do in relation to ukraine 
 i very much welcome the statement the ongoing commitment we have see from this government and the co operation with the previous government on ukraine because it be not just about security in europe as these thing be in our self interest may i impress on the minister that if ukraine be allow to fall it will not just be a european problem so much grain that be grow in ukraine find its way to africa if ukraine fall people in africa will starve too 
 i thank my hon friend for make an important point we all watch summer ago with bated breath as the black sea grain negotiation occur and the impact of miss out on that important agricultural wealth in ukraine and the deleterious effect it have on develop nation be of concern to all in   this house he be right to speak about the knock on effect of conflict we must redouble our effort to stop that happen 
 many of the ukrainian refugee live in my constituency have express relief and gratitude that there have be continuity of policy in still support ukraine with the change of government but at a time when russia be find that its economy be affect by the war and be have to rely on iran china and korea to continue the war do the minister think it unwise to start talk of negotiation about land and so on which will only encourage putin and his regime should we not be talk about increase the resolve of our partner give military support and seize russian asset to let ukraine use they 
 there be no change in the uk position we have always say that we will support ukraine to achieve a just peace on its own term the prime minister have be clear include in his speech last night that we must continue to back ukraine and do what it take to support its self defence for as long as it take 
 the chair of the foreign affairs committee make a strong case about the financial pressure that russia find itself in what additional pressure can we place on russia be there any plan to introduce a sanction bill 
 i thank my hon friend the chair of the work and pensions committee we have a good showing of select committee chairs in the house today i reassure she that the uk have impose measure on over individual and entity the most wide range sanction ever impose on a major economy most recently we have impose sanction against vessel in russia ’s shadow fleet transport russian oil outside g7 sanction may i say how pleased i be i be sure that i speak for everybody across the house that through our leadership on sanction with our good legal mind we have manage to bring in all those financial penalty against the aggressor 
 i thank the minister for her answer president zelensky have be clear that nato membership must mean article include the entirety of ukraine territory what discussion have the fcdo and perhaps the minister have with our nato ally to ensure that that be the case will she commit in particular to discuss the issue with the current and incoming us secretaries of state to ensure that a co ordinated approach be take on behalf of ukraine 
 as the hon member be aware ukraine ’s place be in nato it have say so itself he support that principle ally agree in washington on   july   that ukraine be on an irreversible path to full euro atlantic integration include nato membership of course the uk fully support that goal the hon member play an important role in that because in the us there be important irish counterpart or those who might have heritage there who will want to hear from he to lay out the case for support ukraine 
 give the nato secretary general ’s recent warning about a grow alliance between china russia iran and north korea will the minister clarify what work the uk be do to counter that threat 
 as my hon friend might have gather it be from a position of weakness that those country be be rely on to shore up support that be why it be so important that we look holistically at our sanction regime which can not be just about the current conflict it must also be about how we stop the iranian military juggernaut and how we look at the military industrial complex which work across all sort of different regime that be why it be also so important to understand how the economy of the dprk can tip into russia and for we to work with country who support we and do not support that particular access so that we can win the argument as well as the battle 
 i be grateful to the minister for the clarity she have bring to the urgent question i do not think anyone in the house agree that vladimir putin can be allow to get away with take even a single inch of territory in ukraine and i do not think that anyone be not alive to the danger of give people like that what they want they always come back for more give those fact will she confirm that we will back ukraine for as long as it take and that any eventual deal will be complete entirely on ukraine ’s term and not on russia ’s 
 of course that be why we have support ukraine as it have make the case for want to be in nato and as it have make the case for be as close as possible to friend in europe that be why we have support the ukrainians in their request for either military or non military aid that be why we have implore other even as far away as the indo pacific to assist in this push to ensure that there be as much support as possible to stand up to bully 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the outcome of the parliamentary election in georgia

 i read with some alarm the report about the georgian election include a report by the osce on vote buying multi voting russian disinformation and intimidation be the minister aware that the european parliament pass a motion last thursday state that the election have be neither free nor fair and should be rerun be the british position the same 
 i thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her intimate knowledge of the election in georgia our current position be to monitor the situation we be look carefully at what our european partner say but we be also encourage the georgian authority to determine any complaint as there have be a number of complaint about irregularity we be clear that all irregularity should be thoroughly investigate in addition we be call for demonstration to be peaceful an end to any police brutality the exercise of restraint and respect for the process of the formation of a new government while we be not call for a rerun of the election we want to know the outcome of the investigation into those irregularity 
 i call the opposition spokesperson 
 i be grateful to the minister for her remark so far the shocking and disturbing scene in georgia have be hard for all to witness and i note the statement put out by the foreign office this morning we share the government ’s deep anxiety over the situation in georgia 
 what be happen in georgia matter from the law on foreign influence to election irregularity and the excessive use of force in recent day against protester and journalist we be witness georgia be drag down a dangerous path it matter for the georgian people for our important bilateral relationship and for the wide euro atlantic community which sincerely seek close tie and a deep friendship with georgia our clear and unambiguous aim should be to support the georgian people and that include their desire for a future root in the euro atlantic community 
 will the minister confirm she have tell her georgian counterpart in no uncertain term that they need to tone down the aggressive rhetoric de escalate the situation on the street and stop blame other for the current tension will she also commit to pull every diplomatic lever to support the georgian people as they go through this dark period 
 finally and more broadly i will circle back to the question i ask last week at foreign office question because this be a clear example of the danger of europe become a more contested space will the minister urgently come forward with a plan that build on the work of the previous government to be more muscular in leverage our soft power so that we can counter attempt to sow division and instead bang the drum for the euro atlantic community we need to demonstrate to country in europe and around the world that a partnership with we and choose democracy and openness be the good route to prosperity 
 we believe that the georgian authority must investigate all irregularity and reverse the decline commitment to democracy as the right hon lady have lay out we fully support georgia ’s euro atlantic aspiration in line with the strong will of the georgian people georgia be a valuable international security partner in the south caucasus with which we enjoy a long history and close bilateral relation we be therefore redouble our effort to connect with georgians to encourage restraint and peaceful demonstration and to encourage the investigation of those irregularity so that there can be no doubt about what actually happen   at the recent election the uk remain resolutely commit to georgia ’s independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognise border 
 the right hon lady ask about soft power of course in this house we all know the importance of soft power that be why we be work hard with the british council and group that support democracy and young people in different democracy follow difficult year for soft power in the uk when all funding be drain away from our important soft power organisation that be also why we be seek to rebuild our reputation for soft power where perhaps we have step backwards a little over the past few year 
 my georgian friend and colleague in civil society with whom i have work for many year be call this a maidan moment for the country protester have be brutally assault and there have be report of journalist be hospitalise give that many georgian dream official have tie to the uk will the minister say whether if this continue the full range of government tool will be consider sanction visa ban or financial restriction for example would hit those responsible where it really hurt 
 i thank my hon friend who chair the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax for his pointed question and his support for freedom of the press we know that journalist must be free to report the fact although he tempt i to speculate he know that i will not go there on any future sanction arrangement we always keep those quiet until we make the announcement for obvious reason he comment on the backsliding on freedom of the press and on the link between georgia and the uk which we will certainly investigate if he have specific question or concern in relation to those matter could he write to we so that we can investigate 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson
