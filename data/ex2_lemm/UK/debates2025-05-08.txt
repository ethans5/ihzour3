i be sure the whole house will join i in send all the love and good wish to my hon friend and to her dear friend hannah deakin and her friend who be here in the public gallery today i remember my hon friend mention and raise this campaign many time on her behalf i can truly say that hannah have change the life of many and she have change policy her life will be long remember by many many other and we all pay great tribute to she today 
 nhs england have find that create that environment do not necessarily provide new and well way of repurpose drug and that can be do far more efficiently and far less bureaucratically by use local off label prescribing we be look at how we can incentivise researcher and clinical trial to explore repurpose drug 
 we be determined to make the nihr and other funder grasp opportunity to support those proposal we will help researcher work with industry and clinician to strengthen the evidence base for new drug 
 the nhs be work hard to diagnose and treat cancer on time there be more to do on early diagnosis and fast treatment in order to improve patient experience and survival the nhs be focus on improve diagnostic waiting time and on provide mri ct and other test to reduce cancer wait because as lord darzi ’s investigation have show we face significant challenge if we be to bring this country ’s cancer survival rate back up to the standard of the good in the world we know that the good way to improve survival for those with brain tumour and with all cancer be to diagnose patient early and treat they quickly 
 in our month more patient receive a diagnosis or an all clear within day than do in the previous year thank to investment in cut nhs waiting list in march more than of patient in england refer for cancer have it rule out or diagnose within day it be the time that target have be meet in year but we must go far and we will our reform to cancer care will see more than people diagnose fast and thousand more start treatment within month across the nhs 
 there be no single solution to this complex challenge that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state have be clear that there will be a national cancer plan publish later this year this plan will ensure that rare cancer include brain cancer will not be leave behind it be my absolute privilege as a person with cancer to be drive that cancer plan i be delighted   that we have so far receive more than representation as part of the call for evidence i can assure my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden that her contribution and all other will be take seriously 
 the liberal democrat spokesperson also talk about low grade cancer there be a difference between staging and grade and it be important that we be clear about that low grade brain tumour be consider non cancerous and they grow more slowly and be less likely to spread but although low grade brain tumour be generally non cancerous they can have similar serious symptom and require surgery or radiotherapy to treat they the government be invest in new life save and life improve research to support people diagnose with those cancer 
 in closing for those affect by this devastating disease every discovery every treatment and every moment matter we recognise that more need to be do to stimulate high quality high impact research into brain tumour through our targeted package of support that be what we will do we completely understand the strength of feeling on this issue not least because ministers in the department of health and social care be cancer survivor we know how terrifying it be to receive a diagnosis we have sit in wait room hop for good news and fear the bad and we have hear the bad we have have those difficult conversation with our love one and see the devastating impact on their life that be why we be committed to make a real difference for patient with brain cancer we will leave no stone unturned until they get the class care that they deserve i look forward to far discuss how we can achieve this when i meet member of the all party parliamentary group on brain tumour next week 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to consult the public on reform to the water sector 
 what step he be take to consult the public on reform to the water sector 
 i start by acknowledge on ve day the debt that we all owe to that great generation who sacrifice so much for our freedom we will remember they and their sacrifice forever 
 the independent water commission lead by sir jon cunliffe will make recommendation to transform our water system and clean up our waterway the recommendation will form the basis of further legislation to fix our break water system a public call for evidence that run for week and close on   april   receive a very high number of response those will be share in detail when the commission publish its recommendation sir jon and the commission have hold more than meeting include with regulator environmental group campaigner investor water company and consumer body engagement will continue ahead of the commission ’s recommendation to the government in a few week 
 i echo the secretary of state ’s initial comment south shields have a long stand problem with sewage be dump in the sea at whitburn just this week little haven beach be hand a brown flag and myself and local campaigner be completely feed up the environment agency ofwat northumbrian water the council and the last government all completely ignore our concern we have already request a meeting with the water minister and i hope she will confirm today that the meeting will happen very soon 
 i congratulate my hon friend on her tireless work to represent the concern of people in south shields about those terrible problem with water pollution of course my hon friend vote for the   water special measures act which have give the regulator many more power include the power to ban undeserved multimillion pound bonus i be sure she will be interested to read as will i the finding from the independent water commission lead by sir jon cunliffe when they come forward in a few week time 
 as we act to protect our river and waterway from pollution regulation will be important the environment agency ’s resource be decimate under the conservatives how will the act give the environment agency the power it need to hold pollute company to account 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the previous government cut resource for regulation in half and that be of the way water company be able to get away with so much pollution we have change the law to allow regulator to recover prosecution cost so that they can carry out further prosecution and stop those who have be pollute our waterway 
 can i make an appeal to the secretary of state and indeed his whole front bench not to make farmer a scapegoat in any water reform clearly where farming and farmer be involve in bad practice they should be penalise but social industrialist other employer and indeed those in the public sector might also pollute river water be a critical part of the food supply chain and agriculture farmer look after the environment on all our behalf in the right way most of the time my appeal to the secretary of state be to please get the national farmers union and farmer involve and not let they become scapegoat 
 i of course agree with the right hon member we be support farmer many of whom be affect by very severe flooding recently with the farming recovery fund i be engage constantly and will be again today with the national farmers union about those issue and many other 
 by we will need more than additional megalitre of water a day with rise temperature result in a fivefold increase in drought risk that be concern news for farmer in glastonbury and somerton give the necessity of water for livestock and crop what step be the secretary of state take to consult farmer about reform to the water sector and do he know how important water be to food production 
 we recognise the importance of that point the hon lady will be aware that at the close of the price review process we secure £ of investment now and over the next year to improve water infrastructure and ensure that we get water to where it need to be we have also increase flooding funding so that we can take the water away from where it should not be all of that will support food production as well as many other sector of the economy 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on good practice on monitoring sewage overflow 
 official and i continue to maintain regular engagement with the scottish government on many issue while sewage overflow monitoring be a devolved matter for scotland we continue to share good practice wherever appropriate the snp government should follow this government ’s lead and introduce robust legislation to clean up their waterway 
 the beautiful beach of my constituency be mar by sewage relate debris in scotland under the snp we do not even properly monitor sewage overflow meanwhile in england the labour government be make great stride to improve water quality how i wish we have that in scotland will the secretary of state commit to work as constructively as possible with his counterpart in the scottish government so that they can learn from here how we can improve water quality in scotland 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for highlight the pollution and sewage on beach that so concern his constituent it be deeply disappointing that the snp government in edinburgh be not follow the uk government ’s lead in tackle sewage pollution i agree with my hon friend that his constituent like mine and everyone else in scotland and right across the uk deserve to enjoy sewage free lake river and beach sadly that do not seem to be what they be get from the snp 
 my constituent in bognor regis and littlehampton have be subject to an enormous increase in their water bill will the secretary of state reassure the house that his water review will seek way to prevent the cost of water company mismanagement be pass on to their customer 
 i be sure that the hon lady will be reassure to hear that the government have ringfence money that be earmark for investment in water infrastructure so that it can no long be divert for payment on bonus and dividend if water company attempt to do anything of the kind the money will be refund to their customer through a discount on their bill 
 whether he be take step to limit increase to water bill 
 i add my voice to all those pay tribute to the great generation as we all remember ve day i know that many of we will be travel back to our constituency to join in celebration up and down the country 
 it be no wonder that the public be angry about pay the price for conservative failure by allow water infrastructure to decay on their watch the previous conservative government not only fail to ensure proper regulation of the industry but drive up cost of essential repair result in increase bill for customer while i can not undo the damage of the past i can   ensure that it never happen again that be why fund for vital infrastructure have be ringfence by this government so that it can never be divert for bonus or dividend 
 roberto of my constituent have see his water bill go up by nearly in the last year and other constituent have contact i to say that their bill have nearly double in that time i be pleased by what the minister say about hold the previous government to account for their failure to invest in infrastructure what more can the government do to hold thames water to account for its failure to invest in infrastructure its poor service and these rip off charge for consumer 
 roberto be right to feel angry about his bill increase the past performance of water company and the toothless regulation under the previous government we have already take action to deliver our manifesto promise to hold water company to account ban unfair bonus and introduce criminal liability with up to year in prison we have also create the water delivery taskforce to ensure that all water company include thames water deliver on their promise infrastructure improvement the government will always support those struggle with their water bill indeed this labour government and water company be more than double the social tariff support over the next year 
 what assessment have the minister make on the cost of water bill from increase to regulation laboratory testing capacity i write to she in december about that and she reply in january i be thankful for her answer although it be slightly on the complacent side because she say that regulation do not cause a problem to water quality just now that be true but the industry be burn down its asset to chemical and equipment that have be regulation test so a problem be come what assessment have the minister make of when the solution will be deliver and what effect will that have on water bill 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his important question everything relate to regulation of water be support and look at through the drinking water inspectorate which carry out an assessment to make sure we have the good water quality in the whole country if he require any further detail he be welcome to write to i again and i will make sure i find it 
 what plan he have for future fishing quota 
 on ve day it be important that we remember the huge contribution make by fisherman fishing community farm worker and agricultural worker during the last war to keep the country feed later today i shall unveil a plaque to the member of the women ’s land army of whom be my aunt jean mead they make a fantastic contribution during that period 
 we negotiate a range of fishing quota and any future quota will be agree only if that be in the national interest i be pleased that we be engage closely with industry trialle new method to shape future allocation that will both protect stock and support community 
 a recent poll by the scottish fishermen ’s federation show that of scot believe the uk should control access to our fishing water third of seafood land in the uk come into scotland and it be vital to our economy and to many of our coastal community will the minister show the house and rural and fishing community across the country that the prime minister will not negotiate away any control of our water during his eu reset later this month 
 i thank the hon lady for her important question and i recognise the importance of the scottish fishing fleet and its contribution she will have to wait a little long to hear the full detail of the outcome of any negotiation but i have to remind she that the sense of betrayal across fishing community come under her government ’s watch 
 what recent progress he have make on the surrey hill national landscape area of outstanding natural beauty boundary variation project 
 on this anniversary of ve day i pay tribute to the city of coventry which suffer so grievously in the blitz the commemoration be mark at the old and new cathedral with the lighting of the torch for peace a brilliant initiative from the commonwealth war graves commission to mark the contribution of my city to the war effort 
 natural england ’s work to consider the surrey hill national landscape boundary variation have reach the conclusion of the statutory consultation phase the response receive will be complete shortly and the analysis of those and the result will be publish in early summer 
 on ve day i remember the role of dunsfold aerodrome in my constituency which play a vital role in the battle of britain 
 i thank the minister for her response she know that the propose expansion of the surrey hill national landscape will have a huge impact by improve biodiversity and natural protection in village such as dunsfold tongham bramley wonersh and shamley green in my constituency before she make the final decision on whether to go ahead will she spare the time to meet i so i can explain to she just how important the expansion be to my constituent 
 i be always happy to meet the right hon gentleman this and the yorkshire wold be under active consideration as i be sure he be aware there be a legal process to be follow ahead of that but i know his constituency and will be very happy to meet to discuss the matter far 
 what step he have take to help protect community vulnerable to flooding 
 after year the conservatives leave our flood defence in the bad condition on record we be invest a record £ in a project to well protect property by march 
 follow the recent storm season serious flooding damage the foundation of radyr cricket club and expose electrical cable which force the club to close and cancel practice until the site be make safe the club be also situate next to important electricity infrastructure which mean up to customer could be put at risk of disruption i have be work with councillor helen lloyd jones to try and find a way forward between national grid and natural resources wales to establish who will take responsibility for secure the river bank and the electricity infrastructure unfortunately we be at an impasse and my constituent continue to be vulnerable to further flooding will the minister meet i to establish what the uk government can do to try and help break that impasse before the next storm season hit 
 i be sure they have get a meeting already 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue and i be sorry to hear about the issue his constituent be face with flooding i know at hand how disruptive and awful flooding can be as i be sure he know flooding be a devolved matter in wales but i would of course be happy to work with he and to facilitate the meeting that he request 
 next month a planning application for a biodigester near haverhill and withersfield in west suffolk will be decide it be the wrong location for many reason not least the risk of flooding as the propose site be on flood risk zone land what be the government do to prevent development on land susceptible to flooding 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point of course the national planning policy framework be clear that where development in area at risk of flooding be necessary local planning authority and developer should ensure that the development be appropriately flood resilient and resistant safe for the development ’s lifetime and importantly will not increase flood risk elsewhere we be also look at other measure such as sustainable urban drainage system to be include in planning as well 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on the anniversary of ve day i thank those who fight for our and europe ’s freedom and indeed those who work our land and keep our nation feed 
 our peatland store time more carbon than forest they improve water quality and protect community up and down the uk from flood the nature minister rightly call peatland our country ’s amazon rainforest and launch a consultation to protect they she be right because once they have be destroy they can never be replace at the very same time the energy secretary plan to rip up hectare of protect peatland on historic land in west yorkshire for a vast wind farm development open up community to flood and destroy the peatland that labour say it want to protect how can the government claim to be protect our irreplaceable peatland when the department for energy security and net be actively consider destroy of our most environmentally important landscape in the country 
 i pay tribute to the hon member ’s ability to weave a question for the department for energy security and net into a question on flooding he will have hear from the nature minister how important peatland be and how essential they be for this country and hear our commitment to protect they 
 what step he be take to help prevent foot and mouth disease enter northern ireland 
 we have discuss this serious issue in the chamber before and i know how seriously member on both side of the house take it the government make it an absolute priority to protect farmer from the danger of this awful threat the government have step up measure to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease follow confirm case in slovakia and hungary import into northern ireland of live animal and susceptible meat product be prohibit from within the restriction zone surround the affected premise in hungary and slovakia 
 i join in the secretary of state ’s word on ve day especially regard northern ireland ’s contribution to our armed force and through the armament we supply 
 when i contact the agriculture minister in northern ireland about his responsibility he actually tell i that the issue no long sit within his ministerial responsibility but come directly under the control of the environment secretary what practical step be the minister take to protect northern ireland farmer especially in regard to the recent announcement of a case of african swine fever on   may   in slovakia within the same geographical area as those foot and mouth outbreak 
 we work closely with the minister in northern ireland for exactly the reason that he would expect we take this extremely seriously there be a range of threat in europe and that be why we have not only put in place the long establish and well trialle measure but add additional protection measure to ensure that we be properly protect 
 farmer in northern ireland who fear foot and mouth and even dog owner like i rely on good veterinary support but this be no long the world of james herriot a number of large company dominate the market the competition and markets authority say that remedy be need do the minister agree and will he commit to review the veterinary surgeons act which be clearly no long fit for purpose 
 my hon friend make an important point i can assure he that i and baroness hayman who lead on this in the department be very well aware of the recent report and the antiquated nature of the legislation we will come back with proposal in due course 
 whether he plan to improve support for nature friendly farming

 order we have a lot to get through today come on 
 i be always interested to hear reflection from farmer i have speak to other member of the nature friendly farming network who be very pleased with the progress be make but of course we want to   go fast and far we have over people in the scheme and more money be be spend than ever before we must recognise the important progress be make 
 what step his department be take to help prevent the spread of avian influenza 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise this extremely serious issue to prevent the further spread of disease and manage the risk of avian influenza defra and the animal and plant health agency have implement well establish outbreak structure to control and eradicate disease restore normal trade and support recovery in local community avian influenza prevention zone be in force across the uk to far protect farmer and help community we be currently invest £ in the future of the biosecurity lab at weybridge 
 do the minister agree that avian influenza remain an existential threat to the poultry industry and now that the french have decide to vaccinate their duck will he agree to the national farmers union request that we introduce the vaccination of seasonal turkey in order to protect the entire industry 
 as ever the right hon gentleman make a well inform point vaccination have be consider for some time there be trade issue but as he say the fact that the french be change their position be useful the government be commit to explore option for vaccination and a cross government and industry avian influenza vaccination taskforce have be establish it publish an initial statement on   march   and will report more fully this summer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 avian influenza sadly be still very much with we have devastate both wild and domestic bird in recent year with bluetongue still here african swine fever on our doorstep and alarmingly foot and mouth outbreak this year in germany hungary and slovakia we face significant threat to our biosecurity disease surveillance vaccination and control be crucial centre with the animal and plant health agency which i thank in these challenging time when will this government finish the work that we conservative start when we commit £ in to redevelop the apha headquarters in weybridge labour ’s repeatedly re announce £ be a start but when will it commit the furth £ for this critical national infrastructure for the sake of uk agriculture and our national security 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his word and his praise for the apha these be extremely important subject we face a range of threat that be why the government have increase security in term of personal import through the short strait in particular on his point about weybridge we have have this discussion before there be a major programme under way which   will take a number of year it be already a world lead facility and this government be commit to provide the funding that weybridge need to do its job we be absolutely committed to that which be why we have announce £ this year 
 if he will publish update climate resilience plan 
 the government be commit to strengthen the nation ’s resilience to climate change we be develop strong climate adaptation objective and improve the framework for action 
 with the effect of climate change already be feel the institution of civil engineers and other have urge the government to prioritise infrastructure resilience follow the court ruling on the national adaptation programme the government pledge to strengthen the approach but the climate change committee call this ineffective when will the department publish its update plan and how will it strengthen they 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his important question of course we welcome the climate change committee ’s assessment the government recognise the need to go far and fast to prepare for the impact of a warm world for example we be already take active step to include climate adaptation in our flood programme for the time the environment agency ’s flood risk modelling integrate potential impact of climate change on flood and coastal erosion risk the investment of £ into maintain flood defence will help to well protect property by march 
 what step he be take to tackle fly tipping 
 under the previous government fly tipping skyrocket by leave community bury under an avalanche of rubbish this government be clear up their mess tackle the waste cowboy close the loophole that allow waste crime to flourish and clean up britain we will hunt down the fly tipper with the late technology include drone and mobile cctv introduce new power to seize and crush vehicle and increase prison sentence to up to year for those transport waste illegally 
 i thank the minister for that answer i recently have the pleasure of meeting with the west lothian litter pickers who be do so much in my livingston constituency to reduce the cause and symptom of fly tipping and littering but it be scandalous that their work be need in scotland the late figure show that only of fly tipping incident have result in a fix penalty notice and a mere in a criminal prosecution do the minister agree that in sharp   contrast with this uk labour government who be take a tolerance approach and crack down on fly tipping the scottish government ’s record in this area be quite frankly rubbish 
 i be sorry to hear that the snp government be not take firm action but perhaps where we have lead the way they would like to follow i congratulate west lothian litter pickers and pay tribute to keep britain tidy whose great british spring clean back by the daily mirror help to tackle the tonne of litter discard on our street each year include cigarette butt each cigarette butt can poison litre of water if we be serious about marine litter we have to pick up our butt and perhaps a little less talk and a little more action from the snp 
 i recently meet with the philpot family at the diverse and successful barleylands farm in my constituency fly tipping be a major concern for they and other local farmer and they be work together to address it they tell i that although fly tipping be a major issue it be not the existential threat that the tax increase this labour government be impose on they be with the national insurance tax increase and the massive rise in agricultural property relief and business property relief they be right be they not 
 i congratulate the right hon gentleman on weave in a farm question on fly tipping but he be right—[interruption calm down 
 please let ’s calm down this be a very important day i be the decision maker on whether question be right or wrong anyhow 
 thank you mr speaker 
 we know that fly tipping be a very big problem for farmer i have visit fly tip site near watford in the last month and speak to farmer about what they have to do to clear they up it be clear that many tory run county council be not play their part in clean up fly tipping and make the prosecution that act as a disincentive to these criminal business and their business model 
 what step he be take to help reduce the cost of material for arable farm 
 annual variation in farm input cost be drive by global market uk fertiliser farm gate price be tie to movement in the international market and uk fertiliser supplier compete for market share provide the good price they can for farmer 
 farm in my constituency and across fife produce some of the high quality grain in the world however many farmer be struggle to make a profit as import grain be often produce at a different standard that can undermine or undercut cereal grow in scotland which be produce to the high standard   scottish grain be a vital ingredient for high quality scotch whisky and with the news this week of the trade deal with india welcome by the scotch whisky association demand for scottish grain be likely to rise what step will the minister take to increase standard for import grain and ensure profit for farmer in my constituency and a consistent supply for sector include scotch whisky 
 i can assure my hon friend that we will always maintain our high standard all import product will continue to be subject to clear control include limit for pesticide residue i join he in share the really good news on that trade deal it be good news for scotch whisky and good news for british producer 
 my farmer in northern ireland and strangford and farmer across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland produce some of the good product price be rise sometimes due to thing we can not prevent but farmer need well price from the supermarket what be be do to ensure that our farmer who produce a quality product get the right price for the effort they put in 
 i be always grateful for a contribution from the hon gentleman as he will know a series of fair deal clause be include in the agriculture act they be be bring into effect at the moment and we expect to see more progress make in that regard he be absolutely right to raise the point that farmer should get a fair deal 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 fly tipping scandalously shoot up by over a under the previous conservative government and the public be rightly furious when they see their community bury under an avalanche of rubbish this government will clean up our street town and village we will support council to identify seize and crush waste criminal vehicle by close the tory fly tipping loophole that prevent tough action we will increase sentence for dump waste to up to year and we will make fly tipper pay the cost of impound their vehicle before they be crush because we believe that the polluter not the public should pay this government will call time on fly tipper so we can restore people ’s pride in their neighbourhood 
 the river camel multi use trail in my north cornwall constituency attract more than half a user every year and bring over £ to the local economy will the minister please meet i to discuss a river trail extension to camelford as part of this government ’s manifesto pledge to create new river walk and connect thousand more people to nature 
 i be delighted to hear that people be enjoy the river camel trail it be wonderful to visit and we want to extend more of these walk across the country so that more people can enjoy they i will of course make sure that the hon gentleman can meet the appropriate minister to raise his concern 
 i call diane abbott not here i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as we mark the anniversary of victory in europe i remember the great role that my constituency play include squadron fly from raf woodhall spa we must also remember and thank those woman and man who form the land army in order to feed our troop and our nation many of their descendant still farm the same field that their ancestor farm in the war but that tradition be under threat from this government 
 before christmas i warn the secretary of state that a farmer have take their life because they be so worried about the family farm tax the secretary of state respond with anger and later stop the farming resilience fund which help farmer with mental ill health this week i have receive the devastating news that several more farmer have take their life because of the family farm tax that be the secretary of state ’s legacy but he can change it because this change be not yet law will he set out these tragedy to the prime minister and demand that labour policy be change or offer on a point of principle his resignation 
 order this be a very important matter but i be bother that nobody else be go to get in so i hope the shadow secretary of state ’s question be short 
 i express my regret that the shadow secretary of state would seek to politicise personal tragedy in this way it be immensely regrettable that she would seek to do that none of we can know for sure what happen in matter of personal tragedy it be beneath she to try to weaponise the issue in the way that she have do this government take issue of mental health very seriously indeed we be set up mental health hub in every community so that we can support farmer and other who be suffer from mental ill health i gently remind she that this be a problem that escalate during her time in office as secretary of state for health when she fail to address the problem that people be face 
 i be sorry mr speaker but i be simply confront the secretary of state with the reality of his policy another policy be distress farmer and other people the removal of our ancient property right enshrine in the magna carta the planning and infrastructure bill give a quango natural england power to seize private land not for house building but for undefined environmental reason it can seize not just agricultural land but our constituent garden and it do not even have to pay market value for that land will the secretary of state now commit to an amendment to the bill to save our constituent garden or be this labour ’s garden grab 
 as be so often the case from that particular source that be a complete misrepresentation of the truth nothing of the kind be happen rather than try to politicise and weaponise the matter the right hon lady would help herself and people who be genuinely concerned about those issue by stick to the fact 
 i must thank the land army too i be only here because my grandma meet my grandad on his farm when she be work in the land army cornwall have a successful horticultural industry specialise in cauliflower daffodil potato and courgette the industry welcome the extension of the seasonal worker visa scheme until but what metric be be use to ensure that visa allocation will meet the industry ’s need without sufficient access to seasonal labour there be a real risk to cornwall ’s horticultural sector 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and note that even in those time of distress woe and horror some good relationship be form the seasonal worker visa scheme for seasonal worker visa be announce a few month ago that number include extra for poultry at the national farmers union conference the secretary of state announce a year extension to that will provide certainty but my hon friend be right that we need to analyse and assess very carefully what the industry need to ensure it have the resource require 
 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party 
 on behalf of all member on the liberal democrat benches i add my tribute to those who fight and die to secure our freedom i also pay tribute to those in rural community like our in westmorland who feed this country and welcome evacuee child from the city and to our community in windermere who welcome the child who have survive the nazi death camp after the war we remember they all with deep gratitude 
 have the prime minister consult the secretary of state on the potential impact on british farmer of the us uk trade deal it be a matter of fact that us animal welfare standard be bad than our which mean that import cost be low so allow equal access be not free trade it be unfair trade it be throw our farmer under the bus just as the conservatives do through their deal with australia and new zealand will the secretary of state support liberal democrat call for the deal to be sign only if it support farmer and after a vote in this house 
 there have be no announcement yet and i can not pre empt they but we have be crystal clear that we have red line we will not allow british farmer to be undercut on environmental or welfare standard in the way that the conservatives do when they agree a trade deal with australia it undercut british farmer and cause they immense damage we will never go the way of the tories we will stand square behind our farmer and i be delighted to hear that the liberal democrats feel the same 
 on a similar theme i congratulate the government on secure a good deal for our farmer in the india trade deal which be welcome by the president of the nfu who say it show that this government have clearly listen in marked contrast to the previous government what assurance will the secretary of state give i that our farmer will still be include in negotiation on the us trade deal 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for welcome the trade deal with india it be a £ boost to the uk economy and very good news for our whisky and gin producer and for the producer of salmon lamb and chocolate which be all now tariff free export to india this government will always negotiate in the national interest and that be exactly the approach we will take with the us trade negotiation 
 the solicitor general be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help reduce the crown court backlog 
 today we mark the anniversary of ve day it have be year since the ally victory in europe that bring an end to the world war i pay tribute to the extraordinary courage sacrifice and determination of our veteran and all who make that victory possible their legacy live on in the freedom that we cherish and enjoy to this very day 
 let i be absolutely clear victim be wait far too long to see justice that be completely unacceptable it have hit confidence in our criminal justice system and this government simply will not stand for it that be why we be commit to work with the crown prosecution service and partner across the criminal justice system to slash those backlog and get case through the court more quickly a review be ongoing of how we can reduce the backlog and i be confident that what emerge from that review will mean that we can get delay down and set about the kind of reform that will deliver the change that the public deserve to see 
 on the topic of backlog across the justice system the ministry of justice ’s successful campaign to recruit more magistrate be stretch the capacity of local training committee to provide sufficient mentor and appraiser to support new appointee what more can the government do to fill the gap in training capacity to well serve the interest of justice 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the vital role that magistrate play in our criminal justice system as we seek to reduce the intolerable court backlog that we inherit from the previous government i have absolutely no doubt that magistrate will continue to have a crucial role it be essential that any new magistrate receive the right level of training   and i be happy to raise the matter that my hon friend have speak about with colleague in the ministry of justice 
 i refer colleague to my entry in the register of members financial interests mediation and alternative dispute resolution be critical in reduce backlog in the court i urge ministers in addition to hold the review to look very carefully at the opportunity to use mediation more particularly mandatory mediation 
 the right hon member be absolutely right i know from my day in practice that mediation and adr have a very important role to play it be critical that we get this intolerable backlog in our crown court down and this government be take substantial action to do that we have increase the number of crown court sitting day as i refer to the lord chancellor have ask sir brian leveson to conduct an independent review of our criminal court and we be also increase the sentencing power of magistrate court 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the criminal bar association have report that more than case be adjourn last year due to a lack of available prosecuting or defence barrister a fold increase since in the south west there be half the number of legal aid provider that we have in london and my inbox reflect that with many constituent unable to access legal advice or representation particularly in housing case involve rogue landlord and unscrupulous management company meanwhile citizens advice have close its branch across cornwall what assessment have the solicitor general make of how these regional disparity in legal aid provision be drive crown court backlog especially in rural area such as my constituency of north cornwall 
 the hon member raise an important issue it be crucial that justice be accessible for everyone in this country indeed access to justice be a fundamental tenet of the rule of law that be why we have undertake a comprehensive review of civil legal aid and in december we announce a £ boost for criminal legal aid solicitor start this year we will also be introduce free independent legal adviser for victim of adult rape there be much more to do we be clear about that clearly there be deficiency in access to justice but i can assure the hon member that this government understand the scale of the problem and be commit to address it 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of rural crime 
 the government ’s safe street mission be not just about town and city centre it apply equally to our market square and rural village green rural crime can have devastating consequence for community this government be commit to   crack down on crime and disorder in rural area with tough power for the police to tackle antisocial behaviour and prevent farm theft and fly tipping that be why the crown prosecution service work closely with local police force to tackle those offence 
 accord to the late figure in the national farmers union mutual insurance society ’s rural crime report in the cost of rural crime increase by year on year to £ with criminal gang target farm up and down wales include unfortunately in my constituency prosecution rate for livestock theft in particular be very low often below despite the huge financial and emotional toll that this type of crime take on farmer what action be the government take to tackle those low prosecution rate 
 the hon member raise an important issue we know that rural and farming community face acute and bespoke threat from criminal include highly organise crime group that be exploit our rural community he have refer to livestock theft but those community also face fly tipping and machinery and fuel theft we be commit to implement the equipment theft prevention act and be also commit to far funding for the national rural and wildlife crime unit we have announce additional funding for those unit because we recognise just how critical it be to crack down on rural crime i should also mention policing because our neighbourhood policing guarantee cover the entirety of this country not just urban area but rural area too 
 what step her department be take to support the serious fraud office in tackle economic crime 
 what step her department be take to support the serious fraud office in tackle economic crime 
 this government be determined to crack down on the scourge of economic crime and the serious fraud office do crucial work to tackle complex fraud bribery and corruption under its new director the sfo have open new overt investigation and charge defendant just last week i see the sfo ’s crucial work at hand when i observe a dawn raid carry out in relation to a new multimillion pound bribery investigation 
 the vast majority of uk business play by the rule but fraud be estimate to cost uk taxpayer include my constituent between £ and £ per year what be the serious fraud office do to encourage business to self report wrongdoing 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the vast majority of business do play by the rule and fraud be so damaging precisely because it undermine everyone who play fairly that be why this government be so determined to tackle it i welcome   the sfo ’s recently revise guidance which aim to drive up the number of corporate that self report wrongdoing that be a positive development that will foster good corporate citizenship and it be an important contributor to this government ’s economic growth mission 
 i thank the solicitor general for her answer since their introduction in defer prosecution agreement have result in the sfo raise some £ in fine yet those dpa have dry up the last dpa that the serious fraud office sign be some year ago in i welcome the sfo ’s new strategy to ramp up enforcement include new guidance to make it simple to report crime but i believe we can and must go far can the solicitor general outline what step the government be take to support the sfo in ensure that whistleblower be also incentivise to come forward 
 my hon friend raise an important point the director of the sfo have express strong support for the financial incentivisation of whistleblower and the sfo ’s year strategy commit to explore option work with partner in the uk and abroad reform would require careful assessment and it be right that any suggestion that could enhance the sfo ’s efficiency and our ability as a country to tackle serious fraud bribery and corruption be properly consider 
 thing that concern i in northern ireland be criminal gang and former paramilitary gang be involve in all sort of crime now include economic crime they see business as a way of create more wealth for their criminal activity what be be do to take on these criminal gang whose tentacle reach right across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and indeed far afield which we also have to address criminal gang have to be take on and have to be take out of operation and put in jail do the al capone on they put they in jail for economic crime 
 your problem be solve solicitor general 
 the hon member be absolutely right that fraud do not stop at national border so it be vital that enforcement activity do not stop at national border either that be why the sfo take co operation with international partner extremely seriously in fact most recently the director launch a new international anti corruption prosecutorial taskforce with swiss and french partner agency to strengthen exist tie between these country and to lead to great joint work on case as well as the sharing of insight and expertise i would argue that we need more of those agreement and great international co operation to tackle the issue that he raise 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 i wish to add my own tribute to those who bravely fight for our freedom 
 marks spencer be a much love cornerstone of the great british high street and an important part of our economy many member right across this house will   be shock to learn that over half a pound have be wipe off its value follow a serious ransomware attack harrod and the co op have also be attack and yesterday the legal aid agency be attack too can the solicitor general confirm what role the attorney general ’s office have play in ensure that the criminal justice system treat such attack robustly how be it oversee the response of the crown prosecution service and other relevant agency to economic and cyber crime more broadly 
 the shadow solicitor general raise an important issue we know that this type of crime be on the increase and it be clearly vital that enforcement agency and the cps give it due prominence she refer to some extremely well know and much love brand it be important that all those agency play a role in enhance awareness of this type of crime such that it can be properly prevent the sfo in particular play a role in raise awareness of online crime so as to protect the public as well as business 
 i thank the solicitor general for her response can she confirm what assessment she have make of the economic and legal risk pose by ransomware attack on large uk business can she give an indication of what step the government be take to ensure that company of national economic importance be well protect and support in the aftermath of such incident 
 as i say the shadow solicitor general raise extremely important issue issue that the government be alive to this be a cross government issue frankly and it be important to all those partner enforcement agency i can assure she that work be ongoing and be be do to protect business and the public from these kind of attack 
 if the attorney general will meet the hon member for swindon north to discuss prosecution by the crown prosecution service under section 3zb of the road traffic act 
 i be aware of the tragic case to which my hon friend refer and which he have be campaign on i would like to take the opportunity to extend my deep condolence to the family of harry parker every single death on our road be completely unacceptable and increase the safety of our road be a priority for this government 
 i thank my hon friend for her response harry parker be year old when he get run over the person who take his life do not have a drive licence or any insurance and do not stop yet last november the charge be drop this be partially down to section 3zb of the road traffic act will my hon friend review section 3zb and meet i to see how we can close the loophole 
 it be fundamental that our road be safe for all who use they and that those who break our road safety law be bring to justice that be    why we be commit to deliver a new road safety strategy and the next step will be set out in due course the government keep motor offence under review include those for drive unlicensed and uninsured as my hon friend know the cps prosecute matter independently of government but i would nevertheless be more than happy to meet he to discuss this matter 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people who commit stalking 
 just last month national stalking awareness week serve as a sobering reminder of just how crucial it be that perpetrator of stalk be deal with robustly this government be absolutely determined to protect victim of stalking which be why we be take action by extend stalk protection order so that court can impose they on conviction and acquittal give victim protection when they need it most we be also conduct a review of stalk legislation to ensure that it be fit for purpose and we be empower the police to release the identity of online stalker 
 i thank the solicitor general for her answer which largely anticipate my subsequent question i recently meet a constituent at a surgery appointment who alongside her family have experience significant psychological trauma as a result of stalking and who have concern about the police response in the light of what the solicitor general have say about strengthen stalk protection order what more can be do to ensure that the police be brief and support to implement they so that family can live their life in safety 
 the hon member raise an important issue and i be glad that i largely manage to pre empt his question with my answer stalk case be on the rise we be see more referral to the police and indeed more conviction this government be take strong action on stalk because we recognise the scale of the issue we be introduce statutory guidance to empower the police to release the identity of online stalker which we recognise be extremely important i mention that we be extend stalk protection order which be clearly important too and the review of stalk legislation be ongoing to make sure that that body of law be fit for purpose my colleague will update the house on that in due course 
 that complete question may i just say to the serjeant at arm that i be very concerned that member who have question on the order paper have not be allow into the house can we take this up with the police they have no right to stop a member enter this house i take it very seriously 
 before we proceed to the business question i should inform the house that the government have indicate that there will be a statement this afternoon on us uk trade the timing of that statement have yet to be establish but it will appear on the annunciator once it have be confirm 
 will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business

 the house will rise for the whitsun recess at the conclusion of business on   thursday may   and return on   monday june 
 this be of course the anniversary of ve day when all britain rejoice at the defeat of fascism and the end of the war in europe i be sure i speak for the whole house in put on record once again our profound thank and our celebration of the immortal memory of that extraordinary generation who through their courage their selflessness and their sense of duty make victory in europe possible let we all pray that we can be worthy of their memory 
 if i may turn back from the sublime sweep of history to the mundane business of our politic the government have make valiant effort to crowd the airwave on trade this week but the unfortunate truth be that they have have another dire week in office the financial fact of life have not change growth be stagnant as a nation we have to raise defence spending rapidly and the government have make themselves a prisoner of their fiscal rule before the leader of the house start in on the local election result may i remind she that for all the horror of last week the opposition still end up with time as many council seat as the government 
 let we look at those cost pressure a bit more closely just month after a increase in pay for junior doctor an increase describe at the time by the british medical association as 
 a good enough step 
 the house will recall the bma have now announce it will ballot its member to strike for more pay 
 meanwhile the somewhat unlikely pairing of tony blair and gary smith the general secretary of the gmb trade union have both denounce the government ’s decision to ban offshore licence in the north sea blair describe it as an irrational policy doom to fail the backlash to which threaten to derail the whole agenda he say it be cause by ministers afraid of be cast as climate denier he be not talk about the secretary of state for energy security and net of course he be talk about all the ministers and mps on the government benches who know well but be too frit to say so 
 gary smith say that climate fundamentalism”—that be the secretary of state for energy would 
 accelerate the decline of domestic oil and gas production and increase our dependency on gas import 
 directly contrary to the government ’s suppose growth strategy as he point out 
 across society bill payer will question why they be subsidise a domestic clean power sprint that be offshore uk job and value 
 only today we have have the news that ørsted be mothball its giant new offshore wind farm as it have make it clear it be hold out for even great subsidy know that the secretary of state have no choice and have in effect say that he have no choice if he want to hit his target we all want a just and rapid energy transition but do the leader of the house not think that the word of tony blair and gary smith be simple common sense 
 there be other issue that i think we should highlight the leader of the house have receive universal condemnation for dismiss concern about groom gang as dog whistle politic in response she put out a tweet that conspicuously do not contain an apology for what she have say the secretary of state for health say that her remark be indefensible but the truth be that she have talk in the same way about groom gang from the dispatch box when she accuse people of jump on bandwagon on   january   this year in business question 
 i hope we can agree now that this be an extremely serious national issue and that no whether or not they hold public office should be deflect or deny its seriousness i hope that in her response now the leader of the house will put aside party politic avoid criticise other and speak from the heart so i ask she have she now watch the channel documentary and if so how do she feel about it do she agree that the dismissal of these entirely valid concern have be of the factor behind what even today remain a huge continue national scandal will she now back the call of many victim for a comprehensive national inquiry into grooming gang finally would she like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the hundred of vulnerable woman involve and say sorry 
 mr speaker far to your statement talk on the us trade deal development continue at pace with your permission the house will be update later today i will come on to ve day shortly but may i address the remark of   the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise what i say on an episode of any questions last week so that i can be absolutely clear with the house today and especially to the victim and survivor of child sexual abuse and grooming gang that i be very sorry for those remark as i make clear over the weekend i and every member of this government want your truth to be hear wherever that truth lead your truly appalling experience need to be act on for those responsible to be accountable and face the full force of the law and for justice to be serve i would never want to leave the impression that these very serious profound and far reach issue which i have campaign on for many year should be shy away from and not air far from it no stone will be leave unturned 
 what the victim want and foremost be for action to be take and for the many many recommendation from previous inquiry to be implement in full include mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse for which i have call for nearly a decade shockingly those recommendation remain sit on the shelf until we come into government last year baroness louise casey who conduct the no holds bar inquiry into rotherham be carry out an audit on the scale nature and characteristic of groom gang she will be report soon it will include the question on ethnicity every police force in england and wales have be ask to look again at historic grooming gang case they will be reopen where appropriate to get the perpetrator behind bar i hope the house be leave in no doubt about my commitment to these issue and my apology to those victim for any distress i have cause they 
 i be surprised to hear the shadow leader of the house try to claim some success in the local election for his party i be not quite sure that that be what those on the conservative benches be feel 
 let i address the issue of our need to move to be a clean energy superpower i be afraid that yet again at the dispatch box the right hon gentleman and his party be show a serious misunderstanding of the economic and the reality of the transition to net we face the bad cost of live crisis in generation because his party leave this country expose to international fossil fuel market as a direct result of their failure to invest in clean energy it be only by invest in clean energy that we will bring down bill in future he might want to remind himself of what his former prime minister theresa may say about this issue 
 the sceptic say that the green transition will cripple business we say they could not be more wrong 
 this be a global race for the job of the future to get bill down and that be exactly what we be do 
 the right hon gentleman should know well than anybody that new oil and gas in the north sea will not take a penny off bill because oil and gas be trade on the international market and therefore we be lock in the only way to decouple that be by invest in cheap renewable energy as the government be do it be a previous conservative energy minister who say in 
 more uk production would not reduce the global price of gas 
 the right hon gentleman might want to remind himself of that

 it be clear that we be witness the end of the traditional party system—[interruption like it or not our antiquated past the post system simply be not design to cope with a multi party system at   least not for those who believe in fairness as i hope the government do will the leader of the house now grant time for the bill bring forward by my hon friend   the member for richmond park sarah olney   to be debate in full and will she encourage all her colleague across government to finally support the propose move to proportional representation

 i wish to take this opportunity to place on record my gratitude and i know the gratitude of member of the committee past and present to our former clerk martyn atkins who recently leave the service of the committee for a period of absence after many year of service to the house martyn have play a huge role in the work of this select committee and many other and will be very much miss as will chloe jago who recently stand down as press officer on the committee after year of excellent service to take up a role close to home 
 i thank all those who have contribute to this report the many people and organisation who submit write and oral evidence the committee staff particularly alex farnsworth who have work tirelessly to complete the report and the member of the current and predecessor environmental audit committee 
 let i turn to the report itself we be delighted to see that recommendation no that the government should produce an impact assessment of the planning and infrastructure bill be satisfied within a day of our report be publish at this pace we really could get somewhere however we still need to learn more about how the nature restoration fund will interact with biodiversity net gain i be glad to see that the minister be here to expand on that in his response 
 the dasgupta review make clear the value of nature nature and the service that it provide underpin both our economy and our way of life in the office for national statistics find that the uk ecosystem ’s service be equivalent to of gdp or £ the uk have experience significant biodiversity loss in recent   decade with the state of nature report show an average of specie abundance decline across more than specie between and 
 the committee agree with the government that economic and financial decision making should support the delivery of a nature positive future and we would like to hear a repetition of that commitment and indeed to see it actualise in the forthcoming spending review 
 the committee agree with the assertion of this government and the previous government that in a time of spending restraint taxpayer money alone be no long sufficient to deliver the necessary level of environmental restoration so private finance must play its part we be pleased to hear from the minister for nature that work be ongoing to well quantify the current size of the annual investment in natural capital the committee therefore recommend that within month the government provide a report to parliament on current and projected level of private investment into nature recovery in england so that we can see both the progress that have be make and the size of the funding gap 
 for the government to deliver on protect of land by they must provide landowner with the confidence to invest in nature restoration the long promise land use framework will help and will give assurance that there be a strategic approach to balance the compete need for our land in regard to food production nature restoration renewable energy residential and commercial development and other area it will however require a natural capital approach to be embed throughout government 
 the committee hear concern that the change to the agricultural property relief regime have add to uncertainty although the government ’s decision to give nature investment equal treatment under inheritance tax at least answer the charge that the government be prioritise nature recovery ahead of food production 
 voluntary driver of market demand alone will not deliver the demand that the government need compliance mechanism and the expectation of future compliance requirement will drive market demand so the government should look at bring in increase compliance requirement such as by expand biodiversity net gain requirement or mandate corporate disclosure of nature damage activity 
 the committee seek assurance that the propose new nature restoration fund be an addition to rather than a replacement for government investment in nature recovery without clear support for biodiversity net gain ministers risk cause uncertainty in nature market which could undermine investment in restore nature it will be good to hear a full throate defence of bng from the minister in his response to the report a defence that we hear from he and indeed from myself when in opposition 
 although the committee support an approach that allow nature recovery initiative to be pool the government must ensure that we do not end up with nature recovery mile away while there be a further eradication of nature within urban setting of the strength of bng be that the community that suffer the nature blight also benefit from the recovery of nature locally it will be good to get a commitment from the minister about that principle remain in place   under the nature restoration fund proposal nature can grow hand in hand with our economy and money from growth should go back into help nature thrive 
 the report provide the government with a road map to restore nature by capitalise on our huge national strength as a global financial leader it caution the government not to undermine the progress already make and offer our support for the measure that help nature ’s recovery come hand in hand with the economic growth that the government rightly demand 
 i be delighted to speak in support of the committee ’s report and i congratulate my hon friend the chair of the select committee on the way in which he have lead the committee and on how he take up the remnant of this report from the last parliament as the report for our committee in the new parliament he be right to recognise that natural capital be the foundation of our economy with the spending review next month do he agree that the government should set out precisely how they have take a natural capital approach to the evaluation of spending decision do he agree that the new national wealth fund should be empower to invest in the natural capital project as highlight in our report
