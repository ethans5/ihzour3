we may be recognise a palestinian state at the united nations general assembly but violence in the west bank have be horrific with israeli force and settler displace more than palestinians due to assault on northern refugee camp and of course there be concern about annexation what action will the foreign secretary take to protect palestinians at risk of force transfer what work will he do with international partner to pressure the israeli government at unga 
 the health transformation programme that i mention will allow the introduction of a modern digital service which be certainly not how the exist arrangement could be characterise it be a big job the programme will run until but the outcome from it will be a process that be simple and   easy to understand which i hope will reduce the stress to which the hon member have rightly draw attention and shorten decision time 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the level of unemployment

 the conservative government unify in work and out of work benefit so universal credit be also an in work benefit as i mention some moment ago the legacy of the tories on economic inactivity be now see a welcome reversal with economic inactivity down by 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of child in poverty in congleton constituency 
 as my hon friend know well improved employment be at the heart of our approach to child poverty and that be why reduction in economic inactivity and improvement in employment will be part of our child poverty strategy that be to be publish very soon 
 do the minister accept that the government ’s increase in national insurance contribution have have a negative impact on employment in community such as ours cumbria tourism assess that of its business have cut staff as a consequence and be freeze recruitment be it possible that the government will get less from this tax rise than they expect and that in do this they be do grave harm to the cumbrian tourism economy and many other part of our economy 
 i speak to many business and since come into office the secretary of state and i have totally change our approach with employer that new approach include a partnership with uk hospitality provide specific employment support to get into hospitality and a hospitality passport so that people can evidence their qualification which we and uk hospitality believe can help those people who really need a chance in life to get a good start in the hospitality sector 
 after visit business in newport east this summer i know that there be a high demand for company include thames valley construction which i visit to train more   construction worker locally and i be pleased to see the government make the announcement in the summer on train more people can minister tell i what conversation they be have with the welsh government on work together to do this 
 we will not build the much need home without bring people into the construction sector that be why as part of our new approach for employer we have partner with the construction sector and set up specific scheme with they we be also talk directly across whitehall with other government departments and with the sector about move people into great job in construction 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker it be good to see you back after the summer recess 
 the hon lady can fling around the stat all she like but the fact be clear and bleak under her watch youth unemployment have go up nearly a young people and rise be not in work or education include over more young woman a generation of brilliant young people be go on to benefit rather than into work the government ’s job tax and their unemployment right bill be guarantee to reduce opportunity for young people we have have the winter fuel u turn and the welfare u turn why not a u turn to help young people 
 the damage be do to the come generation under the tories we fail the pandemic generation who put a shift in they stay at home and give up their social life to save old love one i could talk at length about our youth guarantee our trailblazer and the work we be do to expand youth hub but actually it stick in my craw to hear the conservatives who fail this generation harp on about it from that dispatch box 
 what step she be take to support young people into training in hexham constituency 
 this labour government believe that every young person should be able to fulfil their potential unlike conservative members we will not stand by while almost young people be not in education employment or training our get britain work trailblazer in the north east be already help young and neurodivergent people with support work and training placement include in hexham the local jobcentre be also work with newcastle united foundation to help young people build their confidence and develop their skill so that they and our country can look forward to a bright future 
 for too long previous government do not take into account the reality of life in community across my constituency which be incredibly sparsely populated and quite rural the youth guarantee can and will make a considerable difference in community   all across it from the tyne valley all the way out to the north tyne and into callerton and throckley too will the secretary of state work with i to ensure that we continue to support young people in all those different disparate community to access the skill and opportunity they deserve 
 my hon friend be right that people have different need in different part of the country we need to tailor employment support to the need of individual so alongside measure like our youth guarantee we be overhaul our jobcentre to provide that more personalised support and introduce measure such as mobile jobcentre to provide well help in rural area 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in barrow and furness constituency 
 give the significant investment the dwp have partner with bae and the nuclear sector to promote a variety of career pathway include role across its supply chain we be also work within bae ’s new the bridge hub in barrow a collaborative space offer employment advice and support from bae systems and a range of local employer and organisation to connect talent with locally base job far in barrow our youth hub be run in partnership with brathay trust and project john support young people holistically to meet employer and develop their talent 
 i have be impress by the work be do in drop zone in my constituency it run a variety of project for young people include specialised education for those with additional need mental health support and support for the transition back into education employment and training but young people in barrow and furness still face difficult challenge from a long legacy of underfunding the youth trailblazer scheme be already make a difference in some constituency after just a few month will the minister meet i to discuss how we can tailor the scheme to specifically target young people in barrow and furness 
 barrow have unique circumstance challenge and opportunity and it be important that all part of the government address those unique opportunity and challenge in barrow i would be happy to meet my hon friend to far discuss what we be already do and what more we can go on to do to ensure that young people in barrow have the good possible chance in life 
 what estimate she have make of the level of spending on health and disability benefit by 
 the office for budget responsibility forecast in march that incapacity and disability benefit   spending would be £ in that figure will be update at the budget well employment support and remove perverse work incentive in universal credit be the key to get more people into work 
 just month ago the secretary of state be leave humiliate after be force to significantly water down her botched welfare bill if the government have press ahead with the bill as originally draft how much less would taxpayer be spend on benefit by 
 as i have say the obr will update its forecast at the time of the budget we inherit a terrible situation with record number of economically inactive people economic inactivity be down since the election and employment be up those development have be encouraging but our reform will go much far the £ that we be invest in employment support for people out of work on health and disability ground the big package ever will be key 
 do the minister agree that we must invest in community mental health service if we be to reduce spending on mental health disability 
 i very much welcome the nhs year plan publish by our right hon friend the health secretary which give a new priority and commitment to mental health support i agree with my hon friend that that be an important part of tackle the problem that we need to resolve 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be good to see the minister back after the break but i be sorry to hear that there be still no plan to reduce spending on personal independence payment he have say that he be collaborate with people who would not be work with he on his review if there be to be any reduction in the level of benefit or eligibility give that veto on cut to pip i implore he again to consider the benefit to which pip be a gateway such as motability disability premium council tax discount and blue badge will he promise at least that those entitlement could come down 
 we have make it clear that we will co produce our review of the pip assessment with disabled people and representative of disability organisation the review will cover the assessment for the mobility component which lead on to the motability scheme and other entitlement to which pip be a gateway 
 but with no possibility of any of those entitlement come down or any of the spending be reduce we have foreign national claim universal credit most of whom be not in employment i hope that the minister do not plan to co produce his plan with foreign national although know labour lawyer i expect they will say that the european convention on human right demand that they do just that do he think that subsidise more and more foreign national be what the british social security system be for if not will he restrict sickness benefit to british national only as we have argue for 
 it be crucial that we have a fair system we be review universal credit at the moment consider problem such as the week wait that be insert when universal credit be introduce and change to ensure that universal credit effectively tackle poverty and do the job that we need it to do fairness will be at the heart of the system 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in croydon east constituency 
 in croydon east young people age to will be help by the youth guarantee trailblazer be deliver by the greater london authority it will strengthen early identification and outreach to engage young londoner who be not or risk not be in employment education or training by link they to enhanced support employment and education opportunity and the essential service that they need i be glad that the dwp will continue to support community in croydon east by host an information stall at my hon friend ’s upcoming advice fair in new addington 
 croydon be london ’s young borough give that of people age to in my croydon east constituency claim out of work benefit support young people into work and break down barrier to opportunity be vital will the minister give a little more detail about the additional funding for the london youth guarantee trailblazer and will she outline how that will help croydon ’s young people into work i look forward to have the dwp with we in new addington 
 i will pass on my hon friend ’s comment to my colleague in croydon who be keen to work with she and the other mps there in the summer the secretary of state announce further funding of £ for our youth guarantee trailblazer that will ensure that in london as in the rest of the country our young people get the choice and chance that they deserve 
 what step she be take to help tackle fraud in the welfare system 
 the government have commit to significant measure to counter welfare fraud error and debt this be the big package of such measure in recent history and the office for budget responsibility have estimate that it will deliver an additional £ of saving over the next year the package be underpin by our public authorities fraud error and recovery bill which contain a range of new power to enable we to keep pace with offender who exploit the social security system 
 i think we can all agree that fraud strike at the heart of the system kick away its underpinning i hope that the government will undertake a tolerance approach unlike in scotland where we   recently hear that £ of benefit money pay out in error be now not to be recover do the minister agree that that be deeply unfair to taxpayer 
 the hon gentleman tempt i to encroach on what be legitimately policy question for the scottish government the policy of this government be clear and set out in the bill but i be grateful to the cabinet secretary for social justice for continue to work with i constructively to make the bill as workable as possible with alignment where possible such that if we end up diverge we be still able to ensure that this parliament do everything it can and the scottish government do everything they choose to do to bear down on fraud and error 
 do the minister share my surprise that a member of the party responsible for more than a decade of rise poverty record benefit delay and billion lose to fraud and error be now suddenly concerned about tackle that across the house while we recognise the need to tackle fraud in our welfare system we should also recognise the huge issue with tax avoidance and evasion as recently highlight by the public accounts committee which require significant attention 
 i very much agree with my hon friend this government be determined to bear down on tax evasion with additional investigator wherever we see people rip off the public purse whether that be defraud the department for work and pensions or abuse the tax system we be determined to bear down on they and that be what we will do 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the personal independence payment application process 
 the pip application process be outdate and can be very difficult to navigate the health transformation programme will deliver radical improvement and much well efficiency 
 in my constituency i be contact by a woman who have suffer stroke result in permanent right side paralysis and ongoing mobility difficulty despite her condition be permanent she have have to undergo reassessment for pip and have appeal for it to be reinstate i welcome the government change the reassessment requirement for people with long term health condition will the minister clarify what step the government be take to reduce the stress and difficulty of the pip application process for people with those serious health condition 
 the health transformation programme that i mention will allow the introduction of a modern digital service which be certainly not how the exist arrangement could be characterise it be a big job the programme will run until but the outcome from it will be a process that be simple and   easy to understand which i hope will reduce the stress to which the hon member have rightly draw attention with short decision time 
 over the summer i have be do a deep dive into child with special educational need and disability not least the transition point between education and work as part of the timms review the minister ’s own review will he ensure that that interface be look at so that there be a smooth transition for young people as oppose to the cliff edge that many of they face when make the transition into work 
 the review will look specifically at the pip assessment but proposal in our green paper publish early this year be increase the age of transition from dla to pip from to i think that that change could assist with the concern express by my hon friend we be look at the consultation response that we have receive 
 what discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on reduce poverty 
 we be determined to drive down child poverty in the hon gentleman ’s constituency and right across scotland and the rest of the uk our child poverty strategy will look at every lever at our disposal to drive up family income to drive down family cost and to give every child the good start in life i discuss such issue regularly with the chancellor and ministers across government because we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that every child can fulfil their potential they deserve it and our country need it 
 pensioner in the uk be in poverty and the british state pension be among the bad in north west europe during the independence referendum better together claim that our pension be more affordable when scotland be part of the uk year on will the minister tell i exactly what the union be do for scottish pensioner other than impoverish they 
 invest an additional £ in the triple lock over this parliament be deliver huge benefit to pensioner in scotland as be our measure to drive up the uptake of pension credit in order to help the very poor pensioner our measure to stabilise the economy and our investment in the nhs on which many pensioner rely i be proud of the action that we be take give that this government have agree and be give scotland its big ever funding settlement the hon gentleman should ask some challenging question of his government to ensure that they deliver for scotland ’s pensioner too 
 last year a staggering in kid in derby live in poverty our local charity such as the derby food thought alliance do amazing work last year they hand out food parcel will the secretary of state ensure   that the upcoming child poverty strategy address the root cause of child food poverty so that parent be not leave struggle to put tea on the table 
 i understand very well the issue that my hon friend raise as a former chair of feeding leicester the programme to end hunger in my city i see only too clearly the link between poverty and dependence on emergency food parcel i be very proud that we have already slash deduction in universal credit and extend the crisis and resilience fund provide it with its year funding settlement there be much more to do we want to make sure that child have hungry mind not hungry belly and we be determined to deliver that 
 the good way to reduce poverty be for people to be in work but as a result of this government ’s damage economic policy we have see youth unemployment rise by since the general election what representation will the secretary of state make to the chancellor ahead of the budget to ensure that more damage be not do 
 the labour party believe that everybody who can work must work the hon gentleman should look at his own party ’s record progress on the disability employment gap and the lone parent employment rate stall under its watch and economic inactivity rise we be the only country in the g7 whose employment rate have not get back to pre pandemic level we be overhaul our employment system to help more people into work and to get on in work i be proud of our record maybe he should look at his own 
 tackle poverty should be a key priority of any government who wish to see their people thrive the equality act include a socioeconomic duty on all public body to address inequality when make strategic decision when will that duty be enact in england 
 my hon friend raise a really important point throughout its work the dwp be already look at how to narrow the gap between different part of the country and different group of people we have set our jobcentre and employment system new target for reduce those gap and we be take cross government action to tackle child poverty we have achieve a lot there be a lot more to do but this government unlike opposition member have make tackle poverty an absolute priority our child poverty strategy be come out in the autumn so i ask hon member to watch this space 
 what estimate she have make of the number of to year old receive universal credit 
 the late provisional statistic take from stat xplore show that in july there be people age to on universal credit about a quarter of those young people around be on universal credit and in work 
 accord to the library in my constituency the claimant count among those age to have rise by that be of the large percentage increase in the country conservative members know that the government have a moral duty not to let our young people learn that a life of benefit be the life for they so how do the minister explain that increase what will she do 
 i must remind conservative members again that it be their party that introduce universal credit remove the distinction between out of work benefit and in work benefit for quarter of young people who be out of work and on universal credit our guarantee for young people will make sure that they get a chance in life after they be utterly fail during the pandemic by the conservative party 
 what step she be take to improve data sharing between her department and local authority 
 the department continue to provide a broad range of datum to local authority to enable fast accurate assessment for service include blue badge and free school meal look ahead the department be commit to expand real time datum sharing in critical area such as housing benefit and care home while also test innovative model such as the workwell scheme which bring together local and central service to deliver more join up support for citizen 
 in warrington south too many child entitle to free school meal be miss out because of avoidable administrative barrier no child should have to sit in a classroom hungry every child deserve a full stomach and a fair chance a simple change would make a big difference and ensure that every eligible child get the support that they be entitle to it would ease pressure on family help to reduce child poverty and give school confidence that pupil be ready to learn will the minister commit to strengthen datum share with not only local authority but the department for education so that automatic enrolment for free school meal can be introduce 
 my hon friend be entirely right to raise this issue we will look at that work closely with the department for education as part of the child poverty strategy we of course share her ambition to ensure that family can claim the support that they need our expansion of free school meal to all child in household claim universal credit will make it much easy for parent to know if they be eligible as well as lift some child out of poverty 
 i thank the minister for his reply as always he be very positive in his response he refer to the anti poverty strategy what discussion have he have about the anti poverty strategy for we in northern ireland level of poverty and mental health issue have rise dramatically and young people in   particular be under great pressure the minister be always compassionate and understanding what be he do in relation to the northern ireland assembly to make thing well for we as well 
 the hon gentleman will understand that we want this strategy to be for england wales scotland and of course northern ireland he will be reassure to learn that those lead on the child poverty strategy have hold a number of meeting with ministers in northern ireland to ensure that its specific need be take into consideration 
 what step be she take to support young people into employment education or training in bristol north east constituency 
 in young people be not in education employment or training that be bad for they bad for business and bad for our country as a whole our west of england youth guarantee trailblazer which cover my hon friend ’s constituency be help to remove barrier to work for young people include by provide free bus travel for participant and connect young people with skill support last month i announce an additional £ to extend our youth guarantee trailblazer so that we can guarantee that all young people be earn or learn 
 that be fantastic to hear will the secretary of state set out the practical impact of the west of england youth guarantee trailblazer so far assume that it be positive will she confirm plan to back it up with more investment in order to support our young people in the bristol area 
 i be really proud of the work be lead in the west of england include by our fantastic mayor helen godwin to help more young people the trailblazer be engage much more deeply with employer it have engage over of they it be help to enrol young people on employability course and give they more work placement give they the skill and experience they need as my hon friend know young people say that they need a job to gain experience but in order to get the job they need that experience we be try to turn that around we have announce additional funding of up to another £ for that west of england youth guarantee trailblazer a lot have be do but there be a lot more to do 
 what step she be take to increase the uptake of pension credit 
 the government be commit to ensure that all pensioner receive the support to which they be entitle that be why we have be run the big ever pension credit take up campaign we plan to continue promotional activity from september   through to the end of this financial year with the focus not just on eligible pensioner but on their friend and family too 
 early this year a constituent of mine in edinburgh west contact i about the delay she have face in get the pension credit she be entitle to she apply in september last year and be tell that she would receive it in november but it be march before she get her pension credit award the delay mean that she go without extra support just when she lose her winter fuel allowance so what step will the minister take to cut those delay and stop more vulnerable pensioner from be leave cold this winter 
 i hope the hon member will write to i with the detail of the case she raise on the more general picture i can reassure she that we now have a low backlog of pension credit case to be process than we inherit from the last government despite the record number of claim that have come through 
 boot have be a significant employer in my constituency since and many of my constituent have be proud to work for it however those close to claim their pension have be advise that they will be unable to withdraw their pension at an unreduced rate at the age of contrary to what they be lead to believe do the minister recognise the frustration that many of the boots pensioner feel and do he agree that the pensions ombudsman should progress swiftly with its process 
 my hon friend have raise this matter with i before and the thing i can confirm be that she be a powerful advocate for her constituent on this very important issue for they as she know i can not comment on individual case particularly as the matter be now with the pensions ombudsman but more generally it be important that promise make to pensioner about their pension be live up to make sure that happen be exactly why the pensions ombudsman exist 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank to our conservative winter fuel payment campaign thousand of pensioner have sign up to pension credit and million more pensioner will receive winter fuel allowance now that the labour party have admit that its policy on winter fuel payment be wrong however the social security advisory committee recently conclude that the government ’s winter fuel plan fall short of deliver their objective of fairness administrative simplicity and targeted support it seem that the government have prioritise civil service bureaucracy over help frozen pensioner do the minister agree with the social security advisory committee ’s conclusion about their policy 
 i thank the hon member for his question and i congratulate member on all side of this house who have run campaign to drive up pension credit uptake that be very important and it be why we have see extra award over the course of the year to    july compare with the previous year that work which be very welcome have be do by not just member but civil society organisation and local authority 
 on the point that the hon member raise about the process for winter fuel payment this winter and go forward i do not agree with the characterisation he choose to present particularly on the tax side the process will be automatic nobody will be bring into tax or self assessment purely because of that change the vast majority of people will have their winter fuel payment automatically recoup through the pay as you earn system and anyone who want to can opt out i remind member that the deadline for that be   september 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 around a year ago the labour government inherit from the previous conservative government around pensioner in poverty sadly last winter ’s cut to the winter fuel payment see many pensioner push into hardship in the light of winter fuel price hike will the minister reconsider the government ’s proposal and ensure that money be pay to pensioner who miss out on the winter fuel payment last winter 
 i thank the hon member for his question but would gently say that every time he oppose every single tax rise or any difficult choice in this house he be say that the liberal democrats be not a party that could deliver on commitment for example to the triple lock which will increase in cost as my right hon friend the secretary of state mention early by £ by the end of this parliament there be thing call choice which be necessary if we be to provide for our top priority and for labour members the top priority when it come to pensioner be make sure that we can increase the state pension the bedrock of most pensioner living standard and save the nhs and that be exactly what we will continue to do 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of increase the number of remote personal independence payment assessment on claimant in west dorset constituency 
 we will increase the number of face to face rather than remote pip assessment and will increase the number of health professional in assessment centre in order to deliver that i think the hon gentleman will agree however that it be important to keep telephone or video alternative for those who need they 
 many west dorset constituent have write to i with deep anxiety about the assessment for personal independence payment and especially the use of remote assessment constituent despite previously be award enhance pip have endure month of repeat phone assessment which have trigger severe panic attack and high blood pressure and cause lasting psychological harm the secretary of state have give i a commitment to move away   from phone base assessment so what additional resource will be make available to support the roll out of more face to face assessment in west dorset 
 there be a switch to remote assessment in the pandemic for obvious reason but my right hon friend the secretary of state have make the point repeatedly that as be say in the pathway to work green paper we want to move sharply back to face to face while keep alternative for those who need they i be sure the hon gentleman will have speak to people for whom the prospect of go to an assessment centre provoke the kind of anxiety that his constituent experience as a result of a telephone call we be speak to the assessment provider and we have already increase the proportion of face to face assessment that work will continue 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in southend east and rochford constituency 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in southend west and leigh constituency 
 with permission i will answer these question together as they be both about the great city of southend 
 colleague in southend jobcentre be work very hard with southend young people to help they gain skill experience and confidence the team have launch a bespoke employability workshop design for young people and recently deliver a regional work experience pilot for college student they also work with our great partner such as the king ’s trust and firstpoint training to provide placement and opportunity and there be also the employer lead movement to work programme 
 young people across the uk who be not in education employment or training be more than twice as likely to come from disadvantaged background what step be the minister take to ensure that support reach those who need it most 
 the secretary of state mention some moment ago that in everything we do in the department for work and pensions we be try to close the gap between those who have suffer disadvantage and those who have not young people especially those who have experience poverty be vulnerable to mental ill health and the pandemic generation deserve more support to get chance that they have miss that be why we have a joint work and health unit with the department of health and social care we also have many agreement across whitehall relate to our net mission as well as our investment in defence to help employer recruit the next generation whatever their background 
 in southend west and leigh i will soon host a youth day feature local star of the apprentice chisola chitambala who be now   an apprenticeship coach among other thing do the minister agree that early intervention like this youth day be really important to prevent young people from become another neet statistic 
 i agree with my hon friend and congratulate he on his youth day and the work he be do on this kind of early intervention the datum clearly show that if people get qualification some work experience and support for their health and support with other factor in life that be very protective against be without work education or training we have to give a chance to those who need and take step to prevent people from be in that situation in the place 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of child in poverty in leigh and atherton constituency 
 it be a shameful legacy from the conservatives that more than a of child in my hon friend ’s constituency be live in poverty accord to the child poverty action group and we be determined to tackle that we will be lift more than child out of poverty by provide free school meal to all child whose family be on universal credit benefit more than child in leigh and atherton we will also be help to feed they during the summer holiday by extend the holiday activity and food programme alongside our fair repayment rate in universal credit and our crisis and resilience fund we be help struggle family there be much more we will do in our child poverty strategy this autumn but we can and we be make a difference 
 i thank the secretary of state wholeheartedly for that response and i agree with she because of the lack of action from the last government of child in leigh and atherton be live in poverty i welcome the measure that this government be take include the extension of free school meal but more need to be do can she reassure we that she be work hard on the child poverty strategy to ensure that it address the need of all child in poverty include those with disability and special educational need so that every child can reach their full potential 
 we will absolutely do that the child poverty taskforce which include ministers from across government have a specific session on child with disability and special educational need include with family and the charity that fight so hard to deliver improvement i be not a patient person but i ask my hon friend to wait until the child poverty strategy be publish in the autumn because we believe that every child no matter where they be bear or their ability or what their parent do must be give an equal start in life 
 what step she be take to increase level of employment through the trailblazer programme to tackle economic activity 
 this government be determined to get britain work again that be why we be invest £ in our trailblazer programme to drive down economic inactivity we be overhaul our job centre to provide well more personalise employment support we be deliver a youth guarantee so that every young person be earn or learning and we be provide a record £ to help sick and disabled people who can work to get into work there be much furth to go but we be already make a difference 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response a lot of disabled people in swindon with long term health condition tell i that they want to get to work but be just simply not give the opportunity what be this government do to support those people to get dignified work 
 i thank my hon friend for his question because he raise an important point that i do not want to let go which be how many people with a long term health condition or a disability be desperate to work our own survey of people on sickness and disability benefit find that people would work right now if they be give an opportunity we need to give people help to tackle their underlie health condition which we be do through our investment in the nhs we need to encourage employer to do more to give opportunity to disabled people to work above all this government be determined to meet our responsibility with £ invest into employment support for sick and disabled people the big amount in a generation i look forward to work with he and organisation in swindon to make sure we get that support right locally 
 do the secretary of state accept that the reason that unemployment be high today than the day she take office be the job tax which increase employer cost by £ what hope do her trailblazer programme have when the chancellor be work against she 
 i fundamentally disagree with the hon gentleman ’s premise economic inactivity be down by because we be move more people from be out of work and not look for work to start to have to look for work employment be up by we have create job i know there be more we need to do we be work very closely with employer we be overhaul what we be do of the thing that employer say to we be we do not want to tell our story to thousand of different job centre we be put in a single account manager and we be overhaul our support for employer i would be happy to meet he and employer in his constituency to see what more we can do to support they because we want to get britain work and earn again 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 let i start by congratulate all the pupil who have receive their exam result over the last few week have good qualification be essential in today ’s economy and it be brilliant to see so many young people do so well however the number of young people not in education employment or training be of the big challenge face the country and young people be much more likely to be neet if they lack basic skill that be why i be so proud of the action that the government be take to increase the number of youth apprenticeship overhaul foundation apprenticeship and above all introduce a youth guarantee so that every young person be earn or learn 
 i hope you have a lovely recess mr speaker 
 harlow be full of fantastic school and i see the potential of young people there every single day but that potential be often overlook because of economic circumstance will the secretary of state explain how the new crisis and resilience fund will support the poor child in harlow 
 in the spending review we announce this ever multi year settlement for local support replace the household support fund the crisis and resilience fund will provide £ every single year and will give family emergency help if for example their white good break down or they need food urgently however we want to start shift it increasingly towards tackle the root cause of poverty help people to become more financially resilient through the provision of debt advice we recently hold a meeting with more than stakeholder to discuss how we could achieve that shift because we want to prevent people from fall into poverty and to give they the tool that they need to emerge from poverty themselves 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome the right hon lady back after the summer she say recently that it have be a bumpy few months”—an understatement in my view last time we stand here she have just complete a rather humiliating climbdown on her welfare saving plan she set out to save money but end up spend it you could not make it up mr speaker but here we be the number of benefit claimant have hit a record high the sickness benefit bill be head up and up and still the right hon lady have back benchers and cabinet colleague call for even more spending on welfare the chancellor be busy do her sum in advance of the budget so can the right hon lady tell we how much lift the child benefit cap will cost 
 i be not often call understate but i thank the hon lady for her comment 
 welfare reform be always difficult because it involve real people and real life and it be a complicated and personal issue however we be invest £ in employment support to help sick and disabled people into work we be introduce the ever right to try work and we be deal fundamentally with the perverse incentive leave by the conservative party which encourage people to define themselves as incapable of work we be   address that by raise the standard allowance of universal credit and halve the health top up for new claim there be much more that we need to do and we will be publish our strategy to deal with child poverty in the autumn but i be proud to say that the last labour government lift child out of poverty while the hon lady ’s party plunge child into poverty we will take action and as i say early the hon lady should watch this space 
 i ask the right hon lady a simple question but i fear that she do not know the answer she certainly do not reply to it what be clear be that labour want to spend more on welfare so do the liberal democrats and so do reform only party here be tell the truth about the welfare bill the country can not afford it 
 may i urge the right hon lady to take up my proposal will she stop give people benefit for common mental health problem such as anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and give they help instead will she stop give personal independence payment to foreign citizen who have not pay into our system and free car to people who do not need they will she stop people scamme the benefit system over the phone and on the internet will she keep the child benefit cap and get the benefit bill under control 
 order can i just say that we be on topical it be your own member who be not go to get in 
 the conservative party fail on welfare because it fail on work the reason why we inherit such a dire situation with sickness and disability benefit be that the conservatives fail to get people into work we be turn that around and it be about time the hon lady and opposition members put forward a proper plan of action that actually get people into work we believe in work it be a pity the conservative party do not 
 meur ra mr speaker the number of young neet people be often a reflection of a range of different factor poverty poor mental health service lack of access to support service and inadequate transport send and care service especially in remote coastal area such as camborne redruth and hayle can the minister reassure the house and these young people that join up cross departmental work group have be set up to tackle this issue head on 
 yes that be exactly how we be work and i thank my hon friend for his question our get britain working plan identify cornwall as a rural industrial legacy employment area and we specifically point out the lack of connectivity that be why when it come to our new jobcentre service we be also trialle jobcentre on wheel bus that can take support to where people be and which be design for rural area they recently feature on the show 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government be right to want to see more people with disability and long term sickness get into work sadly this be use to justify the savage cut to benefit that be propose early this year my colleague and i be hear report of cut to current award through access to work and to new payment be do by the back door can the minister cast any light on whether guidance have be give to civil servant on such cut 
 there have be no change at all to policy on access to work as the hon member know we do consult in the green paper early in the year on reform to access to work there have be a big increase in demand for it and reform be need we be look at the consultation response at the moment there may have be instance in the past where the publish guidance be not always properly apply it be be apply now and that may give rise to some of the issue that have be draw to his attention but there have be no change at all in the policy 
 i warmly commend the locally lead £ connect to work programme which support those face complex barrier to employment to get into work and to stay in work a constituent of mine charlie have explain to i some of the barrier to work that he experience live with autism spectrum disorder and adhd but he be a dedicated and focused young man who be to be commend for want to be a useful member of society what support will connect to work and other scheme like it offer charlie and other constituent of mine in dartford 
 we want to give people like charlie the chance and choice in life that he deserve our connect to work programme will do everything from help people access health treatment to provide work placement and build their confidence through training skill whatever meet their individual need that be the key to this an end to a size fit all tick box approach and tailor support for he we be also work closely with employer so that they remove the barrier to work and can employ people with all the skill and talent that people like charlie have 
 of the main benefit of save into a private pension be the tax relief that people get from the government which be of the smart way to save for later life any move by this government to cut pension tax relief will devastate savings rate and the adequacy of pension provision i would hope that the secretary of state know that so can she assure i that she have make it clear that when the chancellor be look to fill the fiscal black hole of her own making she must not target pension 
 the hon lady only have to wait till next week ’s treasury question when she could have ask her question but she have the same answer what we should do be look at the record of party and what they have do when i look back over the last year of tory budgets i see a party—[interruption and the lib dems thank you for point that out i have see   party chop and change pension tax relief leave right and centre because they have no plan those be the same budgets that drive child poverty up and wag down 
 it be great to be back after take paternity leave and thank you for your support mr speaker i welcome the government ’s parental leave review but currently partner only get unpaid time off work for antenatal appointment do my hon friend agree that this be a gap and can he confirm that the review be look at how we can well support parent at that crucial time 
 i congratulate my hon friend on the recent addition to his family i hope he have a restful summer although i doubt he do consider the likely lack of sleep he be right to raise this issue it be now past the date for the call for evidence but if he want to write to i directly about that issue i will ensure it be feed in 
 cruel cut to the winter fuel allowance by both this labour government and the snp government in edinburgh leave thousand of pensioner cold in their home last winter when will the secretary of state apologise for the misery her government have cause for vulnerable pensioner in the scottish borders and across the united kingdom 
 i thank the hon member for his question we discuss this issue at some length in the statement before the recess he know that the priority for the labour party have be to raise the state pension by commit to the triple lock throughout this parliament at a cost of £ a year for the new state pension that will mean an increase of £ a year by the end of this parliament 
 on winter fuel payment specifically and i think this be the conservative party ’s position most people think that we should not be pay hundred of pound to the very rich pensioner we have listen to concern and raise the threshold but it be important to maintain that principle if the conservatives position be now that they want a return to universal winter fuel payment they need to have a word with the leader of the opposition who have not support universal winter fuel payment or indeed a universal state pension 
 i be visit the jobcentre in rugby next week and i be look forward to hear more about its work with local business and also with people with disability and special educational need to get people back into work will the minister set out what further step we be take on that very important job for a labour government 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be glad he be visit rugby jobcentre and i encourage all member across the house to go to their local jobcentre because their work coach have the most experience and knowledge about what we need to do to get people into work we be create jobcentre in your pocket so that everyone can have access to   help hour a day let technology take the strain will mean that our work coach can do more of what they do good which be give people person to person the confidence to take up life ’s chance 
 last week policy exchange publish a very insightful report out of control look at the pathway to benefit entitlement it make this point 
 year ago just in people be say to have autism today that have rise to in child 
 will the ministerial team undertake to look at the implication for the department of that definitional creep and the specific implication for benefit entitlement 
 we have set up a panel of expert to advise we on how good to improve employment prospect for people with autism and neurodivergence as the right hon member know we will be undertake a review of the pip assessment co produce it with disabled people so that we have a clear way forward for who should and who should not be entitle to the personal independence payment 
 can my hon friend set out how this government be reform pension long term to help people in bracknell forest and across the country to save for their future 
 i thank my hon friend for his crucial question that be exactly why we have revive the landmark pensions commission we have to confront the reality that we be on track for tomorrow ’s pensioner to be poor than today ’s auto enrolment have be a huge success with of eligible employee now save but of working age adult include self employ and in low earner be currently save nothing the commission will ensure that we build a pension system that be strong fair and sustainable 
 the carer ’s allowance overpayment review be due to report in early summer it be now   september in recent week i have become aware of a case where the dwp have inform somebody that they now owe it £ that be a scandal when will the review report back 
 we have receive the report from liz sayce and i want to thank she very much for her review of earning relate overpayment of carer ’s allowance we be currently consider the finding we be as the hon lady know make a number of change we have increase the earning threshold for carer ’s allowance in a way that i think will help avoid these problem in the future we be look at the possibility of a taper on carer ’s allowance we will come forward before very long at all with both the report and the government ’s response to it 
 as someone who proudly serve the trade union movement for decade before enter this place i warmly welcome the government ’s improvement to    worker right will the minister set out what step be be take to ensure that no be leave behind in the vital reform to statutory sick pay 
 i know that so many of my hon friend will like she welcome the change we be make to statutory sick pay which will improve eligibility for of the lowest pay employee and remove the wait period many of those who will benefit be low pay woman the removal of the wait period will mean that all employee receive at least £ more at the start of their sickness absence compare to the current system but we will continue to evaluate the measure as they be implement 
 scotland be the only part of these island where child poverty be fall as a result of the scottish child payment and the mitigation of the bedroom cap when will the labour government move from empty word to actual action to take child out of poverty 
 we be already extend free school meal to all family on universal credit we have extend the holiday activity and food programme so that we feed poor kid not just during school but in the holiday too we have introduce a new fair repayment rate in universal credit we have make the ever multi year settlement for the crisis and resilience fund to help struggle family we be introduce and roll out breakfast club our child poverty strategy will be publish in the autumn we be already take action to tackle poverty and we will do more i say to the hon lady that the scottish government need to look at how they be spend the big ever funding settlement give in the spending review include on employment support because help parent into good quality job be the long term key to tackle poverty and inequality 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i be delighted to see the establishment of the disability advisory panel a week or so ago interruption i be so sorry mr speaker i have a cold how will the advisory panel link with the co production in the timms review 
 i be grateful to my hon friend we have announce that zara todd will be the chair of the department ’s disability advisory panel the panel be announce in the get britain working white paper last year separately we will set up a group to work with i on the review of the pip assessment i will of course talk to the disability advisory panel about the arrangement but they will be separate structure 
 despite his new role in rid to the rescue of the treasury be the pensions minister still available to fulfil in principle the undertaking he give i before the recess to have a meeting about the plight of exxonmobil pensioner and the difficulty in they get the discretionary surplus benefit to which i think they should be entitle 
 absolutely 
 before we come to the statement by the home secretary i should like to say something about the house ’s sub judice resolution the case of epping forest district council v. somani hotels be still active and before the court but because the case concern wide issue relate to the planning consent require for hotel to house asylum seeker i have decide to grant a waiver so that member be free to refer to it in proceeding however i remind the house that there be other active criminal prosecution relate to disorder around the bell hotel and elsewhere as well as prosecution of an asylum seeker for allege sexual offence hon member may refer to the general issue relate to asylum accommodation but should avoid discuss any specific criminal case 
 with permission i will update the house on the action we be take with france to strengthen our border security and the next step in our reform to the asylum system 
 the house will be aware that when we come into government we find an asylum and immigration system in chaos for year small boat gang have be allow to embed their criminal trade along the french coast the asylum backlog be soar and illegal working be be ignore the previous government have lose control of the system and as a result open many hundred of asylum hotel across the country while return be a low than in before leave office they deliberately cut asylum decision make by leave behind a steeply rise backlog it be little wonder that people across the country lose confidence in the system and demand to know why they be pay the price of a system that be so out of control 
 however that do not mean that people reject the long and proud history of britain do our bit to help those flee persecution or conflict include in the past decade family from ukraine syria and hong kong it be the british way to do our bit alongside other country to help those who need sanctuary however the system have to be control and manage base on fair and properly enforce rule not chaos and exploitation drive by criminal smuggler gang it be exactly because of our important tradition that substantial reform be need now 
 in our year in government we have take immediate action lay the foundation for more fundamental reform we restore asylum decision making and then rapidly increase the rate of decision have we continue with the previous government ’s freeze on asylum decision thousand more people would have be in hotel and asylum accommodation by now instead we remove people with no right to be here which include a increase in return of fail asylum seeker and a increase in removal of foreign criminal we have increase raid and arrest on illegal working by and we cut the annual hotel bill by almost a pound in the last financial year we be roll out digital id and biometric kit so that immigration enforcement can check on the spot whether someone have a right to work or a right to be in the uk on channel   crossing and organised immigration crime we be put in place new power new structure and new international agreement to help to dismantle the criminal industry behind the boat 
 i want to update the house on the further step we be now take in august i sign the new treaty with france allow we for the time to directly return those who arrive on small boat the detention of people immediately on arrival in dover take place the next day and we expect the return to begin later this month application have be open for the reciprocal legal route with the case under consideration subject to strict security check we have make it clear that this be a pilot scheme but the more that we prove the concept at the outset the well we will be able to develop and grow it 
 the principle the treaty embodie be crucial no should be make these dangerous or illegal journey on small boat if they do we want to see they swiftly return in return we believe in do our bit alongside other country to help those who have flee persecution through manage and control legal programme 
 this summer we have take further action to strengthen enforcement against smuggling gang france have review its maritime approach to allow for the interception of taxi boat in french water and we will continue to work with france to implement the change as soon as possible in the past year the national crime agency have lead disruption of immigration crime network its high level on record and a increase in a year 
 over the summer we announce a £ uplift in funding for border security and up to more personnel in the national crime agency focus on target the smuggler gang the border security asylum and immigration bill will give they strong power counter terrorism power against smuggler gang power to seize and download the mobile phone of small boat arrival and the power to ban sex offender from the asylum system altogether if opposition party work with we to speed the passage of the bill through the other place instead of oppose it those power could be in place within month make our country safe and more secure 
 let i turn to the major reform that be need to fix the broken asylum system that we inherit although we have increase decision making and return the overall system remain sclerotic outdated and unfair as we commit to in the immigration white paper we will shortly set out more radical reform to modernise the asylum system and boost our border security we will be tackle the pull factor strengthen enforcement make sure that people be treat fairly and reform the way that the european convention on human right be interpret here at home we will be speed up the system cut number and end the use of hotel and develop control and manage route for genuine refugee 
 at the heart of the reform will be a complete overhaul of the appeal system the big obstacle to reduce the size of the asylum system and end hotel use ten of thousand of people in asylum accommodation be currently wait for appeal and under the current system that figure be to grow with an average wait time already of week we have already fund thousand   of additional sitting day this year and the border security bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of week 
 however we need to go far we will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeal it will be fully independent of government and staff by professionally train adjudicator with safeguard to ensure high standard it will be able to surge capacity as need and to accelerate and prioritise case alongside new procedure to tackle repeat application and unnecessary delay we be also increase detention and return capacity include a bed expansion at campsfield and haslar with the tranche of additional bed come online within month to support many thousand more enforce removal each year 
 our reform will also address the overly complex system for family migration include change to the way that article of the echr be interpret we should be clear that international law be important it be because other country know that we abide by international law that we have be able to make new agreement with france to return people who arrive on small boat and with germany to stop the warehousing of small boat by criminal gang and it be why we have be able to explore return hub partnership with other european country however we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the reality and challenge of today ’s world 
 there be area where we need to make more immediate change the current rule for family reunion for refugee be design many year ago to help family separate by war conflict and persecution but the way they be use have now change even just before the pandemic refugee who apply to bring family to the uk do so on average more than or year after they have be grant protection which be long enough for they to get job find housing and be able to provide their family with some support in denmark and switzerland those who be grant humanitarian protection be currently not able to apply to bring family for at least year after protection have be grant 
 however in the uk those family application now come in on average around a month after protection have be grant often even before a newly grant refugee have leave asylum accommodation as a consequence refugee family who arrive be far more likely to seek homelessness assistance some council be find that more than a quarter of their family homelessness application be link to refugee family reunion that be not sustainable currently there be also no condition on family reunion for refugee sponsor unlike those in place if the sponsor be a british citizen or long term uk resident that be not fair 
 the proportion of migrant who have arrive on small boat and then apply to bring family have also increase sharply in recent year with sign that smuggler gang be now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journey to the uk we continue to believe that family stay together be important which be why we will seek to prioritise family group among the applicant to come to britain under our new deal with france but reform be need so in our asylum policy statement later this year we will set out a new system for family migration include look at contribution requirement long period before newly   grant refugee can apply and dedicate control arrangement for unaccompanied child and those flee persecution who have family in the uk 
 we aim to have some of those change in place for the spring but in the meantime we do need to address the immediate pressure on local authority and the risk from criminal gang use family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to dangerous boat therefore this week we be bring forward new immigration rule to temporarily suspend new application under the exist dedicated refugee family reunion route until the new framework be introduce refugee will be cover by the same family migration rule and condition as everyone else 
 let i turn next to the action we be take to ensure that every asylum hotel will be close for good under this government not just by shift individual from hotel to other site but by drive down the number in support accommodation overall and not in a chaotic way through piecemeal court judgment but through a control manage and orderly programme drive down inflow into the asylum system clear the appeal backlog which be crucial and continue to increase return within the asylum estate we be reconfigure site increase room sharing tighten the test for accommodation and work at pace to identify alternative cheap and more appropriate accommodation with other departments and with local authority we be increase standard and security and joint public safety co operation between the police accommodation provider and the home office to ensure that law and rule be enforce 
 i understand and agree with local council and community who want the asylum hotel in their community close because we need to close all asylum hotel we need to do so for good but that must be do in a controlled and orderly manner not through a return to the previous government ’s chaos that lead to the opening of hotel in the place 
 finally let i update the house on the continue legal and control support that we will provide for those face conflict and persecution we will continue to do our bit to support ukraine extend the ukraine permission extension scheme by a further month with further detail to be set out in due course we be also take immediate action to rescue child who have be seriously injure in the horrendous onslaught on civilian in gaza so that they can get the health treatment they need the foreign secretary will update the house shortly on the progress to get those child out 
 i confirm that the home office have put in place system to issue expedite visa with biometric check conduct prior to arrival for child and their immediate accompany family member we have do the same for all the chevening scholar and be now in the process of do so for the next group of student from gaza who have be award fully fund scholarship and place at uk university so that they can start their study in autumn this year later this year we will set out plan to establish a permanent framework for refugee student to come and study in the uk so that we can help more talented young people flee war and persecution to find a well future alongside cap and manage way for refugee to work here in the uk 
 the government be determined to fix every aspect of the broken system we inherit and to restore the confidence of the british people solve problem not exploit they with a serious and comprehensive plan not fantasy claim base on sum that do not add up or gimmick that fail in the past what we will never do be seek to stir up chaos division or hate because that be not who we be as a country and that be not what britain stand for 
 this be a practical plan to strengthen our border security to fix the asylum chaos and to rebuild confidence in an asylum and immigration system that serve our national interest protect our national security and reflect our national value when we wave the union flag when we wave the st george ’s flag when we sing god save the king and when we celebrate everything that be great about britain and about our country we do so with pride because of the value that our flag our king and our country represent togetherness fairness and decency respect for each other and respect for the rule of law that be what our country stand for that be the british way to fix the problem we face i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement the government have now be in office for well over a year and i think it be fair to say that not even their kind friend would say they think it have go well but listen to her statement it sound like she think everything be fine and that if there be any problem it be somehow somebody else ’s fault be she live in a parallel universe after over a year in office she must now take responsibility for what be happen under this government 
 it be interesting to note that during her statement she do not mention her favourite phrase from a year or so ago namely that she be go to smash the gang i wonder why she be so silent on her previously favourite catchphrase the answer be that it be not go very well she mention national crime agency disruption let i gently point out that of those national crime agency disruption that she cite a few minute ago be classify as not be high impact and national crime agency arrest for organise immigration crime actually go down by in the last financial year that be hardly smash the gang in fact the nca ’s arrest for organise immigration crime in that financial year be only a drop in the ocean compare with the ten of thousand cross the channel 
 it be also rather conspicuous that the home secretary do not mention even a word about the number illegally cross the english channel i wonder why that be i wonder why she forget to say a single word about that the reason i be afraid be pretty clear far from smash the gang so far this year to be precise illegal immigrant have cross the english channel that be the bad year in history and it be up by compare with last year that be not success it be failure thing be not get any well they be get bad this government be fail and everyone can see it that be why there be protest up and down the country and   where those protest be peaceful i support they that be why of the public think the government be handle immigration and asylum badly that be a shocking figure let it sink in 
 let i turn to hotel in the month before the last general election hotel be close down include the bell hotel in epping but since the election the number in asylum hotel have actually go up by have that previous trend of closure continue there would be no asylum hotel open at all today i ask the home secretary to confirm that she will not reduce hotel usage simply by shunt asylum seeker from hotel into flat and house in multiple occupation which be desperately need by young people will she give the house that categoric assurance 
 last week the home secretary ’s lawyer say that the right of illegal immigrant be more important than the right of local people in place such as epping when this be expressly put in those term to the education secretary yesterday on sunday morning with trevor phillips she shamefully agree those statement be a disgrace do the home secretary realise how angry that make people feel it speak of a government not on the side of the people in this country it mean the government appear to care more about the right of illegal immigrant than our own citizen will she apologise for what her lawyer and the education secretary say and will she undertake to ensure that ministers and their lawyer will never say that again 
 the home secretary talk about her return deal with france it have be report that the deal will return only about people a week amount to of arrival do she accept that allow of illegal arrival to stay will act as no deterrent at all if she do not accept that figure of a week will she tell the house exactly how many immigrant cross the channel will in fact be return under her deal she may recall that back in july we be tell by the government that the return would happen within week will she confirm to the house that the number that have actually be return so far be precisely 
 the home secretary say to the house a couple of minute ago that there would be security check on those people reciprocally take from france into the uk but will she confirm that her agreement with france say expressly that the french government will not provide the uk government with any information at all any personal datum about those migrant so if there be criminal conviction or suspicion about extremism or terrorism the french government will not provide information to we if that be true as her agreement say how can she possibly conduct security check 
 the home secretary talk about tweak to family visa rule let i be clear about the opposition ’s position on this if someone enter this country illegally they should not be allow to bring in any family member in fact everybody enter this country illegally should be immediately remove to their country of origin if possible and if that be not possible to a safe country such as rwanda a scheme which she cancel just day before it be due to start the public expect that approach an approach which she cancel because the number cross the channel so far this year have be the bad ever the bad in history 
 it be not just that the number be high hundred of migrant have cross the channel and live in those hotel have be charge with criminal offence include sexual assault on girl as young as year old and multiple rape this be not just a border security crisis it be a public safety crisis as well and people up and down this country be furious that be why they be protest and that be why of the public think this government be fail on asylum and immigration 
 if this government be serious about fix this problem they would know that little tweak here and there be not enough tweak to article be not go to be enough tweak the family reunion rule be not enough return maybe people a week if we be lucky to france be not go to be enough intercept maybe a few boat worthy though that be be not go to be enough the only way these crossing will stop the only way we be go to get back control of our border be if everybody cross the channel know that they will be return we table a bill in parliament a few week ago to do that we have a plan to do that the rwanda bill we need to go far by disapplye to immigration matter the entire human rights act not just tinker with article if the government be serious that be what they would do 
 if the home secretary really want to control our border and if she really want to get down the record number that have be cross on her watch she would back our plan disapply the human rights act in its entirety to immigration matter and ensure that every single person cross the channel be immediately remove 
 i worry about the shadow home secretary ’s amnesia in the year that the conservatives be in government they never manage to do any of the fantasy thing that he claim they do let we come back to reality from his fantasy rhetoric 
 the shadow home secretary talk about the approach that his government be take before the election it be worth remind the house of what that approach be asylum decision drop by the conservatives effectively have a freeze on take asylum decision and they be return those asylum seeker nowhere not to france not to the safe country that people have pass through and not to rwanda despite run that scheme for over year with only volunteer go at a cost of £ their approach leave we with a soar backlog have we continue with that totally fail approach not take asylum decision not return people anywhere there would have be ten of thousand more people in asylum accommodation and hotel across the country right now that be the kind of chaos that his policy be head towards it be the kind of chaos that he be promise again now 
 the house will remember the shadow home secretary ’s personal record small boat arrival go up tenfold on his watch as immigration minister few than asylum seeker be in hotel by the time he become immigration minister but there be more than by the time he leave his post on his new concern for local council he be the immigration minister who write to local authority to tell they that he be stop the requirement on they to agree to accommodation and that he have 
 instead authorise providers to identify any suitable property that they consider appropriate 
 we agree with community across the country that asylum hotel must all close and i understand why individual council want to take action in their area but i say to the shadow home secretary that a party that want to be in government should have a proper plan for the whole country and not just promote a chaotic approach that end up make thing bad in lot of area that be the conservative record we have asylum hotel in the place because the conservatives do no planning and let the manston chaos get out of control as immigration minister both the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick and the shadow home secretary rush around the country open hotel instead of take a practical steady approach to get to the heart of the problem reduce the asylum system strengthen our border security and tackle and reform the appeal that be cause huge delay 
 let i make a final point the government strongly believe that sex offender should be ban from the asylum system altogether that be why we have put those detail into the border security asylum and immigration bill which the shadow home secretary ’s party have vote against time and again and be still resist in the house of lords if opposition party support and work with we that law could be on the statute book and we could have strong power against sex offender strong counter terrorism power to go after criminal gang and strong power to tackle the offence be commit in the channel and across the country 
 the trouble be that what the conservatives be do in opposition be an even bad version of what they do in government ramp up the rhetoric with policy that would make the chaos bad this government will fix the chaos that we inherit and strengthen our border security for the sake of the whole country 
 i thank the home secretary for everything that she have reveal today it will make a difference as we move from hotel into community distribution how can we ensure sufficient vetting and transparency in asylum dispersal especially for group know to be high risk in order to safeguard our resident restore faith among our community and prevent the threat of disorder such as that see in nuneaton this summer 
 my hon friend make an important point anyone who come to our country need to abide by our law the rule need to be enforce we also believe that new partnership and strong measure be need between policing and immigration enforcement and the home office to ensure that there be proper public safety plan for the asylum estate we be draw up new arrangement include not only strong check at the border but strong arrangement in local community i recognise the important point that she make 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be grateful to the home secretary as always for advance sight of her statement 
 anyone with any sense know that the conservatives trash our asylum system and leave the backlog spiral out of control with application for asylum routinely   take year to process some of the home secretary ’s remark be welcome but i worry that this government risk repeat some of the same mistake 
 the liberal democrats will closely scrutinise the plan that the home secretary have talk about today but give that the home office itself say that of the reason that those human being seek asylum make dangerous small boat crossing be the lack of safe alternative family reunion route cut those back far seem counterproductive especially when more than half of those grant family reunion visa in the year end june be child under 
 it be right that the government have increase the rate of decision make those with no right to be here should be send back swiftly and those who have a valid claim should be able to settle work integrate and contribute to our community the backlog be still too large however and initial application decision still take too long as the home secretary state a significant share of the backlog come from appeal accord to the government ’s own figure in almost half of reject asylum application be overturn on appeal for applicant from high grant country that proportion be even high i would welcome clarity from the home secretary on how long it be currently take to process the average asylum application and on what concrete step be be take to ensure not only that case be process more swiftly but that decision be right the time so that applicant be not leave in limbo the court be not overburden and taxpayer be not foot the bill for avoidable delay 
 i welcome the home secretary ’s encourage comment about the reciprocal agreement with france can she confirm whether the government plan for that to be scale up and if so when give that of the main driver of dangerous channel crossing be the absence of safe legal family reunion route do the home secretary agree that cut family reunion rule risk make the small boat crisis bad not well 
 the home secretary rightly also mention the impact on local authority when individual leave hotel many present as homeless create an unsustainable burden on council include my own will the home secretary explain how she be work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to support council and ensure that this crisis be not simply shift from overstretch system to another 
 in recent week constituent have be in touch with i as they be concerned about the number of flag that have go up on lamppost around our area they worry that the flag have be put up by those who seek to divide our community not bring it together patriotism be a good thing we should be proud of our country we should be proud that our country welcome people such as my nan in the 1930 when she be flee the nazis we should be proud of our record of do our bit we should be proud of the british value i see in action across my community every day

 i thank the hon lady for her remark and question at the heart of the france pilot that we have develop be the principle that those who arrive on dangerous and illegal small boat should be return but alongside that we should also have a legal route for those who apply and who go through proper security check as part of that we will seek to prioritise people who have a connection to the uk such as family group people who have family connection to the uk family will continue to need to be an underpinning part of the approach the house will recall that the ukraine family scheme be an important part of the response to the situation in ukraine for which labour call in opposition 
 the family reunion arrangement be be use differently from how they be use year ago the number of people apply for family reunion immediately before they have a job a house or any way of be able to support their family be increase the homelessness pressure on local authority at a time when we need they not just to do their bit to help to clear hotel but crucially to provide homelessness support in the local community it be important to ensure that arrangement for the family of refugee do not put additional pressure on the homelessness support system so we will set out reform and ensure that in the interim refugee be include in the exist arrangement that apply to all sponsor in the uk for family reunion

 a couple of year ago i be work in local government in scotland try to deal with the impact of asylum hotel at that time the shadow home secretary be a minister in the home office and he open hotel after hotel without even tell council that that be happen so his amnesia today be staggering we do not have asylum hotel year ago but we have they now because the last government sign a contract with private provider that have cost billion of pound put pressure on community as well as be a procurement scandal will the home secretary commit to read the report on this issue that the home affairs committee be about to publish and to look as creatively as she can at manage those asylum contract to get the good deal possible for the taxpayer 
 i look forward to read the home affairs committee ’s report and i thank my hon friend for his work on the committee we have already be   work to get well value from the contract that we inherit which be reason that we have save nearly £ on asylum accommodation cost since the election he be right to point out that the previous government completely lose control of the system in there be a total lack of planning or any grip on the situation as well as chaos around management that be incredibly costly the sudden surge of asylum hotel open all over the country with poor contract that provide poor value for money be bad for the taxpayer and damaging to have an effective system across the country we can not go back to that kind of chaos
