before we begin i should like to take a moment to remember that today be the anniversary of the terrible london bombing in the thought of the house today be with the victim and their family and with the emergency service london ’s nhs and the staff of transport for london who respond so bravely to the event on that day i think we all remember where we be when that horrific news come through 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to deliver effective community policing 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 i join you mr speaker in remember the people who never come home on that terrible day as we remember the anniversary of the london terrorist attack and remember too all those whose life be change that day i will say more on this matter during topical 
 the government be rebuild neighbourhood police after it be decimate under the previous government this year we be put more neighbourhood police and police community support officer back on the beat back by £ of additional funding and detailed plan draw up by police force for increase patrol in town centre this summer 
 special constable play a vital role in visible community policing but the number of special drop by over between and and we lose in in the same period in my constituency of chichester which be represent by sussex police will the home secretary consider practical incentive such as council tax relief or free local travel like those that the met police currently have to support recruitment and retention of those special 
 i welcome the hon member ’s point about special they play an extremely important role and the drop in the number of special across the country in the year before the one to which she refer be even steeper i be pleased that sussex police be get not just additional neighbourhood police officer but a further special into neighbourhood team this year we will continue to look at what more we can do to increase support for special and get more on the beat 
 last week i join blackpool police and our police and crime commissioner clive grunshaw under the iconic blackpool tower to launch the safe street summer initiative in blackpool this have coincide with deliver the guarantee that every community in blackpool will now have a name police officer and pcso which have be welcome across the community can the home secretary confirm that my constituent will soon see more visible policing and regular foot patrol in our town centre and crucially start to feel safe and more confident on the street of blackpool 
 my hon friend be right and he and i have talk to shop manager in his constituency about the importance of tackle town centre crime it be why lancashire police be get an additional police officer and pcso into neighbourhood team this year i strongly welcome the work they be do as part of the government ’s safe street summer initiative to tackle shop theft and street assault do so can make so much difference to keep people safe 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 may i associate myself and my committee with your word early mr speaker regard the anniversary that we be mark today 
 live facial recognition technology be an effective tool in community and neighbourhood police we know that be be use effectively by the metropolitan police but other police force be nervous because they do not believe that the statutory underpinning be in place can the home secretary provide some reassurance about what the government will do to make sure this technology can be use effectively 
 the committee chair be right that live facial recognition can play a role in keep community safe as a result the minister for policing have be meet not just police force but other organisation to ensure that we can draw up a new framework to give all police force the confidence to use facial recognition in the good way in order to keep community safe 
 we need good community police but we also need good senior leadership team in our force a recent review of warwickshire police show the leadership and the force management need improvement and that its response time be inadequate would the home secretary look into warwickshire police 
 my hon friend make an important point we want to see standard raise across police and across all police force that be why the police reform   white paper will set out new measure to improve performance management across all police force warwickshire be get an additional police officer pcso and special on to the street 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i join you mr speaker in mark the anniversary of the london bombing our thought be with the victim and family and all who do all they could to help those in need 
 yesterday met police commissioner sir mark rowley call the spending review disappointing highlight that he be be force to cut officer and staff policing may not be a priority for this labour government but the last government put a record number of police on our street will the home secretary commit to keep total number of police officer above as it be under the last government yes or no 
 unfortunately the trouble be that actually the conservatives do not put police on the street they may have try to reverse the massive cut that they have make to police after but they do not put police on the street neighbourhood policing be slash under the conservatives and some area see neighbourhood policing halve as a result i be glad to say that this year the metropolitan police will put additional neighbourhood police on the street as a result of the support that they have be give 
 i think that be a failure to commit to that total number during the passage of the crime and policing bill we ask the government to stop our police have to investigate playground squabble and hurty word online as non crime hate incident and now senior police officer be join that call merseyside chief constable serena kennedy have say 
 non crime hate incident be have a disproportionate impact on trust and confidence in policing 
 i realise that u turn be quite fashionable for the government so will the home secretary now finally scrap non crime hate incident and save hour of police time 
 i should point out to the hon gentleman that police force be follow the guidance that the shadow home secretary   the right hon member for croydon south chris philp draw up on this issue we have a review that be happen under the college of policing at the moment but the shadow minister refer to the crime and policing bill which be introduce new measure on stalk spike respect order e bike off road bike and a whole serious of different issue and which sadly the conservatives vote against so much for care about tackle crime 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the good community policing be embed within community respond to their need whether it be attack on jewish own business or hateful chant at music festival there be too many sobering reminder of the reality of the antisemitism that too many within the jewish community across the uk be face right now home office figure have show that religious hate crime be at record   high and that the number of hate crime specifically target jewish people have more than double everyone deserve to feel safe in our society and that must include british jewish community so what step be the home secretary take to ensure that police have the training and resource need to effectively tackle antisemitic hate crime while support survivor 
 the hon member be right to highlight the appalling increase in antisemitism antisemitic hate crime and assault that take place after the event in the middle east she will know that in order to tackle antisemitism we and the police work very closely with the community security trust and we be introduce new measure to deal with intimidating protest outside synagogue 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of integrate community policing and neighbourhood health team 
 my hon friend speak with a great deal of experience in health matter there be regular discussion between ministerial colleague about how we can well join up public service we know that join up working result in well outcome at a local level collaboration and engagement between neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood health team already exist to tackle mental health issue and drug and alcohol addiction i hope that this government ’s investment in neighbourhood policing will enable more of that work to continue 
 evidence show that integrate policing and health be vital in deliver well outcome in area like mental health substance misuse and youth violence area that we need to address in my city of york with both police and health realigning into neighbourhood team will the home secretary ensure that there be reach across the service with a name lead police officer to develop prevention and early intervention strategy divert those at risk through harm reduction approach include treatment and support 
 with the recently launch year health plan we be move away from those siloe service towards a more join up approach include the preventive model of care that align very much with police and keep people safe and support wellbee i welcome the opportunity to contribute to the national neighbourhood health implementation programme and to ensure that policing be part of the conversation from the outset by work more closely with health and care partner we can reduce inappropriate demand on police officer should not be leave to pick up the piece when other support service be well place to help this be about get it right and get that tailor support time 
 i thank the policing minister for visit northallerton this year and hear directly from my farming constituent about the impact of livestock and equipment crime on   their life and health i be grateful to north yorkshire police for all their hard work and for the recent funding uplift for the national rural crime unit but do the minister agree with i on the importance of implement the equipment theft prevention act and more broadly ensure that rural area get the attention they deserve 
 it be a pleasure to meet the right hon gentleman ’s constituent i think that be way back in february it be a very cold day in north yorkshire i fully recognise what he say about the mental health and wellbeing impact of some of the crime challenge face rural community that be why the neighbourhood policing guarantee be so important for area like the that he represent as i have say a number of time in this house we support the implementation of the equipment theft prevention act and we plan to bring forward regulation shortly 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the propose increase to the standard qualifying period for settlement on nhs staffing level 
 this government recognise and value the contribution that nhs staff make to our country that be why under the settlement proposal in the immigration white paper we have make it clear that individual will be able to reduce the standard year period base on their contribution to the uk ’s economy and society we will consult on detailed proposal later this year these be important change we recognise how important this matter be and we will listen to what people tell we in that consultation an impact assessment will be develop alongside any finalise policy 
 i have be contact by constituent work in health and social care in truro and falmouth who be concerned about the propose change to the standard qualifying period dr mohamed abdelazim work as a doctor at the royal cornwall hospital nhs trust and have not quite complete the year eligibility period he say the policy will directly and severely impact he and hundred of other frontline worker and that year be a very long time to live on a visa without the security that citizenship would provide will the propose increase in the eligibility period to year impact my constituent retrospectively and might they be able to reduce that period base on the contribution that the minister mention 
 i understand the concern raise by my hon friend ’s constituent about the impact of the proposal they be important change which be why we will consult on the proposal and lie out more detail later in the year include on any transitional arrangement we understand the importance of clarity and fairness for those already contribute to public service and we will provide further detail in due course 
 the minister talk about concern raise by the constituent of   the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham they be concern create by this government not value people from different part of the world who serve in our national health service and social care system in cumbria and elsewhere will the minister be much clear that this proposal will not be retrospective for people who underpin our health service in cumbria and across the country will she be mindful of the impact on our health service if she go ahead with a decision which at the moment it look like the government be go to that will hugely undermine the flow of worker who come here to support we and keep we all well 
 may i gently disagree with the hon gentleman we do recognise the vital contribution of overseas nhs worker and we have not yet define what contribution will reduce the period for settlement but the propose change be subject to consultation in addition we be commit to ensure that the nhs remain support while reduce long term reliance on migration 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for housing communities and local government on protect domestic abuse victim from the perpetrator of that abuse with whom they share a joint tenancy 
 the renters rights bill will allow individual to end joint tenancy support domestic abuse victim to leave their abuser if they share a home the ministry of housing communities and local government have announce a £ increase to the domestic abuse safe accommodation grant raise the total funding in to £ 
 my constituent molly be trap in the house where she be violently attack in front of her child she be confine to live upstairs because go into the room downstairs trigger her post traumatic stress disorder despite the perpetrator of this abuse rightfully be in prison and have a restraining order of year molly ’s landlord have tell she that they can not take he off the lease so she can not move can the minister confirm that the government be take step to ensure that victim of domestic abuse like molly can move on with their life 
 i thank my hon friend for raise molly ’s case our heart go out to she and her child for the trauma they be live with her case raise many issue include the need for early intervention in domestic abuse case the need to improve therapeutic support for victim and as my hon friend have say the desperate need for reform of the rule around property right in case of economic and domestic abuse so that woman be not trap i can not give my hon friend immediate answer on all those issue today but i can promise that they will all be include in our upcoming strategy on violence against woman and girl 
 while i have every sympathy with molly and the million of woman who experience domestic abuse accord to the mankind initiative in man be also victim of domestic abuse my constituent mark and adam be victim of serial female abuser who engage in not only psychological physical and financial abuse but sexual abuse as well what be be do to make sure there be space for man in refuge and that there be training for police to ensure they believe these man often they be burly chap who have be in the army and people simply do not believe that they have be victim which only compound the problem they face 
 we often refer to violence against woman and girl as the term refer to a group of crime that be majoritively suffer by woman at the hand of man but of course man be also victim both from other man and from woman the £ of extra funding that i mention in answer to the substantive question be for council to provide accommodation in case of domestic abuse under part of the domestic abuse act local area should be look at the need in their area and act accordingly 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the incidence of fraud 
 fraud be the most commonly experienced crime in our country and this government will publish a new strategy to protect consumer and business later this year before that our crime and policing bill will introduce new measure to fight fraud include a ban on the use of sim farm i hope opposition members will support those measure 
 as the minister say fraud be the large volume category of crime it be come down under the last government but over the past full year it have go back up again dramatically the online safety act be a landmark reform but criminal will always seek new channel so what will the minister do in his new fraud plan to address that displace fraud include that deliver through advertising on website not cover by the act 
 i be genuinely grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise this important issue again he be right fraud account for over of all offence record by the crime survey for england and wales tackle fraud rely on collaboration between law enforcement industry and government departments that mean everyone play their part and we continue to urge the tech and social medium company to take strong action to stop consumer be defraud when use their site 
 what step her department be take to reduce the use of asylum accommodation 
 what step her department be take to reduce the use of asylum accommodation 
 at the peak under the previous government there be hotel in use across the country at a cost of £ a day thousand of asylum seeker be leave in limbo in those hotel as decision making collapse that be the chaos that this government inherit a year ago but we have take action to restore order we be cut the overall cost of asylum accommodation and we be commit to end the use of these hotel entirely by the end of this parliament 
 people be rightly concern by report that the home office be buy hotel to house asylum seeker that appear to be completely at odd with the government ’s manifesto pledge to end the use of hotel will the home secretary or her minister confirm to the house whether those report be true or not true will she reassure my constituent in bridlington and the wolds that there be no plan to house illegal migrant in facility in our local area 
 the home office be not buy hotel as for the hon gentleman ’s constituency there be currently service user house in his area which be less than of the quota and there be hotel 
 the government may not be buy hotel but it be fill they up with asylum seeker the number have go up in the past year not down yet the government say that they will reduce they to by the end of this parliament will the minister confirm whether the commitment to end the use of asylum hotel by the end of this parliament be a guarantee pledge on which we can judge their success or failure yes or no 
 by march this year few people be in hotel accommodation than at the end of we be save money on the chaos that we inherit from the conservatives and we have announce that we will end the use of hotel by the end of this parliament 
 be private rent family home in socially and economically deprive area the right place for asylum seeker to be house be community impact of those placement be monitor ready to inform policy if necessary 
 i can assure my hon friend that we keep all these issue under close monitoring and we be do our good to ensure that individual area take their fair share of the burden when it come to look after people in our asylum system just to reassure she we have speed up asylum decision making the system that we inherit be paralyse and we be get it go again so that we can deal with this issue as quickly as possible 
 this labour government inherit a situation from the conservatives where we be spend almost £ every single day on asylum hotel include the crewe arms hotel in my constituency will the minister set out what step she be take to bring down those cost as well as speed up decision making so that we can reopen the crewe arms as a hotel 
 we be as anxious as my hon friend to end the use of asylum hotel but the backlog we inherit from the conservatives and the time it be take decision making collapse by in the last month of that government have make it hard to empty hotel than we think it would be at the beginning however we have speed up there have be a increase in initial asylum decision we be speed up the system we be get people through the system and we will close all asylum hotel by the end of this parliament 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i gently remind the minister that the number of immigrant in asylum hotel have go up since the general election i recently visit an asylum hotel and see bike from deliveroo just eat and uber eats in the hotel compound local eyewitness confirm that the illegal immigrant in the hotel have be illegally work that create a pull factor because people smuggler actively market illegal work opportunity it also create risk for woman and girl who might receive delivery late at night from these undocumente illegal immigrant will the minister at least commit now to prevent this illegal working from take place from the hotel that she run 
 we have have a increase in raid and arrest on illegal working since we come into government so perhaps the shadow home secretary should have spend more time when he be in government enforce the rule on illegal working we be do more include extend the law on illegal working to the gig economy that measure be in the border security asylum and immigration bill which he vote against 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 enable new refugee to prepare properly for life in the uk will be key to reduce the need for asylum accommodation in my constituency we have see the extension of the move on period not only give new refugee much need time to make those preparation but protect other public body such as the local authority from be leave to pick up the cost we welcome the news last december of the government ’s decision to trial a long move on period for month but those month have now come and go and despite numerous request for an answer the government have provide no certainty on whether the trial will be extend can the minister provide clarity today 
 as it happen i can we have extend the move on trial until the end of the year 
 if she will review the temporary worker visa regulation for the fish processing sector 
 the seasonal worker route be design to support the horticulture and poultry sector both of which have short term seasonal production   peak i discuss these issue with the scottish minister during my visit to peterhead fish market in february there be not the same evidence of seasonal pattern in the fish processing sector which would require significant but short term increase in labour but i be always happy to discuss these matter with colleague in the house 
 may i begin by acknowledge the passing of a giant of our movement mr alex sim from peterhead whose funeral be take place at the moment 
 on   wednesday march   the prime minister tell i from the dispatch box in answer to a question about the fishing industry in my constituency 
 we want to tackle the problem of labour shortages”.—[official report   march vol c. 
 however it be not just a question of fishing last week moray chamber of commerce tell i of hospitality sector business closure in some case relate to the inability to recruit key staff can the minister tell i what progress have be make in this vital area she have mention discussion with the scottish government but when will we be inform of sector specific progress ensure that these industry which be cry out for help receive it 
 as the hon gentleman will know we work closely on this issue with the department for environment food and rural affairs but we must also focus on address the underlie cause of recruitment problem we recognise the position in which some of our fishing community find themselves in relation to workforce challenge but the hon gentleman will i hope welcome the news that through our new labour market evidence group we will be engage with devolved government in the gathering and sharing of datum and evidence on the state of the workforce on training level and on participation by all part of the domestic labour market so that we have an immigration system that be well informed and work for the whole united kingdom 
 whether she plan to extend the qualifying settlement period for people with british national overseas visa 
 this government be firmly committed to support exist member of the hong kong community in the united kingdom and those who may come here in future the new rule on earn settlement will be subject to consultation follow that consultation we will outline the way in which the new rule will operate explain for instance which immigration rout they will affect and when the change will come in 
 many of my constituent come to the uk from hong kong under the bno visa scheme in search of safety freedom and opportunity they have share with i their concern about how the uncertainty involve in the change in the visa system might affect their future here can the minister provide reassurance that those on bno visa in milton keynes and throughout the country will continue to have security stability and a clear route to permanent settlement 
 my hon friend be a strong and powerful advocate for member of the hong kong community in his constituency and throughout the uk we recognise those concern and we be take step to ensure that bno visa holder have an opportunity to share their view during the consultation on the new earn settlement and citizenship rule as i have say follow that consultation the government will outline the way in which the new rule will operate and the immigration rout that they will affect give the ambitious nature of these proposal it be essential that we fully understand their impact on all affected group before make any final decision in the meantime the current rule for settlement under the bno route will continue to apply 
 will the minister clear up once and for all the further confusion over the propose change to the settlement period from to year will she clarify for the bno visa holder live in my constituency whether the change will be apply retrospectively or only prospectively and will she confirm that those who be already build their life in the uk and work in important sector in my constituency will not see their pathway to settlement unfairly change mid journey 
 the bno route reflect the uk ’s historic and moral commitment to the people of hong kong who choose to retain their tie to the uk by take up bno status as i have outline we will have a consultation we will ensure that bno visa holder have the opportunity to share their view during that consultation and we will listen to those view very closely 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood police in leigh and atherton constituency 
 the government be introduce a neighbourhood policing guarantee which mean that all community will have name and contactable officer from the end of this month and we be expand neighbourhood policing include by deliver new neighbourhood officer this year for the greater manchester police force which cover the leigh and atherton constituency 
 as a proud co op member i commend the long stand campaign for well protection for retail worker usdaw ’s national retail workers day which take place this weekend highlight the essential role that retail play in all our community will the minister join i in thank retail worker in leigh and atherton and across the uk will she commit to strong visible neighbourhood police in our town which be crucial to protect they from abuse to ensure that worker can work safely on the frontline 
 i will certainly join my hon friend in thank shop worker in her constituency and right across the country who be often on the frontline during the covid pandemic sadly during that period   and since then they have see a disgraceful increase in assault and abuse we can not stand for that which be why we be not only introduce strong neighbourhood policing particularly in town centre but bring in the new law on assault against shop worker as part of the crime and policing bill what a shame the conservative party vote against it 
 whether she have have discussion with the scottish government on the national inquiry into groom gang 
 as the hon member will be aware child protection and policing be devolve to the scottish government we regularly engage with they on a range of issue include the national inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation and abuse that be announce by the government on   june official meet to discuss the government ’s approach to the national inquiry its remit and the expectation that relevant finding and lesson learn will be share with the devolved administration and we will continue to discuss this matter with our scottish counterpart to ensure a comprehensive uk wide response 
 senior scottish advocate sandra brown have say that groom gang could be operate in every town and city in scotland this scandal affect the whole of the united kingdom so when will the government extend the grooming gang inquiry to scotland surely all victim across all part of the united kingdom deserve justice 
 of course i agree with the hon gentleman but he should take up that issue with the scottish government as it be devolve as i have say we will make sure that all learn be pass on to the devolved administration 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the comment from my hon friend   the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont   relate to the question of whether it will be a national inquiry rather than a co ordination of a few local inquiry all the victim and survivor deserve justice so can the minister please confirm for we today that every town and city with a grooming and rape gang will be part of the inquiry include and especially where local authority may not wish to be part of it 
 to the hon lady ’s question whether a local authority wish to take part be not up for debate the inquiry will be decide by the chair of the inquiry as would happen in a statutory independent inquiry and that work will go on when we have inquiry we have to make sure that we actually live by the recommendation of those inquiry that be why i ask the hon lady why she vote against mandatory reporting and make groom an aggravate factor those be recommendation from the last inquiry when she be ask to vote for they 
 what step her department be take to stop small boat crossing 
 small boat crossing undermine border security and put life at risk the criminal gang have adapt their tactic to exploit french rule that prevent the authority from intervene in french water the french minister of the interior and i agree that this need to change he have instigate a major maritime review to change tactic and operation and we want to see these change in place as soon as possible 
 i agree with the home secretary that that would be a major step forward do she agree with i that on average well over people have be cross the channel each week this year and that there be no way any form of court procedure can keep pace with that do she therefore agree that nothing other than prevention as she have describe interception or as a last resort detention and return can possibly be successful 
 i agree with the right hon member that we need strong action to prevent the boat crossing in the place which be why we be work closely with france both on strengthen law enforcement with a new law enforcement and investigation unit in dunkirk and on the issue of maritime tactic because we need those intervention in french water 
 the small boat crisis be of the single big issue that my constituent raise with i and although the government have make progress on return crossing be still happen what assurance can the home secretary give my constituent that these gang will be dismantle and that the crossing will stop 
 my hon friend be right to refer both to return we have increase return of fail asylum seeker by more than since the election and to the action against the criminal gang we know that there be iraqi kurdish gang in particular operating in northern france so we have a new agreement in place with the french government the iraqi government and the kurdistan regional government to pursue those gang 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 the government be determined to crack down on antisocial behaviour and tackle it be a central theme of our safe street summer initiative which be currently under way in over town our crime and policing bill will provide police with a   suite of new power to tackle antisocial behaviour include respect order to get persistent offender out of town centre and strong power to seize dangerous and deafen off road bike i again remind the house that the conservatives vote against those measure recently 
 with increase incident of antisocial behaviour and fall police number in scotland will the minister assure i that she will share learn from the safe street initiative with snp ministers as it be roll out to encourage they to raise their game on this issue will she also join i and police scotland in fife in praise kingdom off road motorcycle club in my constituency which be such a success in run activity that divert young people from antisocial behaviour 
 we will of course learn lesson over the summer from our initiative and our blitz on town centre and i be willing to share that with snp ministers which i think would be very helpful in the light of what my hon friend say about the problem people be face in scotland i of course welcome and commend the work with young people that be go on in his constituency 
 we have exciting plan for gateshead town centre but we have more work to do on antisocial behaviour northumbria police ’s operation shield have bring down antisocial behaviour significantly but more power and more officer be need what be the government do to ensure that the police have both the power and the resource to tackle persistent antisocial behaviour 
 i be very pleased to hear about the work of northumbria police with operation shield which i think be to be commend we want to work collectively with force to focus on town centre nationwide while recognise that some town centre and area of the country have more significant problem to address we want to build on exist datum good practice and evidence to develop a model that can then be roll out up and down the country 
 glastonbury town centre have see increase rate of antisocial behaviour shoplifting and crime a local charity shop manager tell i that resident and customer be too scared to walk down the high street which obviously have a negative impact on the local economy will the minister meet i to discuss how effective community policing can be the solution to the persistent issue that glastonbury be face 
 i be of course very happy to meet the hon lady that be why neighbourhood policing be important and why the government make a commitment to put additional police personnel back into our town centre and community over the course of this parliament to provide the reassurance that community have not have for far too long with the decimation of neighbourhood police over previous year 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer i know she be very aware of what we be do in northern ireland where community   police officer be an important part of our policing the relationship they build up over a period of month month or year mean that they become a part of the community we should share good idea we have good idea as have the minister will she take the opportunity to discuss those idea with the police minister and the chief constable in northern ireland because i believe that what we do can help here as well 
 i be very pleased to hear about the good idea be roll out in northern ireland i hope very much to be able to visit in the near future so that i be able to see for myself that community police in northern ireland 
 what step her department be take to counter hostile state threat 
 the department be take robust action to respond to state threat we continue to implement measure in the national security act which include launch the foreign influence registration scheme on   july we have also announce the conclusion of the transnational repression review new police training and the establishment of a cross whitehall joint unit to tackle state threat 
 year ago after the horror of the bombing we join up how we work on security threat of all kind create an endure multi agency approach now with the add challenge from far right extremism and the rapidly mount threat to europe from malign russian activity we need to bolster our response across border as well as across our agency will my hon friend look at the concept of a joint uk french national security council meeting to push that forward at thursday ’s summit 
 i be grateful to my hon friend i be sure we will all be reflect on where we be year ago he be right about the nature of the threat we face today and he make a very good suggestion as he will know we work very closely with our french neighbour important conversation will be take place against the backdrop of the state visit but i will consider more carefully the point he make 
 we know that terrorist and potential terrorist be come on small boat across the english channel so why be border force pick these people up and bring they to the uk 
 i can say to the hon gentleman that we be strengthen those check we continually assess potential threat in the uk and ensure that we guard against they 
 what step her department be take to tackle knife crime 
 my hon friend will know that the government have set an unprecedented mission to halve knife crime in a decade we be determined to tackle the scourge of serious violence on our street this month we be run a major new surrender scheme for lethal weapon include ninja sword in hotspot across the country alongside introduce the new provision in our crime and policing bill to crack down on the illegal sale of knife online those measure will help to reduce the availability of dangerous knife on our street and ensure that those who perpetrate these offence face the full force of the law 
 week ago kayden moy a year old boy from east kilbride in my constituency be stab to death leave his family bereft and a community my community in grief since kayden ’s tragic death i have receive multiple video and image of local youth pose while wield machete in their own home but the police claim that they be powerless to take any action whatever do the minister agree that much more need to be do to stop the very real glamourisation of knife crime online and to prevent social medium from be a breeding ground for youth violence 
 may i express my condolence to kayden ’s family and friend that be just appal to hear my hon friend be absolutely right about the role that social medium can play in glamourise these type of weapon that be why it be so important that we have measure in the crime and policing bill and the online safety act to start to tackle that as i say it be absolutely appalling 
 what step her department be take to tackle shoplift 
 this month we have support police and the retail industry to launch the new retail crime strategy and the home secretary launch a safe street blitz in town centre with targeted action to tackle retail crime under the previous government shop theft soar to record level and assault against retail worker spiral out of control that be why in addition to invest in neighbourhood policing we be introduce in our crime and policing bill a new stand alone offence of assault a shop worker because everybody have a right to feel safe on the job 
 staff at tesco in aldershot tell i that the store be face rise level of shoplifting with people walk out of the store with full trolley it be often the same individual who be embolden because they do not fear the consequence hampshire police be do their good but they can not attend every incident and store staff feel threatened and powerless this be a nationwide problem what step be the home secretary take to tackle the wave of retail crime and to protect shop worker on the frontline 
 it be totally unacceptable that shop theft and violence and abuse towards retail worker have continue to rise particularly over the last year   of the previous government when they go up by we be ask retail worker to perform a significant act of public service as they enforce restriction on the sale of item include cigarette alcohol and knife as i have set out the bespoke offence in the crime and policing bill will help to shine a spotlight on the problem and ensure that we bring perpetrator to book the bill will also ensure that the sanction of a criminal behaviour order can be attach to a conviction for assault a retail worker which will help to protect retail worker 
 whether at asda in basildon or waitrose in billericay there have be real issue with shop theft particularly by organise gang which often come from outside the local area they come in ransack store and then drive away what be the minister do to address the issue that go beyond local theft and be actually a nationwide gang issue 
 the right hon gentleman raise a really important point we will continue to crack down on the organise gang that target retailer as we have set out we will provide £ over the next year to continue to fund a specialist analysis team within opal the national police intelligence unit for serious organise acquisitive crime to share information and make sure that retailer be part of the conversation we be do everything we can to tackle organise gang

 our crime and policing bill which opposition members vote against on reading be give the police great power to clamp down on off road bike and other nuisance vehicle that cause chaos in our community once the change come into force officer will no long be require to issue a warning before they seize a bike that be be use antisocially on   may we publish a consultation to explore change to the circumstance in which the police can seize and destroy these vehicle and we will not hesitate to go far if need 
 i thank the minister for that answer gwent police be take on dangerous illegal off road bike but a related problem be electric bike which be sometimes chip to go fast and have become a new danger will the minister please look into this the bike can be switch up from be a means to get from a to b into be a real menace 
 yes i be very happy to look into that issue and to meet my hon friend to discuss it he may want to know that the additional officer that be go to be available in his police force area by the end of this year will help to tackle some of the antisocial behaviour involve e bike and other vehicle 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility

 i associate myself with the home secretary ’s remark eastleigh police station be close in after year of service in the hampshire police and crime commissioner promise that a new station would be open within month but we still do not have do the secretary of state agree that my constituent deserve a new police station 
 as the hon member will know decision about where police station be locate be for the local force the chief constable and the police and crime commissioner she will welcome the news that hampshire be get additional neighbourhood police officer who will be out on the beat this year as a result of the government ’s neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 i   join colleague in pay tribute to all those affect by the attack 
 in huddersfield new neighbourhood police team be make a difference in restore safety to our town centre with additional officer for the team i welcome the funding uplift receive by west yorkshire police this year but give the persistent challenge that town centre face include violent and knife crime which we have see in huddersfield will the secretary of state update the house on how the government will continue to support neighbourhood police and ensure that force such as west yorkshire have the long term resource that they need to keep community safe 
 my hon friend be right that we need the additional neighbourhood police in west yorkshire i welcome the additional officer in her constituency the additional neighbourhood police officer across   west yorkshire and of course the additional police officer in pontefract and castleford town centre we have make it clear to police force across the country that the focus this summer need to be on tackle town centre crime 
 i associate myself with the home secretary ’s remark about the terrorist atrocity perpetrate on the victim and their family of course remain in our prayer the whole house will want to send thank to the emergency service for what they do on that day and what they do every day 
 it be now clear that the home secretary have lose control of our border so far have be the bad year in history when it come to illegal immigrant cross the channel her claim to be smash the gang be clearly laughable the french be have almost no effect despite spend hundred of million of pound and the press report that not much will change in the negotiation this week return of small boat arrival be down represent only of overall arrival so will 
 order this be topical question you have to help i get the back benchers in but you be not at the moment i be sure you be come to an end now 
 i be mr speaker will the home secretary finally admit that the only way to fix this situation be for there to be a removal deterrent whereby every single illegal immigrant be immediately remove 
 the shadow home secretary seem to have forget that in the short period for which he be immigration minister net migration near treble and the number of small boat go up tenfold not only that but the funding for france that he have refer to be agree by his government when he be at the home office if he really want to see serious action against small boat why do he vote against counter terror power for smuggler gang against clamp down on illegal working in the gig economy and against strong action to stop those dangerous crossing 
 the home secretary talk about stop those dangerous crossing but there have be record number on her watch as home secretary 
 be the home secretary aware of the so call police anti racism commitment which be itself flagrantly racist it say that the racial equity commitment mean 
 not treat everyone the same or be colour blind 
 it say that the police should treat people differently in order to artificially engineer equality of police outcome do she agree that that be itself flagrantly racist the police should treat everyone the same will she call on the national police chiefs council to cancel the commitment if it will not will she legislate to give herself the power 
 as the shadow home secretary know the police ’s oath make it clear that they have to police without fear or favour and that be what they do right across the country it be a shame that he will not support the police in the difficult job that they do just as the conservatives vote against crack down on off road bike against new spike and stalk law and against respect order they be against support our police 
 i echo the home secretary ’s remark about the attack alcaline transport in my constituency be fin £ after it report that a clandestine migrant be find in of its vehicle when will improvement to the clandestine entrant civil penalty scheme be fully implement so that haulier who report issue responsibly be support not penalise 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue while the clandestine entrant penalty scheme have to be rigorously enforce in order to be effective it also provide a very fair process of appeal for haulier against penalty that be not justify by the fact of a case i be sure that my hon friend will assist the company in his constituency through that appeal process 
 do the home secretary agree with labour police and crime commissioner that the money allocate by the chancellor at the spending review be insufficient to deliver the government ’s police priority 
 we have provide an additional £ for neighbourhood police as part of more than £ of additional funding for police force across the country that be how we be put an additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer on our street this year after the decimation of neighbourhood police under the conservatives 
 i   associate   myself with the home secretary ’s comment on recently the town of prudhoe be shock when islamophobic graffiti be find on a building such graffiti have no place in prudhoe my constituency northumberland or this country can the home secretary assure i that uphold the safety and security of everyone in rural community no matter where they be from or what their background be of the utmost importance to this government 
 my hon friend be right that sort of graffiti and serious hate crime divide community and need to be take seriously by police across the country it be of the reason we be strengthen the law to give the police strong power to prevent intimidating protest around not just synagogue but mosque 
 my thought be with the family of jayesh pitrola hertfordshire ’s police budget already face a £ shortfall and the recent spending review contain no direct funding from the home office to address that will the home secretary reassure my constituent as well as our police and crime commissioner jonathan ash edwards that hertfordshire will benefit from more police officer without further local tax rise be require 
 as the home secretary just point out we have provide an additional £ this year to support new neighbourhood police officer   and pcso for all our community i be very happy to meet the hon gentleman if he would like to discuss police far but this government be commit to make sure that the police have the resource they need 
 the   nationally recognise brave building resilience and valuing emotions programme support adult survivor of domestic abuse in berkshire but after our conservative police and crime commissioner cut its funding by the scheme be leave unviable do the minister share my deep disappointment about this cut 
 yes i do i thank my hon friend for highlight the important work that brave have do in berkshire grassroots organisation be at the heart of work to support domestic abuse victim and the community they live in tackle domestic abuse be at the heart of the government ’s mission and i should hope the mission of every police and crime commissioner 
 the mercure hotel in stanwell in my constituency be use to house asylum seeker and i have have multiple report of asylum seeker there work illegally will the department please put that on immigration enforcement ’s radar so that it can take the appropriate action 
 i assure the hon member that we take action against those who break the rule by work illegally raid and arrest for illegal working be up in the last year civil penalty in the last quarter be at their high rate since and we be take action to close the gig economy loophole through the border security asylum and immigration bill which he and his conservative friend vote against 
 what step be the home office take to ensure that palestinian student award scholarship to uk university can obtain visa and travel to the uk to take up their place 
 that be an important issue i be work closely with the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer and the israeli jordanian and egyptian authority to identify safe route by which british national and other eligible people can leave gaza or indeed the west bank and so be able to obtain visa and travel to the uk 
 i call the father of the house 
 the number of small boat crossing be drive people mad and erode support for the labour government just as it erode support for the conservatives i worry for the labour government i want they to do well on this for all our sake have not our french friend get a point about this country be uniquely attractive to illegal asylum seeker we do not have identity card and we do not do what the belgians do which be to refuse to put they in reception centre can we make a study of what every other member of the council of   europe be do and replicate the strong action so that this be not the most attractive country for illegal asylum seeker 
 i agree with the right hon member that we need to take action on a whole range of thing that include action in france further action on the network of criminal gang action on the water and action to tackle illegal working and reform the asylum system in the uk we inherit a system in which there be not enough action on illegal working that be why we have ensure a increase in raid and arrest we will also bring forward more reform on asylum 
 to what extent do the minister agree that reform of the european convention on human right which can block we from deport some foreign criminal include paedophile should be a priority for the government 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that it should be for parliament and the government to decide who have a right to remain in our country as set out in our immigration white paper we intend to clarify these issue and the application of article right in the uk 
 less than week ago the home secretary whip she back benchers against new clause to the crime and policing bill which have cross party support and would have criminalise the harassment of woman and girl her ministers promise at the dispatch box and elsewhere that the new clause be not necessary because the matter would be deal with in the violence against woman and girl strategy which be mean to come out before the recess we now hear that it be not come out before the recess do ministers misspeak at the dispatch box or be they incompetent 
 if the hon gentleman wish to read the national audit office ’s report on the previous government ’s violence against woman and girl strategy he will see that the strategy be find totally want 
 what about your strategy 
 i will come to it it be also undeliverable and untested i want to ensure that the violence against woman and girl strategy that go out in this government ’s name be the good it can possibly be 
 of my constituent find that despite take precaution their identity have be assume and their pin for online banking be change that be repeat across other account and thousand of pound be steal what step be the department take to combat sophisticated cyber crime and ensure that in particular old constituent like mine remain protect 
 i be sorry to hear about my hon friend ’s constituent combat these crime be a key priority for the government we continue to collaborate closely with the financial industry organisation such as cifas and regulator on strengthen account security and support victim i would be happy to meet he to discuss this far 
 i associate myself with the home secretary ’s comment about i remember that day too well and we support the government then too in more recent time there have be a number of major cyber attack ransomware attack and associate blackmail of major company it have come to my attention that such company pay a very large sum to its blackmailer recently i will share the name with the home secretary afterwards it would not be appropriate to share it in the chamber will she update the house on the progress of the government ’s action to ensure that blackmailer of this sort do not succeed in future 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise this matter and will happily meet he to discuss it the home office recently close a consultation on a world lead package of legislative proposal to counter ransomware a public response will be publish shortly 
 the chair of the met police federation rick prior and the chair of the west midlands police federation rich cooke have both be remove by the unelected chief executive of the police federation after speak up for the officer they be elect to represent be the home secretary as concerned as i be that the only staff association that police officer be legally allow to join be no long fit for purpose 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue i know he have experience as a police officer i regularly meet the police federation and its officer and chief executive i will raise his concern directly with they 
 how do the home secretary propose to reduce the number of people in asylum accommodation in bognor regis and littlehampton give that even the prime minister admit that the situation in the channel be deteriorate 
 by speed up the asylum process so that people be not trap in asylum hotel by huge backlog and by increase decision making by follow the fall that we see in the month before the last election we will get the system move again 
 over the past year police force have face significant cut to personnel and resource while many area be return to staffing level the west midland still have few officer i support the effort of the police and crime commissioner simon foster how can we address the funding gap cause by an outdated national formula that have disadvantage my dudley constituent 
 my hon friend be a passionate advocate for police in her constituency i hope she will welcome the increase for the west midland of over neighbourhood police officer and pcso it come at a time when we be put more neighbourhood police on the beat we be also bring in new law on off road bike and town centre crime a ban on machete zombie knife and ninja sword domestic abuse expert in control room and new protection against terrorism for venue that be action across the board to keep our community safe 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if she will make a statement on the government ’s performance against the fiscal rule 
 as the shadow chancellor know it be a long stand convention of this and previous government not to provide a running commentary on a fiscal forecast and it be for the independent office for budget responsibility to assess performance against the government ’s fiscal rule in its official economic and fiscal forecast in the most recent forecast publish in march alongside the spring statement the obr confirm that the government be on track to meet their fiscal rule year ahead of target it also confirm that the government be on track to meet their fiscal rule early in the budget last autumn 
 this be a choice a responsible choice when we contrast it with the action of conservative members who lose control of the public finance we see work people across the country still pay the price in line with the usual process the chancellor will ask the obr to produce a new fiscal forecast in the autumn for the annual budget that forecast will include an update assessment of the government ’s performance against their fiscal rule as the prime minister confirm last week the government be commit to their fiscal rule which remain non negotiable 
 we have see what happen when fiscal rule be put to side—[interruption conservatives members may be chuntere from their sedentary position but family across the country be still pay the price of the consequence of liz truss ’s experiment through high mortgage payment and we be not go to put the nation ’s finance at risk as the conservatives have do in contrast this government be meet their fiscal rule and as a consequence of the chancellor ’s decision we be invest billion of pound in the renewal of britain in school hospital affordable home and public transport and in keep the nation safe any future fiscal plan will be set out at the budget in the normal way 
 the chancellor say that she would not make any commitment that be not 
 fully fund and fully cost 
 but the chief secretary to the treasury have just say that he now expect we to wait until the autumn to hear how the government intend to cover the £ of unfunded commitment that their u turn have run up in the last month alone a government divide a government rack up unfunded spending a government wreck the public finance why be the chief secretary not prepare to explain how they will fund these u turn there be surely only possible answer either the treasury have make they without a clue as to how they will be fund or it know but be refuse to tell we either be completely unacceptable can the chief secretary set aside the usual blather that we have just hear and   tell we whether he know how these unfunded commitment will be pay for or be his government simply refuse to say 
 the house will also have note the inherent contradiction in the chief secretary stick to the line that decision will be make at a fiscal event in the normal way when that be precisely what the government have not do by lose control of the finance and of their own parliamentary party the government have make significant fiscal decision outside of a fiscal event the chancellor say at the budget that she would not be come back with more tax rise be this still the position will the chief secretary rule out a wealth tax along with reconfirm there will be no rise in income tax national insurance or vat the chancellor say that she would not extend the freeze on tax threshold because it would hurt work people be this still the position can the chief secretary confirm that the chancellor will not be add to her fiscal black hole by scrap the child benefit cap can i also ask whether consideration 
 order the shadow chancellor will know the time limit i be sure that this will be his last sentence 
 it certainly be now madam deputy speaker if ministers be to begin put their house back in order that must start right now with full transparency and proper answer 
 i think the house know what lose control of the public finance look like because under the previous conservative government interest rate go through the roof family be pay high mortgage rate and the chair of the treasury committee be call out the irresponsible behaviour of liz truss and her ministers in the treasury that be what lose control of the public finance look like and that be why the conservative party lose control of government and be in opposition today the right hon gentleman ask i to comment on forecast of annually manage expenditure and on future tax decision he know how this work all of that will happen with a forecast and a budget which will happen in the autumn 
 we all know why the government want to keep their fiscal rule tight because we know what happen when the market go wrong but a lot of thing have rock the country since the labour government be elect a year ago will the chief secretary explain to our constituent what the benefit of the fiscal rule be for they in their day to day life this can seem a very remote and distant discussion for people who be live in overcrowded condition or who need healthcare for example 
 i thank the chair of the treasury committee for her question the way i would describe it to the public be that when the government lose control of the public finance as the conservative party do in government it affect not only the account in the exchequer and the treasury but the family finance in every house across the country people be still pay for the consequence of the last government not stick to their fiscal rule and act irresponsibly that be why our fiscal rule be non negotiable and we will stick to they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we all know the government have a terrible inheritance from the previous government whether it be the incompetence of covid contract the mini budget or the botched brexit deal but at the same time last year ’s labour budget be a treasury tax grab with no vision for the economy and no regard to the impact on small and medium sized business and key sector like hospitality and social care we liberal democrats want to see thing get well in this country for our constituent and for the country in the spirit of constructive opposition i will ask the minister a number of question when will the government get serious about growth through a much deep trading deal with europe will ministers look at fair revenue raiser such as reverse the conservative tax cut for the big bank and raise revenue from tech giant and online gaming and gambling company will the prime minister make a public statement to calm the market and avoid month of speculation about what might be in the next budget will the government commission an interim office for budget responsibility report now 
 order the same stricture apply to the liberal democrats more sentence 
 i be grateful for your guidance madam deputy speaker can the government confirm that they will not raid capital budget to fix crumble hospital and to pay for day to day spending and will the minister confirm the date for the autumn budget 
 the hon lady encourage i to act above my pay grade the chancellor will set out the date for the autumn budget in due course the hon lady invite i to explain to the house what our strategy be at the budget it be about invest in the renewal of britain that be why the chancellor ’s decision to update the fiscal rule to allow billion of pound of investment in our capital infrastructure across the country include into school and hospital be the reason that the budget be set out as it be she also ask i about trade deal i politely point to the trade deal that the government have already agree with the european union india and the united states of america save thousand of job across the uk and generate growth in the year ahead 
 do the chief secretary to the treasury agree that it be because of these fiscal rule that this government have be able to establish firm foundation for future growth will he explain to the house how the budget stability rule support the government with confidence of investor and business 
 my hon friend know from her work on the treasury committee that the fiscal rule be important because they prove that the government be in control of the public finance we see what happen when the last government lose control the cost of government borrowing go through the roof and that take money out of budget before they even get to public service like the national health service that be why this government be commit to our fiscal rule and will ensure that they be be implement 
 the chief secretary will be aware from his previous role as chair of the business and trade committee that of the thing that those who create wealth and invest in our economy need be certainty before the next budget will he ensure that he consult with business leader and that a proper impact assessment of whichever taxis he will increase be do so we can minimise the damage be do to the productive capacity of the uk economy 
 the treasury engage with business leader and investor all the time and the thing they tell i be that they be grateful this government have bring back long term multi year budget that we have the fiscal rule in place and that we be reform thing like the planning system to make it easy to do business in this country as a consequence business confidence be increase under this government have drop enormously under the right hon member ’s government 
 my constituency face a housing crisis and inflation and out of control borrowing cost make it much more expensive to build social housing and those cost be pass on to tenant do my right hon friend agree that that be precisely why the fiscal rule be critical 
 the fiscal rule be important because when we control the nation ’s finance we bring stability to family finance we have all experience the consequence of previous government lose control and our mortgage rate and rent have go through the roof this labour government will never let that happen again 
 the government commit to fiscal event a year in the name of economic stability but by have an obr forecast and these constraint they have only lever to pull spending cut this time disabled people pay the price and the government have since have to row back do the government regret place those restraint on themselves over tax measure when obr forecast be publish 
 the government be commit to the independence of the obr we will keep set out future fiscal plan at fiscal event a year 
 do the chief secretary agree that without the fiscal rule we would not have see interest rate cut which have benefit thousand of constituent across the country 
 i agree with my hon friend that we have have interest rate cut under this government which be good for mortgage holder and renter wage have increase fast than cost for the time in many year and the chancellor have be able to invest billion of pound in our country while keep market stable that be the consequence of stability in our economy and in our politic and the fact that we be implement our fiscal rule in the way we say we would 
 with all due respect to the chief secretary the chancellor really should be here to answer this urgent question   because the financial market be extremely concerned about she wellbee the financial market which by the way be ask for a year yield now that be considerably high than after the liz truss budget it be really important that the bond market which be aware of the hole in the government ’s finance know how the government be go to act because otherwise we will see far fleeing of the millionaire and the wealth creator and the business whose investment we rely on for growth in this country 
 i be not entirely sure what the question be but i think the hon lady be exhibit that she have learn some lesson from her party ’s performance when she be last in government maybe she could share that with her front bench colleague in due course 
 i be amazed that the conservative party have bring an urgent question on fiscal rule the conservatives have set of fiscal rule in year i mean guy and it be all guy come on the reason why they keep miss debt and deficit target be because they keep cut investment mean less growth and less tax revenue do the chief secretary agree that by invest to grow we get our debt burden down 
 this government recognise that it be because of cut especially to capital investment through the austerity year under the conservative government that we have such poor productivity in our economy we be still suffer the consequence of that which be why as the chancellor say at the budget we be choose investment over decline 
 a year ago we be promise radical change but the only radical change appear to be in the labour party itself which have decide that if you be poor old or disabled it will be you who will bear the brunt of the cut and on whose back the book will be balance so be the fiscal rule always predicate on go after the most vulnerable and the weak and those least able to organise and fight back instead of take on the rich the powerful the multinational and the tax avoider 
 as a consequence of the chancellor ’s decision we give scotland the large real term spend increase since devolution begin and the only radical change that we be now look for be the scottish national party to be kick out of holyrood next may 
 as my hon friend   the member for loughborough dr sandher   mention there be different set of fiscal rule under the previous government the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride have announce that he have reflect on the mistake make by the truss government and i be sure that international investor watch what be happen in the commons would like to see sensible debate from all party in the chamber on the most critical challenge face our time will the chief secretary therefore set out the important way in which capital investment unlock under these fiscal rule be allow for economic growth and development 
 because of the chancellor ’s decision to update the definition of debt—[interruption we have be able to unlock billion of pound of investment into house and school and hospital and gp surgery across the country opposition members may laugh but as my hon friend point out they have no plan to share with anyone at all 
 in november last year the chancellor tell the cbi conference that she be 
 not come back with more borrowing or more taxis 
 will the minister as the chancellor be not in the chamber reiterate that promise today or have the chancellor mishandle the economy so badly that she be now go to have to add this to the government ’s grow list of u turn 
 the chancellor be very clear that the last budget be a once in a generation budget because it have to deal with the sheer scale of negligence and mess that we have inherit from the party opposite i be very grateful now that we be year into a labour government we do not have to keep clear up their mess year after year 
 the opposition have oppose all the tough decision this government have make to raise revenue from vat on private school to the windfall tax have the chief secretary hear anything from the shadow chancellor about how their plan would interact with the fiscal rule if they plan on have any fiscal rule at all 
 i might suggest to my hon friend that the public be grateful not to hear very much from the conservative party after year of failure but if conservatives member wish to be competitive again i would encourage they to set out what they might actually do with the country 
 plan to plunder disability benefit and the decision to hike national insurance contribution be example of policy that disproportionately hit welsh community instead we need fair policy such as a wealth tax on asset over £ an end to government subsidy for oil and gas giant and a clampdown on tax evasion when will the government ’s fiscal rule enshrine fairness where the ultra wealthy and large corporation pay their fair share 
 the right hon lady seem to have miss the fact that this government have change the non dom tax status which have be use by some of the wealthy people in our country for many year we have introduce vat on private school and it be now much more expensive to fly in a private jet than it be under the former conservative prime minister as a consequence of the decision that the chancellor take at the budget last year we have give the large real term increase in spending to wales since devolution begin and as a consequence of our reform to the bill that we will be discuss on wednesday we have increase the base rate of universal credit for the time in many year 
 it be extraordinary that the tories have recover so quickly from their economic mismanagement that they feel able to stop apologise and even to offer advice if only the economic wellbeing of my constituent have recover as quickly do the chief secretary to the treasury agree with i that the office for budget responsibility like economist the world over find it easy to measure the economic consequence of funding cut such as the propose cut to disability benefit than the economic consequence of investment such as invest in people get into work 
 this be the opportunity i have have to congratulate my hon friend on her recent damehood which be very well deserve she invite i to comment on the independent office for budget responsibility ’s forecast methodology give its independence i be afraid i will not to that but i will point to the fact that in the last forecast the obr be able to forecast an increase in growth as a consequence of our reform to the planning system which we welcome very much 
 since april company have personally approach i to tell i that they have either lay people off or have have to close their business after decade of trading because of the rise in national insurance contribution how many business in the minister ’s constituency have tell he a similar story 
 i will not give a running commentary on my conversation with business or constituent in my constituency but what i have hear from business in the defence and infrastructure sector be welcome news regard our long term spending commitment our reform of the planning system and our commitment to spend more on capital across our country which will generate good job and good skill in every part of the country 
 there have be talk about the previous prime minister as the mp for the constituency where the lettuce that last long than the previous prime minister be locate i can confirm that we all know from our constituent that she do more damage it be good to hear conservative member finally talk about the small business that be the backbone of the british economy rather than worry about the millionaire do my right hon friend agree that we need to give those business even more certainty and confidence about the road ahead the eu trade deal that we have do be a brilliant start but do he agree that there be now a case for also look at thing like alignment by default so that they can confidently know what kind of future they have under this government 
 i thank my hon friend for welcome the trade deal that this government have enter into with the united states india and the european union with whom we get a great deal especially on food and drink import and export which will result in low price on the shelf of our supermarket across the country as my hon friend know we have commit to an annual summit with our counterpart in the   european union and i be sure that my ministerial colleague will set out further detail on those negotiation in due course 
 george be the generation owner of knight ’s fish and chip shop in glastonbury it be a much love business in the town but it be under severe pressure after the nic increase and business rate and some of the decision make by minister on our economy hike national insurance hurt our small business and economic growth so will the minister back small business by overhaul business rate and scrap the nic hike 
 the hon lady will know that when the change in national insurance contribution for employer be implement the scheme be design so as to protect small business in relation to big business she point to our fish and chip shop which be often belove in all our community i know from fish and chip shop in my own constituency that the price of fish for example have go from about £ to £ a box the price of oil have go up follow the russian invasion of ukraine and even the price of potato have go up often because those product be import from the european union into the uk that be why our trade deal on food and drink with the eu as well as our investment into cheap renewable energy will make a big difference to fish and chip shop such as the that the hon lady mention 
 it be always amusing to hear the shadow chancellor who preside over a crisis in the welfare system complain about this government ’s action to restore fiscal stability it be like listen to an arsonist complain about the fire brigade do my right hon friend agree it be difficult to take the conservative seriously when they will not tell we what their plan be or even whether they support the spending lay out in the spending review 
 my hon friend be right if any party on the opposition benches want to be competitive in the next election it need to set out what it propose to do with the country and how it will pay for it time and again whether it be the conservative party reform uk the green party or any other party it be all promise of jam tomorrow with no idea about how to pay for it the public have be burn by that already because of the last government and they will not be burn by it again 
 have the chief secretary see the much long term forecast by the obr for the growth in public spending and the growth in debt rise to more than of gdp in decade to come and the debt interest rise to of gdp now that there be a gap hole in the government ’s financial plan because of the vote last week and the u turn on welfare reform why do he think that he can play for time instead of act to give the market confidence before they lose confidence 
 the treasury obviously monitor all obr forecast and consider they in detail as the hon gentleman know it be right and proper that the treasury look at obr forecast in an orderly way when it   produce its forecast in line with the fiscal forecast that be how we bring stability back to the public finance and that be what we will be do 
 the leader of the opposition have appoint every member of liz truss ’s treasury team to her front bench apart from those boot out by the public do my right hon friend agree that a party that have no fiscal strategy but to believe in liz we truss can not be trust on any of it 
 in a more conciliatory tone to conservative members let i say that they have so few mp they have no choice 
 since the budget some job have be lose and borrowing be up by ten of billion of pound just last week the office for budget responsibility indicate that it will lower its forecast for the time since the budget do the chancellor still have confidence in the obr or have she lose confidence in it 
 the chancellor have confidence in the obr 
 the consequence of lose control of the country ’s finance as the conservatives do cause real pain and a cost of live crisis for my constituent do my right hon friend agree it be only because of our sound economic management that we have see wage rise for work people at a fast rate in the month of this labour government than in the last year of the conservative government 
 my hon friend be right whether it be investor market trader or our constituent they get sick to the back tooth of chaos under the conservatives whether it be the mess of brexit or the change in prime minister and chancellor every minute ultimately that result in a parliament in which people be bad off at the end of the conservative administration than they be at the start and our mortgage and rent be high as a cost of the loss of control in the public finance this labour government will never let that happen again 
 a £ hole have be open up because those on the labour front bench can not get those on the labour back benches to vote for their own policy as a result no be today conspicuously refuse to rule out a wealth tax if we tell business people and wealth creator that their money will get tax if they leave it in this country we drive even more investor away be it not the case that even if this measure be not ultimately put in place over the next couple of month the speculation about a wealth tax itself will drive investment away from this country 
 the hon member know that the chancellor will set out any decision on tax way or the other in the budget which she will do in the autumn 
 do the chief secretary agree that this government have have the courage to make the difficult but necessary decision in an effort to ensure sound public finance and improve the economy while the opposition have hide behind their mistake and have no credible economic plan of their own 
 my hon friend know that this labour government be commit to fiscal and political stability because that be what matter for family finance and get this country back on track after year of chaos under the conservatives 
 i find it highly alarming that the chief secretary to the treasury do not seem to realise that the cost of government borrowing be high now than at any time since the last labour government all of this come back to decision about spending so why when labour ’s manifesto say that it would limit spending increase to £ a year do it increase spending by time as much—£76 a year month later in its budget 
 because the conservative party have not do a spending review since and let inflation go through the roof and the cost of do business be high along with a whole string of broken promise from the conservatives the soon they reflect on their mistake and apologise to the country the well for all of we 
 with major investment announce by this government that will directly benefit my constituent such as the low thames crossing dare nt valley hospital and school building renewal do the chief secretary agree that this government have the fiscal rule in place to provide the economic stability we need to renew our social and economic infrastructure which be leave in a terrible state by the last government 
 i thank my hon friend for demonstrate the real consequence of fiscal discipline but also the fact that the chancellor update the fiscal rule to allow for investment in precisely the kind of project my hon friend mention in his constituency in hospital school well road public transport and more affordable housing across the country 
 with its ni rise among other measure last year ’s budget skew the tax burden on to small company my hon friend   the member for st albans daisy cooper   have just lay out some measure that would skew that burden towards big company and multinational give that the government ’s no priority be growth could the chief secretary explain why we be tax small company over big company 
 i think the hon member be refer to employer ’s national insurance contribution which as i have set out to the house be design to limit the burden on small business with big business pay more that be the way that the system be design and that be the system that the chancellor put forward 
 the only way out of the economic doom loop that the previous government get we into be by grow the british economy again if the british economy have grow over the past year as quickly as the oecd national average there would be £ more sit in the exchequer without have to touch spending or taxis at all interruption the conservatives talk about the fast growth in the g7 that be like walk the mile of a marathon and then brag about jog over the finish line growth be unacceptably slow under the previous government so can the chief secretary let we know what he be do to get the british economy grow again particularly change the broken planning system so that we can build more home and energy infrastructure here in the uk 
 my hon friend speak passionately because his constituent know that they be bad off at the end of year of the conservatives than when they start he know that this labour government be commit to make his constituent well off at this end of this parliament than they be at the start that be what our investment in the renewal of britain be about and it be what this labour government will deliver 
 we all know that taxis be come we just do not know on whom they be go to fall hard the country be nervous with every family and every business wonder how much those taxis be go to cost they do the chief secretary regret the fact that that be lead to reduce domestic spending and reduce business investment and be drag the economy down overall 
 i do not disagree with this government ’s fiscal policy no 
 i always listen attentively to the shadow chancellor in this place and in his many medium round sadly what be miss be a cost economic policy of his own do my right hon friend agree that the shadow chancellor might be wise to spend some quality time in his beautiful dorset constituency 
 devon 
 apology in his devon constituency over the summer to develop some credible policy of his own if he do not he be not credible from the dispatch box 
 i agree with my hon friend it will be a benefit to the whole house that the shadow chancellor will be in his devon constituency for the whole of august
