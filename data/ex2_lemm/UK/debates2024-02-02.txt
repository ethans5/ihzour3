let i warmly congratulate my right hon friend   the member for chelmsford vicky ford   on her success in the ballot and on use that success for this purpose i be delighted that she have choose school attendance as the subject of her bill it be a subject that i know be close to her heart and that she have champion with aplomb and with impact she say towards the end of her remark that attendance be the key to a child ’s future and i agree we have often say that reading be the most fundamental thing in school because if a child can not read properly they can not access the curriculum and nothing else work but attendance be even more important whatever our brilliant teacher be do in school if the child be not there they can not benefit 
 i thank my hon friend and the opposition spoke person   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell for their contribution we all recognise the importance of regular attendance not only for child ’s attainment but for their wellbeing and development there be evidence that some attitude   to absence have change since the pandemic with a somewhat great propensity among some family to keep a child with a minor illness such as a cough or a cold at home whereas prior to the pandemic they would have go to school it be worth say that before covid great progress have be make on attendance since and we be commit to get back to those level they will never be for obvious reason every child will be off school ill at some point and sadly some child will need to be off for extended period but we need to get back to that pre pandemic level of or above 
 i be pleased to confirm that the government fully support this bill from my right hon friend the member for chelmsford we be explore all possible avenue to make our attendance guidance statutory include the use of exist power that be important because we want every child to be able to achieve their potential and attend school regularly be obviously crucial to that as my right hon friend outline this bill will improve the consistency of support available in all part of england by require school of all type to have and to publicise a school attendance policy and secondly by introduce a new general duty on local authority to seek to improve attendance and reduce absence in their area 
 the bill will require school and local authority to have regard to statutory guidance in practice that will see we revise and reissue our work together to improve school attendance guidance it be widely support by school trust and local authority and both the education committee and the children ’s commissioner have already call for it to be make statutory the guidance be introduce in september and have already start to make a difference there be few pupil persistently absent or not attend in than in overall absence for the autumn term just go be which be down from in autumn to turn it the other way around attendance in that term be up year on year from to 
 however while we of course welcome that improvement there be still further to go to get to those pre pandemic level and well and there be still part of the country where family do not have access to the right support as my hon friend   the member for aylesbury rob butler   rightly identify it be important to legislate to end the postcode lottery so that any family can get the support they need and do so will give parent increase clarity and level up standard across school and local authority that be also an important part of this government ’s emphasis on a support approach mean that school and local authority work together to break down the barrier that can stop a pupil attend 
 to support school and local authority in meet those expectation the government already have a comprehensive attendance strategy and this aspect of it be only part of a much wide whole we have deploy attendance adviser to support local authority and a number of trust we have create a new data tool with of state fund school sign up at the system leadership level we have convene the attendance action alliance to work across sector to remove barrier to attendance and reduce absence we have launch attendance hub to reach more than pupil and we have expand our attendance mentor pilot as   my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon   rightly mention to reach priority education investment area 
 of course much wide work be in place as well more child be now eligible for free school meal as a result of the protection put in place on universal credit transition £ have be spend on breakfast club and it be target at where it be most need where it can have the most effect i say to the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north that that do include secondary school as well as primary school we also have in place the holiday activity and food programme we be increase the pupil premium in to £ of course attendance be of the great factor and important driver in narrow the gap between well off and more disadvantaged pupil we be expand the supporting families programme over this spending review period and address attendance at school where there be a problem be a fundamental part of that programme 
 my right hon friend   the member for ludlow philip dunne   mention the last effect sadly of the pandemic and the importance of socialisation and he be absolutely right we often think of the early year and the effect on the young child but this be actually true throughout a child ’s or young person ’s development he particularly mention the year to year transition point which we know be pivotal in so many way and a lot of school be do some very good work there 
 my right hon friend specifically ask about mental health and the possibility of an absence code i understand his motivation and that of other in raise that point let i just say that a practicality question be involve at the moment someone be take the register it be not always practical for they to be able to say that something be particular type of health issue or another and there be the risk that we would have inaccurate reporting and a misunderstanding of trend as a result he also mention the wide work on mental health he will know that we be put forward a grant for every state school to be able to train a senior mental health lead in addition the really important wide work on mental health support team support cluster of school primary as well as secondary continue to grow 
 my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central mention not only the mentor programme but the importance of extra curricular activity and pastoral care that be really important and we need always to be say that this be about not only learn and attainment but everything else that come with school of course i join my hon friend the member for aylesbury in congratulate aylesbury high school he be right also to ask about cost for local authority and for we not to overburden school in advance of issue our exist guidance on attendance we carry out the comprehensive new burden assessment which find that the expectation could be implement by local authority without additional funding if they have the average number of staff work on attendance we be confident that that assessment remain accurate base on a grow body of evidence since that assessment be publish the evidence show that where local authority be deliver the guidance staffing level have remain within those predict level 
 but my hon friend the member for aylesbury be also right to talk about ensure that we do not overburden school themselves i join he in pay tribute to school leader schoolteacher and wide staff for the extraordinary work that we have hear be go on and what they be do to get child into school i absolutely agree with he that we need to ensure that we have a proportionate approach that support the whole system the school local authority and so on and work with people in our common endeavour to maximise the benefit that child get from their education this bill if pass will also update our exist guidance in advance of the new school year to reflect the late good practice and feedback that we have gather from the sector and to make it as easy as possible for school and local authority to understand the action they need to take 
 in closing i reiterate my thank and appreciation to my right hon friend the member for chelmsford for bring this important bill before the house today be in school have never be more valuable with standard continue to rise and this bill will help to ensure that every young person and their family whatever their background and wherever they be in the country can receive the support they need to do just that i be sure we will hear more from she and i look forward to that as the bill progress through the house i thank she again and i urge hon member across the house to support the bill 
 motion make that the bill be now read a time 
 hon member object 
 bill to be read a time on   friday march 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 in this place our nation ’s parliament change come in many form sometimes it be the clamour of the picket line the lobby group or members own interest sometimes it come in the shape of an mp ’s constituency surgery and the quiet work man a man who know what be right and wrong who seize injustice and internal fury and propel it to this place to be remedie he fight not for himself he know the barrier that he face but for every man woman and every of we as we face the cruel certainty of age and age discrimination in the workplace the man be stephen horne i be proud that he be my constituent and i be proud today to speak to stephen ’s bill stand with he on tackle the endemic age discrimination in our society the bill aim to address the provision at the heart of the nation ’s challenge 
 jo gideon stoke on trent central con i support my hon friend ’s bill as she know the protection of other characteristic gender race and religion for example be generally observe in employment law do she agree that pervasive age discrimination be a big issue that we need to tackle as her bill will do in a small but important way 
 mrs elphicke my hon friend be exactly right age discrimination be absolutely pervasive in our society it be such a common experience that in people report have experience it we must tackle that injustice 
 the bill repeal paragraph of schedule to the equality act which allow workplace benefit to be remove from a work person solely by reason of their come to statutory pensionable age i be pleased to introduce the bill under the minute rule last year and i be pleased to bring it back today with strong support from so many member across the house who like i believe that we urgently need to tackle this issue 
 people in their 50 and 60 commonly experience discrimination because of their age and of those incident be at work accord to the centre for ageing better in employer believe that age discrimination occur in their organisation and many argue that ageism be a key barrier for people age to who want to return to or remain in their workplace paragraph allow active discrimination under the law and so open the door to other form of indirect and unconscious bias discrimination that be well explore by the women and equalities committee which say that it be clear that there be 
 prejudice unconscious bias and casual ageism in the workplace 
 as well as inadequate challenge to current practice 
 stephen be a train driver with eurotunnel he help to build the tunnel before it open year ago and he have drive a train since the very go through the tunnel when he reach the age of his boss decide to remove his workplace benefit relate to income protection and long term sickness and his health insurance that put stephen at a disadvantage compare with other worker he be do the same job at as he do at but now he do not get the same   money ’s worth or the same term and condition in his contract of employment in simple term stephen do not get pay and condition equal to those of a young worker solely by reason of his age that be not right 
 if stephen fall ill he can not get the same access to speedy private healthcare that other people in his company get include for a workplace injury which mean that he might be out of the workplace for long if heaven forbid he die his wife marsha would no long have the compensatory insurance through death in service benefit that another worker ’s family would be entitle to yet stephen be do exactly the same job as he be before he reach retirement age 
 when look into stephen ’s case i be shock to discover that such age discrimination be legal the equality act be suppose to provide protection for old people against age discrimination age be as my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon   rightly say a protect characteristic and it need to be treat as such that exception in the act mean that stephen and worker up and down the land face discrimination and similar issue with term and condition 
 we need to tackle that issue because people be stay in the workplace long and because it be unfair and wrong it need to be tackle in this place through a change in the law i have have discussion with company about why they do not just do the right thing why they do not change this unfair practice and why they do not look after all their worker well the answer that i have have be simple they will not do that until we in this parliament say that they must because they do not want to have to pay more by offer those term and condition the bottom line be that they do not want old worker like stephen that be not right and it be not something this country can afford either people be work until a much old age that have become more acute as the government have change the pensionable age 
 stephen ’s bill seek to put right the situation for every old worker in this country by change the law on workplace benefit so that old people be treat the same as other in any other part of the employment relationship we know why this matter there be a time when a pregnant woman have to quit her job and leave the workplace indeed there be a time when woman be not welcome in many workplace there be a time when woman be not give pay maternity leave man be not give pay paternity leave and woman would not get job if they be of childbeare age we have address that through parliament over decade now employer find that retain woman in the workplace indeed have they at the very top level in the boardroom benefit not just mother but business business can now retain the vital skill knowledge and commitment of female worker and that need to happen in relation to old worker too old worker have skill and knowledge gain over many year in the workplace treat old worker fairly will encourage they to stay and benefit the company they work for 
 i remember a time when employer use to say that a woman do not need to work get the same bonus as a man or be offer overtime because man need those   opportunity in order to feed their family we outlaw that because equal pay at work matter and equal opportunity at work matter too that apply every bit as much whether it be a young or old worker do the job 
 another excuse that be give be that cover old people become more expensive for everyone because the premium for the company go up that is of course absurd apply that logic would it be okay to exclude from employment benefit people who have have a heart condition cancer a bad back a disability or a chronic condition on the basis that the insurance might go up of course not it would not be lawful and it should not be lawful for that to happen simply because of someone ’s age we have say in other case that take away someone ’s work benefit be discriminatory and wrong and it be discriminatory and wrong to do so simply because they have get old that be something that none of we can influence or affect it will happen to we all even in this place and as we have hear recently even in government people ’s term and condition and severance pay differ depend on the age at which they take their role or responsibility 
 it be time for we to amend this great injustice stephen know that the challenge that he face in change the mind of his boss be enormous and there be no indication that they be prepared to do that however i know from speak to business that there be thing that the government can do beyond change the law to ensure that this injustice be address that could include ensure there be compensatory payment to give equivalence on an equal pay basis to people who do not have access to the same pay and condition as other that mean make it unlawful for those offer insurance to have that kind of discriminatory condition which we should do 
 this be such an important time for our nation as we look for everyone to contribute and require people to work in old life it be essential that we put in place the right law protection and framework so that whatever people want to do in old age they be treat fairly and equally that be the reason that stephen have ask i 
 the debate stand adjourn standing order no 11(2 
 order that the debate be resume on   friday march 
 the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 this very small bill be narrow in scope but it will provide financial assistance and fairness to people who be terminally ill who have see the sponsor of their pension scheme become insolvent it will do that by change the definition of terminally ill for this purpose i thank the legislative team of the department for work and pensions and my staff for their help prepare the bill 
 i think everyone in the house would agree that those who receive the devastating news that they have a terminal illness should receive as much financial help as possible in their final day the loss of their right to pension payment be a blow that they should not have to suffer and that be what the bill seek to address 
 by way of background the bill focus on the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme the pension protection fund be establish by the pensions act and pay compensation to individual when the sponsor of define benefit pension scheme usually their employer become insolvent and lack the necessary asset to pay those pension to the level that the pension protection fund would ordinarily pay that apply to insolvency that have take place on or after   april the financial assistance scheme apply to individual whose pension scheme be unable to meet their pension liability in full if those scheme start to wind up between   january   and   april 
 the bill relate to compensation payment from those scheme make to people with terminal illness when meet the liability of pension scheme the pension protection fund can pay a off lump sum to someone who be terminally ill the financial assistance scheme can start to make pension payment but not pay a lump sum to someone at any age with a terminal illness the issue be the definition of a terminal illness the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme use the same legal definition of terminal illness which be that a person be terminally ill 
 at any time if at that time the person suffer from a progressive disease and the person ’s death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expect within month 
 i commend my hon friend on bring forward this bill and i hope that he will not mind that at time i will ask some question about it i may also make some comment later he be talk about the assessment of what be a terminal illness can he spend a bit more time on who be make that decision and what the range of illness be be the illness set down by the nhs be there a limited list of those illness who assess whether a person be within the bound of what would be call a terminal illness for the purpose of this bill 
 i thank my hon friend for his intervention as i understand it the assessment be make by a health professional what illnesse he or she be entitle to take into account go beyond the scope of this bill and i do not think that i can list those illness the bill be about the length of time someone be expect to live if he will allow i i will leave my explanation there 
 on that point be there provision for a opinion to be obtain in case where there be doubt if my hon friend can not answer that today will he write to i 
 i thank my right hon friend for that intervention i be not aware of the process that someone would have to go through when be assess the assessment of the time that someone have to live which be a technical legal point be particularly concern but i be certainly happy to look into that 
 the definition of terminal illness be a disease that can reasonably be expect to bring an end to somebody ’s life within month the department for work and pensions use that definition for calculate benefit but in the social security special rules for end of life act that month be extend to month it therefore seem logical to change the definition of terminally ill apply by the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme so that it be consistent with the definition that be apply when consider social security payment the bill seek to make that extension from to month 
 it be hard to know how many people would benefit from this legislation i suppose paradoxically we do not want people to benefit from it because that would mean that the sponsor of their pension fund have become insolvent which we do not want to happen however the bill will help terminally ill people where that be the case 
 while the bill ’s scope be technically limit to the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme i hope that my bring it forward will encourage any workplace pension scheme that do not have provision for member with a terminal illness who have a life expectancy of month or less to consider put that in place many private pension scheme can already make what be call serious ill health payment under tax law to a member who have up to a year to live that would be a change well worth make 
 my hon friend have make another interesting point he say that the pension protection fund be there for when a pension fund fail and that the bill may be an incentive for viable pension fund that do not already use a month period to do so and to   mirror what the pension protection fund do will he or perhaps the minister tell i whether there be an understanding of how many pension fund have a month provision will the bill increase that in viable pension fund 
 i grateful to my hon friend for make a good point i do not have those figure and i do not necessarily expect the minister to have they to hand but we should look into that and try to take that point forward 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech that i be sure most of we will have no difficulty agree with in the lead up to the bill ’s introduction have he speak to charity and other organisation about what impact extend the period from to month will have on people ’s real life and on their family and friend 
 i thank my hon friend for that yes i speak in particular to the marie curie charity which tell i of some very sad case it be important to stress that the bill refer to occasion when the pension fund or its sponsor company become insolvent so the bill be narrow in scope however he make a good point the charity give i a number of example and there be many other that bring we back to my point that we should look to extend the month provision beyond the bill to other pension scheme the last thing that someone give a terminal illness diagnosis need be more financial problem if there be anything we can do about that i be happy to take it forward with the minister and the government i thank my hon friend for their intervention 
 determine the length of time that someone have to live fall to health professional and it be a heartbreaking and difficult judgment to make modern medicine surgery and palliative care such as that provide by the excellent sue ryder hospice in my constituency and the general care provide by our nhs staff make that judgment even more difficult i therefore feel that it be right to extend the definition of terminally ill from the very narrow band of month to the more accommodating threshold of month that be fair not only to the people who be ill but to those who have to make that very difficult judgment a judgment that it be especially difficult for health professional to make when they know that a person ’s pension payment may rest on it 
 the bill extend throughout the united kingdom and would come into force in england scotland and wales 
 on such day or day as the secretary of state may by regulation appoint 
 and in northern ireland when the department for communities appoint by order i be about to wind up but i think my right hon friend   the member for east yorkshire sir greg knight   wish to intervene again 
 my hon friend be generous i think he be refer to clause 2(4 be he entirely happy about the wording of that subsection the bill could be pass with unanimous support from all part of the house but under that subsection a minister could later decide not to implement the measure we would be unable to do anything about that 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for mention that point the government have be very co operative while i have be prepare the bill so i remain confident that they will not hesitate to name the day technically the bill will not come into force until the government decide that it will but i be confident that that will happen i thank my hon friend for their intervention and for all the reason i have state i commend the bill to the house 
 good morning madam deputy speaker and thank you for call i so early in this important debate let i start by congratulate my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   on introduce this bill he share with i the prospect of join the rank of the pensioner in our community later this year he fail to declare that in his speech but i be glad to put that on the record for the benefit of member of the house it be a time of life that we will be fortunate to reach if we get that far 
 thank to the good work of the nhs more and more of we manage to achieve pensionable age as of last may nearly people be claim the state pension the over-65 pensioner population in england and wales have increase from in to over in the most recent census pensioner represent some of the population although now that the pension age be go up the figure will be slightly different 
 my constituency probably share with my hon friend ’s constituency the characteristic of have a significantly above average proportion of the population who be pensionable at i mention that because although the bill be narrow in scope it be possible that any of we pensionable or not could be diagnose with a terminal illness although the bill apply to member of define benefit or define contribution scheme who be a subset of that population and hopefully very few of they will have such a diagnosis it be important that we provide equity to those who do as he say so well i therefore think that the objective of my hon friend ’s bill be entirely honourable and appropriate and that we should support 
 on the subject of pension as we have the minister here i would like to raise a case that be bring to my attention in my advice surgery last friday by a constituent whom i will not name who be a member of the boots define benefit pension scheme the scheme be acquire by legal general quite properly last december accord to my constituent the new scheme administrator have decide seemingly without consultation with member to remove the option to take an early pension from the age of so that pension have to be take from the age of 
 if that decision have be take without consultation with member i urge the minister to look into whether the trustee be duly authorise to undertake such a significant potential change in term for their member without consultation i would not expect she to know the answer to that now i have also write to the secretary of state on this matter because the boots pension scheme be probably of the large membership scheme of any retail business in the country 
 have put that on the record i commend my hon friend the member for tewkesbury for his bill today which i shall support 
 since we be put it on the record i declare that i be a proud pensioner as well as an mp i thank my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for bring forward the bill while technical in nature it address a much wide issue that concern we all 
 more than people in the uk die in poverty each year and the figure for my region be over be diagnose with a terminal illness be shatter whatever a person ’s circumstance but for those live in poverty the impact can be even more profound on the news recently i hear a devastating story of a woman name helen who be die of cancer and of cold she talk of how she switch off her boiler because she could not afford to pay for heating her cancer affect the circulation in her hand and foot and when the cold start to creep in she could not hold thing and be worried about fall helen envisage travel during her retirement instead she be stick at home worry about how she could afford to pay her bill in her last month helen have be work with marie curie on its campaign to ensure that everyone who receive a terminal diagnosis be grant immediate access to their state pension 
 as a society we should be look out for and look after the need of those who be suffer those who be terminally ill should not be leave to fight for every scrap of warmth make end meet can become impossible once someone receive a terminal diagnosis their expense go through the roof their heating cost alone can be twice as high often just at the point when they have to give up work because of their illness cover the high cost of heating travel to appointment childcare and essential home adaptation with little or no income be leave thousand of die people and their family in a desperate situation 
 people of working age who die be twice as likely to spend their final year of life in poverty compare to people of pension age access their pension early would give people back some dignity and independence marie curie estimate that most people of working age who die have pay more than year of national insurance contribution as a civilised society we should not put people through the burdensome and time consume benefit process or interview with work coach that be inappropriate for a person who will never return to work some patient have die wait for the welfare benefit they need which do not seem right or fair 
 everyone have the right to the good end of life care and support in stoke on trent we be lucky to have the wonderful care provide by dougie mac which in september be name the good charity to work for in the uk local people be hugely proud of it so i be delighted to hear that recognition of just how special the charity be to the people it look after both in the hospice and in the local community and to its staff it be very much a local charity support generously by local individual and business last year alone i hear of a group who canoe an intense mile journey from fort   william to inverness and other who cycle the mile game of thrones route some hold a day book festival in stoke on trent and individual run the brutal marathon des sables all to raise money for dougie mac we should all show that much care and respect for people approach the end of their life 
 the small change in this bill from a month to a month approach would help ensure that people get the financial help they need as quickly as possible in the most challenging of time it would be a significant step forward and all of the experience share by individual in the long process to get to this stage be valuable and important we need to ensure that more people with a terminal illness can concentrate on make the most of the limited time they have leave rather than worry about their finance this must be a time spend in love and laughter with dignity and compassion i sincerely hope these change be implement quickly to ensure that no more people already face the most difficult time in their life have to wait to claim the support that they so desperately need and be entitle to so i support the bill 
 it be a pleasure to follow my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon who give an excellent speech about why this bill be so important and will make a material difference to many people to that end i thank my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for bring forward the bill because this be a very important issue for a number of people and the bill set out some important principle i want to come on to the important point make by my right hon friend   the member for east yorkshire sir greg knight   about when the bill will come into operation because it deserve more explanation from the government 
 for a person to find out that their illness can not be cure must be a terrifying experience not just for the sick individual themselves but for their friend family and loved one as a parliament we should be commit to alleviate the pressure face those near the end of their life since the 1990 the department for work and pensions have provide access to key benefit through what be refer to as the special rule for end of life these be benefit rule that allow people who be near the end of their life to get fast track access to certain benefit 
 the special rule be introduce in attendance allowance in follow a recommendation by the social security advisory committee attendance allowance claim be subject to a month waiting period and the committee be concern that some terminally ill people be die before that period have lapse eligibility for the special rule be therefore limit to people diagnose with a condition that mean they be unlikely to live for more than month as establish in the social security act since then the use of special rule have be extend to disability living allowance employment and support allowance personal independence payment and universal credit all with the same eligibility criterion 
 the current pension legislation contain provision that allow a patient who be deem terminally ill to claim under special rule and get the high rate of financial help and fast paragraph 25b(3 of schedule to the   pensions act and paragraph 12(3 of schedule to the pensions act both define the eligibility criterion for a terminal illness lump sum which allow the patient to apply to exchange all their ill health benefit for a off lump sum payment if they be diagnose with a terminal illness and do not expect to live long than month the then work and pensions minister say that this would be 
 use the same rule to define terminally ill as those that be use in the financial assistance scheme and in dwp benefit ”—[official report house of lords   july vol c. 
 historically people eligible under the special rule have not have to wait as long as other to start get benefit payment as no waiting period be apply they be not require to go through medical assessment or face to face appointment and in most case they have qualify for high rate of financial help the form support a special rule claim be complete by a clinician and be call an sr1 to access the fast track route people have to have be assess by their healthcare professional as have month or less to live this have become know as the month rule my hon friend the member for tewkesbury make the point about it be a healthcare professional who make the assessment 
 the pensions act establish the pension protection fund which provide compensation to member of eligible define benefit pension scheme in case where the sponsor employer become insolvent on or after   april   and the scheme lack sufficient asset to fulfil its pension liability up to the level of compensation offer by the pension protection fund the financial assistance scheme initially cover scheme that wound up between   january   and   april since its inception it have undergone review and expansion in both coverage and the level of assistance provide the scheme offer payment to member of qualifying scheme who be unable to fully secure their pension liability 
 currently the pension protection fund have the authority to issue a time lump sum payment to individual who be terminally ill and have not yet receive their protection fund compensation similarly the financial assistance scheme allow for the early disbursement of financial assistance in case of terminal illness 
 both the ppf legislation and the fas regulation employ the same definition of terminal illness it be currently define in pension legislation as if 
 the person ’s death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expect within month 
 that mean that both the ppf and the fas currently make payment when medical evidence show that a member have a life expectancy of up to month this eligibility criterion be set in line with the social security special rule for end of life provision for certain benefit originally introduce in the eligibility rule be extend to month by the social security special rules for end of life act which we all support 
 the bill seek simply to restore the original policy intent that there should be an alignment between the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme for more than year the special rule have ensure that at this most difficult time people have have the financial support to which they be entitle and that they get it quickly and easily 
 i be listen to my hon friend ’s speech with great interest he be provide a lot of detail so i hope he will not mind my ask some specific question he will be aware that the pension protection fund do not necessarily pay up of what people would have get have their pension fund not become insolvent and often insolvency occur through no action of the employee themselves but be about how the director of the company make contribution he will also be aware that shortfall in the pension protection fund be cover by a levy that be charge on other pension fund i be almost certain that the effect of the change which as my hon friend have rightly say be support generally throughout the house will be significant but have he make an assessment of the cost change have he have any thought about what the implication might be for how the pension protection fund might have to change its rule and/or what it might mean for the levy charge on other pension fund 
 my hon friend raise typically astute point that need to be consider the short answer be yes i have if he will bear with i i will come to that because i have seek professional advice on the implication for those fund i promise my hon friend that i will come to that if he feel that i have not do so sufficiently he can feel free to have another bash so to speak 
 since the special rule be introduce there have be significant advance in how the nhs treat and care for people near the end of their life mean that many terminally ill people now live for long with their illness give the advance the then secretary of state for work and pensions announce in july that the dwp would undertake an in depth evaluation of how the uk benefit system support those near the end of their life 
 as part of that consultation the department seek feedback from the terminally ill those who support they and clinician much of the reasoning and finding from that report be directly applicable to the bill 
 the purpose of the evaluation be to consider the policy and implementation of the special rule relate to people define as terminally ill it aim to take a holistic view of the support provide and take into account direct contribution from people near the end of their life who share their hand experience of access support via the special rule as well as from charity and organisation support they as well as receive write evidence the evaluation team hold engagement session include an event for people live with or affect by motor neurone disease conduct telephone interview with people near the end of their life and meet charity that provide support for people near the end of their life 
 the study also take into account the view of healthcare professional who work with and support people approach the end of their life through national expert palliative and end of life care clinical group and nearly clinician from a range of profession in england scotland wales and northern ireland also have a chance to respond through a survey their view should not be underestimate as they play a large part in respect of access to financial benefit under the special rule which be the bit i want to look at in a little more detail 
 the department ’s finding agree with the purpose of the bill show that there be a consensus across all group that the government should extend the current month rule and support for the department for work and pensions to adopt a month end of life approach that would allow people in the final year of their life to claim under the special rule an add benefit of the month approach be that it would also bring great consistency with the definition of end of life use by the nhs and right across government 
 the overwhelming evidence of medical advance in the past year since the special rule be implement in demonstrate that the law in its current state be no long fit for purpose in general public health have change dramatically both with the pandemic and with the advance in pain relief and other trial drug that now make live with a terminal illness for long more likely the leap and bound make in both the care for terminal patient and the identification and diagnosis of these patient have progress extensively all form of palliative care have progress from how people near the end of their life be treat and care for and how their condition be manage to how clinician define people near the end of their life that be why the question from my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller   be so important it be because of these huge change that have take place 
 new approach in care have be develop use the gold standards framework and the daffodil standard the ambitions for palliative and end of life care a national framework for local action nhs guidance have also lead the way in reform care for people near the end of their life the gold standards framework be a register charity and have be the uk ’s lead training provider for generalist frontline staff in care for people in the last year of life for more than year its aim be to enable a gold standard of care for everyone with any condition in any setting give by any care provider at any time in a person ’s last year of life that be focus on the medical side of thing and this bill hop to provide the equivalent standard in term of pension both framework have be integral to the improvement in palliative care and the great life expectancy of terminally ill patient because with well care and treatment the long people will live and hence the need for the amendment propose by the bill 
 of the large issue relate to the bill be how clinician define who should be eligible for the special rule the dwp survey show a consensus across all group that the current definition be not fit for purpose for several reason some patient who have fluctuate condition or uncertain life expectancy find it difficult to access the special rule as their life expectancy be indeterminable many condition progress rapidly and then plateau and some condition do that regularly group of patient who struggle with that be motor neurone disease sufferer and cancer patient in prepare for today ’s debate i contact the motor neurone disease association to ask how it feel about the change and how it will affect people diagnose with mnd i be sure everyone in the house be familiar with the scrap months campaign lead jointly by the mnda and marie curie which my hon friend   the    member for tewkesbury mr robertson   mention and which be support by thousand of campaigner across the country they tell i 
 this bill will ensure that a great proportion of people live with mnd will be 
 able to receive 
 terminal illness payment from the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme 
 this be important give the context of the financial impact of live with mnd especially as symptom of the condition increase 
 so on that basis they very much support the bill 
 macmillan cancer support play a large part in end of life care and have its national call centre base in my constituency in shipley it tell i that it be supportive of the decision to widen the criterion from month to month ensure that those with a terminal diagnosis have timely access to financial support when they need it most 
 in some case the month rule force clinician and patient to have very distressing conversation about life expectancy either too early or at the wrong time for they there be way in which this issue can be tackle the be the month rule which be where we be with the bill mirror the end of life approach use by nhs england the be take out the timescale and instead use a clinical recommendation support by guidance which do not have an explicit timeframe attach to it in effect look at the nature of somebody ’s condition 
 the option be an increase in the term of life expectancy to month which be what the bill would do obviously this approach align the welfare state with the work of the nhs and so would make it easy for organisation across the uk that support people near the end of their life to understand the application of the special rule because it make they all consistent clinician have many difficult conversation when discuss end of life care and this could be add into those conversation instead of be have separately also save the nhs time 
 however i just want to point out that any time bind rule could be subject to the same problem as life expectancy can fluctuate and nothing be certain even within a year there be therefore an argument for base it on a clinical diagnosis rather than a fix term which by definition be always go to be slightly arbitrary 
 will my hon friend just clarify the position be he say that he would prefer the bill to be amend or be he happy with it as it stand 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his question i support the bill because it be far well than the status quo and it sensibly even up those situation which be what my hon friend the member for tewkesbury intend with the bill in effect to ensure that the rule for benefit and pension be the same and that do not diverge from the other my point be that this should not be the last word on the matter because it may not necessarily be the good outcome it be a sensible measure to take but there be a big issue here about whether across benefit and pension this be the right approach to take my point be that we should not be wed to the idea that a time limit be the right way to do it this matter therefore warrant consideration as to whether fix time limit be the right way to go 
 the benefit of an open ended time period clinical recommendation be that it would allow great access to pension under special rule for those who have an uncertain prognosis many of whom still have difficulty access benefit whether it be month or month the drawback of that approach be that a broad definition of terminal illness would make it difficult for clinician to make decision about who be eligible which could lead to people miss out 
 the aforementioned survey of clinician view on this matter relate to the benefit system find that when ask what they think the time criterion should be under special rule of respondent prefer a month model prefer a model without reference to a time limit and only support the exist month model that go to the heart of what my right hon friend the member for east yorkshire be say which be that whereas everyone agree that the month rule should be change and that therefore my hon friend the member for tewkesbury be absolutely right to bring forward the bill there be not much in it between whether people think it should be month or there should not be a specific time limit those view should be express in this debate for further consideration give the subject we be debate 
 the conclusion on this point from the department be to make a legislative move to the month rule which be a perfectly reasonable decision to make base on that survey that be now codify in the social security additional payments act and the exact same reason have be apply in my hon friend ’s bill change the month to month be clearly the most popular option base on that evidence and it bring it into line with the rest of the benefit system it would maximise the opportunity to improve awareness of the special rule and provide consistency in their application we should be make it easy for people near the end of their life to access their pension benefit and any other financial aid they be entitle to under the special rule system 
 the argument take into consideration for access to special rule be awareness and communication the dwp evaluation show that much more could be do to improve awareness and respondent feel that the information and guidance regard access to special rule could be improve again we might want the bill to say something about make people aware of the change in the rule because it be no good have those change if nobody be aware of they that be something else that need to be consider 
 of course charity be vital in help people to make a special rule claim as people be often unaware that there be financial assistance and support available from the department for work and pensions for people near the end of their life however clinician can also play their part apparently as write in a dwp report some be not aware of special rule or have limit knowledge of they when the department align benefit with the month end of life approach it expect to be able to improve awareness among clinician by take advantage of training and educational resource and that through those resource the language should also be simplify that be the department ’s conclusion and i assume the same will be valid in this case too 
 on the point about the report i should also mention that the clinician raise concern over the term terminally ill which be use in the bill they say that the term be be use less and less these day and patient be now more commonly refer to use term such as end of life that be a change within the field of palliative care and that maybe could be take into account with the language in the bill and in the rule that the government use 
 what actually happen when someone try to submit a special rule claim be that something the bill could make easy too people near the end of their life or those who support they provide the dwp with medical evidence that provide detail of their clinical condition treatment and response to treatment that be most commonly do by a clinician complete an sr1 form that form can be complete by gps by hospital doctor or by register nurse work in role such as advanced nurse practitioner macmillan nurse clinical specialist nurse or practice nurse with expertise in long term condition management that form can be submit in either paper or electronic copy and in england by nhs staff use an online tool 
 as i say some clinician be not aware of the special rule or have limit knowledge of they therefore the clinician who provide sr1s do not always fully understand the special rule and what need to be include in they that mean some patient find get an sr1 or other medical evidence more challenging than it should be in the dwp ’s survey of the clinician who have complete an sr1 form the majority believe it be of value of respondent agree or strongly agree with the statement that the form be 
 an effective way of provide evidence to support a patient ’s benefit claim under the special rules criterion 
 but disagree or strongly disagree when ask to explain their reason for their view the majority say the form be perceive as easy and clear to use but some consider that it fail to capture certain information that they feel be important particularly where the patient meet the definition but be receive active treatment or where it be necessary to explain the detail of a condition other than cancer 
 if the bill succeed as i hope it will and the change be make from month to month that will offer an even big chance to develop a more cohesive approach between the department of work and pensions and clinician to ensure that the right people be claim special rule in order to get benefit there must be requirement for claim and way to claim the department find that more support around make a claim would improve the experience it also receive feedback on what happen once a special rule claim be make there be a consensus from those who feed back into the evaluation that have access to an online portal or some information on the progress of their claim would be helpful 
 i promise my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire that we would talk about the fiscal side of the bill i contact tim middleton the director of policy and external affair at the pensions management institute about that i thank he for give up his time question must be consider about the financial repercussion of the policy how many application for full commutation on the ground of serious ill health be receive by the pension protection fund scheme   each year i be tell that the number be in double figure it be really not many i should say that tim middleton have be work in the pension industry since and he have only ever encounter case of a special rule be apply to a pension protection fund scheme so we can safely say that it be not a big number 
 the question which my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire rightly ask be be the application period extend from month to month as the bill anticipate what additional cost would the pension protection fund incur a member be able to apply within the extended month of a diagnosis rather than month would be a change tim middleton who be an expert in the field of course if the government have any different figure we would all be delighted to hear they have say 
 whilst there be likely to be an increase in cost it do not seem likely that this would be significant and in any event for a scheme as large as the ppf it be expect that these cost could be easily absorb 
 that should give my hon friend some comfort that the scheme will not be burden beyond its mean but it certainly need to be consider it would be helpful if the minister let we know whether her assessment be the same as the i have be give by way of context in the european court of justice judgment in the hampshire case in it be estimate that the additional annual cost to the pension protection fund would be £ and that it would affect approximately member the bill change would see nothing like that figure 
 for completeness i look at whether anything other country do could be usefully include in the bill base on their practice and experience compare the terminal illness definition of country with comparable system i find that belgium use the phrase palliative status which be define as 
 expect survival of a maximum of month due to or more irreversible disorder and with the intention of die at home 
 the netherlands define it as 
 with an expectation to die within month 
 australia and new zealand use an average life expectancy of less than year in canada a terminal medical condition be a disease that 
 can not be cure or adequately treat and be reasonably expect to result in death within month 
 spain refer to people who will 
 benefit from palliative care for example those with an incurable advanced and progressive disease limited life forecast low possibility of response to specific treatment frequent crisis of need intense emotional and family impact impact on the care structure high demand and use of resource 
 from those definition we can see that there be no clear international definition of what constitute a terminal illness for the purpose of a welfare system whether that be a benefit system or a pension system some country as we can see have take a time base approach and other have go for a clinical definition this be a wide area that need more consideration generally but my hon friend the member for tewkesbury ’s bill be exactly right to make the point that the system the benefit system and the pension system should be exactly the same there be absolutely no reason why they should not whatever system we have in future i very much hope that we will always be able to keep a consistency of approach because otherwise it be not fair 
 on the bill ’s commencement my right hon friend the member for east yorkshire be absolutely right to be fair my hon friend the member for tewkesbury set it out clearly in speak to the bill so it be not as if anything be be hide to focus on the fact that the measure 
 come into force on such day or day as the secretary of state may by regulation appoint 
 i share his concern we all think something be a good idea the house of commons pass a bill as do the house of lords but lo and behold nothing happen i think most of our constituent will find that to be an intolerable situation 
 can the minister explain why we must have such a woolly starting point in the bill i can not see the need for it why can we not have a specific starting date surely at the least a no later than date base on the reason any delay might be need could be insert it be important that the minister explain why we can not have a specific date why there might be a delay and why we can not have a no later than date add to the bill i be pretty sure that we will all want to consider that again either in committee or the subsequent stage 
 have my hon friend examine clause 2(7 which give the secretary of state the power to make transitional arrangement so that a month period could be introduce for a specific time i do not understand why we be give the government that flexibility if the house and the other place approve the bill and the monarch sign it it should become law and be implement 
 my right hon friend make a good point duty of members in scrutinise legislation and hold the government to account be to ensure that on a day like today when people be anxious to get through as much as possible the government do not sneak into the bill a few power to change thing more easily in future power that perhaps the house might not otherwise want to give they at the moment this house pass far too many thing that give the government of the day sweep power to change thing without come back to the house for meaningful scrutiny my right hon friend be absolutely right to be wary of those measure 
 this be a fairly short bill but the most extensive part be clause which basically give the government power to vary this and that introduce the measure when they want and so on we should always be nervous about legislation that be a convenience for the executive rather than a benefit for our constituent it be incumbent on the minister to explain why the government need those power be there a specific reason that each of those power have be add to the bill or be it a typical catch all—“let ’s shove the lot in there just in case we might need it at some point in the future we should always be wary of such measure if there be a good reason that each subsection in clause be need let we hear it so that we can all make our own mind up about they if they be not need and have just be shove in for a bit of convenience in case the power be need at a later date perhaps the house might want to say well we do not think you should have those power if you want to do something different you should come back at a later date and make that case i look forward to hear the minister ’s response on that 
 those be perhaps thing that we could come back to in the bill ’s remain stage but in the meantime i certainly support the thrust of what my hon friend the member for tewkesbury be do he should be commend for focus on something that be important to many people and will make a massive difference to their life and he will be thank by many in my constituency and beyond on that basis i support the bill ’s reading 
 it be a pleasure to follow my hon friend   the member for shipley philip davies i must warn the house that i do not have his great detailed knowledge of this subject so i hope right hon and hon member will forgive my comparative brevity as a result 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   on table what be an excellent piece of legislation be diagnose with a terminal illness elicit a whole spectrum of emotion for the individual their family and their friend initial shock perhaps denial then a struggle as they cope with the harsh reality of their prognosis and the plethora of emotional response that it entirely unsurprisingly generate on top of that many have to grapple with get their affair in order add stress and anxiety to ensure they can support themselves in their final day and month while also perhaps think ahead to provide for those they leave behind we know from charity and campaigner that financial concern loom large in the mind of those enter the final stage of their life precisely at the time when they understandably want to be focus on other thing 
 as such i be pleased that this conservative government have take action to help those who be terminally ill by extend the definition of terminal illness from month to month as have be say the social security special rules for end of life act ensure that people can claim financial support in the form of personal independence payment disability living allowance employment support allowance and universal credit that be absolutely right so i be pleased that my hon friend ’s bill be before the house today because it will amend the rule around the pension protection fund to be largely in accordance with those other measure that be already in place it be a simple administrative change that will allow terminally ill people to claim assistance from the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme if their death can reasonably be expect within the next month rather than the current month it may seem a small step but it be a hugely significant that will provide certainty for terminally ill people and their family at a time of real stress and anxiety 
 i also concur with my hon friend the member for tewkesbury that although the number of people affect may be small the bill send an important signal to pension provider more widely i hope they will look at the bill and the decision of this house today and reflect on how they might well look after people who be protect by their individual pension fund the social security special rules for end of life act receive cross party support i hope the same will be true of my hon friend ’s bill i will certainly be wholeheartedly support its reading today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate   the hon member for tewkesbury mr robertson   on bring the pensions special rules for end of life bill before the house today for its reading the bill seek to expand the eligibility criterion for receive terminal illness payment from the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme to all those with less than month to live an increase from the exist month that will bring eligibility in line with the department for work and pensions own definition of terminal illness for the purpose of social security payment 
 the shock and distress cause by a terminal diagnosis for the individual and their love one can not be overstate those with a terminal illness should have the dignity of spend the time they have leave in comfort their stress should not be far compound by financial worry therefore we wholeheartedly agree with the aim of the bill it will of course only benefit a relatively small number of people it relate only to those who have a define benefit pension that be be assess by the pension protection fund or the financial assistance scheme however it be a step in the right direction and i hope we can build on it to improve thing for all those live with a terminal illness because at the moment the reality be truly shocking 
 i pay tribute to the marie curie charity for all the work it have do to highlight the financial struggle of the terminally ill research carry out by that charity in paint a harrowing picture people die in poverty in the uk every year in people who die while of working age be in poverty at the end of their life and in uk adult would be wholly reliant on benefit if they become terminally ill the cost of living crisis have worsen since those figure be publish so i fear that the situation be more severe now 
 as i say the dwp ’s definition of a terminal illness for the purpose of social security rule be now set at 
 less than month to live 
 have be increase from month by the social security special rules for end of life act we support that legislation as it be the right thing to do it and should provide some small reassurance to those in the most difficult circumstance i question why the dwp do not look this issue at the time of the change while the issue do differ that legislation relate to benefit payment while this bill relate to workplace pension it be important to have consistency so that those with a terminal illness have clarity on their entitlement with that in mind i hope the minister can offer some reassurance that the definition of a terminal illness will be consistent across the dwp and its various agency if this bill make it on to the statute book 
 the conservative cost of living crisis continue to hit family hard this government ’s reckless decision crush the economy send mortgage rate soar and send energy bill through the roof receive a terminal diagnosis be incredibly difficult at any time but too many people be spend the time they have leave in poverty that can not be right the government must do far more to help these people 
 i conclude by once again congratulate the hon member for tewkesbury on his dedication in bring forward this important bill it be a step in the right direction and we fully support its aim 
 it give i great pleasure to confirm that the government give their full support to this private member ’s bill i thank my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for bring forward what he say be a small and limited piece of legislation but we have hear over the past hour and a bit how important these small change will be to those affect i thank my hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller my right hon friend the members for east yorkshire sir greg knight and for ludlow philip dunne and my hon friend the members for stoke on trent central jo gideon for shipley philip davies and for aylesbury rob butler for their contribution 
 my hon friend the member for shipley explain why the alignment be ultimately a good idea as we have hear a life limit illness can cause unimaginable suffering for the patient and their loved one and that be just at diagnosis yet alone across the trajectory of the disease many people have say that they feel as though they have be hit by an emotional tsunami and we should do anything we can to help and support those near the end of life my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central poignantly outline some of the challenge that people can face at this stage in their life 
 many charity have be mention but i pay particular tribute to marie curie which often provide nurse who sit with people as they near the end of life it be an incredible service for our constituent and ensure that people do not die alone its work be incredibly important its motor neurone disease campaign have be mention but we must also thank people in the hospice sector and more broadly across the nhs particularly those who work in end of life and palliative care 
 we have hear much about the social security special rules for end of life act which change the special rule process to allow simple and fast access to financial support through the benefit system the change make in the act cover the disability living allowance the personal independence payment and the attendance allowance and ensure that people at this most difficult of time could receive their support more quickly and easily the special rule be then extend to universal credit and employment and support allowance through secondary legislation that come into force on   april under those rule claim be fast track and a medical assessment be not require no waiting period be apply and in the majority of case the high level of benefit be award since eligibility under the special rule have be limit to those who have be diagnose with a condition that mean that they be unlikely to live for more than month the change that the government make in mean that people receive certain social security benefit who be think to be in the final year of their life be show additional compassion and be able to receive that vital support month early 
 when the regulation come into force they be welcome by key end of life charity such as the motor neurone disease association whose chief executive say at the time 
 i welcome the announcement that change to the special rules will come into force next month this change will enable more people live with complex and unpredictable terminal illness like motor neurone disease to access the support they need swiftly and sensitively this be an important step and we hope that this positive change can be enact for other applicable benefit as soon as possible 
 marie curie also welcome the change say that they would 
 make it easy for terminally ill people to access support quickly 
 and that 
 the scrapping of the month rule for fast track access to benefit be a significant step forward 
 macmillan cancer support say 
 patient deserve well co ordination of care into the last year(s of life and this change give we a brilliant opportunity to help they benefit from end of life financial support while have treatment so they can make the most of the last year(s of life 
 this bill take a further step in support those with a terminal illness by extend similar support through compensation payment make by the pension protection fund and payment under the financial assistance scheme as my hon friend the member for tewkesbury explain the pension protection fund pay compensation to member of eligible define benefit pension scheme if the sponsor employer become insolvent on or after   april   and the scheme have insufficient asset to meet its pension liability member can claim their compensation payment before their scheme ’s normal pension age generally from the age of the financial assistance scheme make payment to member of qualifying scheme that be unable to meet their pension liability in full 
 currently member of the ppf who be not yet entitle to receive compensation may make an application to their scheme for a terminal illness payment if they be expect to live for month or less terminal illness be currently define in legislation as 
 if the person ’s death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expect within month 
 the bill amend that definition to ensure that member with a life expectancy of up to month can now receive the payment it will restore the original policy intention of alignment between the social security special rule and the pension protection fund the same definition apply to the financial assistance scheme and the bill therefore amend that definition as well the financial assistance scheme differ from the ppf in that a terminal illness diagnosis allow payment from the financial assistance scheme to be put in place immediately rather than a specific lump sum be provide 
 my right hon friend the member for east yorkshire and my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire ask what consultation we have carry out as i think my hon friend the member for shipley mention we have consult general practitioner consultant specialist nurse and other medical professional 
 some may argue that the government should take a more open ended approach and not put any time limit on the payment that argument as we have hear may be particularly pertinent for those who have condition such as motor neurone disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease parkinson ’s disease and a plethora of other condition that can make it exceedingly difficult for clinician and doctor to accurately predict how much time a patient have until the end of their life 
 unfortunately there be not a clearcut correct answer on how terminal illness should be define so as my hon friend the member for tewkesbury say that should be leave to the professional in recognition of that the act be precede by an evaluation in which the majority of clinician who respond say that a month definition be preferable as it would bring the special rule for benefit into line with nhs practice and nhs initiative such as the gold standard framework the department agree and the legislation align the definition of terminal illness with that use in the nhs provide consistency for clinician and tie the special rule into the nhs long term plan to provide proactive personalised and well co ordinated care for all those in their final year of life 
 this bill build on the previous legislation by align the definition use for the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme payment with that use more widely in the department for work and pensions and the nhs the government believe that the month timeframe be appropriate for define the period for serious ill health payment in tax law for an individual to meet the definition of a person in serious ill health evidence be require from a register medical practitioner that the individual be expect to live for less than year 
 the pension protection fund may be a compensation scheme rather than a pension scheme but in many way it be treat as a pension scheme for taxation purpose that mean that the pension protection fund terminal illness payment fall under the category of a serious ill health lump sum that allow it to be pay without trigger unauthorised payment tax charge on either the individual or the pension protection fund extend the definition of terminal illness to long than a year would open up member to significant tax charge on their terminal illness payment which be not what the government want at all 
 my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire ask about the impact on the levy we believe that the cost to the pension protection fund will be marginal most member will simply get their payment early he also ask about pension fund have a month provision the benefit provide will depend on scheme rule we do not know how many scheme have such a provision but we believe that many scheme already provide early access to lump sum for terminally ill member or those with a life expectancy of month or less because that be allow under tax law 
 my hon friend the member for shipley and my right hon friend the member for east yorkshire ask about commencement as with any bill that pass through both houses it will come into force on a day appoint by the secretary of state it be the intention for that to be as soon as practicable after royal assent to ensure that all measure relate to the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme come in at the same time 
 i hear that my right hon friend the member for ludlow have write to the secretary of state and i will make sure that an answer come to he in a timely way he ask who make the decision the answer be clinician medical assessor and specialist nurse in response to my right hon friend the member for east yorkshire let i say that can obtain a opinion and that go for all the illness that i mention 
 i thank all hon and right hon member for their contribution and for the sensitive way in which they have approach this matter i appreciate the time bind argument that my hon friend the member for shipley put forward but these matter be always a challenge for clinician i agree with he and my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central that a well conversation about end of life and how we treat issue as we move forward into that stage of our life would be a very good thing for we all we should be a lot more discussive about it 
 i thank my hon friend the member for tewkesbury for bring forward the bill and all right hon and hon member for their contribution these change will make a significant positive impact for people near the end of their life by ensure that most pension fund member will be able to receive a payment at an early stage that will give they the financial support they need at a most difficult time for they and their family as well as help they plan more effectively to get the most out of the finance they be due these change send a message about end of life that the conversation must be alive and vibrant for we all so that we do the good we can i be pleased to support the bill and wish it a speedy passage through both houses 
 i call mr laurence robertson to wind up with the leave of the house 
 i thank the minister for that response and the shadow minister for her contribution i also thank my right hon and hon friend for their speech and intervention they all raise good point but i think the most important make by my hon friend   the member for shipley philip davies be that the bill take we in the right direction but should not be the last word on this issue we must look at assess people in term of illness because it be not just about time it be about the diagnosis and the seriousness of those illness i be pleased that the minister pick that up we must look to extrapolate this principle into other pension payment and scheme as i mention in my speech 
 finally i be pleased that the minister confirm that the government intend to ensure that the bill start to have an impact as quickly as possible after royal assent i look forward to work with she and the government on that basis

 i thank the cross party sponsor of my bill notably   the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the esteemed chair of the justice committee his support throughout this process have be invaluable and have demonstrate clearly the potential of the bill to create cross party consensus 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech she mention   the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill his support show the cross party support for look at how a majority of our young people be wrongly criminalise and lock behind bar and their life throw away do she agree that this bill be important and that we should take the criminalisation of young people away from party politic 
 i totally agree with my hon friend ’s point about the criminalisation of our young black people we need cross party consensus 
 lastly i thank my a team becky and charley who have be truly amazing 
 before i begin my argument i recognise that this be an incredibly difficult and sensitive topic because behind each joint enterprise case there be victim of crime and their family many of whom have lose love one in situation that most of we find difficult to comprehend behind each joint enterprise miscarriage of justice there be people love one whole family whose life have be tear apart by an unjust lifelong sentence where someone have be wrongly punish for the crime of another 
 my hon friend be make an excellent contribution about a very important bill do she agree that many of the predominantly young people ensnare by joint enterprise come from inner city black community their family be devastate and often lack the medium and political connection to mount an urgent and rapid legal case or campaign so these young people end up spend several year in prison for an offence they do not commit their life be subsequently damage severely this bill be very necessary the injustice have go on for a very long time 
 i agree that the bill will look at right those wrong and challenge those miscarriage of justice 
 can the hon lady confirm whether the leader of her party support the bill 
 i can confirm that the party will be look at this bill when we be in power and when we get rid of well when we be in power 
 it be possible both to uphold the law by provide power to prosecute those who play a significant role in a crime and to prevent innocent people from go to jail there be cross party consensus that thing need to change and that it be now up to parliament to act that be what this bill seek to do no more no less 
 do my hon friend agree that the campaign on joint enterprise be not about guilty people get off but about have a justice system that work for everyone the chair of the justice committee and i co chair the all party parliamentary group on miscarriage of justice and we believe that this be the big injustice in the criminal justice system there be a grow feeling across the criminal justice system include among senior judge that the balance have to be get right 
 i totally agree with my hon friend and i will cover some of those point in my speech i hope that the minister will listen closely to the argument i put forward today and fully consider this opportunity to end this injustice which have destroy so many life and place undue burden on the court the prison system and the taxpayer 
 as the minister will know joint enterprise be the century old legal doctrine that be intend to give power to prosecute people who be not the primary actor but nevertheless play a role in a crime such as a getaway driver in a bank robbery however something have go profoundly wrong in the way the law have be use for the past year as the supreme court recognise in the landmark case of ameen jogee 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech research include the report from the centre for crime and justice studies have find that follow the landmark supreme court judgment which have be expect to lead to a reduction in these type of prosecution and conviction not only have there be no discernible effect but the number of black people convict of murder have actually rise do my hon friend agree that that be of the reason the bill be need 
 my hon friend make a valid point on the consequence of the landmark case of ameen jogee whose mum be in the gallery today people be be give mandatory life sentence for murder that they do not commit thousand have be lock up for life because they have be deem in effect guilty by association since that rule very little have change with only successful appeal as be show in the research by the centre for crime and justice studies that my hon friend refer to 
 i compliment my hon friend on bring forward this private member ’s bill through her good office i have have the opportunity to meet some of the family involve to describe some of the case as egregious injustice be no understatement of the appalling thing i have find be the inconsistent way in which joint enterprise guilt by association have   be apply there be case where might think it would have be apply such as in the murder of jay abatan in i would like to highlight the justice for jay abatan campaign which be still fight for justice year on 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point and particularly for raise the justice for jay abatan campaign which be very similar to the stephen lawrence campaign 
 the centre for crime and justice studies suggest that the judgment have little to no effect on the number of joint enterprise charge or conviction indeed since there have be a new legal problem whereby jury be deliberately not direct to consider the contribution that a person make to a crime as in the case of faisal fiaz who be in a park car that be street away from where the murder for which he be convict occur only parliament can fix this 
 a charge of joint enterprise too often lead to an assumption of guilt in the courtroom with the defendant have to prove their innocence turn our justice system on its head this be a failure of our justice system which be supposedly the good in the world and an affront to the taxpayer who be leave foot the bill for sloppy sentencing to quote jimmy mcgovern ’s common 
 joint enterprise might allow it natural justice do not 
 if pass my bill will fix this wrong turn and help to return the law to its original intention
