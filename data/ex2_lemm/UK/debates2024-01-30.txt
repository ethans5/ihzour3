the minister of state be ask 
 what recent diplomatic step he have take to help secure a sustainable ceasefire in gaza 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help end the conflict in israel and gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza 
 what recent diplomatic step he have take to help secure a sustainable ceasefire in gaza 
 we be call for an immediate humanitarian pause in order to get aid in and hostage out as a vital step towards a sustainable permanent ceasefire 
 that be all very well but the problem be that netanyahu and the israeli government be simply ignore all the plea for restraint those plea have become empty word what will the government do to put real pressure on the israelis to stop the unacceptable killing enter into negotiation for a permanent ceasefire and stop the threat to permanently annex and occupy gaza have the time come to stop sell to israel arm that be be use to raze gaza to the ground 
 as i tell the house yesterday the foreign secretary be in the region today and will pursue the vital policy that the hon gentleman have set out the hon gentleman will know that it be an absolute priority for britain to ensure that more aid get in but the israeli government have the right of self defence and as the uk government continually make clear they must exercise that right within international humanitarian law 
 like many other member i be sure i have receive an extraordinary number of email from constituent who be deeply concerned about what be go on these be people who would never normally get in touch with their mp we must stop the killing my party and i believe that an immediate bilateral ceasefire be the way forward what step be the government take with partner in the region and around the world to achieve that end 
 all of we want a ceasefire but it must be sustainable that be why the british government be bent on ensure that we get a humanitarian pause so that we can get far more supply into gaza and on the back of that a sustainable ceasefire as i say in answer to   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts we need a pause in order to get aid and support in and the hostage out 
 accord to the un world food programme over half a palestinians in gaza be starve a famine be imminent allegation against united nations relief and works agency staff be rightly be investigate but cut aid to unrwa entirely be disproportionate and punitive have the minister even consider the consequence of those cut on woman baby and the seriously injure and do he understand that they would breach the measure issue by the international court of justice to ensure that aid flow into gaza 
 as i have set out to the house repeatedly we be do everything we can along with other to ensure that vital supply get into gaza for the very reason that the hon lady set out on unrwa it would be impossible for any of we to continue business as usual give the appalling event outline over the weekend that be why we have make it clear that we will not produce further finance until we be satisfied that those matter have be address with regard to what we be seek to do through unrwa now we have provide additional funding in the past and that will ensure that aid and vital supply get into gaza 
 the government have consistently repeat their commitment to a state solution and that be right but for year israel have deliberately undermine that through the settlement of the west bank in contravention of international law now netanyahu have come clean and rule out a state solution so do the minister agree that if the uk ’s policy be to be see as anything more than empty word we need to demonstrate our commitment to a viable palestinian state by recognise it and by upgrade current government advice against trade with the illegal settlement to a full embargo 
 the government ’s position on the issue of illegal settlement be absolutely clear in respect of the state solution i would point out to the hon gentleman that progress have be make previously in particular after grievous act of terrible conflict and terrorism that be when the big leap forward towards a resolution of this desperate problem have be make we hope that on the back of the horrendous event that have take place on   october   and since additional progress can be make as soon as the political track can be restart 
 the palestinian authority ’s grip on security control across the west bank have be push out by the malevolent force of hamas palestinian islamic jihad and local terror group fund by iran be it not the case that unilateral recognition of a palestinian state now would risk equip those dangerous actor with the trimming and capability of a state 
 the british government have always be clear that we intend to recognise a palestinian state when the timing be right my right hon and learn friend will have hear the comment that the foreign secretary make last night which in no way deviate from that policy the foreign secretary be point out how important it be to ensure that people can see that when a political track get go real progress can be make 
 if we can not have a ceasefire a humanitarian pause would of course be very welcome but it will only be of any use if we can get the aid that be so urgently require into gaza what be the government do to overcome what the foreign secretary have describe as the ludicrous check regime put in place by the israelis and what more can we do to stop or avoid crowd of israelis from gather at crossing into gaza aim to prevent aid from enter and so obviate a famine 
 on my right hon friend ’s point i can assure he that we be in regular touch with all the relevant authority to try to ensure that do not hinder the entry of aid on his point we should all be aware that the issue be not that there be not enough aid in the region but that it be not get in that be why the government under the prime minister ’s specific instruction have be investigate how to get aid in through all mean include from the sea and from a naval corridor 
 it be really disturbing that bbc online be report that the foreign secretary have change the uk government ’s approach on recognition of a palestinian state do the minister agree that bring forward and accelerate unilateral recognition of a palestinian state would be to reward hamas ’s atrocity 
 my right hon friend will be aware that there be no question of reward hamas for the appalling act they perpetrate in a pogrom on   october the point that the foreign secretary have be make be that we must give the people of the west bank and gaza a credible route to a palestinian state and a new future but we must do so when the time be right 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister will know that there be rise anger in the region about the desperate situation in gaza which make a ceasefire much hard to achieve more people be now die of hunger and thirst than from bomb and bullet he say yesterday that the uk be pause funding to unrwa not cut it but give its critical role will he reassure we that nothing will disrupt the supply of aid not just into gaza but through gaza now and in the month ahead he be right that these be serious allegation and we should be robust about how uk aid money be spend but it would be unconscionable if we allow anything to   stand in the way of uk aid reach those child right now will he promise that the uk will move heaven and earth to get that aid to they 
 the shadow minister for development be absolutely right about the balance that have to be strike of course we need to investigate rapidly the very serious allegation that have be make against unrwa but the asset we use for get aid and support into gaza depend on the asset that unrwa own warehouse vehicle and the other distribution mechanism as such we need that inquiry to be complete as rapidly as possible in the meanwhile britain be not intend to give any further support to unrwa in this financial year in the next financial year we will consider the position in precisely the way the shadow minister set out 
 whether he be take diplomatic step to help reduce the risk of conflict in the west philippine sea 
 the uk be commit to the primacy of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and to freedom of navigation and overflight we oppose any action that raise tension or the risk of miscalculation in the south china sea the foreign secretary speak to his philippino counterpart in december and the fcdo issue a statement on   december condemn chinese unsafe and escalatory action against the philippines 
 i declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the philippines the minister be no doubt aware of a large number of video post on youtube and other outlet show chinese gunboat ram and victimise philippine fisherman in the west philippine sea this be a vital industry for the economy of the philippines which as she know be of our key strategic partner in the region what discussion have she have with her chinese counterpart to stop those unprovoked attack and allow those peaceful fisherman simply to go about earn a livelihood to support their family 
 i be in vietnam in october speak at the south china sea conference and i set out very clearly the uk ’s position and raise the serious risk which my hon friend highlight pose by these instance of unsafe conduct against philippino fishing vessel the uk have provide £ in funding to support regional partner through an enhance programme of maritime security capacity building in south east asia which include training on the law of the sea and we continue to provide that support to help maintain that free and open pacific 
 i thank the minister for that response china be quite clearly a thuggish country a bully country that think it can step upon anybody they have an insatiable demand and appetite for everybody else ’s resource when will the time come that china will understand that they can not bully the wee person that we will stand with that wee person against they 
 the hon gentleman set out a really important position and we want to continue to support and work closely with the philippines i be able to co chair the uk philippines strategic dialogue in november where we be continue to work with the philippines across a number of front on how we can support they to ensure that they can sustain their agency and present themselves the position as he highlight of want to be able to use their waterway freely and unencumbered 
 what recent discussion he have have with his israeli counterpart on israel ’s political objective in gaza 
 what plan the government have to recognise a palestinian state 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of the recognition of a palestinian state 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of the recognition of a palestinian state 
 we be clear that for a peaceful solution to this conflict there must be a political horizon towards a state solution britain will recognise a palestinian state at a time when it well serve the objective of peace bilateral recognition alone can not end the occupation 
 give the evidence of war crime and crime against humanity commit by israel and now recognition by the international court of justice of the risk of genocide be commit by israel have the uk government seek to ascertain what the israeli military objective be in gaza and do the minister agree with the motion table by the scottish national party at the council of europe last week support by nation and member that an immediate ceasefire and a resettlement scheme for those bomb out of gaza by israel be absolutely essential 
 i have not see the motion table by the snp and i probably would not agree with it if i have we be always focused on address the point that the hon lady have make when it come to the international court of justice and indeed international humanitarian law the government ’s view be not the same as her but she may rest assure that we keep these thing under very close review 
 there be now a live ongoing investigation by the icj into genocide in gaza give the british government ’s reluctance thus far to recognise the state of palestine do the minister not understand that failure to do so will soon result in the uk government just recognise a cemetery 
 the government ’s position and indeed i believe the position of those on the opposition front bench have always be clear we should recognise the   state of palestine when the time be right the foreign secretary last night add some further word to that commitment but that be the commitment of the british government 
 last night the foreign secretary indicate that the uk government will consider recognise the palestinian state in order 
 to give the palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there be go to be irreversible progress to a state solution 
 can the minister explain how that be possible when both the israeli national security minister and the finance minister have advocate use the ongoing war as an opportunity to permanently resettle palestinians from gaza and establish israeli settlement there and the israeli prime minister have openly say he be proud to have prevent the establishment of a palestinian state 
 the foreign secretary be make it clear that we need a credible route to a palestinian state and the offer of a new future it be very important to lift people ’s eye to the possibility once a political track be establish i point out to the hon gentleman that progress have be make progress that be make at oslo take place on the back of appalling event when people reach for a political solution the same be true of what follow the intifada the aim of the british government be to get a sustainable ceasefire and move to that political track 
 my right hon friend ’s comment about a big leap forward be noble i recognise that but as long as hamas who believe not in a state solution but in kill and rap jews cle on in gaza as fatah be barely able to control the west bank and as israel be still in trauma still try to get hostage include baby back from gaza what do he think that talk about early recognition of palestinian statehood can achieve 
 i recognise the voracity of what my right hon friend say but there be no change in the policy he be right that hamas must agree to the release of all hostage that hamas can no long be in charge of gaza and that we need an agreement to provide governance service and security there which will involve the palestinian authority the foreign secretary in his meeting with president abbas last week seek to advance that agenda 
 on sunday a of knesset members attend a conference call for the return of settlement to gaza and to the north of the occupy west bank some of those member have also ask for a voluntary migration of palestinians from gaza with israel take over control do the minister agree that that be not in the good interest of israel and that there should be a return to the pre-1967 border with both country work together to maintain peace in the interest of their citizen 
 yes i do the only viable long term pathway be a state solution base on line with jerusalem as a shared capital that guarantee security and stability for both israelis and palestinians 
 surely the only political objective in gaza be inextricably link to the security objective because the grim reality be that hamas do not seek a ceasefire and israel can not be reasonably expect to pursue with a group who actively seek its destruction not least the commitment make by a senior hamas official ghazi hamad who recently say 
 we must teach israel a lesson and we will do this again and again 
 and that the   october   massacre be 
 just the time and there will be a a a 
 the only political solution must be the elimination of hamas and the release of the hostage 
 that be why the government have make it clear that call for a ceasefire on its own will simply not work israel absolutely have the right of self defence to address and deal with the cause of the terrible event of   october secondly hamas have make it absolutely clear that they do not want a ceasefire they want to replicate the event that take place on   october 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 for a decade now the labour party have support palestinian recognition as my right hon and learn friend   the member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer   have say 
 statehood be not in the gift of a neighbour it be the inalienable right of the palestinian people 
 i welcome the foreign secretary adopt that position and reject the notion that recognition can only follow the conclusion of negotiation after the unacceptable comment by prime minister netanyahu do the prime minister agree that no country have a veto over the uk ’s decision to recognise palestine 
 i can tell the shadow foreign secretary that we will pursue the policy that we think be right the foreign secretary set out clearly in his remark last night the importance of a credible route to a palestinian state and a new future in respect of the conversation that the foreign secretary will have have last week with prime minister netanyahu i can not trade the detail across the house but i can tell the right hon gentleman that the foreign secretary will have represent the british position with prime minister netanyahu whom he know very well with great accuracy 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 palestinian recognition be an inalienable right not a privilege to be confer by other although i be pleased to hear the foreign secretary say last night that the uk 
 with ally will look at the issue of recognise a palestinian state 
 i feel we have be here before most notably in give netanyahu ’s categorical rejection of a palestinian state what be the next step when will we hear about they and how confident can we be that we will not be sit here in another year wish we have act to prevent a genocide 
 it be not easy to sustain the view that we have be here before at least not to this extent the british government ’s policy have be clear on the recognition of the state of palestine we be work extremely hard in the region and more widely internationally to secure a political track the hon gentleman will recognise that that will be in the mix once that political track be able to start 
 what step his department be take to support develop country with climate change adaptation 
 we be committed to spend £ on climate adaptation by 
 extreme weather be already cause huge devastation especially in the poor community across the world who be also the least likely to find investor or to borrow from global financial institution at cop28 there be a breakthrough and a loss and damage fund have finally be establish however the money for the uk ’s contribution will come from pre existing climate finance commitment and the development budget should the government in the spirit of what the loss and damage fund represent not establish a new ringfenced loss and damage budget that be not take from other budget 
 we do support set up the loss and damage fund at cop28 and we contribute specifically towards it however it be important that loss and damage do not draw from the same donor and the same official development assistance budget as other development it have to be different it be because the uae as a non traditional donor put in $ to that fund that britain be willing to support it but we need new and different donor and new and different source of fund 
 i welcome the extremely important work the government be do in protect vulnerable community around the world will the minister confirm to i that the £ that the government have commit for save nature will be use on some of the very vulnerable habitat site and animal around the world such as those environmental audit committee see on a recent visit to antarctica will he particularly think about whale fur seal and of course the emperor penguin 
 i will think about all the mammal my hon friend have mention i can assure he that our commitment be to biodiversity and to nature we recognise the great importance of the work be do in the antarctic and indeed the contribution that he make to that 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 from the flood to the fire from melt ice sheet to ocean heat the climate crisis be reach a tipping point labour have a plan at home double onshore wind treble solar and end new oil and gas licence in the north sea labour have a plan internationally a clean power alliance   of developed and develop country to drive forward the transition be it not the truth that the government have no plan and have squander britain ’s climate reputation to wage culture war at home 
 the reason the government be able to reduce the size of electricity bill for hard work family be precisely because we be meet our target and will meet our international commitment britain ’s international target and commitment be enshrine in law as a result of the activity of this house internationally we be commit as the right hon gentleman know and as be set out to the house towards the end of last year to spend £ on ensure that we meet our climate target and produce climate finance i would argue that that figure will be near £ by 
 whether he have have recent discussion with his international counterpart on a strategy to reduce debt in the develop world 
 the government recently set out our commitment on develop country debt in our international development white paper 
 the main mechanism to tackle the debt crisis the common framework for debt treatment be fail due to the low level of participation by private creditor who own around of low income country debt do the minister agree that there be strategic need for the united kingdom to take debt reduction seriously and change its approach give the crisis in africa and the grow role of china and russia in the develop world 
 the hon lady be right to point to the considerable difficulty that country be find some of low income country be in debt distress and be at high risk of that the african development bank say that debt repayment in be likely to be time the level of that be why britain be work with other creditor to secure debt restructuring most often through the g20 common framework but also through the paris club 
 what recent step he have take to help prevent an escalation of conflict in the middle east 
 the government be engage extensively to prevent an escalation of conflict in the middle east the prime minister speak to president biden last week about that specific issue 
 i think we can all understand the anger towards israel for the way it be systematically demolish gaza and needlessly kill so many of the people as well as the need for it to be properly hold to account do the minister recognise that we must do everything to protect against other join the conflict   and that activity such as those against the houthis must also be proportionate and accompany by more diplomatic work across the region to stop wholesale killing 
 the hon gentleman be right to make clear that all of we seek that there should not be an escalation of this conflict in the middle east that be why right at the start britain move military asset to the eastern end of the mediterranean more recently as he allude to we be express strong support for freedom of navigation on the high sea stop attack by the houthis we be degrade their capacity to carry out their attack and have make clear that we will not accept that challenge to international freedom of the sea 
 problem with the middle east be the sense of hopelessness among the palestinian people which be fuel terrorist outrage what step can the government take with our american friend to try to put pressure on the israeli state to stop the imposition of new settlement in the west bank so that we can gradually reduce tension in the whole region be that not the way forward 
 we have make it clear that the settlement be illegal and should not have go ahead and should not go ahead on the wide point we be work closely with our american friend and other through the superb diplomatic network that britain possess to try to lift people ’s eye and move to the day after when a political track can start that be the answer to my right hon friend ’s question the political track which can then start to offer hope in resolve this dreadful and long stand problem 
 i call the shadow minister 
 today the middle east be in danger of see a major escalation of conflict and whether it be in gaza the red sea lebanon iraq syria or jordan we be see aggression if there be a common denominator in those conflict it be the malign influence of iran usually through its proxy what be the government do to disrupt and stop the disruptive activity of iran 
 my right hon friend the foreign secretary have a meeting recently with the iranian foreign minister to set out britain ’s view of and requirement from the relationship with iran and i think that be a most useful contact to have the foreign secretary be in the region today try to ensure that the very point behind this question be accept and honour we be work extensively with jordan egypt qatar israel saudi arabia and america those discussion be ongoing and will address the point that the hon gentleman have raise 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the uk ’s non military support to ukraine over winter on the humanitarian situation in that country 
 what recent diplomatic support he have provide to ukraine 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on maintain support for ukraine 
 what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the war in ukraine 
 since february the uk have commit £ of humanitarian assistance to ukraine in response to winter we scale up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance insulation and support for energy and heating the foreign secretary ’s overseas visit be to ukraine he continue to set out the uk ambition to international partner and do so in november during nato and osce gathering and most recently at davos where he meet foreign minister kuleba 
 tim bamford our local councillor for denby dale have devote his own time and expense to make several potentially dangerous excursion drive a truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war tear ukraine alongside volunteer from the yorkshire aid convoy will the minister join i in thank tim who be sit in the public gallery and all the fantastic team at the yorkshire aid convoy for everything that they be do to help the ukrainian people and wish they a safe journey for their next trip in march 
 i be delighted to join my hon friend in thank tim and tina bamford both of whom be in the public gallery the response of the british people to the tragedy in ukraine have be remarkable and hugely generous and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit show by the commendable action of the yorkshire aid convoy 
 there be many billion of russian asset freeze by western nation and there be a strong moral case for ukraine to use those asset to repel russia ’s aggression and rebuild its own economy what progress have the department make in talk to other nation to make that a reality 
 i agree that there be a strong moral case for use russian asset to repair the damage that russia have work on ukraine we be clear about the fact that russia should pay and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieve that end 
 the united nations high commissioner for refugees recently say 
 i think the big difference from last year to this year be that this year there be somehow a trend towards get use to ukrainian suffering 
 it be more than day since the opposition table a motion necessitating government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of russian state asset within day but no plan have yet be forthcoming why be the government so out of step with our ally and partner in this regard 
 we be not out of step we be lead the pack and have be do so for the last year our resolve be show by our own financial commitment but also by our permanent commitment to the uk ukraine   relationship which be demonstrate when the prime minister sign the uk ukraine agreement on security co operation at the start of the year we be in it for the long haul 
 tomorrow jens stoltenberg the secretary general of nato will meet representative of the heritage foundation a republican lean think tank he will meet ally of former president trump in an effort to unlock $ of funding for ukraine what effort be the government make to persuade trump ’s ally and what contingency planning be they do with our european ally for a scenario in which trump and his ally be not persuade 
 minister engage constantly with counterpart around the world include those in the us when it come to the nato response we have see nato expand and grow in the last year putin think it be weak but it be now big and strong than it be in 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the international monetary fund estimate that ukraine need $ this year just to manage the book there be a special european council meeting on thursday to sign off a package of € in aid to ukraine the uk government have be part of that coalition so can the minister assure we that ukraine fatigue will not set in here there be back across the house for the continuation of these supportive effort and surely the most effective way to get aid to ukraine be to transfer the seized russian asset to finance for ukraine ’s reconstruction 
 i assure the hon gentleman that we feel no fatigue when it come to our ukraine policy we have exceed last year ’s commitment in term of lethal aid and we will be contribute a huge amount of other aid and economic support since our total humanitarian economic and military support have rise to more than £ which i think demonstrate that our resolve be unflagge 
 i share the concern of   the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord   about the attitude towards the ukraine fight and indeed towards nato of certain element on the american political scene will our foreign office team do everything in their power to impress on our american ally that the peace of europe depend on unquestionable american support for the nato alliance in the future just as it do in the past 
 we continue to make that point to all our interlocutor i should also say that we continue to make the point to all nato member state that invest of gdp in defence expenditure be a condition of membership 
 i meet the leeds ukrainian community in my constituency this weekend to hear about the desperate need of war tear ukrainian citizen with the hungarian leader viktor orbán continue to veto the eu ’s £ aid package to ukraine what diplomatic step be the minister take to encourage hungary to play its part in support ukraine ’s fight for freedom 
 we be very active in our diplomacy with hungary and neighbouring state i be actually in slovakia last week talk about a similar set of issue diplomacy do matter and our judgment be that in the end mr orbán will do the right thing 
 what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the state of relation between iran and pakistan 
 the foreign secretary have make it clear to his iranian counterpart that iran must stop use regional instability as cover to act recklessly he and lord ahmad have also underline to pakistan ’s foreign minister the importance of avoid further escalation we welcome iran and pakistan ’s subsequent commitment to dialogue in a joint statement release on   january confirm that ambassador will return to post and we continue to monitor the situation 
 as the minister say diplomatic effort have ease tension follow the exchange of missile early this month however the minister will be aware that over the weekend iranian gunman murder pakistanis in the iranian city of saravan the fact that both country have launch air strike against each other indicate how fragile the situation be in the middle east and how interconnect act of war and violence be across the whole region how will the british government ensure that their own action do not escalate tension 
 as i say iran must stop use regional instability as cover to carry out its reckless act we recognise that it bear responsibility for any further escalation and we be look at all the tool that we have to bear down on the iranian regime include sanction 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the human right situation in eritrea 
 we continue to press eritrea bilaterally and at the un human rights council to end human right violation it may come as a surprise to the house to hear that eritrea be an elect member of the un human rights council 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on eritrea i often hear the country describe as the north korea of africa young people be conscript indefinitely and critic of the regime be arbitrarily detain and disappear do the minister agree that that perhaps explain why over of asylum claim from eritreans in the uk be grant by the home office what more can the government do to take step to ensure an end to human right abuse in eritrea and elsewhere in the horn of africa which be push factor behind irregular arrival in the uk 
 i think the hon gentleman pull his punch it be bad than he say eritrea rank towards the bottom of the world press freedom index we urge eritrea to allow the un special rapporteur for human right access to the country and we also seek the full withdrawal of eritrean troop from northern ethiopia in accordance with the pretoria peace agreement 
 we must not forget the abuse that be happen in neighbour sudan over people have be internally displace with in desperate need of humanitarian aid last night the international criminal court prosecutor tell the un security council that there be reasonable ground to believe that both the sudan armed force and the rapid support force be commit atrocious crime in darfur what hope do the minister have that we can end the impunity stop the rape murder and pillage and bring peace to the people of sudan 
 we be call for an immediate ceasefire there be talk in addis before christmas we seek progress through the united nations where we hold the pen on sudan and also through the troika the intergovernmental authority on development and the african union we be do everything we can to end the appalling situation in sudan which my right hon friend have just describe with great eloquence 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the situation of the hazara community in afghanistan 
 the uk work closely with the international community include the g7 and g20 and through the un to protect the human right of all of afghanistan ’s people and to co ordinate a consistent international response in december my colleague the minister for south asia in the other place raise the recent attack on hazaras with the un assistance mission in afghanistan 
 last week   the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin   and i meet member of our respective hazara community they also regularly attend the all party parliamentary group on hazaras which be chair by   the hon member for peterborough paul bristow my concern be that the kidnap rape and persecution that the taliban regularly use against the hazara woman and girl largely go unreported due to a lack of diplomacy or to journalist be unable to access the region would the minister or a member of her team be prepared to meet those whose family be still strand in the region and be subject to what be essentially the ethnic cleansing of the hazara people 
 the hon lady set out some of the shocking issue that we know about indeed daesh claim responsibility for the november attack and we be continue to see these challenge i will happily take back her question to my colleague and i be sure that he will be happy to meet they 
 i call shadow minister catherine west 
 since the summer of when the hope and dream of so many woman and girl in afghanistan be snuff out we have be struggle to get a strategy together for year the uk international partner and afghans themselves fight for a more hopeful future for woman and girl will the minister outline what step be be take with international partner to develop a sustained strategy for work in the region so that we can regain a sense of hope for the afghans leave behind to a future devoid of opportunity 
 the hon lady highlight the frustration that we all feel we be work closely with international partner at a number of level to ensure credible monitoring not only of the violence and threat against religious minority but of the challenge for woman and girl across the piece we co sponsor a human rights council resolution extend the mandate of the un special rapporteur to monitor and report on the human right situation to try to make decision together on how to tackle it 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the uk ’s diplomatic relationship with china 
 the government set out their approach to china in the integrated review refresh last year we must continue to engage with china to work towards open constructive and stable relation to manage disagreement defend our freedom and co operate where our interest align the foreign secretary speak with china ’s foreign minister wang yi on   december   in pursuit of those objective 
 the result of economic modelling from the rhodium group the rand corporation and early this month bloomberg on the impact on global gdp of either an economic blockade by china on taiwan or a full scale invasion be horrify be i right that the government have do their own economic modelling for both those scenario if so will the minister publish it 
 the hon gentleman highlight the importance of understanding and planning for such economic coercion this be an area of policy that sit within my portfolio in the fcdo across government we currently have a lot of focus on think about how we can build resilience in uk interest and support partner 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the government be pursue vital british national interest priority we be support ukraine and the prime minster have announce a further package of military support we support israel ’s right to self defence and be work towards a sustainable ceasefire and tackle the   humanitarian crisis in gaza we continue strongly to support freedom of navigation on the high sea and to seek to make progress on sudan we be implement the international development white paper which have be well receive around the world i continue to deputise for the foreign secretary in this house and regularly seek to keep the house update 
 the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food michael fakhri say at the weekend that more than people in gaza be face inevitable famine now that the government have opt to halt funding to the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees how do they intend to ensure that the urgently need humanitarian aid as call for in the international court of justice ruling last week and which be central to the ruling will continue to be deliver to the innocent man woman and child in gaza who must have a right to food 
 as i set out the government ’s high immediate priority be to ensure that aid and humanitarian support get into gaza we be relentlessly pursue that objective i have set out where we be on unrwa but there be no immediate effect on the food that it seek to deliver in gaza today 
 i understand that my noble friend the foreign secretary will shortly be visit india our friend and key ally in the region will the minister set out what the foreign secretary will be aim to achieve particularly at a time when we be negotiate a free trade deal and building on the co operation we already have 
 although i can not comment in detail on future ministerial plan i assure my hon friend that the uk government have a broad and deep partnership with the government of india the foreign secretary have ambition to far strengthen that relationship through trade and wide people to people relationship in defence science and technology on   november in his bilateral meeting the foreign secretary discuss some of these issue with external affairs minister jaishankar 
 i call the shadow minister

 tackle this be britain ’s central aim the aim be to get humanitarian aid into gaza but also to ensure that there be a plan on the west bank to take forward a political initiative everything that we be do be bent on try to get the aid that be in the region through the narrow entrance into gaza we will continue to do that 
 the minister have say several time in the last few day that the government ’s decision to suspend funding for unrwa should not affect that agency ’s ability to deliver immediate aid in the region if it transpire in the day and week ahead that the opposite be the case and the agency be be compromise will the government immediately review their decision 
 yesterday i speak to the head of unrwa philippe lazzarini i make the point that it be essential that his review which of course he be not conduct the un be conduct it be complete as fast as possible for the reason the hon gentleman set out i be reasonably confident that it can be conduct within the next month and the british government be watch this carefully 
 will the minister confirm whether the government have undertake any further military action in yemen since   january if so will he clarify whether the government ’s long term plan include commit to sustained military action in of the poor country of the world

 we work closely with thailand and our official in the country lead by our ambassador do a great deal of work around these difficult issue when they arise i have pick up some of the consular case myself if there be specific issue that the hon gentleman wish to raise i be happy to meet he to discuss they 
 i have and year old constituent british citizen who be stick in the israeli fire zone in southern lebanon the foreign office be urge they to return to the uk but as their mother be not a british citizen the home office be prevent that will the minister help i to persuade the home office to relent on this issue 
 i be happy to look at the case that the hon gentleman raise immediately after question time if that be convenient to he the foreign secretary be in the region today not far away from the country that the hon gentleman mention and i be sure that we will be able to advance the talk that be go on 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport if she will make a statement on the propose sale of the telegraph media group to redbird imi 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for table the urgent question for the time in as many day this be a media focus day for i as i will take the media bill through its remain stage straight after the urgent question so forgive i if have make i insufficiently prepared for the other or vice versa 
 i be in the frustrating circumstance that i can say only what be publicly know and nothing of the specific in answer to question about the ownership of the telegraph media group which contain of the world ’s great newspaper the sunday telegraph and the daily telegraph and in the spectator the old survive weekly magazine in the world 
 as hon member will be aware my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport have issue a public interest intervention notice in respect of the anticipated acquisition of the group by rb investco ltd far to the notice issue in november in respect of the redbird imi medium joint venture which remain in force she be lead this process and examine it in great detail and with great care but it be a quasi judicial process involve the competition and markets authority which look at jurisdictional and competition matter and ofcom which will be report to she on public interest consideration in relation to the medium expressly accurate presentation of the news and free expression of opinion both report will be return on   march 
 my right hon and learn friend as a very assiduous and diligent kc be make sure that i as media minister be absolutely exclude from the process because that be what it demand i be not permit to know about the scrutiny that be under way or to interfere with it she be also not permit to take into account any political or presentational concern in her deliberation and we would not wish to cause there to be any chink of light here that would leave the process open to judicial review that leave i in an unenviable position i face understandable expert probe by hon member to whom i can offer no answer beyond what be in the public domain however this urgent question be as much an opportunity for hon member to make their concern clear and their view know as it be an opportunity for i to answer they so i say be hear loud and clear 
 straight after this urgent question i will take the media bill through its remain stage and make the case for that legislation in broad term i will argue that a free medium not interfere with by government or indeed government able to articulate and reflect a broad range of view free to speak and create and able to project to the world what democracy a plurality of view and debate truly mean be something important that we should value in many respect it underpin   what we mean by a free society of course we all know that it be something that we repeat automaton like in a way that risk give rise to complacency however as i watch the action of authoritarian state in these time of turbulence as i see western democracy in a knot of angst over our value and as i see our population question from the safety of these shore whether our value still matter i be remind of the need to make that case again and again 
 i can not speak to the specific media ownership question i know hon member will understand that and will help i keep within the tramline but i can speak about medium freedom the need for medium to be separate from political and government interference the importance of a british voice domestically and internationally and the pride we can feel in medium institution such as those in the telegraph media group some of which date back century and drive change in this nation as profound as the great reform act to this day those who write for those institution ask question of we all with a rare inquisitiveness and preoccupation with truth interruption i shall finish shortly i will be hear 
 order please do not tell i what you be go to do i be in charge of the time you be way over and i expect you now to finish quickly 
 i apologise mr speaker for over speaking i will listen to the point make in the broad of term and i suspect that i may agree with many of they 
 thank you for grant this important urgent question mr speaker the minister hit the nail on the head when she say that this be about freedom from government interference although it be quite something for we to start this urgent question know that we will get no answer to any of our question we have a proud tradition of a fiercely independent press in our country a press who hold we to account in this place and shine a light on misbehaviour and misdoing here and abroad yet a paper of record the daily telegraph and the spectator the long run magazine in the world and my personal podcast of choice will be purchase by a foreign state the concern here be about not foreign ownership but foreign state ownership in this situation we can not separate sheikh and state those be our concern 
 more broadly i worry that we have allow our medium critical national infrastructure for our democracy to fall between the crack our defend democracy taskforce look only at electoral concern and the national security and investment act deal with sector none of which be the medium we therefore have no protection against this sort of situation 
 i have question that i hope the minister will at least attempt to answer i appreciate the restriction that be in place be there any example from around the world of a nation with differ medium value to put it politely acquire the newspaper of another country secondly will the government commit to a national security investigation of these purchase thirdly do the government not recognise that their intervention in the united arab emirates purchase of vodafone set a precedent allow they to intervene in this case finally will they look either to extend the   defend democracy taskforce or those sector to ensure that we can protect our medium we be deal with something that will make we vulnerable not for or year but for the rest of our life and we can not afford for our medium to be undermine 
 i thank my hon friend for her question as she be aware a public interest intervention notice have be issue in this case which mean that i be not able to speak to a number of the point that will likely be raise however power under the enterprise act allow we to look into acquisition of this nature and to examine issue of medium freedom of expression we also have power under the national security act the cabinet office have a role there that will allow the culture secretary to look at some of the question that my hon friend raise 
 there will now be an investigation by not only the competition and markets authority but ofcom which will look into all these question in great detail that will allow the secretary of state to make a judgment on what action she take next there may potentially be a long investigation after which she could be offer particular remedy or could prevent a transaction however at this stage i can not speculate on what action she be likely to take 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i be frustrate with the minister i want to thank she for her answer but frankly it be not an answer   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs ask perfectly reasonable question which do not go into the specific and zoom out to the general yet we still have no answer a strong and independent free press be a cornerstone of democracy we have a long history of that in the uk the spectator be the old magazine in the world it be the responsibility of government regardless of their political persuasion or the newspaper under discussion to safeguard the freedom to scrutinise to expose wrongdoing and to speak truth to power 
 we on these benches recognise the legitimate public interest concern raise over the propose acquisition of the telegraph media group include about the accurate presentation of news free expression of opinion in newspaper and the competition issue i welcome the fact that the government have ask further question and i await the conclusion of the investigation by the competition and markets authority and ofcom in full but the telegraph have be up for sale for month the secretary of state issue her public interest intervention notice on   november this process be ongoing employee at the telegraph and the spectator have be leave in limbo and senior journalist have express significant concern 
 can the minister tell the house why the secretary of state have grant an extension to the deadline by which she expect to receive report from ofcom and the cma in relation to the piin i be sure she can not but i be just go to ask anyway can the minister tell the house this be a general so maybe she can whether in the light of the propose sale she have any plan to review the exist rule on media ownership have she or the secretary of state consider that or have any conversation with colleague about it 
 with a general election approach in a significant year for democracy across the world and with record number of people go to the poll the freedom of the press have never be more important now be not the time for the government to have no answer or to be asleep at the wheel 
 i thank the hon lady for her rather hyperbolic intervention we be have a debate because public interest intervention notice have be issue the government take their power in this respect seriously and the competition and markets authority and ofcom will be give the space and time to look into all these issue in detail those notice be issue because the secretary of state take the issue of medium freedom and the ownership of important british medium institution extremely seriously 
 i therefore ask the hon lady to help we those investigation be under way we must not prejudice they and must ensure they be watertight the important question of media ownership be something that all member of this house care about it would be regrettable if i be to say anything in this chamber that should prejudice that process so i say again to the hon lady that action have be take it be something the government take seriously and i ask she to let the process take its course 
 it be hugely new for we to be tell that we will not get our question answer at the dispatch box we be use to that happen anyway but it be good to be tell that it be a waste of our time be here in the place 
 to press on with not be answer i say to the minister that i and other across all party write a letter to her department specify that we be all oppose to this potential takeover we make it clear that we be not opposed to it because we dislike that particular government although i have to say that that may well be a feature rather we would oppose it if the french government wish to buy the newspaper or even if this government decide they would control they we would oppose that on the basis that it would trample right across the idea of freedom of the press 
 follow the notice that have go to the cma i simply ask the minister whether she would ask the secretary of state to create a new piin on the basis that redbird imi have twice disrupt the government ’s effort to properly scrutinise the purchase particularly with the idea of debt be load into the purchase we need a far detailed investigation i would be grateful if the minister do that because this could easily turn into a disaster for this government 
 i do not say i would give no answer i say i would be able to give general answer and my right hon friend will understand why these be very precise process that must be keep watertight and i would not want to do anything to prejudice they or the secretary of state ’s ability to act in a way that be in the interest of this country and the medium this be not a waste of time it be an opportunity for this house to make its voice and opinion know on what be a controversial issue of great public interest an issue that we as a government be very interested in 
 my right hon friend also make the important point that his concern be not about the government in this particular case but about government ownership in principle it be something i appreciate and understand and i be sure it will be in the secretary of state ’s mind 
 when host cop28 sultan al jaber say that there be no science behind the climate change emergency the sultan be head of the uae medium council and influential in the telegraph takeover i work for many year as a journalist i understand that democracy require plurality in the medium landscape sadly in the uk the vast majority of title be already skewed to the right in scotland as we know half the population support independence but only title support that position we do not want the situation worsen i be in favour of a free diverse and vibrant press ecosystem and not in favour of a newspaper be own as a loss make public relation arm of a foreign state through access to our daily news cycle do the minister agree that allow the uae to take over the telegraph would be unhealthy in principle for our democracy 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise an issue of principle which i perfectly understand as something that i speak about in relation to the bbc and how it must have editorial independence from the government as a principle i would be concern about government ownership of any medium institution but as he will be aware i can speak only of principle 
 when the wonderful taylor swift discover that her back catalogue have be buy by a purchaser of whom she disapprove she begin to render it worthless by re record all her previous hit be that an example that journalist at the spectator and the telegraph might do well to follow 
 i thank my right hon friend for his mischievous suggestion i could not possibly comment on it but i be sure that it have be hear 
 i be reel from the comparison of telegraph hack with taylor swift if the minister can not answer question maybe we could use this as an exercise in issue some concern the national union of journalists concern be obviously about job but they be also about future editorial independence it behove the minister and the government to look at what sanction could be use in future if agreement be reach but not keep to murdoch be the good example of that in addition i wonder whether it be time as my hon friend   the member for bristol west thangam debbonaire   say for a proper review of medium ownership 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for speak on behalf of the nuj and for raise what this mean for medium plurality and the ability of journalist to hold we here to account i agree on those generality but i be afraid i can not say anything more about the specific of this case as he will be aware once the process be over i be sure there will be question to go back to about how we well look into how our medium   be own 
 for what it be worth the proposal be say to enhance the competitive landscape not diminish it do the minister agree that this sort of decision must be make accord to legal principle not politic it be not appropriate to consider political posturing from the left or right when decide this important matter which be part of the secretary of state ’s quasi judicial function 
 my right hon and learn friend be right to say that the secretary of state will be under specific obligation to consider this matter without politic both the cma and ofcom will look at this carefully from a regulatory point of view we as politician should also have a right to some broad view about media ownership as we consider those question the secretary of state be the departmental owner of culture medium and sport and will have some consideration about how to ensure a dynamic medium landscape i be sure that she will carefully apply her legal brain to the application of those principle 
 i think the house see i for what i be which be a shy and retire member for year i have be tease in the telegraph at the hand of mr alan cochrane and more recently in the spectator but that be democracy it be the nature of the beast and it be free speech i agree with   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   that there be a national security implication i think that the mood of the house be that this be simply not on we all agree on that the message should be pass back to the secretary of state and to the government that we will not wear this 
 i hope the hon gentleman do not mind i say so but i believe that when i last see he he be on his way to a spectator burns night party so i hope the relationship be warm and cordial now with no unkindness towards he from that magazine as i say at the outset this be a useful exercise in make the view of this house know on this matter it be an important opportunity for member to have their say and i hope that they will be hear 
 i must say i be amuse by the minister ’s opening remark because i can not recall any judicial review ever be trigger by statement in parliament not once however give that she want a statement not a question in the event that the cma and ofcom report find conditionally in favour in any way she must not take the murdoch ownership of the times as an example because since the sacking of its editor that have be a failure not a success 
 as my right hon friend will be aware the decision make process be not mine i will not be the person to make a judgment call on this matter the cma and ofcom have until   march   to issue their initial report at that stage undertaking can be accept or a stage can be open i be sure that all these question will be in the secretary of state ’s mind as she make that judgment 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer which be always very helpful and we appreciate that can she outline if measure can   and will be put in place to secure editorial freedom in the long term we look to a nation with completely different ideal but which have capacity to shape the medium narrative and public information how can we make sure that we retain trust 
 as the hon gentleman will be aware a public notice have be issue on this matter ofcom will look expressly at accurate presentation of the news and free expression of opinion when it make its report and judgment know i hope that will give he some assurance about how the medium consideration will be look at not just the competition aspect 
 i fully understand the limitation on what my hon friend can say have cover for she until a few week ago as medium minister i be give no inside information about this matter either however she will be aware that it be now over year since the ofcom report to the secretary of state that say that the internet have transform the way that news be provide and consume and that there will need to be a fundamental review of the medium ownership regime do she agree with that and can she say whether the government will undertake that review 
 i thank my right hon friend for his expert cover for i we discuss that subject in our handover when he tell i that there be no information that he could share because he be assiduous in his role and make sure that he be not involve in area that he should not be he ask about future ownership question he will be aware that we be debate the medium bill after this urgent question we have look at some issue in relation to medium in particular the change medium landscape and how the internet have change it that have not cover all the issue that will be raise by this acquisition but i be sure that once that the media bill have complete all its stage we will be able to look afresh at the other hole in the landscape 
 i appreciate that there be a limit to what the minister can say about the potential sale of the daily telegraph to owner back by the uae but be there any lesson for medium freedom that the government might learn from the creation of university branch campus in the uae and what that have mean for freedom of speech 
 i be afraid that be not a subject about which i know a great deal i shall happily look into it and see whether there be any implication for our medium landscape but i can not comment in relation to this specific acquisition 
 do the minister agree that the fact that we be in this position show that clarity be need about media ownership rule we need a presumption against sovereign foreign state acquire strategic uk medium asset to further their influence just as there should be against acquisition by a foreign oligarch who might not have a commitment to the medium we need some certainty about how and where such an intervention can be make and not purely on competition ground 
 that point have be raise by a number of hon member we have tool for these kind of acquisition as can be see in the public interest intervention   notice that we have impose in this case i reassure member that we be not totally naked on this question there be tool under the enterprise act that allow we to look into it i be sure that once the process be over we will be able to look back and say whether any further action or intervention be require 
 as owner expect to have influence over editor and the editorial line why do we not have a policy of rule out all government ownership of such organisation which would make it much simple 
 i thank my right hon friend for make that simple point it be that i be sure will be consider once this case have pass 
 be a media outlet in an authoritarian state or indeed any other state to be threaten with foreign ownership would the minister responsible be as scrupulous in her answer as my hon friend have so properly be with we today 
 perhaps not 
 i be sure that many member be like i concern about foreign ownership of our institution and business our national resilience strategic independence and critical infrastructure as well as our medium be vital to quote the well know album how do we ensure that we do not end up sell england by the pound 
 as i have say in answer to similar question we have power to look into some of those investment and ownership question and they do not relate just to the medium we now have much broad national security and investment power in relation to question such as these and to other area in which there be a critical national interest in the ownership of a particular asset it would be wrong for member to leave the chamber with the belief that there be no such power and that all these acquisition can go ahead regardless of security and other implication 
 the minister be absolutely right ofcom can apply a test which it already apply to broadcast licence do she agree that give the change in the medium landscape that should be roll over to news website and publisher that have significant scale 
 we be look at how we regulate online content alongside standard broadcasting and other medium output outcome of the mid term review be that some of the bbc ’s online material will be consider in the same way as its other output those be all question that the department be look into to ensure that medium regulation and legislation be fit for what be a rapidly change medium landscape 
 it be clear that pay off the debt mean that redbird imi have control over the title indeed it have already transfer the ownership of that debt to a new uk entity should not the secretary of state also issue a piin on the debt to ensure that she retain control of the situation 
 my hon friend will be aware that this be the such notice to have be issue i be not able to speculate on or speak about any other action that the secretary of state might be minded to take i know that he will understand that he will know that the broad principle of concern to he about which he have write so eloquently and powerfully in recent week and month be also close to my heart 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision about the training of teacher in relation to the early identification of autism and for connected purpose 
 for those with autism the stat be stark few than half of autistic child say that they be happy in school of young autistic people say that their teacher do not understand their need only achieve grade or above in english and math gcse compare with for all pupil and on top of that autistic child be twice as likely to be exclude from school than their peer 
 it do not get well in adulthood just of autistic people be in full or part time employment and those in work be pay a less than their peer that be not right especially when the potential of autistic child with proper support should not be underestimate autistic people have strong attention to detail creative talent mathematical and technical ability and expertise in niche area those of we who know autistic child know that they be honest and loyal 
 we all know that an early diagnosis help to identify what an individual child need and what adjustment need to be put in place so that their strength can be maximise it provide a positive pathway instead of a negative it mean that those with autism be more likely to find work it help to combat mental health issue which affect of those with special educational need and disability and cost the uk economy £ 
 however of child wait long than the nhs week deadline and wait more than month that backlog mean that a quarter of child with autism will not be diagnose while in school in norfolk between and october under-18s be diagnose with autism many wait long than month for their diagnosis some even wait year and wait year how many more of the child in norfolk will not be assess at all 
 the question be why do a diagnosis not happen until much later unfortunately there be often a wait and see attitude however not only be a delay in diagnosis extremely damaging for a child who be autistic but it be unnecessary condition such as autism have marker from month old as it become obvious through the way child learn move or pay attention exist weakness in the send system which be magnify by the pandemic also make it difficult for people with autism to get a diagnosis there be inconsistency in how send be identify a lack of join up thinking on care and a lack of clarity regard accountability and responsibility in organisation that lead to delay in an already weak system make the fight that many parent undertake to have their child assess even hard 
 over a year ago in this chamber i mention hayley turner a constituent who come to i as she be have difficulty get the right support for her son rocky i be ask about early year psychologist in education   question but it be partly through conversation with hayley that the inspiration for this bill take flight so i would briefly like to share her story 
 rocky be year old when his parent notice that he be develop a little differently it be when he start school age that it become clear that mainstream education be not the right fit and that those teach he be not train to teach child with neurodiverse condition that situation be very distressing for he and for hayley who have to fight to be hear she go to tribunal and spend many hour put together all the necessary paperwork to show that rocky need to be place in specialist education it be an unnecessary distraction that take hayley away from be the mum she need to be for both her child which make everyday family life hard rocky be just of thousand of child whose parent be fight today for their child to have an adequate education indeed the government ’s own send statistic show that of parent win on appeal once they get to tribunal 
 those child be not difficult or troublesome hayley say something very poignant 
 autistic child whilst in mainstream school be easily misunderstood they be just innocent child try to survive in an environment that be not design for they they have to fail before they be adequately support and that ’s not how a child should start their education 
 rocky ’s story be eventually a success story but it be his story along with other conversation i have have that lead i to introduce the bill today it be important to impress on all member of the house that autistic child will not grow out of it they will need extra help and target treatment to reduce the chance of negative consequence and financial burden in later life however as it stand just of primary school teacher have more than half a day ’s training in autism such a small number for secondary school that figure drop to just send be see as a specialist area a bolt on not a build in with teacher training not include how to ensure that teacher can identify send marker that need to change autistic pupil routinely identify autism training for teacher as the single big change that would improve their experience of school that can only happen if all teacher be train in send 
 it be for those reason that i introduce my minute rule bill the autism early identification bill which will deliver support to increase autism assessment reduce diagnosis waiting time and introduce mandatory autism training for all teacher the bill will provide a solid base through which all teacher will learn about early identification the special educational need code of practice the pattern and sequence of child development what need to be do if a child have communication difficulty and understanding and deal with difficult behaviour it will mean that if milestone be not meet help can be put in place that few child will struggle in school and that they will no long be label difficult or disruptive through a bill that ensure that   all teaching staff can support autistic pupil well school will in turn become more inclusive place where everyone staff pupil and parent be truly value and feel a sense of belong 
 i be encourage by the openness of this government to change in the system it be positive that the government announce as far back as the last queen ’s speech that every child will get the education they deserve and that there be vision ethos and strategic direction in our education system i be also encourage by the publication of the send and alternative provision improvement plan in which the government state that they 
 will explore opportunity to build teacher expertise through a review of the initial teacher training itt core content framework and early career framework 
 i be encourage by the secretary of state ’s comment at the dispatch box yesterday and by a letter from the minister last july that say that 
 all initial teacher training course must be design so that trainee teacher can demonstrate a clear understanding of the need of all pupil include those with send 
 and that 
 all teacher be teacher of send 
 all those objective be encapsulate in the bill but it would go far have a special educational need co ordinator in school be not enough and only have a few provider of training be not enough the bill will ensure that all autistic child receive the support they need so that they can flourish and that autistic and send pupil be not a forget piece of the puzzle but an integral part of the education system it will help the government achieve their objective in this area the bill be support by the sector which be keen to work with the government on the fine detail regard what training be need and how it should be roll out as well as to work on technology to make the system around education health and care plan a lot easy and ensure that support can be easily review so that it continue to suit the young person ’s need 
 as i wrap up i ask the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston   to please be bold in this area please support we and use the essence of my bill to make sure that the reform really do make autistic child ’s live well i thank fullspektrum keystone consulting and ambitious about autism as well as my constituent hayley turner and everyone else who have support i so much in introduce this bill
