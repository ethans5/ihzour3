 when people hear the word cannock chase they naturally think of the stunning forest that be the constituency ’s namesake while make their speech many new member have claim their constituency as the most beautiful in the land however i have to point out that my constituency be the only in england that   share its name with an area of outstanding natural beauty fact be fact but the chase be not just a place with serene walk and herd of fallow deer although we have plenty of both it be also a place of industry sport and recreation the chase be still a work forest manage by forestry england which produce around tonne of sustainable timber every year 
 the chase be arguably most famous as a national destination for mountain biker as someone who could barely stay upright on fresh tarmac the conversation i have have about mountain biking have probably be the steep learning curve i have be on since the general election but i look forward to work with biker and forestry england to build on the legacy of the commonwealth game and make sure that unauthorised trail do not spoil the natural beauty of the forest 
 the chase be a vibrant place with a huge range of activity include the high rope and free fall of go ape at birches valley i place on record an open invitation to   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey who month on from the general election campaign must be suffer from zipline withdrawal the iron age hill fort of castle ring and the chase ’s former status as a royal hunting forest attest to its rich year history more recently soldier be train on the chase include j.r.r. tolkien who be station there in and who may have draw from it inspiration for the great forest in his legendary book

 decide what to say in a maiden speech lead we to reflect on what bring we to this extraordinary place and what we hope to achieve for the people who send we here for i personally it be momentous to be stand here because year ago i be a painfully shy young boy in the corner of the playground with my head bury in a book try as hard as i could to be invisible to the bully who torment i for a sexuality that at that age i do not yet understand today i stand here proudly as a member of this house if i achieve just thing in my new job i hope it be to show young people who be in the position that i be in that your bully do not define you nor do they limit what you go on to achieve i also hope to make my mark in other way alongside my incredible husband i be an adoptive parent to a beautiful year old daughter and foster carer to an equally beautiful week old baby boy so adoption permanence and our care leaver be all passion of mine 
 have be a councillor in my constituency for over year i be and will always be a fierce advocate for local council and the tangible difference that they make to our community give that my constituency have the high proportion of people who commute by car in the whole of england i know that a priority must be to fix the pothole i be delighted that the government be commit to both devolution and decent road as a proud member of the co operative party i be always keen to promote democratic ownership community in rural and coalfield area know more than most the value of club together and give everyone a stake in the place and service that they rely on 
 it be safe to say that i have lot on my to do list which be hardly groundbreake for an mp but i must finish by thank the people who have enable i to serve my home of cannock chase in this house if it take a village to raise a child it take a whole town to win an election campaign i thank the cannock chase labour party and all the volunteer who contribute to our record break result i thank my incredible family many of whom be in the gallery they have help i to overcome so much in my life and they have put up with a lot i be sure that many member family can relate to that the final thank go of course to the people of cannock chase for give i the opportunity to fight for our town and village i will go on as i have start repay that trust with action and hard work for as long as they keep i here

 this morning the nation fall silent to pay tribute to all those who have serve and continue to serve in our armed force and those who have make the ultimate sacrifice today we honour and remember they i quote the word inscribe on lutyens beautiful arch of remembrance in leicester from the hymn o valiant hearts 
 all they hop for all they have they give to save mankind themselves they scorn to save 
 some child be grow up in poverty—700,000 more than in that be why the work of our cross government child poverty taskforce be so urgent and why we will use all lever available to increase family income reduce family cost and give every child the good start in life 
 i have have the privilege of assist the brilliant volunteer at the make lunch organisation in rugby which provide holiday lunch club with play activity for entire family include those with complex need last summer it feed family last christmas it buy slow cooker for family and this christmas it be offer hamper they treat family with dignity as with food bank be it not an indictment of the record of the last government that such charitable support be need in the place 
 make lunch sound like an absolutely brilliant charity and i ask my hon friend to pass on our great thank for its fantastic work that work be urgent because the child poverty action group estimate that a quarter of child in my hon friend ’s constituency be grow up poor our child poverty strategy will be publish in the spring but we will not wait to act that be why the budget announce a new fair repayment rate to slash universal credit deduction and give of the poor household £ on average a year lift thousand of child out of poverty 
 previous labour government have tackle not only poverty but its root cause can my right hon friend outline how the child poverty taskforce will identify and tackle the root cause of poverty in my constituency and across the uk to ensure a permanent end to child poverty 
 i be sure that like i my hon friend think that it be unacceptable that an estimate in child in her constituency be grow up poor we have take immediate action to help the poor family in scotland through our fair repayment rate which will benefit household in scotland we be tackle the root cause of poverty with our reform to make work pay tackle exploitative hour contract and create more good quality job in every part of the country 
 child poverty be a scourge in british society and i be grateful that the secretary of state be bring forward a child poverty strategy have she decide how to measure child poverty may i warn she against use the much discredited relative measure which as we know show poverty decrease during time of economic decline and increase during time of economic growth i implore she to use an absolute measure which have a much well record of show deprivation and long term increase and improvement in living standard 
 i be afraid i will disappoint the hon gentleman we will look at relative poverty after housing cost but we will go far and look to alleviate the very deep poverty it be appal that hundred of thousand of family be force to rely on food bank something that i know only too well from my time chair feeding leicester we will look at relative poverty deep poverty and what it will take to give every child the very good start in life by bring together support from public service charity and other group that be the way to bring down poverty and make the change sustainable 
 northern ireland have some of the high child poverty figure in the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland i be sure that the secretary of state want to help we have have a increase in food bank usage in my constituency in the past month which be an incredible indication will she kindly tell i what discussion she have have with her counterpart in the northern ireland assembly on what more can be do to help

 of my constituent in receipt of pip be sight impair deaf blind register and can not use a phone or fill out form can the minister tell i why pip reassessment be be schedule for people with incurable disability and terminal illness 
 the hon gentleman raise a very fair point it be of course important that we keep the award under review because sometimes they go up as well as down and we want to ensure that the support be provide be appropriate for the claimant we also need to ensure that the process be accessible i agree with he about that help can be provide to manage the assessment process if he would like to send i more detail about his constituent i would be glad to see what we can do to help 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 yesterday it be report in the sunday paper that a blind woman with additional complex need have her pip assessment over the phone which be approve but be then send a letter to confirm that the charity sense say that over half the people it survey feel humiliate by the process i know my right hon friend be very keen to get this right so will he expand a little more on the type of thing the department be change 
 before the minister reply may i ask members to look at the chair as party when they be ask or answer question i be be cut out those be not my rule but those of the house on how we should address each other so if anybody have a problem please have a word with the clerks 
 my hon friend raise a very important point indeed she and i work on an excellent select committee report on health assessment for benefit which provide some very important and valuable recommendation to the department we will continue to look at this issue i be not familiar with the case that she refer to but i will dig out the detail clearly it be vital that the process should be accessible to people with sight impairment or any other impairment i completely agree with she 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the number of young people out of work education and training 
 the legacy we inherit be almost young people not in education employment or training nearly in with all the long term consequence we know that can bring for their future earning job prospect and health that be why our new youth guarantee will ensure that every young person be earn or learning which be well for they well for the economy and well for our country as a whole 
 the dwp have describe peterborough as a national youth unemployment hotspot in september the youth claimant count be run at nearly double the national average place like peterborough college through its jobsmart provision be already pull together a coalition to respond to that challenge i welcome the government ’s youth guarantee and get britain working plan to ensure that young people in place like peterborough be give the opportunity to earn or learn will the secretary of state please confirm a timetable for the publication of the white paper 
 the get britain working white paper will be publish imminently back by £ of investment announce by the chancellor in the budget i look forward very much to talk to my hon friend and the organisation that be work so hard locally because i believe that the man or even woman in whitehall can never know what be good in peterborough leicester or leeds 
 a small business in my constituency to which i have speak over the last few week have raise concern about the impact of the national insurance rise in the budget on in particular those in lower pay work who in many case be young people start their job what impact do the government think that those rise will have on young people and youth unemployment 
 just last week i visit a very large employer in my constituency tesco and see the fantastic work that it be do with the king ’s trust to ensure that more people get into work and stay in work it be determined to work with we and our local school and employment and other provider because they know that rather than write off nearly a young people which lead to the situation that we inherit this new government have a plan to get people into work enable they to get on in work and ensure that every young person have the chance in life that he or she deserve 
 i call the new shadow secretary of state and welcome she to her post 
 may i say how nice it be to be sit opposite the right hon lady again albeit regrettably have swap place with she i enjoy our exchange on social care during the last parliament and appreciate our constructive conversation during the pandemic although give how well she know the care brief i suspect that she be gutte as i be to see the incoming government abandon the care cap and scrap more than £ of funding for social care training the consistent feedback from jobcentre be that the big barrier to young   people take up job opportunity in social care be lack of career progression hence our reform to create a career path for care worker and investment in training have the right hon lady speak to her counterpart in the department of health and social care about the impact of those social care cut on her ambition to get more young people work or learn 
 i too welcome the hon lady to her post as she have say while we will always have our political difference we have also work closely and constructively on issue that matter across the house such as the terrible problem face social care during the pandemic i will continue that work and i hope that the hon lady will as well in her new role 
 the hon lady ask about the impact of what be happen in social care on people ’s opportunity and chance to learn i have already have many discussion with among other member of integrate care board and they be passionate about the opportunity that exist to get more people into work and enable they to get on in their work include job in social care join up work between the department of health and social care and the department for work and pensions will be at the heart of our plan to get britain work because unlike some opposition members we do not find it acceptable for people to be lock out of the workforce owe to long term sickness we have a proper plan to get britain work and grow again 
 the right hon lady will know that under the conservative government youth unemployment fall by and that we be tackle inactivity with our workwell programme help people to stay in work or return to work which i be delighted to see the right hon lady continue unfortunately however as a result of her government ’s budget and employment rights bill business will slash the number of their employee moreover the government have just break another promise and hike up university fee what advice would the right hon lady give a young person who be currently out of work and education and must choose between bad job prospect and more expensive university degree thank to her government ’s choice 
 the hon lady ’s party leave nearly a young people not in education employment or training and almost a record number of people—2.8 out of work owe to long term sickness they fail to introduce reform to join up work health and skill properly and they have not learn from those mistake i be proud that this government be invest an extra £ to get britain work again give people the opportunity that they need to work and build a well life 
 what step she be take to increase uptake of pension credit in winter 
 what step her department be take to help increase uptake of pension credit 
 what step she be take to increase uptake of pension credit in winter 
 we have launch the next phase of our pension credit campaign on radio tv and print medium and the government have write to pensioner on housing benefit who may be eligible but be not currently claim pension credit after less than month in government we be bring forward the merger of housing benefit and pension credit which the conservatives announce year ago but fail to deliver 
 under the previous conservative government many eligible pensioner in sunderland central do not receive the pension credit that they be due when i speak to organisation such as age uk sunderland they tell i that that be often because people do not know how and whether to claim how many pensioner be now take up pension credit thank to the action take by this government 
 we have see a increase in pension credit claim since late july with over pension credit claim up to mid september we know that many local authority and indeed member of this house include i last thursday be help pensioner on low income to ascertain whether they be due pension credit 
 there will be people who be eligible for pension credit live in very remote area where connectivity be less than great it be an appalling thought that they might miss out on what they be due may i suggest to the department that the way to reach out to those people might be through a database follow by a mailshot 
 in addition to merge housing benefit and pension credit which will help some of the people whom the hon gentleman have in mind the secretary of state and i have ask the department to look at what can be do to make the application form simple the department will report back to we by the end of the month and we will update the house in due course 
 i welcome the government ’s campaign to get people to sign up for pension credit and i urge every pensioner in gower to sign up and attend my pension credit event on   november do the minister agree that we should highlight the fact that pensioner who go over the threshold could still be eligible because they receive another benefit such as attendance allowance or because high housing cost be take into account when apply 
 yes indeed assess somebody for pension credit be a complex procedure so we urge all those on low income to check whether they be eligible we have see an increase in the number of people apply online with the help of local authority members of parliament and charity and we urge everybody who think that they might have an eligible family member to encourage their love one to apply 
 temperature be set to drop to across scotland by next weekend many pensioner be scared to put on their heating with the big issue report a month delay in claim for pension credit can the minister let we know what she be do to ensure that those claim be process as quickly as possible so that people can get the money into their pocket 
 i thank the hon lady for her question we want people who be eligible to get support and we have redeploy staff to process those claim i can assure she that that be something that we be focus on 
 we come to the shadow minister 
 the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment from household include of disabled pensioner be a huge change as be use pension credit to distribute the benefit to the minority of people who will still get it yet the government have rush this change through without give their own statutory advisory committee the chance to properly scrutinise it minister have not even respond to the chair of the committee who write to they several week ago with suggestion on how to mitigate the effect of the policy on top of that they have fail to provide a full impact assessment to show what the effect on poverty would be will they finally produce a full impact assessment of this policy and when will the minister respond to the chair of the advisory committee 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place in answer to his question we have publish an equality analysis which he can find on the government ’s website owe to the legislation we do not have to produce an impact assessment but there be an equality analysis i urge he to have a look at that all i would say to he be that the new leader of the opposition argue in that winter fuel payment should be mean test i wonder how the hon gentleman might mean test the winter fuel payment if he have the chance 
 the minister mention the equality assessment that be a high level equality assessment that be only drag out of the government in response to a freedom of information request the fact be that they be avoid accountability for this policy and avoid scrutiny by the house the government be say that the impact of the cut on the poor pensioner will be mitigate by pension credit and we have hear from the minister about the very small number who be take up pension credit in response to this announcement their own figure predict that fully a of eligible pensioner that be of the poor people in the country will not get pension credit and will not get the winter fuel payment 
 that be what the government be bank on that be how they be make the saving that they predict from this policy by cut benefit to some of the poor people in our country—[interruption the minister shake her head so she might want to put i right do she want all eligible pensioner to claim pension credit interruption the secretary of state say yes if she do want that do she then accept that the government ’s saving from this policy will be completely wipe out 
 yes and no 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson steve darling 
 on armistice day it be important that we as a chamber reflect on the royal british legion and its credit their service campaign this be a campaign to ensure that when benefit be calculate military compensation be disregarded in the light of this will the secretary of state give serious consideration to disregard military compensation when calculate pension credit 
 i associate myself with the hon gentleman ’s comment and those of my right hon friend the secretary of state i will look carefully at what the hon gentleman have suggest and get back to he 
 what step she be take to help reduce level of poverty 
 after year of conservative government adult and child be leave in poverty among other thing £ be recently announce in the budget to support well work so that people can get the dignity of a good job and the security of a proper wage detail will soon be available as the secretary of state mention in our get britain working white paper 
 i thank the minister for that answer and the assurance from the dispatch box that the maximum level of debt repayment from a household ’s universal credit be to be reduce from to each month that be great news for scottish family who could benefit by an average of £ a year much of that debt management be carry out at the dwp centre in stornoway in my constituency and some of the staff there be involve in respond to call nationally that be a good example of job dispersal and their service be high quality and be now involve in reduce poverty i encourage the minister to come and meet the staff there to meet client and to see the operation for herself 
 my hon friend mention the new fair repayment rate which be another crucial part of the budget and a downpayment on the action that we will take on poverty i be fond of an invitation to scotland and i will happily accept that 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the universal credit assessment system 
 the department have adopt an iterative approach update the universal credit system to reflect user need as they develop the new government be commit to review universal credit to make sure that it be do the job we need it to 
 of my constituent spend hour fully awake during an operation that go wrong as doctor battle to save her life obviously this affect her mental health and she be deem unfit for work by her gp and by a clinical psychologist she then go through a half hour telephone assessment for her universal credit health check which deem her fit to work so she do not get universal credit and it be not backdate to the operation do the minister think that that sound right if not will he review the case 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for draw my attention to that what he have describe sound very odd indeed and i will be happy to look at the detail if he will let i see they we be absolutely committed to make sure that universal credit do the job that we need it to include for people in the situation that his constituent have find herself in 
 last week i be make aware of a constituent who be a carer for his wife who experience a stroke in the constituent be a veteran who live with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and be award carer ’s allowance in late last year the dwp begin demand the return of more than £ in allege universal credit overpayment and this april under the previous government the dwp begin take it from his state pension without warn will the minister meet i to discuss this case in more detail so that i can help my constituent 
 as my hon friend will know there have be some very troubling case of carer ’s allowance overpayment i be not sure whether carer ’s allowance be part of the overpayment he describe but i will be very happy to meet he to discuss what have go wrong in this case 
 what step her department be take to increase the support available in jobcentre in broxbourne constituency 
 jobcentre serve the broxbourne constituency and elsewhere will change follow the get britain working white paper which have already be mention this fundamental reform will have part a new public employment service to get more people into work and to help they get on in work a join up work health and skill plan and a guarantee for young people age to 
 the budget have make it even hard for small business in my broxbourne constituency to create job what can the minister do to make sure that jobcentre connect with local business to help those who be look for work to find sustainable employment 
 i thank the minister for his question—[interruption honestly i be still get use to be on this side of the house 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that jobcentre everywhere need to be locally responsive to employer and that we need to provide an excellent service to local   employer if he have further thought on how we can make that work in his constituency i would be very happy to discuss it with he 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential merit of remove the child   limit for universal credit 
 the last labour government dramatically reduce child poverty and we want to repeat their success the child poverty taskforce be explore how to harness all available lever include social security reform and it will publish its strategy next spring 
 the prime minister have say that he want to break down the barrier to opportunity and tackle child poverty he have also say that 
 insecurity be the enemy of opportunity 
 give that by the time the child poverty taskforce report next spring a further child will have be drag into poverty and give the devastating impact that poverty can have on a child ’s education their health and their vulnerability to the criminal justice system why will the minister not do the right thing and scrap the child benefit cap to lift child out of poverty immediately 
 the strategy will be very clear about how we will tackle the scourge of child poverty and the hon lady be absolutely right to highlight the importance of do that labour vote against the child limit but we will not promise change until we know how we be go to pay for it that will be address in the work of the taskforce with the result publish in the spring 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the extension of the household support fund in on low income household 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the extension of the household support fund in on low income household 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the extension of the household support fund in on low income household 
 no specific assessment have be make of the impact of the household support fund on low income household in although we hear routinely from local authority across the country about the impact of the fund in support those who be struggle an evaluation of the iteration of the scheme run from april to   march will be publish shortly explore the benefit of the more than award make during this period 
 i agree that the payment of winter fuel allowance should be mean test because many pensioner who receive the winter fuel allowance simply do not need it however there be pensioner who be not entitle to pension credit who will struggle to heat their home can the minister please confirm the extent to which the household support fund will assist those pensioner in my wolverhampton west constituency 
 the household support fund be intend to support a wide range of household in need include pensioner household there have be no ringfencing of funding for specific group since october mean that local authority have the flexibility to support pensioner who be just above the pension credit threshold in the financial year of household support funding go towards meet energy cost 
 i welcome the government ’s decision to provide more than £ in new funding for the household support fund extend it all the way through next year and to give much more notice to the local authority that deliver it the funding be so important not just to countless vulnerable resident but to great local organisation such as the need project food bank in my constituency how will the department work with local authority to make the most of the notice and to ensure the funding go as far as possible 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as a former local authority leader i know that above all else certainty will allow council to design and deliver sustainable plan for local welfare assistance the government ’s commitment to fund the hsf until march offer that certainty and time to plan with great confidence to that end we will confirm individual allocation for the forthcoming year extension to the hsf as soon as possible and ahead of the scheme begin on   april 
 because the household support fund be devolve to local council there be lot of different example of how the funding be spend so how will the minister ensure that the money from council go to the people who really need it 
 like i my hon friend be a former local authority leader albeit a directly elect mayor and with a far great mandate therefore than i ever enjoy like i he will appreciate the importance of empower local area to respond to local need that say all council must develop delivery plan to show how they be target the fund to support the most vulnerable to ensure that the spirit of the hsf be uphold in help low income household with the cost of essential 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of pensioner poverty 
 the last labour government lift more than pensioner out of poverty and this government remain absolutely committed to support pensioner we know that there be low income pensioner who be not claim pension credit and we urge they to apply this will passport they to receive other benefit too 
 these be extremely worrying time for million of pensioner who simply can not fathom why of the act of this new labour government be to remove their winter fuel payment the minister will be aware that last month the snp scottish government open application for the pension age disability payment which could be worth up to £ a month for pensioner with disability or long term health condition it will be pilot in scotland next year will the minister join i in welcome this initiative and encourage those who be eligible to apply for it 
 it be good to see that the snp government be focus on that issue now because during their year in government we have see increase in pensioner poverty across scotland 
 pensioners in poverty now have just day to apply for the winter fuel payment via the pension credit system will the minister look at extend the deadline so that more people can claim pension credit and get the winter fuel payment 
 i reassure my hon friend that we have redeploy additional staff to process the claim we be work at pace to process they but   december   remain the deadline 
 what step she be take to improve support for carer 
 as a lifelong champion of unpaid family carer i be proud that the labour government in year have give unpaid carer the big ever cash boost to the amount they can earn while still receive carer ’s allowance that mean family carer can earn an extra £ a year and still keep their allowance that be the difference this labour government be make support family who do the most important thing which be care for the people that they love 
 i have speak to many people in my constituency of south derbyshire who be take on care responsibility for love one i know how hard that be and i be so grateful for the job they do but it be often a thankless task i be glad that the government have take action to support people in our community who take on caring responsibility but it be disproportionately woman who do so will the secretary of state outline how the increase in the threshold will benefit woman and allow they great freedom to work 
 my hon friend be right of unpaid carer be woman but woman spend more hour care so they be disproportionately represent when it come    to receive carer ’s allowance this be a small but significant and important step forward it be a signal that the new government understand that as people live for long and care for long we will have to do more to help family balance work and care responsibility that be the truth of family now it be as much about care for our elderly and disabled love one as it be about care for our own wonderful child 
 what estimate her department have make of the number of pensioner eligible for pension credit but not claim it 
 estimate for pensioner who be eligible for but not receive pension credit be publish in early october the estimate show that more than pensioner individual pensioner not household be entitle to pension credit but be not claim it 
 as the minister will know the chancellor ’s cruel decision to tie winter fuel allowance to pension credit despite know that the uptake of pension credit be very low will force thousand of vulnerable pensioner to choose heating or eat this winter with pensioner in wokingham expect to be affect by the cut will she extend the deadline to apply for pension credit and consider pledge further support to increase take up 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my answer to my hon friend   the member for york central rachael maskell the deadline remain   december thank to the government ’s steadfast commitment to the triple lock more than pensioner will see their pension increase by more than in april next year up to £ over this parliament they will be well off by around £ thank to the triple lock low income pensioner can also apply for the warm home discount scheme and thank to the extension of the household support fund local authority can target that support on low income pensioner in the long term the warm home plan will transform home across the country by make they clean and cheap to run 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to reduce level of child poverty 
 as well as put in place breakfast club that mean child be ready to learn and as well as the fair payment rate we have discuss that which will stop family be tip into destitution by debt the ministerial taskforce chair by the work and pensions and education secretaries will publish the child poverty strategy in spring use all available lever across government to bring about an endure reduction in child poverty in this parliament as part of a year strategy for last change 
 we know that the previous government preside over shameful level of child poverty include nearly child who be eligible for free school meal but who be miss out will my hon friend alongside the education secretary urgently look at the proposal by feeding britain for auto enrolment to free school meal as part of the single application process for family claim uc 
 person who have never look the other way when people be face poverty in this country be my hon friend through her innovation she have ensure that household food insecurity be measure properly and i pay tribute to her effort i have listen to what she say about feeding britain and i will take that as an input into the child poverty taskforce i hope that she and feeding britain will meet i to discuss how we can take that forward 
 what step she be take to help support parent who be look for work 
 help parent to have fulfil and sustainable work help our economy and prevent child poverty as we have mention several time the get britain working white paper will rewrite employment policy and set our ambition for an employment rate but we will not get there without parent 
 in recent week i have meet the dwp in bournemouth and advice agency include the citizen advice bureau for bournemouth christchurch and poole advice agency welcome the record increase in carer allowance that be announce in the budget they and in work parent with disabled child have also ask about the transition from child tax credit to universal credit that may be a matter for the get britain working white paper but can the minister say how the government will far support such parent to work and earn and flexibly meet their family need 
 i thank my hon friend for bring this matter to the house and i pay tribute to all those he have work with to understand the challenge that we face he be right that we will take this forward through the get britain working white paper citizens advice be play an important role in support that work and the work of the child poverty taskforce 
 what progress her department have make on the pension review 
 i be lead the government ’s landmark pension investment review which aim to increase pension investment in the uk economy and improve retirement outcome for future pensioner an interim report will be publish soon phase of the review which will focus on pension adequacy will be launch later this year 
 david carson and patricia kennedy constituent of mine in central ayrshire face massively reduce pension payment from their pre-1997 contribution to their hewlett packard pension because current legislation index link contribution from only what assessment have the pension review make so far of the challenge face pension scheme and will the minister meet i to discuss david and patricia ’s case the issue affect some hundred of thousand of people 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that case i would be very happy meet he or any other hon member who have such case in their constituency however the pension review will look more at how current pension scheme can improve outcome for future pensioner we be look at driving scale in consolidation of define contribution pension scheme and local government pension scheme and at a shift away from cost to value i know that there be interest in that from across the house and i hope that we can work on it across the party 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of change to the eligibility criterion for the winter fuel payment on trend in the level of pensioner poverty 
 the government remain absolutely committed to support pensioner we be urge pensioner to check their eligibility for pension credit to ensure that as many people as possible have access to the support to which they be entitle 
 year old joyce from my constituency be worried about lose her winter fuel payment so she contact my office it sound like the minister have have a similar experience fortunately my team be able to assist joyce we run a full benefit check and help she to secure pension credit and therefore her winter fuel payment entitlement however do the minister think that it be right that the old and most vulnerable should have to resort to get their mp to help they claim pension credit 
 i be glad to hear that the hon lady be able to help her constituent we be look at the form as i mention in a previous answer and we will update the house soon on those development 
 what progress her department have make on meet pension credit application target 
 the department do not have a pension credit application target publish application number show that we receive around pension credit claim in the week from the end of july to mid september 
 in the week follow the chancellor ’s announcement on the winter fuel allowance the number of pension credit application double then nearly triple now the dwp be delay release any more datum on this subject i be concerned that the government know that they will not be able to process the application on time and that the information be not be put into the public domain will the minister tell i exactly how many pension credit application have be submit since   september and whether the backlog will be clear before old people start have to make a choice between heating and eat 
 i gently say to the hon lady that we be not delay the publication of statistic a new set of statistic will be publish soon as i say in previous answer we have redeploy additional staff to help to process pension credit application we urge all those who have love one who be pensioner or who be pensioner themselves to apply if they think that they be eligible 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the budget take the step in this government ’s plan to drive up opportunity and drive down poverty in every corner of the country it include an additional £ for our plan to get britain work a new fair repayment rate in universal credit to help over of the poor household and the big ever package to reduce fraud and error in the system ensure that every pound of taxpayer money be wisely spend there be much much more to do but in the department for work and pensions change have begin 
 my constituent kevin have to stop work in due to a medical condition he be desperate to find a job but have consistently find that he be not eligible for support from his local jobcentre kevin ask i how do someone who have fall out of work get back into work will the secretary of state or a minister meet i to discuss kevin ’s case and see if together we can answer his question 
 the hon gentleman raise an extremely important point it be not right that his constituent who want to work have suffer from a mental health problem but do not have the support that he need in part of the country step have be take to help provide the healthcare and other support that people need but we need to go far fast my hon friend the minister for employment will indeed meet the hon gentleman let ’s get crack on this and see what we can do 
 on my recent visit to hertford and ware food bank hard work volunteer raise with i the damaging impact of rule introduce under the previous conservative government which prevent jobcentre from refer benefit claimant to food bank do my right hon friend agree that those change prevent some of the   most vulnerable people in our community from access support in an emergency and will she set out the step that the department will take to reverse they 
 there have be change to ensure that referral be gdpr compliant but i will happily discuss this issue with my hon friend the very good jobcentre be closely link with local support organisation and we must ensure that that be the case everywhere 
 we come to the shadow secretary of state 
 the conservatives be the party of work and aspiration and once again we leave office with unemployment at a historic low we all know that labour always leave unemployment higher than when it come into office but rarely have it seem in such a hurry to achieve that its budget will accord to the office for budget responsibility cost the country job in the next few year alone what assessment have the right hon lady make of the cost to her department of those job loss 
 may i gently say this to the hon lady she should be apologise because we have record number of people out of work due to long term sickness in young people be not in education employment or training and people be lock out of the world of work because the conservatives fail to make proper plan to get people into work and on in their work until conservative member face up to their responsibility and to the cost to the taxpayer of their mistake in not get people with long term sickness into work—£25 extra over the course of the forecast period they will remain on the opposition benches 
 i wonder if the secretary of state do not hear my early question i say that i be grateful that she be continue the work that we do in government through the workwell programme to help people in ill health into work by join up healthcare and employment however the point i be just make to which she do not respond be that job will be lose as a result of labour ’s budget that be not the only thing frightening the life out of business at the moment 
 order the hon lady can keep point at i but this be topical question and i have all these back benchers to get in so question really need to be short 
 thank you mr speaker the budget be not the only thing frightening the life out of business at the moment labour ’s employment rights bill be a wreck ball for the uk labour market labour ’s own impact assessment predict that business could cut staff 
 order i do make the suggestion that you might come to the end of your question but you decide to carry on reading so i will have to stop you i call the secretary of state 
 i be very proud of a budget that invest in the long term growth that this country need that give a pay rise to the lowest pay worker   and that invest in the nhs so that people can get back to health and back to work that be the change that this country desperately need 
 as a proud member of the union of shop distributive and allied workers i want to raise with the minister the amazing work that it have do to produce the estimate that around quarter of worker in typically low pay sector be pay weekly fortnightly or weekly rather than monthly that be not recognise by universal credit will the minister promise to meet usdaw and other trade union to make sure that this matter be investigate 
 my hon friend be absolutely right if a person be pay weekly they receive payment a year so in of the monthly assessment period each year they be pay twice that mean that they probably get no universal credit that month which completely mess up budgeting i would be delighted to meet usdaw and perhaps my hon friend to discuss what we can do through our review of universal credit 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be sure all member in this chamber be aware of the women against state pension inequality campaign and the parliamentary ombudsman ’s finding will the secretary of state commit to make a statement in the house before christmas on progress with her review of the ombudsman ’s report 
 as the hon gentleman will know the ombudsman take year to consider a range of complex case and we be look at their complexity i be the minister in year to meet representative of the waspi campaign we hope to be able to update the house in the come week 
 the   work of unpaid carer be of huge value and be often heroic a recent report by carers uk reveal that of those receive carer ’s allowance be struggle financially i be therefore really pleased by the significant increase in carer ’s allowance announce in the budget it be the large increase in decade and will benefit many in my constituency do the minister agree that this change will help mitigate the financial challenge that carer have face for the past year 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that research from carers uk the budget increase the earning threshold so people will be able to earn £ a year from work and still claim carer ’s allowance and an extra carer will become entitled to the allowance it be a very big step forward 
 research from the university of bath show that over half of working household receive uc have income that fluctuate from payment period to payment period sometimes by up to £ this be to do with the way that assessment period be calculate and the income come into people ’s account in the high court rule   that the system should be smooth and that the dwp should look at different way of do that can the secretary of state update the house on where we be with the implementation of that high court judgment 
 as i mention early we be commit to review universal credit the way it work mean that in each assessment period each month there be a new calculation base on the income that the person have receive as report by his majesty ’s revenue and customs however i would be very happy to meet the hon gentleman to talk about how the system need to be improve far 
 carer matter include the carer in swansea west so i welcome the significant move in the budget to increase the amount that carer can earn while retain carer ’s allowance history tell we that awareness of the rule be low so what plan do the department have to communicate this important major policy change to carer 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the threshold will increase on   april   next year and all current claimant will receive an annual uprating letter in the spring that will set out the new limit as i mention a moment ago new unpaid carer will also become eligible for the allowance at that point 
 give the new government ’s collective condemnation of the child limit over the year since it be introduce which include condemnation from many government members on select committees will they at the very least commit to scrap its heinous sexist and frankly disgusting rape clause element 
 the hon lady raise some of the bad aspect of the consequence of year of conservative government we will consider all those issue through the child poverty taskforce 
 i congratulate my hon friend on be the labour member for weston super mare i have meet liz sayce who will carry out the review and she be rare to go the term of reference and timeline have not yet be set but they will be in the next few week as soon as they be the detail will be place in the library 
 kevin be a pensioner in waterlooville who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and struggle to breathe in the cold his personal budget put he on average about £ above the poverty line but he be of many thousand of people who will be hit by the government ’s cruel cut to the winter fuel allowance political point scoring aside what practical advice do the minister have for kevin to get he through the harsh winter ahead 
 i would suggest a number of thing the warm home discount scheme be available for those on low income include pension we have extend the household support fund that local authority can and should use to help people on low income and in the long term the warm home plan will help to make home across the country more energy efficient and cheap to heat i will also say that thank to the government ’s commitment to the triple lock pensioner will be about £ well off over this parliament 
 as i say in answer to a previous question we be look at the form some of applicant now apply online but we note that the paper form be long and we be consider how we can simplify it 
 eastbourne veteran pauline be award military compensation for injury that she sustain in the service of our country but she say that that have cause her pension credit entitlement to plummet from £ to just £ a week will the minister meet i to discuss her case and ensure that no veteran be penalise for their service to our country 
 the hon member be the person to raise that issue and i happy to meet they both 
 how many current department employee can not receive further sponsorship due to the previous government ’s change to the skilled worker visa salary threshold 
 my hon friend ask an important question and i will be delighted to follow up with he in writing 
 accord to the census of somalis here live in social housing compare with of the population overall in answer to my write question the department say it be explore the feasibility of publishing benefit claim by nationality which be important for a proper debate on benefit policy and immigration policy can the minister confirm that that work be go ahead and tell we when the datum will be publish 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that nationality and country of origin be not factor in assess benefit eligibility we may look at that in future but i would be delighted to follow up with he in write about how we will take it forward 
 when i speak to my constituent from lofthouse to farnley they be extremely concerned about the amount of money be lose to fraud and error in benefit can the minister confirm a timeline and a plan to get back the £ that have be lose since the pandemic 
 my hon friend be right to raise that issue the spiral nature of fraud in this country since the pandemic and on the last government ’s watch be totally unacceptable we will bring forward a fraud error and debt bill in the come month which be part of a much broad package the large ever package bring forward by any government to take out more than £ of fraud over the forecast period 
 citizens advice tell i that the dwp continue to start action on allege overpayment more than year after the event    that be long than bank record be keep to prove otherwise do the secretary of state think that that be fair and right 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman be ask specifically about carer ’s allowance or about other benefit but if benefit have be overpay the department have an obligation to recover the money what be important be that overpayment be identify soon and that people be notify when there be a problem so that we do not get the very large sum that have accrue in overpayment in the past 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on his commitment to spend of gdp on defence 
 i congratulate the shadow defence secretary on secure the defence urgent question of the new parliament previous defence secretaries answer just urgent question in the whole of the last year although i can not promise to answer every future uq i want to answer the hon gentleman ’s today to underline just how seriously i take our department ’s responsibility to report to this house 
 the government have a cast iron commitment to spend of gdp on defence we promise it in our manifesto at the election the prime minister promise it at nato in washington in july and my right hon friend the chancellor promise it in the budget week ago as well as announce a £ boost for defence spending next year to start to fix the foundation for our armed force that of course be on top of £ each year for ukraine i remind the house that the last time this country spend of gdp on defence be in with the last labour government a level not match in any of the tory year since 
 everyone agree that defence spending must increase to match and deal with the threat we face of our very act as a government be to launch the strategic defence review which be work at pace to look at the threat we face the capability we need and the resource we have available it be not just about how much we spend but about how we spend it the prime minister say at nato that our plan in the sdr will come and then we will set out the pathway to spend the chief secretary to the treasury say yesterday that this will come in the spring 
 today be armistice day at the hour i have the honour of lay a wreath at the cenotaph today be a reminder of what be at stake in this new era of insecurity a reminder that our dedicated servicemen and woman around the clock around the world work to keep we safe and a reminder of the ultimate sacrifice that so many have make in the past so that we may live in freedom today we will remember they 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker especially on armistice day i be grateful for the secretary of state ’s response but he keep go back to when we spend that be true but he say it without add the fact that his government have bankrupt the country in fact i ask the house of commons library about this the institute for fiscal studies have confirm that if labour have return to government it be plan cut to the defence budget of to 
 but this question be about today the threat picture be far graver than it have be for many generation as the chief of the defence staff confirm at the weekend as the secretary of state say the labour party commit in its general election manifesto to a 
 path to spend per cent of gdp on defence 
 the prime minister say shortly after take office that it be cast iron which the secretary of state have repeat today 
 with president trump ’s election victory there will inevitably be a great focus on what more european nato member can do to boost europe ’s own defence but yesterday the chief secretary to the treasury and this morning the secretary of state himself be unable to say whether the government would deliver on in the current parliament in addition yesterday the sunday times report that defence equipment and support in abbey wood have effectively be instruct to avoid any new procurement at all for the rest of this financial year 
 spend be not an end in itself the key reason that in april we set out a fully fund multi year pathway to be to enable the ministry of defence to procure at pace and at scale the munition that we need to urgently replenish our stock to warfighting level with the whole world want to buy more munition we can not afford to delay any far 
 i have key question for the secretary of state because at the same time we be have this debate there be a whole load of new burden come for the mod which it will have to cover in which financial year do he expect the share of gdp spend on defence to start rise significantly and will he guarantee to hit in this parliament yes or no not include exist programme be it true that there be a freeze on new procurement of defence equipment and support for the rest of this financial year will the mod be compensate by the treasury for high employer national insurance contribution and for the cost of increase continuity of education allowance and will service family be compensate for the extra vat on school fee penultimately on armistice day can the secretary of state absolutely rule out survive spouse of service personnel be tax on death in service benefit finally on the chagos island in the department ’s write answer to i it refuse to say how much the mod will contribute to rent back our own military base so this be a very simple question the secretary of state will not tell we how much it be go to cost but do he know how much it be go to cost 
 please remember that when i grant urgent question the time each person have be limited it be minute for the main opposition party and minute for the other opposition party 
 year the conservative government have to increase defence spending to of gdp and there be not a plan or a pathway from the last government as the shadow defence secretary try to claim it be a political ploy that be announce week before they call the general election it be unfunded and it be a con on the armed force and on the british people who give their answer emphatically by sweep away tory mp in many of the proud military community and constituency across the country 
 on the shadow defence secretary ’s accusation about a total spending freeze i be put in place a grip on the out of control spending that the last government leave we be secure value for money we be cut waste and we be get a grip on defence spending in a way his government do not 
 we greatly value the continuity of education allowance and greatly recognise the role it play in help avoid disruption to the education of the child of serve personnel in line with how the allowance operate we will continue to pay up to of private school fee follow the vat increase in january by uprate the cap we will take account of any increase in spending 
 on the chagos island of course i know the detail because i be heavily involve in the negotiation this secure britain ’s military base and it secure a military base for our us ally which be why they welcome it so strongly i have say to the shadow secretary of state and to the house that when it debate the treaty this house will have the full information 
 nobody know well the defence inheritance that year of conservative government have leave we for the past month than the shadow defence secretary he be a defence minister at the heart of the problem with pound black hole service morale at record low and a crisis in the recruitment and retention of personnel never again must a government leave our armed force in a bad state than they find they and this new government will make this country more secure at home and strong abroad 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 we live in an increasingly dangerous and volatile world with hundred of thousand of people die or be injure on our own continent in ukraine and war and conflict rag in the middle east africa and beyond not to mention the increase nefarious activity in the grey zone without a shadow of a doubt we be deal with exceptional circumstance and we need to grasp the gravity of the situation i have a great deal of time and respect for the secretary of state because i know that he get it but do other in government understand the gravity of the situation because we need clarity we need a timetable so that not only our ally but those in our defence community know where we be head 
 yes they do everyone agree that defence spending must increase and it be increase under this government it increase in the budget of this new government by nearly £ for next year alongside that be the cast iron commitment that we be a government who will set a path to spend of gdp on defence 
 i call the lib dem spokesperson 
 we be deeply concerned about the impact of the us election on ukraine and europe president trump be an unreliable partner and within day of his election us support to ukraine be regrettably under question clearly the uk need to urgently set out a path to spend of gdp on defence we need to lead in europe do the secretary of state agree that the previous government ’s legacy on our army which be the small since the napoleonic era be deeply regrettable will he commit to secure a uk eu defence and security agreement as be on the table while theresa may be prime minister will the government convene a summit on save ukraine to begin the process of seizure of frozen russian asset so that the uk and our european ally can support ukraine regardless of the path the us take 
 we do not need a summit to release the interest on the frozen asset the corrupt russian money as we be do that already the chancellor and i be work closely on that and we have announce that from early next year £ will be available for ukraine for that purpose i give the hon lady the assurance that we will pursue a uk eu security pact alongside the deep bilateral agreement we have already start to strike include the last month with germany which be the most comprehensive defence agreement this country have sign in many year finally the hon lady be right i have argue this before that at a time of increase global threat european nation in nato must do more of the heavy lifting we must be prepared to spend more on defence but we must also be prepare to work together to increase the level of deterrence we can offer to those who would do we harm 
 be president trump not right in his term when he push nato country to increase defence spending the number have go from country meet the target back in up to country meet the target now be this not serious because if president trump make decision on ukraine in his term we might be face with a choice either to accept those decision or to step up and ensure europe ’s defence ourselves 
 i welcome the fact that nato nation will hit the spend this year i regard that as a floor not a ceiling the uk under government of both party have always spend well above and set the pace for other european country we will continue to do that because european country in nato must take on more of the nato leadership we be determined that the uk will do that which be why we have say that our approach to defence will be a nato policy we will wherever we can look to be in nato so that we set the pace on the sort of transformation to the well equip well able and more lethal force that our nation need to deter adversary and to defend ourselves if require 
 the secretary of state be right that we use to spend a lot more than in the 1980 we spend between and of gdp on defence do he share my concern at what i hear on the radio this morning when a labour politician in another place be say that he could see an outcome in ukraine whereby russia get to keep the territory it have occupy while ukraine do not get any guarantee of join nato but merely some more security assurance we know what happen last time with the security assurance previously give do the secretary of state agree that whether we spend on defence now or in the near future it be important that whoever we send to washington do not capitulate in advance 
 the right hon gentleman make the important point implicitly in his question that it be the ukrainians who be fight and the ukrainians who will make the call about whether to talk and on what term our task as of the lead supporter of ukraine and its fight for sovereignty freedom and its own future be to support it and to step up our support for its fight and then to step up our support if necessary and whenever require in any negotiation as well as   to play our part as we have make the commitment to do in provide any security guarantee for the long term 
 russia have go to war in europe start in ukraine it be america and britain that save europe in the last war it look like this will be the same europe simply must step up what discussion have the secretary of state have with lloyd austin about america ’s role in the way forward 
 to be quite honest with my hon friend it be a little early to have discussion with america it be less than a week since the presidential election and the current administration have more than month to go as she would expect i be in detailed discussion with the current administration and my counterpart there in particular about how we together as of ukraine ’s lead ally can step up our support over the couple of month ahead 
 in the future i expect a president trump lead administration to recognise that it be in america ’s interest nato ’s interest and the interest of all country that believe in the international rule base order and a stable and secure peace that putin do not prevail because if large country like russia be able to redraw international boundary by force that send a signal that undermine the security of all nation if report be right that president trump have already speak to president putin and warn he against the escalation that we see from russia in ukraine that be a good step and early sign
