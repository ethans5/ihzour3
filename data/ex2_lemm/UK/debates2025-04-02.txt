 northern ireland do indeed have a great industrial heritage titanic studios for example have be the paint shed for harland and wolff and now it host a lot of film making another example be the revival of harland and wolff which thank to the takeover by navantia will now be build the navy ’s new fleet solid support ship those be good example of northern ireland ’s strength 
 do the secretary of state agree that the uk industrial strategy be of deep importance to resident of northern ireland as it be to resident of erewash where we be currently in the process of redevelop new stanton park to form a new industrial future from the rubble of our famous former ironwork 
 i do indeed and i wish my hon friend every success with the new stanton park redevelopment at the roundtable that i co chair last week we have representative from manufacturing from cyber from small business such as alchemy and from the chamber of commerce for derry londonderry and for causeway coast those business can see the industrial strategy result in great opportunity for the people and business of northern ireland 
 a core objective of the government ’s modern industrial strategy be to unleash the full potential of our city and region which be as true in northern as it be in my constituency of harlow do the secretary of state agree that northern ireland ’s city growth deal which the government commit to at the budget can play a vital role in this 
 i wish harlow every success as well the city and growth deal be really important to northern ireland ’s economic future the government be invest a considerable amount of money together with the executive private sector partner and business among the project that the city and growth deal will support be those relate to digital innovation decarbonisation and digital health yet another example of the great strength of the northern ireland economy 
 if we be to boost productivity drive clean green power and build a resilient economy across the uk collaboration will be essential will the secretary of state set out what political engagement he have have with business leader and politician on work together to deliver the good for northern ireland and the united kingdom 
 last thursday i visit foyle port and its innovation park a new data centre will be build there to tap into the renewable energy that be available alongside it that be a really good example of the port think about its economic future and how we will get new business in draw on the great strength that northern ireland have in renewable energy i hope we see more such development 
 my constituent in falkirk see at hand the failure of government to collaborate in the previous parliament what engagement have the secretary of state have with political leader and business and sector leader such as those in bus manufacturing to work together to deliver the good for northern ireland 
 my hon friend give i the chance to talk about the great success of wrightbus base in ballymena which have win a huge new order from go ahead it be make the electric and hydrogen bus of the future and be take on more staff i would encourage anyone across the united kingdom who be think of buy bus for their fleet to see what be available at wrightbus 
 can the secretary of state further outline what representation he have make to cabinet colleague to ensure that the uk industrial strategy pay more than lip service to the position of northern ireland ’s manufacturing industry as see in aerospace shipbuilding and defence which have a global reputation for be top class how will he advocate for our own government to invest in those sector even far and even well 
 i have already point out example of that investment to harland and wolff i would add the order that be go to thales to make more missile for ukraine which will create an additional job as the answer that i have give demonstrate northern ireland have enormous strength and the task of the strategy and for all of we be to build on they 
 can the secretary of state give safeguard for the benefit of the uk industrial strategy such as economic growth innovation and research and development against the adverse effect of the windsor framework 
 the windsor framework be a necessity arise from our departure from the european union because we have get trading entity with different rule and an open border and some arrangement have to be put in place to manage that but the good be continue to flow both way across the irish sea i point out to the hon gentleman that the growth rate in northern ireland be high than in the uk as a whole northern ireland also have the low unemployment in the uk 
 with regard to international trade as mention by   the hon member for north down alex easton what assessment have make be make of the uk industrial strategy and the impact of us tariff that may come on good manufacture in northern ireland 
 we will discover more later today about the decision that we be tell the us administration be about to make tariff be not good for any country and they be not good for the global trading system but we will have to see what the consequence be any tariff that the united states of america put on the united kingdom will be feel equally in northern ireland and in great britain we will not hesitate to take the action that be necessary to respond but we be not go to make snap decision because we be also try to negotiate an economic agreement with the united states of america 
 an industrial strategy would be very welcome but be not the reality that any assistance under an industrial strategy in northern ireland would be subject to eu state aid rule that any raw material for industry in northern ireland that come from gb would have to pass through the international eu custom border and that many good would have to be make to eu not uk standard unless or until we get rid of those hindrance how do we liberate such a strategy 
 as i point out in my previous answer the windsor framework which be negotiate by the previous government and be a huge improvement on   the northern ireland protocol be the only available mean of manage the challenge of have system with different set of rule and an open border not all member of the house may want to recognise that fact but it be a fact and we have to deal with it 
 the secretary state will be aware that over the past couple of decade investment from us company in northern ireland have be important for economic growth and for cement the peace process as we all await the announcement from the president of the united states later today will the secretary of state give some thought to support business that could be detrimentally affect by any potential tariff in northern ireland 
 we be go to have to wait and see what the us administration decide as i have already indicate the government will take the step that be necessary in the national interest but we be seek to negotiate an agreement and that work be continue notwithstanding what be announce later today 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as the house have hear we be expect washington later today to announce the big change to its tariff regime in a generation that may cause huge disruption to industry and business throughout the united kingdom and that disruption may be particularly feel in northern ireland what guidance have the government provide to business in northern ireland to help they prepare for different scenario 
 we do not yet know apart from the tariff on car and on steel and aluminium what else the us administration may announce later today but the effect of any tariff if impose will be feel equally in northern ireland and across the rest of the united kingdom we will have to deal with the consequence when we know what the us administration have decide 
 i be afraid that reveal that the government have provide business with no information to help they prepare for the different scenario that may emerge the secretary of state will be aware that in some scenario northern ireland because of its unique arrangement may be particularly disadvantage in a trade war will he confirm to the house that if that happen the government will be prepared to use article of the windsor framework to take unilateral safeguarding measure to protect business in gb and northern ireland 
 in respect of tariff that affect the whole of the united kingdom as i have already say to the hon gentleman we will have to see what they be and take the appropriate action in response if the eu retaliate then there will be an issue in respect of northern ireland as he will be well aware however there be the tariff reimbursement scheme of which he will also be aware and that mean that provide those business can demonstrate that the good they have buy from the united states of america be not leave the united kingdom they can get that tariff reimburse 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the potential impact of defence expenditure in northern ireland on defence supply chain company in the rest of the uk 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the potential impact of defence expenditure in northern ireland on defence supply chain company in the rest of the uk 
 the government ’s commitment to increase defence expenditure to of gdp from april will provide an opportunity for defence company in northern ireland to secure investment and create job 
 teesside have strong and endure tie with northern ireland we remember the contribution of the late mo mowlam and her legacy as well as the economic tie do my right hon friend agree that the government ’s historic uplift in defence spending can deepen those tie and ensure job and growth across the uk 
 i do indeed agree because it be an opportunity for uk defence business include in northern ireland to take advantage of the increase defence expenditure i have already indicate to the house example in thales and in harland and wolff where the government be invest in northern ireland already 
 the uk defence industry support hundred of thousand of good job and represent uk manufacturing at its good will the secretary of state outline what the government be do to support the defence sector in scotland and in northern ireland 
 the most important thing that we be do be increase defence expenditure which will provide the opportunity to which i refer a moment ago i also very much welcome the ministry of defence ’s announcement of a new hub for small and medium sized enterprise to allow they well access to the defence supply chain the mod have also commit to set a target by july this year for spend on sme 
 the secretary of state might recall that year ago i launch a report that highlight that northern ireland receive of the uk average spend on defence that incorporate the commitment for harland and wolff which i work on and greatly welcome i also welcome the announcement of a £ contract for thales however do he accept that the previous government commit to a thorough and thoughtful publication of how they would support continued growth in northern ireland ’s defence sector will he similarly commit to do so 
 the ministry of defence have agree to deliver precisely that safeguard the union commitment through its defence industrial strategy   which will look at how the uk ’s defence technological and industrial base can contribute to the government ’s growth mission include in northern ireland 
 the house of commons will this afternoon recognise year of the irish guards as a british regiment when we consider the capacity to arm those who defend we should we not also continue in our resolve to defend those who stand up for the value of this nation in term of legacy will the secretary of state commit to defend those who defend we 
 i certainly will those who serve in operation banner be protect the people of northern ireland and stand up for the value of our country we have discuss that a great deal recently and since i last have the opportunity to address the house the right hon gentleman will have see the decision the ministry of defence have take to judicially review the clonoe inqu verdict a decision that i support 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy funding on northern ireland 
 great british energy will operate across the whole of the united kingdom help to reduce our reliance on import gas and bring down energy bill uk ministers and gb energy will work with northern ireland ’s department for the economy to explore opportunity to increase clean energy deployment by start with £ of funding to the executive for sustainable energy 
 abandon the net target show that the tory leader have learn nothing from her party ’s historic election defeat do the minister agree that northern ireland have a huge amount to gain from this labour government work together with the northern ireland executive on the transition to clean power will she update we on any recent discussion she have have with the executive 
 the conservatives energy policy now as over the past year fail to bring down bill still rely on expensive oil and gas fail to invest in green job and fail future generation on climate change this government be invest in the new technology we need week ago i be delighted to join the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks at ulster university to see its cutting edge renewable energy and solar panel development and the benefit that the clean energy transition can bring to northern ireland i be also work with the executive on this 
 in pursuit of their unrealistic and costly net policy this government have commit billion of pound to carbon capture guarantee long term price to renewable energy source which have add to consumer bill and set up gb energy a costly quango project that be likely to apply to   gb energy be the proposal for a massive wind farm off the coast of northern ireland and adjacent to the giant ’s causeway a world heritage site and major tourist attraction will the minister commit to ensure that gb energy do not support a project that would have a detrimental effect on our tourism industry 
 where the wind farm be positioned will be subject to the normal planning process but wind farm and solar power offer huge opportunity to northern ireland net be the future reliance on expensive oil and gas be the past bill will come down and job will grow with the new technology that we can bring forward 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn budget on northern ireland 
 the record £ funding settlement for will provide northern ireland with funding in line with its independently assess level of need and it be now for the executive to decide how that funding be spend 
 the royal college of general practitioners in northern ireland have say that the hike in national insurance contribution will be catastrophic for gp surgery with many practice teeter on the edge why be minister not do more to talk to their colleague in the treasury 
 i would point out to the hon member that the previous government left—[interruption however much they may deny it the previous government leave a fiscal black hole that have to be fill the increase in expenditure result from the autumn budget be help to fund in part the record settlement that the northern ireland executive have get for 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 the committee will soon publish our report to the house on the funding of public service and the issue of revenue raising by the executive continue to be highlight what conversation be the secretary of state have with the executive to help deliver long term financial sustainability in northern ireland 
 i have regular discussion with the executive about the financial situation and about their plan the truth be very simple all government around the world include the northern ireland executive have choice to make with the resource available as to whether they seek to raise revenue to fund more thing include further investment in health those be choice for the executive to make but if they do not make those choice they will have less fund than would otherwise be available to they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday belfast chamber which represent business warn that many northern irish business be be force to freeze growth plan halt recruitment and in some case cut job to absorb rise cost as a consequence of the rise employer national insurance contribution due to take effect in just day what assessment have the northern ireland office make of the impact of those tax rise on small and medium sized enterprise and what practical discussion be the secretary of state have with the northern ireland executive to support sme which be the future of northern ireland ’s growth 
 of course the increase in employer ’s national insurance will be difficult for some firm that be clearly the case but as i say the north ireland economy be grow fast than the rest of the united kingdom and have low unemployment the rest of today ’s question time have highlight the huge area of potential that the northern ireland economy have to continue to grow and create new job and business 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the northern ireland farming minister estimate that quarter of dairy farm in northern ireland could be hit by inheritance tax follow the chancellor ’s disastrous change give the particularly high cost of agricultural land compare with farming income in northern ireland do the secretary of state recognise that the budget be a direct threat to family farm and thousand of livelihood across northern ireland 
 the figure the hon gentleman just refer to do not reflect the treasury ’s assessment of the number of farm that will be affect which be base on claim submit in the past i understand the farming industry ’s concern but the treasury be clear that it will not hit the majority of farm and secondly we have to do something about very big landowner who buy a lot of land to avoid inheritance tax 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on good practice for public sector reform 
 public sector reform be a priority for this government and i regularly meet with northern ireland executive ministers union and public service provider most recently the government and executive agree £ of funding for public service transformation for health special educational need justice and waste water 
 i welcome what the minister say about public service reform be a share challenge do she agree that it be in the interest of patient and people in northern ireland and england for the executive and the government to share knowledge and good practice 
 i absolutely agree public service transformation be not just about funding it be about how to spend the money that the northern ireland   executive have with the record £ settlement health be devolve but we work together to share good practice and expertise as well as recently agree £ of funding for multidisciplinary team in gp surgery we will work together to create an nhs fit for the future and i will be meet the health minister again in northern ireland this week 
 will the minister ensure that any future discussion with northern ireland ministers about public sector reform include the need for employment practice and procedure in many part of the public sector to result in workforce that be more broadly representative of the working age population the unionist community have be under represent in many sector include for many year in the public sector 
 workforce challenge be a huge part of public service transformation worker across northern ireland do fantastic work in health education and justice and they need to be support to do that and to be representative of the community workforce issue be devolve but they be important and support our workforce and work with union to do so be an important part of our work together in an active partnership with the executive 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i wish to inform the house about my recent trip to ukraine it be at the invitation of mr ruslan stefanchuk chairman of the rada of ukraine i join speakers from across europe in a memorial service to mark the anniversary of the bucha massacre and to hear the important testimony of the survivor of that terrible atrocity i also deliver a speech at the bucha summit which be open by the president of ukraine i take with i specific cross party message of solidarity from the house of commons the prime minister the leader of the opposition and the leader of the liberal democrats the appreciation feel by the people of ukraine for the support offer by this house and the people of the united kingdom should not be underestimate hon member hear hear indeed in his nightly address on monday president zelensky explicitly express his thank to the united kingdom for the support provide to ukraine 
 the prime minister be ask

 to pick up on your comment mr speaker on monday night i speak to president zelensky he want i to pass on his    thank to you for attend in ukraine particularly on the anniversary of the massacre at bucha i have be to bucha and this be a terrible terrible anniversary 
 we have be prepare for all eventuality ahead of the confirmation of us tariff later today let i be clear with the house a trade war be in nobody ’s interest the country deserve and we will take a calm and pragmatic approach that be why constructive talk be progress to agree a wide economic prosperity deal with the us it be why we be work with all industry and sector likely to be impact our decision will always be guide by our national interest that be why we have prepare for all eventuality and will rule nothing out 
 our deep sympathy be with the people of myanmar and thailand we be send immediate lifesaving support to assist their effort 
 may i also extend my personal condolence to the family friend and colleague of christina mckelvie she be much love and will be sorely miss especially by our scottish national party colleague here and in scotland 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 this week the full state pension will rise by £ a year put money in the pocket of pensioner in glasgow and across the united kingdom do the prime minister agree that this rise be possible only because of labour ’s plan for change and our commitment to the triple lock 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we can commit to the triple lock because we have restore stability after the conservatives crash the economy that mean that next week pensioner will receive up to £ more that be an extra £ over this parliament include pensioner in scotland the contrast could not be clear the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon mel stride call the triple lock unsustainable and the leader of the opposition want to mean test the state pension so that she can cut it 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 the triple lock be a conservative policy—[interruption 
 order 
 rather than the prime minister congratulate himself on what we do why do n’t we talk about what he be do from sunday labour ’s job tax will mean that many british business face a terrible choice cut wage put up price or sack their staff what be his advice to those business 
 the right hon lady say that the triple lock be a conservative policy the conservatives be once think to be the party of sound finance but they blow all of that she ask what we be do we be clear up the mess that they leave we be deal with global instability and we   recognise the pressure that be bear down on business individual and work people that be why we be roll up our sleeve yesterday i be pleased to announce the national living wage increase by £ that be a pay rise for million of worker we have announce £ for the warm home discount now extend to household which be in family wage be go up fast than price never forget under the conservative party there be the bad living standard on record inflation up to and public service leave on their knee 
 the only mess be the that the prime minister make with his budget they have an emergency budget last week that fix nothing he say that he be bring stability but all we see be fragility during the election the prime minister also promise that he would not increase taxis on work people but even the office for budget responsibility say that the job tax will be pass on to worker on average family will be £ poor why should anyone trust he again 
 the right hon lady ’s fantasy figure be about as much use as liz truss ’s economic planning she turn up every week to carp from the sideline about decision that we make in the budget yesterday she hold a press conference and could not say whether she would reverse the decision that we make at the budget i understand because she can not bring herself to say that she do not want the investment of an extra £ in our nhs i be not surprised at that as that is extra appointment more gps a pay rise for nurse and so on let i get her position right if i can follow it she want the extra £ in the nhs which be pay for by the national insurance rise she want that but she do not want to reverse the national insurance rise she be now reduce to this absurd position of voting against a budget carping against a budget that she actually agree with 
 i do not agree with make people poor i do not agree with pensioner poverty i do not agree—[interruption out there they be call it awful april and that be because of decision the prime minister have make because he make promise and break they his promise be worthless people be get poor before the election he pledge to freeze council tax instead it be go up everywhere even in birmingham where tonne of rubbish go uncollected on the street do the prime minister regret promise the british people that he would freeze their council tax when he have so obviously fail 
 i have to ask the right hon lady this if she do not want people to be poor why do she not resign when she be in government the last government put up council tax for year in a row she i think be actually the minister responsible for council tax and in that year what do she do she put it up even now the local government association conservative group manifesto state on page its current position 
 we ask that that the government remove the cap on council tax 
 who be lead the charge hampshire county council want a hike we say no slough council want a hike we say no windsor and maidenhead council be tory now lib dem want a hike and we say no it be no surprise that council tax be £ cheap under labour council than under tory council 
 the prime minister do not want to talk about birmingham and that be because he know the situation i will say it again tonne of rubbish on birmingham ’s street normally a state of emergency be call for natural disaster not labour one his policy have leave our economy dangerously fragile the chancellor once again leave herself no room for manoeuvre economic expert real economist say that she will either have to break her fiscal rule or put up taxis which will it be 
 i think the right hon lady must have pick up the script she be use a few week ago because only then she be say that we be go to put up taxis in the spring statement the situation in birmingham be completely unacceptable and i fully support the council in declare it a major incident to resolve the situation we will put in whatever additional support be need when the conservatives be in government we lose more day to strike action than in any year since the 1980s nhs worker be on the picket line not on the frontline and that send waiting list through the roof so we will take no lecture on industrial harmony from the conservatives 
 the whole house would have hear that the prime minister do not say whether he could keep to his fiscal rule that mean it be either change that or put up taxis month ago we leave labour the fast grow economy in the g7 interruption we do i remember watch his mps laugh at their destructive budget they have have another that have make our economy dangerously vulnerable the bank of england say that his policy have push up the cost of live for family do he disagree with the bank or do he accept his policy mean high bill 
 the right hon lady must be the only person leave in the country who actually think the tories do well on the economy when they be in power that be what be test at the last election living standard be the bad on record and inflation soar up to the nhs be on its knee she be so obsessed with talk down the country that she have not read the obr forecast properly growth be up in in in and in that be thank to our planning reform the large growth measure the obr have ever cost what do the tories do when that bill come before parliament they abstain we do not grow the economy or build house by abstain they be the same old party they have not change nothing ’ new 
 the prime minister talk about inflation we leave it at it be now twice what the obr forecast when we be in government the fact be that his decision have make our economy fragile just as we face global trade war in november i urge he to seize the draft us trade deal that the conservatives negotiate instead he lose our most experienced trade   negotiator it be no wonder he can not get a tariff deal for british car the conservatives secure investment for that industry with £ from bmw £ from nissan and £ from jaguar land rover labour ’s record be a car industry in crisis even before tariff with more job now at risk he say he be prepare for all eventuality can the prime minister tell we exactly what he be do to protect the british car industry from his failure to negotiate 
 we be take a calm pragmatic approach and keep our foot on the ground constructive talk be ongoing on a wide economic prosperity deal with the us that be really important at this moment we be work with all sector that be likely to be impact and we be guide by our national interest at all time and that be why we have say we will not rule anything out but it be important at a moment like this that we do not have knee jerk reaction and that we be cool headed about this that be why we will not rule anything out the right hon lady be the trade secretary who fail to get a trade deal with the us 
 today the trump administration will announce new tariff that will hurt work people in the us and around the world do the prime minister agree that at a time when big tech have grow fat by corrupt our politic and preying on young people the wrong approach would be to pander to his bullying tactic and the tech billionaire in his imperial court by cut the digital service tax can he assure the public that the poor will not get cut while the rich get a free ride 
 i thank the hon member for raise this important issue there be issue in relation to northern ireland in particular that we have to deal with very carefully we will always put the national interest and that be why i be pleased that talk be ongoing and they be constructive talk i believe that a trade war be in nobody ’s interest and all of the sector and industry impact be of the same view so we will continue to make that progress in the national interest 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s early remark particularly about myanmar and thailand i support the aid despite the budget cut i hope we can be as generous as possible because of the humanitarian crisis there 
 the prime minister have show commendable leadership over ukraine with his plan for a military coalition of the willing against putin will he now provide similar leadership with an economic coalition of the willing against trump ’s tariff and for free trade so we can avoid a global trade war and a global recession 
 every week the right hon gentleman try to tempt i to make what i think be a false choice between our relationship with the us and our relationship with other country particularly in europe i think that be the wrong choice on defence on security and on intelligence for reason that we have rehearse across this chamber i also think it be wrong on trade and on the economy we have a good deal of   trade a balanced trade relationship with the us and i believe that our interest be well serve by calmly try to secure a deal that be in our national interest while at the same time prepare and leave all option on the table 
 i hope the prime minister be able to cut a deal but i increasingly fear that the deal will not be good enough to avoid a global trade war that be why of the option must be to work with our european ally our commonwealth ally and other because if we do not tackle trump ’s tariff we could be say goodbye to free trade for a generation 
 turn to a domestic matter year ago the american private equity firm kkr buy a stake in northumbrian water since then people across the north east have see their water bill soar while in the last year alone northumbrian water have dump nearly tonne of raw sewage into durham ’s whitburn coast conservation area kkr be now poise to buy into thames water because minister have rule out a special administration regime will the prime minister guarantee that thames water will not be allow to repeat the same trick of put up bill and dump raw sewage at the same time the conservatives allow it he should not 
 in relation to the beginning of the right hon gentleman ’s comment i really do not think it be sensible to say that the response should be to jump into a trade war with the us that can not be the response of the united kingdom and i will resist his urging to do that 
 in relation to water the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to point out the conservative party ’s appalling record on water just like its record on everything that be why i be pleased that we have already pass the water special measures act to take the necessary measure but we will go far 
 yesterday the work and pensions committee visit manchester where we see the power of devolution in action in this case help people to find work with just percentage point separate labour and conservative candidate at the last mayoral election do the prime minister agree that to get the maximum advantage from labour ’s devolution offer the west of england need an ambitious labour mayor in helen godwin for more job to fix our bus and to get the home we need build 
 i believe it be good for community when their leader have skin in the game helen godwin grow up in stapleton go to college in filton and have a great record fighting for the community where she be raise her family our plan for change have deliver record funding for the west of england more money for well bus pothole and get young people into work that be the difference a labour mayor work with a labour government deliver for the west of england 
 the prime minister will know that many in the house will be assuage by his suggestion that he will act in the national interest in relation to tariff but most will not have consider that in act in the national interest what   occur in northern ireland be no long solely in his control he know that export from northern ireland be uk export and rightly so yet import to northern ireland could be affect as a consequence of eu retaliatory action in keep all his option open now we have to live in a world of the consequence of the last government with his support will he indicate whether he be prepared to take step either to exempt northern ireland from eu action or to take retaliatory action if the eu do not do so 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise this issue which be of real importance to his constituent and to everybody in northern ireland it be a very serious issue that be why we need to be calm and pragmatic and that be what worker and business in northern ireland would want to see from this government at a time like this we be as he would expect look carefully at the detail of any retaliatory tariff announce by the eu if they be announce and what impact they might have on business as he know where good do not enter the eu business can claim a full reimbursement of any eu duty pay but i reassure he that the interest of northern ireland be at the forefront of our decision he may want to know that this morning the business secretary speak to the northern ireland executive because this be a serious issue and we need to work together to resolve it in the interest of everybody in northern ireland 
 while the last government resort to damage keyboard diplomacy this government be lead bring nation together this week to tackle illegal immigration like the prime minister i have see at hand how counter terror power can disrupt threat before life be lose that same approach be essential in dismantle the smuggling network do he agree that it be time that the conservatives and reform drop the posturing put national security and back our border bill 
 the conservatives try an open border experiment we be now tackle illegal migration they talk about flight we have already remove people with no right to be here under their rwanda scheme which be only ever suppose to return i think people a year what we have achieve in month would have take they year we have replace a gimmick with a real deterrent 
 the prime minister have speak very movingly and with genuine sincerity and affection about his time as a young man in the langdale valley in the lake district in my constituency and how that help to shape he i wonder whether he be aware that the hill farmer who maintain those stunning landscape in the lake and elsewhere will be earn on average significantly less than or barely half of the national minimum wage due to cut in their income despite the fact that they provide the backdrop to the remarkably important tourism economy will he agree to meet i and upland farmer in the lake and the dale so that we can design a scheme together to end this poverty and equip our hill farmer to produce food and protect our epic landscape for generation to come 
 the hon gentleman and i share a love of the lake district we still go back there with our child this be obviously a serious issue which be why we put a record amount into farming at the budget and also set out our road map i will happily make sure that he get a meeting with the relevant minister to go through that and to take on board any point he have to make in relation to it 
 hundred of resident in my constituency at union park be face massive £ charge to repair their heating system and for fire safety work that have not be put right by the developer which have now declare bankruptcy and walk away their new freeholder have wash its hand of responsibility and be instead leverage huge ground rent bill and fine against those resident do the prime minister agree that that be exactly why we have to move forward with our plan much delay by the conservatives to abolish the outdated leasehold system once and for all as part of our plan for change 
 the deputy prime minister be say absolutely in my ear we will end the feudal leasehold system which have leave million of homeowner subject to unfair cost and unreasonable practice our reform include clear standard for repair and maintenance and that will give homeowner a great say in how their home be manage i know the housing minister will have hear what my hon friend say

 perhaps the most immediate and visible failure which pose an immediate and direct health risk to the people of birmingham be the appalling financial mismanagement of labour run birmingham city council after more than a decade of labour control that council ’s incompetence have lead to mountain of uncollected rubbish pile up on every street so large that they can be see by satellite orbit in space it be nothing short of a disgrace and a damn indictment of labour ’s inability to govern will the prime minister take urgent action to protect public health and the people of birmingham by immediately deploy the 
 order we be mean to ask quick question otherwise nobody be go to get in 
 i have say that the situation in birmingham council be completely unacceptable but the hon gentleman might want to tell his constituent that we have deliver extra appointment for the nhs so waiting list be come down for they we have deliver a £ increase in the national living wage include for his constituent and we have get record investment into this country grow the economy include for his constituent 
 my constituent be grafter they want to work and they want to see opportunity create and the skill and investment in infrastructure that we need for the future i welcome the prime minister ’s commitment to fix the transport system in the north of england which have be hold we back and i invite he to the atom valley development zone in my constituency to discuss how we can create skilled job in north greater manchester

 since the prime minister and i last speak more than people have sign an open letter to the health secretary in support of north devon district hospital which face a year wait for urgent repair why be that hospital still be deny a ministerial visit and will the government consider the trust ’s emergency plan and meet i and the trust so that we can discuss keep the operate theatre open beyond to meet capacity 
 as i say in our previous exchange obviously the unfunded promise the fantasy promise of the conservative party mean that the hon gentleman ’s hospital would never have be deliver interruption conservative member should not moan they should apologise to the hon gentleman ’s constituent we have to take tough decision to make the programme deliverable which be what we have do we will continue to support the trust to maintain facility in advance of the new hospital investment and the minister for secondary care will be visit that hospital which i hope will be an opportunity to have the necessary discussion 
 stone lodge academy a special school in ipswich will be of the school in the country to benefit from a new breakfast club this month that be an important step in tackle suffolk ’s decade long special educational need and disability crisis as be the multimillion pound funding settlement give to open new specialist place across the county will the prime minister outline what step he will be take to break down the barrier to opportunity far for all child as part of our plan for change 
 i be very pleased to say that the breakfast club will open this month i be pleased that there be an early adopter in my hon friend ’s constituency as well as in the constituency of the leader of the opposition i be sure she will welcome that of these week that will put £ a year back in the pocket of work people today we have award £ to primary school to create up to nursery place from september make it easy for work family to access government fund childcare 
 some worker at scunthorpe steelwork be face redundancy plus many more in the supply chain and many of those people be my constituent it be welcome that negotiation be continue but whatever the outcome the local economy be go to need significant support all those affect would appreciate it and be reassure if the prime minister could give an indication that he be personally take an interest in this matter and if at some point in the not too distant future he would meet i neighbouring mp and the council leader to discuss the way forward 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that i do take a personal interest a short while ago i go to scunthorpe to talk to the management and worker to understand the challenge at hand and how deeply worry this will be for those work there their family and the community as a whole which be why negotiation be take place i call on the company to accept the offer of financial support that have be advance so that we can achieve a sustainable future for the workforce the industry and the local community because i believe that there be and need to be a bright future for steel as i have say i do take a personal interest in this 
 too many of my constituent be struggle to obtain an appointment with a gp the gps be try their good but they too be struggle with capacity issue outdated building and outdated technology all because the conservative party break the front door to the national health service can the prime minister reassure my constituent that our plan for investment and reform will ensure that they can see a gp when they need 
 we be focus on deliver real result for patient by scrap unnecessary target bring back the family doctor and require online booking which will help deal with the am scramble we be invest an additional £ to reinforce the front door of the nhs that be the big increase for more than a decade and it mean that there will be hundred more gps since we come to power this week we have announce record investment to enable community pharmacy to deliver more service for patient and to free up gp time 
 a recent nhs england report lay bare the catalogue of failure that leave a patient with a history of violent aggression unconfined untreated and completely unmedicated for month until he kill ian coates and the young friend grace o’malley kumar and barnaby webber from taunton in my constituency will the prime minister join i and the people of taunton in pay tribute to the family who have campaign on this matter will he confirm that a public inquiry be to begin give the cut to the cost of integrated care board will he also confirm that mental health service both in the community and secure will not suffer as a result of those cut 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that tragic case and i pay tribute to the family when it come to case such as this i often find it hard   to think how i would respond if i be a family member in such circumstance i be not sure that i would have the courage that those family have to campaign in the way that they have do and i pay tribute to they for it we need to get to the bottom of all these issue wherever they may lie and that be what we will do 
 my constituent be struggle to gain access to the healthcare that they desperately need and in scot be on a waiting list meanwhile in england the waiting list have be come down for the last month and more than appointment have be make available do the prime minister agree that the snp lead government should stop blame everyone else for their failure when scotland ’s break public service be their responsibility 
 my hon friend be right more than scot have be stick wait for test or treatment for over a year that be a rise in year i have to check that figure because it be so staggering despite the backlog nearly few operation be be perform than be perform before the pandemic let we compare that with the situation in england where we have drive down waiting list with more than extra appointment and have scrap nhs england to cut bureaucracy scotland ’s nhs be in desperate need of reform but the scottish national party have no strategy no plan and no idea 
 early the prime minister seem reluctant to answer a direct question about his job tax next time he visit my constituency to enjoy the beautiful buckinghamshire surrounding of chequers will he go minute up the road to wendover and explain to kate rumsey of rumsey ’s handmade chocolates why his choice and those of his chancellor have lead to a increase in cost for that business as a result it have already have to lay people off and have have to reduce the hour of those whom it still employ be that what he mean by growth 
 i be happy to tell anyone why the conservatives leave a £ black hole they crash the economy they ruin our public service   and as we mend and rebuild the country they carp from the sideline even now they can not bring themselves to say that they do not want the investment or that they will reverse the decision we have make they actually agree with the decision we have make because we be clear up the mess that they leave 
 year ago yesterday my constituent james henderson be kill with other aid worker from world central kitchen when take humanitarian aid into gaza jim ’s family have tell i that he would want confirmation from our government that we be take all conceivable step to make sure that aid power and supply be safely return to gaza could the pm confirm that he be do all he can to ensure this could he also confirm that he will continue to push for a full investigation into the death of jim and the other british wck worker to be complete and for appropriate action to be take 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this appalling incident and our thought remain with the family of jim john chapman and james kirby attack on aid worker be never justify the family deserve justice and we be press the israeli government to accelerate their investigation include into whether criminal proceeding should be initiate israel must stop block aid to gaza the hostage must be release and we must have an urgent resumption of the ceasefire 
 double child rapist and murderer colin pitchfork be up for parole for the time i know the prime minister do not have direct control nor should he over the parole board but he do have a view i have ask this of all his predecessor and i will now put the question to he do he agree that man who brutally rape and strangle to death young woman should as a matter of a principle spend most of their natural life in prison 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this appalling case and i absolutely agree with he that there must be maximum penalty for anyone fall into that category i see many of these case for myself at hand when i be a prosecutor for year and work with the police on really terrible case and i know the impact that such crime have on victim i thank he for raise this 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the status of the negotiation surround the future sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question as we and mauritius have repeatedly say include in joint statement on   december   and   january both side remain committed to conclude a deal on the future of the chagos archipelago that protect the long term effective operation of the joint uk us base on diego garcia we be now work with mauritius to finalise the agreement and although it be in everybody ’s interest to progress the deal quickly we have never put an exact date on it and we do not intend to do so now follow signature the government will bring forward a bill to enable the implementation of the treaty and parliament will of course have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty in the usual way before ratification 
 i repeat that the government inherit a situation in which the long term future of the military base be under threat this deal be root in a rational and hard head determination to protect uk security and that of our ally it will protect the base on diego garcia and cement the uk and us presence in the indo pacific for generation to come 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question it be incredibly disappointing that only a day after foreign office oral question ministers have have to be haul back to the house to explain what be go on yesterday at lunch time downing street brief that the agreement between the uk and mauritius under which the uk would give away the chagos island and pay for the privilege have be finalise that be not say in this house yesterday the prime minister of mauritius have also issue a public statement confirm that despite be interrogate on this botched deal in the chamber yesterday ministers give no indication of this very significant development 
 we be still completely in the dark about fundamental question of enormous importance how many billion of pound of hard press british taxpayer money will we be expect to fork out to lease back territory that we already own this come as vulnerable pensioner be have their winter fuel payment rip away and family farm and business be be punish with new taxis by this labour government what safeguard will be in place to protect the military base on diego garcia from other state that may try to establish a foothold on the archipelago minister have so far refuse to publish even a map of the buffer zone what happen to the vital military base on diego garcia at the end of the treaty and what kind of sovereign right if any will we be able to exercise over diego garcia in the meantime 
 the prime minister of mauritius say that he force change to the arrangement on the exercise of sovereign right and the lease extension will the minister finally   confirm that the account give by the prime minister of mauritius be correct he can not simply stand here and avoid these question the house do deserve answer so do the british public the taxpayer put simply the british indian ocean territory should remain british but labour have prioritise appease the whim of left wing lawyer and activist rather than stand up for our national interest it be high time this deal be ditch 
 finally there have be report of imply military threat to the chagos island a british sovereign territory labour members may laugh but this issue be fundamental to the security of our country from the regime in tehran the iranian regime have threaten this space these purport military threat be important we understand that in response to such report there have be an unusual build up of american bomber aircraft and equipment carry aircraft at the joint uk us military base on diego garcia this be very serious and we clearly need to take these threat seriously we would welcome clarity about the foreign office ’s diplomatic response on this issue 
 on parliamentary accountability for this issue i have answer no few than urgent question on the subject in the last month and i have answer write question from she and her colleague we discuss this twice at foreign commonwealth and development office question yesterday as i have repeatedly say when the detail of the treaty be finalise it will be present to this house and there will be full scrutiny in the usual way i have explain that a bill will be bring in to put into force the important aspect of the treaty that require legislative change and there will of course be full debate as there should be in this house 
 i simply reject the basis of much of the right hon lady ’s question as i have say repeatedly if there be not a problem why do the government of whom she be a part start negotiation and go through round of they there be a significant challenge and this deal be paramount for our national security we will not scrimp on our security and it be important that the deal be put in place as have be recognise by all the party 
 we will only agree a deal that be in the uk ’s good interest and protect our national security importantly the right hon lady ask about the security provision to protect the base these will include full uk control over diego garcia include control of the electromagnetic spectrum and unrestricted access to and use of the base as well as a buffer zone around diego garcia in which nothing can be build or put in place without our consent there will be a robust mechanism and review process to ensure that no activity on the outer island can impinge on the base ’s operation indeed there will be a prohibition on the presence of foreign security force either civilian or military on the outer island as the prime minister have say the full detail will of course be set out when the treaty be lay before parliament and that will include cost we will not scrimp on security 
 the right hon lady ask an important question in relation to iran she will understand that for operational reason and as a matter of policy we do not offer comment or information relate to foreign nation military aircraft movement or operation the uk in   close co operation with our ally in the united states closely monitor the security environment in the indian ocean region to identify and mitigate any potential threat to the base on diego garcia 
 i share the minister ’s bafflement at the opposition ’s utter obsession with this issue can he confirm that under the agreement the vital us uk military base and its operation will be completely unaltered 
 i share my hon friend ’s bafflement with so many issue go on in the world i do question the number of time this have be raise we have answer all the question before we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of the deal it be root in a rational and hard head determination to protect uk security and that of our ally once sign it will protect the base on diego garcia which be under threat and cement the presence of the uk and the us in the indo pacific 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 follow yesterday ’s intervention by president trump it appear that the white house have the final say on the future of sovereign british territory meanwhile the chagossians continue to be ignore the process of secure the deal have be shambolic chagossian have be deny their right to a say and it be shameful how they have be treat will the minister confirm whether there be any plan to ensure that the chagossians be finally include in discussion at this hour of the negotiation 
 hard work family around the country will rightly be question why the government seem to be willing reportedly to negotiate such significant payment to mauritius at a time when winter fuel payment have be scrap 
 the confected consternation of the conservatives be also bemuse give that it be their foreign secretary who signal the uk ’s intention to secure an agreement as the minister confirm the treaty must come before the house for scrutiny especially give its importance to our national security can he confirm when that will happen and that this house will have a vote on any final deal 
 it be absolutely right as i have say on many occasion that the new united states administration have a chance to consider the agreement we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of the deal we hear the comment that have be make and that be because it will fundamentally protect uk and us security interest i remind the hon lady that we have legal obligation with the united states in relation to the operation of the base and it be only right that it be consult with full engagement in the process 
 the hon lady ask about the chagossians we deeply regret as i have say many time the way chagossians be remove from the island but the negotiation be between the uk and mauritius with our priority be to secure the full operation of the base on diego garcia however we have work hard to ensure that   the agreement reflect the importance of the island to chagossians i have set out to the house a number of time the mechanism and system that will be in place to do that it be really important to respect the many different view within the chagossian community there be not settle view for example the chagos refugees group of the large chagossian group have in fact welcome the agreement 
 can the minister confirm that the confirmation of the legal status of the base on diego garcia will strengthen our influence in the asia pacific and put we in a strong position to counter the influence of china 
 i absolutely can our national security and that of our ally have be at the heart of the agreement there be a significant problem the former government know that which be why they start negotiate we have complete the deal with the full involvement of the united states and with consideration of all the important measure which i have set out on many occasion to keep the base safe 
 the minister know the regard i have for he but when he say he have appear at the dispatch box many time with this information he know that it have have nothing to do with give we information it mean he be drag here the question i want to ask the no question which be not cover in the detail he set out today be how much will taxpayer pay for this settlement and out of which budget will it come can he guarantee that at no stage will it come from the defence budget increase 
 as i say yesterday a financial element over year be crucial to protect the operation of such a vital base we will not scrimp on our security once the treaty be sign it will be put before the house for scrutiny before ratification in the usual way and that will include the cost the right hon gentleman ask where the budget be come from the term of the treaty and the associate funding arrangement be still be finalise financial obligation include departmental budgetary responsibility will of course be manage responsibly within the government ’s fiscal framework 
 do the minister agree that it be vital the uk government fulfil their obligation under international law do he recognise that the january bind judgment of the international tribunal for the law of the sea—[interruption]—which be hand down under the conservative government find that the uk ’s current administration of the archipelago 
 constitute a wrongful act and must be bring to an end as rapidly as possible 
 there do appear to be some confusion about the different legal judgment among the opposition as i can hear from the chuntering there be a number of way in which the operation of the base be not sustainable we be very clear that without a deal as the previous government recognise we would face serious real world operational   impact on the base that would erode our ability to operate key frequency vital for our own communication and to counter hostile state affect everything from overflight clearance to secure contractor with consequential rocketing cost decline investment and a degraded facility we be not willing to take that risk and have therefore secure this base for our security and that of our ally 
 the united states be busy increase its presence on diego garcia most recently with its b-2 spirit aircraft probably face towards iran give that how much will the trump white house be contribute to the endowment that the minister propose we hand to mauritius 
 as i have set out on a number of occasion and again today when we present the treaty we will present the cost and the arrangement and the house will have the chance to scrutinise they we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of this deal which be because it be root in a rational and hard head determination to protect our security and that of the united states and our presence in the indo pacific as i say before i be not go to get into operational discussion about matter at the base in relation to the presence of aircraft 
 i thank the minister and his team for their tireless effort to secure the future of this vital base which be exactly the right thing to do will he assure i that no less than the most robust of security provision will be in place 
 i can absolutely assure my hon friend of that fact it have be at the core of the detail of this arrangement we will retain full control over diego garcia and have robust provision to keep adversary out include unrestricted access to and use of the base for the united kingdom and the united states the buffer zone i mention the comprehensive mechanism to prevent activity on the other island threaten the base operation and a ban on the presence of foreign security force 
 in all inhabit british overseas territory british sovereignty flow in my opinion from the self determination of the islander and resident and that be exactly the same with the british indian ocean territory even though the population be displace british sovereignty flow from chagossians and their right to self determination i ask the minister again what effort he have make to engage with the wide possible constituency of chagossians and whether he will give they a veto over this deal if it be not acceptable to they 
 the island be not permanently inhabit and that be of the fundamental issue in this situation as i have say repeatedly we be do many thing that will be supportive of the chagossian community include engage with a number of different group there be a range of opinion and i think it be important that we recognise that there be of course some who support this deal we continue to put the interest of the chagossians at the heart of this agreement again full detail of that will be available in due course 
 yet again the opposition be attempt to sow division between the uk and its ally and indeed to share our ally sensitive operational information if they succeed it will have impact on our strategically vital relationship with the us and india do my hon friend agree that the opposition should consider wait until the treaty be ready for scrutiny rather than damage our vital national interest in this way 
 i completely agree i think some of the speculation have be hugely unhelpful we have be hugely grateful for the close co operation between the united kingdom and the united states throughout the negotiation and to the administration for their extensive and detailed engagement which have help we to make progress on this deal as my hon friend rightly point out this agreement have be welcome by other important partner include india china have not welcome it of course because it know that the agreement will strengthen the presence of the united kingdom and the united states in the region 
 today mark the anniversary of the start of the war in the falklands another key overseas territory government member keep refer to the non binding advisory judgment as the basis of the chagos deal if the argentinians be to seek a similar judgment against the falklands would the minister cede control 
 i have to say as i have say on a number of occasion in this house that such attempt to make a false comparison be extremely unhelpful and would not be welcome by the resident of the falkland islands i can absolutely assure the hon lady that our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the falkland islands be absolute and iron clad i have make that clear on many occasion as have the minister for the armed forces and the government as a whole 
 will the minister confirm once again that any agreement that be make will return to this house for scrutiny 
 my hon friend ask a very important question as i have set out there will be multiple opportunity for this house and the other place to consider this matter not only through the normal constitutional reform and governance act process but through the bill that will be bring forward to make the necessary provision under the treaty which will go through the normal process full scrutiny will be afford to member of this house 
 the president and vice president of the united states have make clear their detestation of country freeload on defence and security matter we be not ask for the detail we be not even ask for the quantum but we do deserve to know in this house today whether the government have ask the us to contribute to the base on diego garcia that be so vital to it yes or no 
 as i have say on a number of occasion we welcome the us endorsement of the deal and of its strength and we be grateful for the close   co operation between the united kingdom and the united states the full detail will be provide when the treaty be present to the house 
 i thank my hon and gallant friends the members for north east derbyshire louise jones and for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for their question can the minister confirm that this agreement will close potentially dangerous route for irregular migration be that possibly of the reason the conservatives open and preside over round of negotiation on it 
 i can absolutely confirm that that be also why we agree an important arrangement as an interim with st helena which i have speak to the house about that have absolutely be at the heart of it but our primary objective have be to protect the national security of the united kingdom our ally the united states and our partner 
 i want to go back to the question from the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison and for beverley and holderness graham stuart and indeed the question i ask the minister the last time this issue be raise in the house the minister be well aware that what we be talk about be primarily a us base surely he can at least tell the house today that conversation have be hold with the us and that it fully understand that a compensatory package will be make and that there be a question over who will primarily contribute to that package can he make that clear to the house today 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the answer i give a moment ago we be absolutely clear that the united states recognise the strength of this deal we have have excellent co operation with the us throughout the full detail will be provide in due course 
 not only be the government prepare to give away sovereign british territory but they be prepare to pay for the privilege of do so by hand over billion to mauritius the minister can not say where the money be come from but can he at least agree that that money would be well spend restore the winter fuel payment to pensioner in need and relieve social care provider hospice and charity from their national insurance increase here in the uk rather than be hand over to mauritius 
 quite frankly the hon member neglect to mention the shocking mess that his former government leave we to inherit i have be clear in this house on many occasion that we will not scrimp when it come to the national security of this country whether that be in relation to diego garcia or investment in defence and our armed force that be exactly what my hon friend the minister for the armed forces and the defence secretary have be set out on our wide defence spending what we be do in this deal be protect our national security and defence and that of our ally the united states 
 the minister will have hear the feeling of the house so can he provide we with the specific guarantee that the foreign secretary have secure in relation to prevent hostile state such as china from increase their influence in the chagos island while we as a nation be still pay for they 
 the hon member have ask an important question and i have answer it a number of time to reiterate there will be robust security provision in that regard that be why china have not welcome this deal we will have full uk control with the united states over diego garcia we will have a buffer zone around diego garcia and we will have a robust mechanism to ensure that no activity in the outer island can impinge on the base ’s operation crucially there will be a prohibition on the presence of foreign security force on the outer island either civilian or military 
 what a disgrace this shabby chagos deal be turn out to be labour be not just give away our national security they be go to pay billion to mauritius for the pleasure instead of raise taxis on people and business in this country why do the minister not stand up for britain and stop this deal 
 we be stand up for britain by defend our security and that of our ally and we will not scrimp on that it be critical to secure the operation of this base it be crucial to our interest and that of our ally as i have ask many time if there be no problem why do the hon member ’s former government start negotiate over this 
 this be perhaps a question for the minister for the armed forces who i notice be also on the front bench on the buffer zone can the minister state categorically that it will be sufficiently wide to protect all the capability on the base 
 yes 
 surrender sovereign territory base on a non binding legal judgment and fork out taxpayer money for the privilege what kind of deal be that it be do behind closed door evade the scrutiny of this house do the minister agree that this deal be a prime example of what happen when we have a government of lawyer for lawyer rather than a government for the british people 
 i simply reject the premise of the hon member ’s question the government inherit a situation where the effective operation of the base be under threat claim that we negotiate this deal simply because of the international court of justice advisory opinion be wrong that be not the only challenge that we face as the previous government know without a deal mauritius would have inevitably pursue a legally bind judgment and there would be huge implication from that not have a deal would affect the real world operational functionality of the base which be so crucial to our national security and that of our ally 
 the minister make reference to the uk have full control over diego garcia but early this month i receive this response from he 
 the right to operate and maintain the naval support facility diego garcia be hold by the government of the united states this include function as be necessary for the development use maintenance operation and security of the facility 
 will he explain what control we would have over naval support facility diego garcia in the event that us and uk defence priority do not align and at what level the control over the base lie 
 the hon member ask an important question the us operate its naval support facility and although i will not get into the operational detail of that for obvious reason the full detail will be provide i can absolutely assure he that we will have control over diego garcia and will be work closely with the united states over it 
 as we come to the end of this urgent question i be still no clear on the substance of this disastrous deal so the house must now make assumption give that the minister be sit next to the minister for the armed forces can we assume that this deal will be come out from the ministry of defence 
 naturally the foreign office and the ministry of defence work closely together on this matter as indeed department do across all government i have be very clear that the term of the treaty and the associate funding arrangement be still be finalise the responsibility will be manage responsibly within the government ’s fiscal framework as for understand the reason for this deal and why it be necessary i suggest that the hon member ask some of his formerly ministerial colleague on the conservative benches 
 the minister be an incredibly honourable man and he be much like in this house so i say this with all gentleness my constituent be tell i that the deal with the indian ocean territory be overwhelming and that the cost factor be   something that they can not quite understand and neither can i. do the minister understand why pensioner in my constituency and across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be wonder why at a time of reduced help and aid the government be hand over sovereignty of land and then rent it back at a cost to the public purse will the minister outline where the money will come from when it have be decide that pensioner and ill people on personal independence payment can not have the support they deserve due to the lack of money within government 
 i know that the hon gentleman ask his question with sincerity and he be much like in this place too i suggest that he make it clear to his constituent that a financial element to this deal be crucial to protect operation it be crucial for the security of his citizen in strangford and the citizen of the united kingdom and of the united states and our interest overseas some of the figure that have be quote in the medium be simply inaccurate and of course this will happen over a year period we will not scrimp when it come to our security it be important that we invest in it and that be exactly what this government be do 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 be it relevant to the question we have just have 
 it be link to the comment of the liberal spokesperson   the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire in her question to the minister she note that the winter fuel payment have be scrap this be simply not true the winter fuel payment have not be scrap it have be mean test and to say otherwise be misleading it be similar to when the liberal democrat tory coalition government mean test child benefit 
 order i think we have get the gist it be a point of clarification rather than a point of order and the hon lady have get it on the record let we move on 
 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary to make a statement about the israeli government ’s announcement that they be expand their military operation in gaza 
 we be deeply concerned about the resumption of hostility in gaza the uk do not support an expansion of israel ’s military operation continue fighting and more bloodshed be in nobody ’s interest all party include israel must observe international humanitarian law we urge all party to return to dialogue and ceasefire negotiation ensure the return of all who have endure unimaginable suffering it be clear that this conflict can not be win by bomb and bullet but by diplomacy 
 aid should never be use as a political tool israel must restart the flow of aid immediately block good supply and power from enter gaza risk breach international humanitarian law and it should not be happen we be do everything we can to alleviate that situation gaza be also the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker over aid worker have be kill since the start of the conflict despite renew fighting the united nations and humanitarian organisation must be able to deliver their vital work 
 a year on from the appalling attack on world central kitchen aid worker lesson have not be learn we be appal at recent attack on aid worker which include the attack on a united nations office for project services guest house and the killing of at least palestinian red crescent medic our thought be with the victim and their family those responsible must be hold accountable the government of israel must urgently ensure that there be effective deconfliction mechanism in place to enable agency to deliver their impartial mandate safely 
 on   march the uk and france call an urgent un security council meeting to discuss the risk face humanitarian aid worker in gaza since the hostility resume the foreign secretary have speak to secretary rubio special envoy steve witkoff the israeli foreign minister gideon sa’ar the israeli minister for strategic affairs ron dermer the eu high representative kallas and the un emergency relief co ordinator tom fletcher 
 a return to a ceasefire be the only way we will bring the conflict to an end and return to negotiation for a last peace in the region that be the only way to deliver the state solution that we all want to see both israelis and palestinians have the right to live in peace and security 
 the israeli government ’s brutal decision to expand their military operation in gaza be not about security it be about domination and erasure it come on top of month of collective punishment include since   march the long aid blockade since the war begin i welcome the minister ’s confirmation that the uk do not support the israeli government ’s expand military operation in gaza will he now finally name   what be happen as genocide and undertake a structural investigation into genocide and other crime under international law commit in israel and the occupied palestinian territories 
 to ensure that the uk be not complicit in israel ’s ongoing genocide illegal occupation and system of apartheid will the minister immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply sale or transfer include transit and tran shipment to israel of all weapon munition and other military and security equipment will he immediately suspend the provision of training and other military and security assistance and recognise that otherwise there be a clear risk of contribute to the commission of serious violation of international humanitarian law and international human right law include crime under international law 
 as the minister mention the uk be a significant provider of humanitarian aid to the region what assessment have he make of the impact of today ’s report on the humanitarian crisis although he touch on this lightly give the uk ’s level of influence with israeli authority will he confirm that he will use his position to actively oppose current and planned attempt by israel to establish a permanent military presence in gaza and to oppose move to alter gaza ’s border and demographic make up or to shrink its territory include through any expand buffer zone and construction of permanent checkpoint 
 the hon lady ask a series of important question as i have say to the house on a number of occasion determination of breach of international law be for competent court and we support those court in their work 
 on weapon i want to be clear that we continue to stand by the assessment that we make soberly in september and the suspension of license that that involve the hon lady ask about the uk ’s view on a permanent presence in gaza i be happy to restate our policy now we welcome the proposal by arab nation call the arab initiative which would allow for a reconstruction of gaza the safe return of palestinians who have be displace and for those remain in gaza to rebuild their life without forced displacement which we oppose 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 we have have several urgent question and statement on gaza over the last few month each time i have come to the chamber and ask the government what be plan b what be plan b when israel end the ceasefire which be what have happen what be plan b when israel ’s far right government choose their survival over the life of the remain hostage which be what seem to have happen what be plan b when annexation of either the west bank or gaza be not just threaten but actually happen which be what be happen now my question be this what be the government do to turn our ally head from american trade war and towards the tragedy unfolding in the middle east to do whatever they can to restore a ceasefire and the road to peace 
 my right hon friend who have be press on these issue for some time be right to raise those question she ask whether there be a plan b. in   all of my experience there can be no plan b in israel palestine there be only route which be widely understand by our ally in the region and beyond and it must be a state solution the route to a state solution must involve compliance with international humanitarian law 
 it be clear even from the short exchange that we have already have in the chamber that the british government ’s policy and the israeli government ’s policy differ they will continue to differ until we return to a pathway to a state solution there be no plan b. our plan a be for a state solution and we will work with our ally in the region on the security council as we do on friday and close to home in order to pursue those argument 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 thank you for grant the urgent question mr speaker this be clearly a difficult and dangerous moment for the middle east a way must be find through the dreadful impasse that have lead to the breakdown of the ceasefire agreement 
 as have be say time and again the key to a sustainable end to the conflict be the release of the remain hostage so cruelly hold by hamas terrorist since the atrocity of   october their continued captivity be intolerable the british government should be able to bring their influence to bear and the foreign secretary should be directly involve in all effort to find a way through work with israeli counterpart the us and key regional player and mediator country we say that in the chamber yesterday 
 the minister state yesterday as he have today that the government be 
 in regular contact with all those involve in negotiation ”—[official report   april vol c. 
 that include the foreign secretary who speak to his israeli counterpart last week will the minister inform the house what direct minister to minister discussion have take place about the current military operation be ministers inform in advance and have they be give any information about the objective that israel be seek 
 every week we come here to ask question of ministers and it be unclear exactly what level of influence the government have what be the government ’s plan what be their vision of a way through what discussion have they have in recent day with vital interlocutor 
 on humanitarian aid do the minister feel that he have make any progress in his effort to try to unblock the current aid access situation we have speak about this many time will he update the house on what have be happen to british aid while the restriction remain where be that aid
