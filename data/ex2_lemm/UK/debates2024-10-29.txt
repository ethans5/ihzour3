 in my own speech i will lay out why i stand to represent my home of erewash my plan for my time in parliament and why i love the area it be now my honour to represent by the way before i start in earnest for the information of all member present the constituency be pronounce eh ruh wash or occasionally eh ree wash but never under any circumstance ear wash i look forward to see how that be record in hansard 
 i begin my speech by thank my predecessor maggie throup for her effort in serve the people of erewash over the past year maggie work diligently for our community consistently lobby for funding to support our town and village give her background in the health sector maggie regularly contribute to health policy throughout her tenure and she serve the nation admirably through the latter stage of covid-19 as vaccines minister while maggie and i rarely see eye to eye on policy our relationship across the political divide have always be courteous and collegiate and i wish she the very good for the future 
 i would also like to pay tribute to my colleague liz blackman who serve erewash as our member of parliament throughout the last labour government liz ’s guidance during my campaign to become the mp for erewash be invaluable and i be sure i will continue to seek her advice throughout my tenure 
 in my month in parliament as i have meet colleague from across the country the question i have most frequently be ask be what even be an erewash anyway name for the river and the canal we comprise town ilkeston and long eaton the village of breaston draycott risley sandiacre and stanton by dale and other community in sawley kirk hallam and cotmanhay more often though i find it easy to answer with a reference to our geography simply we ’re junction of the m1 
 like many town that operate as a binary star ilkeston and long eaton exist in a delicate balance with resident of ilkeston or ilson as we call it regularly declare long eaton get everything it be probably no surprise then madam deputy speaker that if you spend minute talk to someone in long eaton you would similarly and resoundingly hear the mantra ilkeston get everything i should note that i have sanitise these statement somewhat reference to the other town in my constituency be often a little more colourful 
 in truth both of our town have be hard do by in the past year despite the hard work of incredible and passionate teaching and support staff for example many of our school struggle with underfunding something i witness at hand when i train as a secondary physics teacher both high street have decline and while town funding be help to support long eaton ’s regeneration the underlie problem remain antisocial behaviour crime shopkeeper force out by online giant and a general malaise and the feeling that nothing will fix the foundation 
 despite the difficulty we face i would like to explain why erewash be a fantastic place by pay tribute to the people and the group in our town who be do everything they can to lift the area up by its bootstrap people like joe cahill who by liaise with shopkeeper and landlord through a local facebook group focus on incredible independent shop have empower our community and begin restore ilkeston as a thriving market town similarly i commend the work of paul opiah and other in build the new friends of ilkeston town centre provide grassroots regeneration to our town the effort of joe and paul have be fantastic and i want to provide they with more support joe recently note that he have do as much as he could without change the law to bring the remain rot shop unit back into service unit that be currently hold hostage by absentee landlord i be therefore excited about the government ’s proposal to revive our town centre and i will do everything in my power to support local people in their effort 
 in long eaton i pay tribute to scott clayton and his team who have create a beautiful new community focus on support mental health through the joy of song where man of all ability can come together to sing and discuss their issue it be a pleasure during my campaign to become a member of parliament to join scott and the bluetonic community and to dive head out of my comfort zone to sing with new friend 
 i also pay tribute to chris and jackie brookes along with the team at long eaton rugby football club the club serve long eaton so well provide access to sport in our local park for child and adult and support local charity and the armed force community after grow substantially over the past decade in the man ’s game in the woman ’s game and now with its new mini side long eaton rfc have become a pillar of our community 
 then there be lindsay rice and her team who have build a food bank and a lunch club and be on their way to create a brand new ilkeston carnival through their every eats institute alongside the collective church in long eaton that have similarly support those in our community struggle through poverty lindsay recently ask i adam as a food bank when be you go to shut we down i respond as soon as possible lindsay as soon as possible 
 erewash have a thrive veteran community and as a member of the royal british legion i be very proud that our current mayor councillor kate fennelly be a royal air force veteran i recently meet the local charitable trust forces veterans afloat which do incredible work housing veteran for whom brick and mortar be not the answer on narrowboat as a cadet warrant officer in cardiff squadron atc for much of my childhood i have long support our force and veteran without and the citizenship leadership and community spirit instill in i by the wide cadet movement i would not be stand here as a member of parliament 
 erewash be the birthplace of many national star from douglas houghton baron houghton of sowerby who serve our country in the world war and in harold wilson ’s government as the last british cabinet minister bear in the century through to robert lindsay who have play countless part include the infamous wolfie in citizen smith and the former   prime minister tony blair we also have bru c who today be put long eaton on the map in the grime scene our town village and people be fantastic but they have be let down by the previous government by politician and by their country 
 so what do i bring to this place and what do i hope to do for erewash my background be in academia and education in my previous day job i teach engineering apprentice at the university of nottingham i work there for a decade specialise in metrology research and train the next generation of world lead manufacturer i believe i be the metrologist elect to this place metrology be the science of measurement and definitely not meteorology as i say in the opening quote to my phd thesis it have nothing to do with cloud 
 erewash and the wide east midland have long be the engine of our nation ’s manufacturing base produce everything from drain cover look down on nearly every street in the country to see the logo of the famous stanton iron works to the fine lace wear by the princess of wales on her wedding day produce by cluny lace in ilkeston to tunnel for hs2 make by sateba uk and composite motorsport and aerospace component from atlas composite i want to see an expansion of our manufacture base through an industrial strategy and reform of the apprenticeship levy so that we can cement erewash ’s position as a centre for advanced manufacturing 
 we also need new infrastructure to build the new home to support our local economic growth which i be glad to see the government commit to as the stanton industrial regeneration site grow i will fight every day for infrastructure work we need a new junction on the m1 to support the grow industry in the area and to reduce the impact on resident in sandiacre and ilkeston who currently endure a huge volume of heavy good vehicle pass through the town 
 i be proud today to support the great british energy bill for year my constituent in erewash have suffer through rise bill because of our exposure to dictator control fossil fuel market now that ratcliffe on soar power station just outside my constituency have burn its final lump of coal i look forward to the investment in our community that gb energy will bring and the reward that will reap in energy security clean power and new job 
 it be the most incredible honour for i to represent my home of erewash i would not be here without my partner my family my friend and my incredible campaign team who by constant repetition of our mantra of be point behind under any circumstance begin the process of change our country for the well come from a background of education and science i look forward to contribute to evidence base policy debate and apply my scientific training in this house stand here i feel the weight of my community the weight of responsibility and the weight of the need to deliver a well future for my constituent and the whole country throughout my tenure i will always be guide by reason not dogma by the scientific method and by a desire to serve 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what step she plan to take to help improve living standard 
 what step she plan to take to help improve living standard 
 what step she plan to take to help improve living standard 
 what step she plan to take to help improve living standard 
 this be likely to be the last time that the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt be up against i at the dispatch box we have have the privilege of these exchange for just over year now and i have a huge amount of respect for he he steer our country through a very difficult time after the mini budget and i wish he well in whatever he choose to do next 
 if uk living standard as measure by real household disposable income per capita have grow by the same amount between and as they do between and the amount would have be over £ high in we be commit to boost economic growth to turn that around although it will have be welcome news for million of family that inflation be now below there be still more to do early this month we deliver our international investment summit announce over £ of investment and unlock nearly job in the uk all focus on create and spread opportunity to lift living standard 
 the conservatives oversee a living standard disaster in place such as hexham prudhoe and throckley in my constituency people see hardly any improvement to their income in over year surely the clear sign of whether government be work be whether work   people feel well off do the chancellor agree that paper over tory failure be not enough and that in tomorrow ’s budget we must reset the foundation of our economy 
 my hon friend be right the previous parliament be the bad ever record for living standard tomorrow ’s budget be an opportunity to fix that and turn the page so that we can start deliver for family in hexham and all around the country 
 the bottom of the population own less than of wealth in while the top stack up of it up from in in our community the less well off be struggle with energy price and other cost what will the government do to ensure that the gap close 
 we have already announce the child poverty taskforce which be work to publish a comprehensive strategy to tackle child poverty we will publish that strategy in spring next year we have also provide £ include the barnett impact to extend the household support fund in england until the end of march next year which will help the most vulnerable household to cover the cost of essential such as food energy and water 
 shamefully under the last conservative government the need for food bank soar to level even high than during the pandemic recent research show that in my bathgate and linlithgow constituency the number of food parcel distribute have rise by over the past year and that in of child be live in poverty after housing cost what step be the government take to reduce the need for food bank in the context of child poverty 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and congratulate she on her great work on the co op ’s food justice policy as she know we be right behind she in our commitment to raise living standard across the country we make a manifesto commitment to update the remit of the low pay commission so that for the time ever it will take into account the cost of live when make recommendation about the minimum wage 
 as my right hon friend will be aware coastal community such as mine struggle with a low pay low skill economy do she acknowledge the importance of the minimum wage in tackle this problem and support our community and local economy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be why we will ensure that the low pay commission take into account the cost of living and why we will close the gap between the youth rate of minimum wage and the overall rate so that all adult can be pay a fair wage for their work 
 the live standard of a year old pensioner on a £ income be fall sharply this winter as a result of the chancellor ’s decision to take away the winter fuel allowance tomorrow she have the chance to increase the threshold will she take it 
 as the hon lady know because of our commitment to the triple lock the basic state pension and the new state pension will continue to rise this winter the new state pension be worth £ more than it be a year ago and it be likely to rise by a further £ next april indeed during the course of this parliament because of the triple lock the new state pension be likely to be worth £ more much more than the value of the winter fuel payment 
 i be sure that the treasury be pleased to receive £ in a windfall tax from octopus energy would the chancellor consider use that money to reinstate the winter fuel allowance for year until the treasury have have the opportunity to find a well system of mean testing so that my vulnerable resident and pensioner in chichester be not fall off a cliff edge this winter 
 i can understand the hon member ’s concern but of course that £ be already bake into the forecast it be not new money to spend on initiative as she know we inherit a £ black hole in the public finance we will set out the detail of that at the budget tomorrow but because of that we have have to make very difficult choice even in those difficult circumstance though we have protect the winter fuel payment for the most vulnerable pensioner who be on pension credit we have also boost the uptake of pension credit so that people get the support they be entitle to 
 resident of joseph rowntree ’s st ellens court all gather recently to tell i about the devastating impact that the cut in the winter fuel payment will have on their living standard and people in withernsea gather saturday last to demonstrate against it tomorrow the chancellor can do the right thing will she 
 i be sure the right hon gentleman tell they about the £ gap in the public finance that his government leave which have require the difficult decision this government have have to make to clean up the mess leave by the conservative party 
 with the promise £ cut in energy bill not materialise the winter fuel payment scrap for pensioner and now the bus cap lift for work people whatever definition of that term the chancellor be use today can she honestly say that living standard will improve for everybody under this government 
 on the bus price cap specifically the hon member will know that the previous government put no money in to extend that cap we have put money in to ensure that the bus price cap remain at an affordable level for people unlike the previous government who just have short term gimmick 
 what estimate she have make with cabinet colleague of the additional funding need to process pension credit application within target timescale 
 the department for work and pensions have deploy additional staff to process pension credit application as quickly as possible and i encourage all pensioner who might be eligible to apply by   december as the hon gentleman know that benefit can be backdate by month and can passport pensioner to other benefit 
 i be very grateful for the minister ’s answer i put in a write question to find out how long this would take and almost in people who apply for pension credit be wait long than working day for their application to be pick up which take we past christmas and into the new year that be before the increase in application refer to in the datum release by the government so although i be pleased to hear that there be more staff could we hear how much extra funding be go in immediately to make sure those application be process this side of christmas otherwise pensioner be really go to struggle 
 i be very pleased to say that there have be a increase in the number of pensioner who be apply for pension credit that be good news and be a result of the pension credit awareness campaign that we have be run since early september we be put in place all the resource we can to process claim as quickly as possible 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we on the conservative benches be deeply concerned about all those who will lose their winter fuel payment under labour some pensioner will keep the winter fuel payment if they claim pension credit but we know that some will not apply or will have difficulty apply can the minister confirm how many people the treasury assume be eligible for pension credit but will not claim it therefore lose their winter fuel payment and what be the treasury do to close that gap 
 as the hon gentleman will understand the estimate of how many people might be eligible for pension credit be an imperfect science they be base on a survey mean testing what be a very complex benefit as all mean test benefit be require an assessment of not only people ’s income but their saving it be about pensioner household unit too so it be a complex set of procedure all i can say be that i be glad we be target support at those most in need something that be outline in the conservative party manifesto which state 
 we will mean test winter fuel payments focus assistance on the least well off pensioner who be most at risk of fuel poverty 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as the newly appoint treasury spokesperson for the liberal democrats this be my opportunity to welcome the chancellor and ministers to their place notwithstanding that on the winter fuel payment the government need to think again i recently speak with representative of citizens advice in st albans who be deeply concerned that letter from the department for work and pensions will   be send out only in december to people that it believe be eligible mean that many people may lose out we have urge the government to either reverse the cut and make it taxable or look at for example raise the pension credit limit could the government confirm whether they be go to look again at any of the measure that we have suggest 
 i welcome the hon lady to her place i reassure she that we be write to all pensioner i do not know where she get that misinformation from about the change in policy for the time we be also write to all pensioner in receipt of housing benefit to encourage they to claim for pension credit 
 we have also make a steadfast commitment to the triple lock which will mean that the new full state pension will be worth around £ more over this parliament we have extend the household support fund which local authority can use to help people who be on low income and struggle with their fuel bill we have also ensure that the warm home discount scheme will provide £ for low income household include pensioner

 the hon gentleman can see our commitment to support vulnerable household with the cost of energy and food in our extension of the   household support fund at a cost of half a pound from the end of september to the end of march that will allow local authority to help low income family with the cost of essential such as food and energy 
 this nation experience the high rise in energy bill of all g7 country after putin invade ukraine because the conservatives leave we dependent on natural gas and with the worst insulate home in western europe can the minister assure i that we will invest in the clean energy and home insulation that we need to lower energy bill for good 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to say that while it be essential that we tackle high energy bill now it be also essential that we invest for the future to bring energy bill down for good critical to that be invest in our housing stock as i have mention but also through gb energy in sustainable energy source to make sure we improve our energy security and bring bill down for family across the country 
 what step she be take to help ensure sustainable public finance 
 in july a treasury assessment of public spending show that this government inherit a £ black hole in the public finance i take immediate action—[interruption those on the opposition benches may not like it but it be true interruption 
 order i can not hear the chancellor and i will hear the chancellor 
 there be not many conservative member but they still make quite a lot of noise 
 i take immediate action by identify saving and make reform to the spending and fiscal framework to ensure that never again can a government be allow to make unfunded commitment and to leave their successor with a massive black hole as the leader of the opposition and the previous chancellor do as my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury say to the house yesterday the budget will confirm the detail of the robust fiscal rule this be set out in our manifesto and will set out tax and spending plan alongside an update forecast from the independent office for budget responsibility 
 do my right hon friend agree that be honest and transparent about the state of public finance be the right thing to do and that have a long term plan to fix the foundation of our economy and the public finance be preferable to the short term chaotic approach take by the snp in scotland which have lead to consecutive year of emergency in year budget cut 
 this government be commit to sustainable public finance unlike of the opposition party a stable economy build on stable public finance   be a key foundation for growth which be why labour be on the government benches and the snp and the tories be on the opposition benches the robust fiscal rule set out in our manifesto will put the public finance on a sustainable path so that we can move the budget into balance with day to day cost be meet by revenue and get debt fall as a share of our economy give our challenge inheritance that will require difficult choice but this government will make they to fix the foundation of our economy 
 the last government leave eastbourne borough council in a position in which it spend 49p in every pound it collect in council tax on temporary accommodation we need a solution because that be not sustainable for council or family will the chancellor commit to support council with the cost of temporary accommodation and to invest in prevent homelessness in the place 
 the hon member be absolutely right the number of people house in temporary accommodation be a scandal and the amount that cost taxpayer in eastbourne and around the country be a double scandal we make a commitment in our manifesto to build home during this parliament conservative members oppose that but we be determined to do it because that be the way to bring down the cost of temporary accommodation and ensure that all family have a safe and secure roof over their head 
 my right hon friend be right about the challenge it will be for the government to balance the public finance a stiff target of in year efficiency saving have be set for departments what be she do to make sure that the target be robustly apply and that departments do not game it by put off decision which will end up cost more 
 i thank the chair of the treasury committee for that question she be absolutely right that in our july statement we set a productivity target not just for the department of health and social care as the previous government do but for all departments minister be absolutely determined to deliver against those target because that be the way to ensure that we have resource for the frontline public service our school hospital and police that we all rely on 
 under the last government the chancellor say that interest rate and gilt yield be drive by government policy will the chancellor guarantee that neither will rise high than they do under the conservatives 
 the last government crash the economy with a mini budget and send interest rate and mortgage rate soar put huge pressure on the cost bear by family and business we will set out our budget tomorrow include robust fiscal rule on pay for day to day spending through tax receipt and borrow only to invest whereas the previous government borrow for day to day spending which be why we be in the mess we be in today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last wednesday in washington the chancellor announce change to the debt rule to allow labour to borrow more however publish treasury advice say that increase borrowing risk interest rate stay high for long do the chancellor agree with her treasury civil servant 
 last week when i be in washington i be very pleased to hear the international monetary fund say how important it be that country include the uk borrow to invest in their capital infrastructure under the plan we inherit from the previous government capital spending as a share of gdp be due to fall from to if those decision be to go forward it would mean plan delay and cancel we will set out our plan tomorrow in the budget but it be crucial that we have rule ensure that we pay for day to day spending through tax receipt and that we borrow only to invest unlike the previous government 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of recent fiscal event on investor confidence in the uk 
 the conservative party oversaw year of chaos which cost not only family but business the government be commit to deliver the economic stability need for investor confidence our commitment to a credible budget strong institution and robust fiscal rule be at the heart of that plan early this month we announce a record break £ of investment at our international investment summit that show that the uk can attract investment from around the world to boost job and growth here in britain through serious stable government policy 
 when do the chancellor think that the conservative party lose its fiscal credibility be it with the liz truss mini budget interruption be it when national debt rise from to nearly of gdp or be it when they make the farcical promise to abolish national insurance 
 order who want to go for that cup of tea normally this happen at prime minister ’s question i do not want it start in treasury question 
 all of the above that be why my hon friend be in his place and conservative members be on the opposition benches 
 if the chancellor want to increase investor confidence the thing to do be help small and medium sized enterprise tomorrow she will have the opportunity to do that what will be do to help they in northern ireland of business employ or few employee if she help the sme in northern ireland that will increase employment 
 i know that the hon gentleman be a proud supporter of business big and small in his constituency and across northern ireland i will set out   more detail in tomorrow ’s budget include on business rate but i recognise how important it be for we to support small business so that they can grow and create job right across the united kingdom 
 i call the shadow minister 
 clearly the chancellor be desperately try to raise old ghost along with debt and taxis but her own broken promise be come back to haunt she and be frightening investor it do not have to be halloween for socialist to spook british business why do she think that business confidence have fall fast in the past month than at any point since the pandemic 
 i would judge this government on their record we secure £ of investment right across the united kingdom create nearly job in constituency up and down our country good job that pay decent wage that be more than twice the investment that the previous government secure at their international investment summit that show how important it be to return stability to economy and work in partnership with business something that the conservative party might want to learn a lesson from 
 what fiscal step she be take to support pensioner with the cost of living 
 more than pensioner will be protect by this government ’s commitment to the triple lock with the new full state pension expect to increase by around £ over the course of this parliament pensioner also benefit from free eye test free nhs prescription and free bus pass 
 we know that no impact assessment be carry out prior to the decision to cut the winter fuel payment but be any consideration give to the burden that the daunt application form place on the elderly and the extra burden on charity such as age uk which advise they on complete it evidence of that daunting burden be the limit to uptake over the past decade will she work with her colleague to simplify the application process ease the burden on those who be lose the winter fuel payment and help they receive the broad benefit that pension credit provide 
 i think the minister get it in the minute never mind the last 
 the government do an equality analysis on the change which be publish in september i recommend that the hon gentleman take a look at it it be such a long question that i have forget what he ask on application form 
 order let ’s move on 
 rise 
 order what be the hon gentleman stand for i hope he be not i call blake stephenson 
 what taxis she class as taxis on work people 
 what step she be take to minimise taxis on work people 
 as hon member know any change to tax policy will be set out in tomorrow ’s budget member will also know that our approach to fix the foundation of the economy will be that protect work people this labour government will honour our commitment to protect work people by not increase national insurance basic high or additional rate of income tax or vat 
 the government have get into an absolute pickle over the definition of work people people deserve certainty in mid bedfordshire we be proud of the hard work of the owner of nearly small business they be work people create job and grow our economy and all while provide for their family they be lie awake at night worry about yet high taxis will the chancellor give they a peaceful night ’s sleep ahead of tomorrow ’s budget and confirm that she will honour her manifesto commitment not to raise taxis on they 
 i do not think i be pre empte anything tomorrow by confirm that the chancellor will absolutely stick to our commitment not to raise taxis on work people through national insurance the basic high or additional rate of income tax or vat and i might add that what people and business in the hon gentleman ’s constituency might want be stability in the economy a government who support investment in the economy and a government who will get the economy grow and make people across britain well off 
 in bury north child poverty rate be at densely populate in of our ward bury east redvales and moorside do the minister agree with i that minimise tax rise for work people be just the starting point and that tackle the crippling level of impoverishment for those in work require a laser focus and intervention from this mission drive government 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that while keep taxis on work people as low as possible be crucial the way to make people well off in the long run be through boost public and private investment and deliver sustain economic growth that be the focus of this labour government and that will guide the choice we make 
 i call the shadow minister 
 during the election campaign i hold a press conference at which i outline the glare funding gap in labour ’s plan and the taxis they might raise to pay for they of those taxis be employer national insurance contribution   the right   hon member for bristol north west darren jones now chief secretary to the treasury respond at the time by argue that this be a list of thing that labour be not do be it correct that raise employer national insurance contribution be something labour be not do 
 the right hon member will have to wait for the budget tomorrow she be a minister not that long ago so she might still remember that the budget be the time when such announcement be make let i restate our commitment so it be crystal clear that we will protect work people by not increase national insurance income tax or vat might i add very briefly that i note the conservatives suddenly have a new find interest in the livelihood of work people it be a shame frankly that they never prioritise that during their year in office during which time and again they make work people pay for their mistake 
 what step she be take to help ensure value for money in public spending 
 the government have launch a multi year spending review to set out our long term plan for public spending and to ensure that every pound of taxpayer money be spend effectively the phase of the spending review be due to report this week alongside the budget and phase will begin shortly after the budget 
 i thank my right hon friend for his response recent national audit office report have reveal the extent of the tories economic mismanagement over the past year that have put capital project such as bingley pool in my constituency at risk as a member of the public accounts committee i will ensure that taxpayer money deliver value will the minister assure i and my constituent that tomorrow ’s budget will be base on an honest assessment of the public finance so that this government can deliver on their promise 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i can confirm that the budget tomorrow will be an honest assessment of the mess leave to this country by the conservative party but crucially our plan for clear up the mess and then deliver the change we promise 
 give that i assume everyone in the chamber have eat at some point today do we think that back britain ’s farmer be a good use of public money and give that there be a £ budget for british farming which the last government underspent foolishly recklessly and carelessly will the chief secretary guarantee that at the very least the farming budget will be protect so that our farmer can carry on look after our nature and feed we 
 actually i do not have breakfast today so i be look forward to lunch and i therefore welcome that short question from the hon member this government be commit to farming and rural   affair and to the production of the food that they provide for we which be important for security of supply as well as in due course for my lunch 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 tomorrow i will present my budget it will be a budget that fix the foundation of our economy and deliver on the promise of change it will turn the page on low growth and will be the start of a new chapter towards make britain well off it will mean more pound in people ’s pocket an nhs that be there when they need it and business create wealth and opportunity for all 
 i commend the chancellor for recently outline investment in social housing but in the interim the joseph rowntree foundation have state that the previous government ’s decision to freeze local housing allowance rate will push private renter on housing benefit include child into deep poverty during this parliament will the chancellor now consider unfreezing the allowance and relinke it to the actual cost of local rent so that those family can keep their head above water 
 my hon friend make a really important point which i think be familiar to all of we in our community about the cost of housing outstretche people ’s income in our manifesto we commit to build new home include social housing which be so important and can give security to people who would otherwise be leave in insecure housing in the private rented sector 
 as this be his farewell question time let we now come to the shadow chancellor 
 this be indeed our final exchange in the house so before tomorrow ’s firework i wish the chancellor well for the future in her role there have be a lot of common ground between we for example before the election she say that raise employer national insurance be a job tax that would take money out of people ’s pocket i very much agree with she on that do she agree with herself 
 the right hon gentleman know well than almost anyone else that there a be £ black hole in the public finance that will require difficult decision but even in those circumstance we will do everything in our power to protect the income of ordinary work people so we be committed to ensure that no work people will see high taxis in their payslip after the budget 
 we all know why the chancellor be invent this fictitious black hole time this year before the election she promise not to raise tax and now she be plan to present the big tax raise budget in history more consensually however as this be our final exchange i welcome her announcement last week of a £ loan for ukraine do she agree   that the strong signal of resolve that we can send to putin be a commitment to spend of gdp on defence and do she understand why so many people be worry by the fact that she have yet to do so 
 i have always respect the right hon gentleman but i think it be important for we not to deny the seriousness of the situation that we face with the black hole in the public finance combine with the lash out at independent economic institution it suggest that he have more in common with liz truss and kwasi kwarteng than perhaps we think i watch my party lurch towards an ideological extreme and deny reality and we spend year in opposition as a result the shadow chancellor risk take his party down the same path 
 my constituency ’s beer and pub sector make a significant contribution to the economy both locally and nationally our pub and brewery generate £ in tax receipt each year will the chancellor work with the sector to unlock its growth potential in newcastle under lyme and across our country 
 i know that newcastle under lyme and indeed the whole county of staffordshire have a proud brewing tradition and my hon friend will be an excellent champion of brewery in his constituency support pub and brewery be very important for i as a minister indeed on my day in the treasury ’s darlington economic campus i visit durham brewery it be a work visit where i hear from the society of independent brewers and associate about the huge contribution that brewery make to british society further detail will be set out by the chancellor tomorrow 
 the chancellor recently announce an extra £ for the school rebuilding programme can she now confirm that all the school on that programme include bramhall high school be fully fund and will get their repair soon 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i go to school in the 80 and 90 and i be teach in portacabin because there be not enough room in my school i know how important it be that child be teach in proper facility we will set out more detail of our capital investment at the budget tomorrow 
 i would like to ask a question that come out of local government of the frustration that i find after year in local government be that short term cut can often end up cost more in the long run an example that always come to mind be youth service what do the chancellor make of the local government association ’s call for spending on prevention to be routinely consider in both treasury and departmental spending decision and for well tracking of long term outcome 
 my hon friend be right to point out the opportunity for improvement as the chancellor set out in her    july statement prevention will be at the heart of this government ’s new approach to public service reform that will be set out in the spending review in the come month 
 many household be face homelessness due to increase household cost what support can the chancellor provide to they 
 build the home that our country need be a top priority for this government in our manifesto we commit to build home in this parliament include social housing so that people have access to secure and affordable accommodation and that every family have a roof over their head we will set out more detail on all of this in the budget tomorrow 
 prior to be elect to this place i be the leader of south ribble borough council in lancashire where we continually struggle to set meaningful budget due to the fragmented short term policy of the previous tory government will minister please assure i that the proposal be consider in tomorrow ’s budget will see an end to the fragmented annual public sector funding allocation and a reintroduction of meaningful forward think multi year settlement 
 the government recognise the significant pressure that all council be face we be look at consolidate funding stream for local authority into the local government finance settlement and we will work towards implement our commitment to a multi year financial settlement 
 during my send summit in bodmin on saturday teacher and parent reveal the shocking extent of our break special educational need system in north cornwall and across the county thousand be struggle to get the support to which they be entitle what be treasury ministers do to ensure that local council and school be properly resource to deliver an effective send system so that family finally get the support they need and deserve 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question this be an issue that resonate right across the house with so many of we hear terrible story at our surgery about the lack of support for some of the most vulnerable child in society i know that it be a priority for the education secretary too and we will set out more detail on departmental settlement in the budget tomorrow 
 there be over pub and brewery in my constituency support more than job and contribute million of pound to our economy whether it be the mulberry tree farm in hampton or the windmill in orton waterville these be value business that have earn their place in our local community do the chancellor agree that they deserve to be support and that this labour government will give hospitality the tool it need to thrive 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be absolutely right to say that pub make an enormous contribution to our society and economy the current alcohol duty system support pub through draught relief which ensure that eligible product serve on draught be charge less duty the government be commit to deliver a fairer business rate system for high street include hospitality any decision on future tax policy will be announce by the chancellor at a fiscal event the next of which be tomorrow 
 per cent of those who have see labour take away their winter fuel payment be either below the poverty line or within £ a week of it how can the government justify this when they be not even allow a freedom of information request from the financial times to be respond to they be hide the figure from the people 
 we be not hide the figure if i have have the chance i would have say that pensioner be pay the high rate of tax and that be pay the additional rate many wealthy pensioner have say to i that they do not need the winter fuel payment—[interruption the right hon gentleman say that but there be a number of 
 order i think the minister have answer the question i call emma foody 
 resident in my constituency be still feel the pinch in their pocket and pay packet from liz truss ’s disastrous mini budget it be vital that this government fix the foundation of our economy to deliver proper public service and a rise in living standard can the chancellor tell i how she will deliver this for the north east and for people across the country 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the disastrous impact of the conservative mini budget just over year ago which be still have an impact on people ’s life as they pay high mortgage bill this government have commit to return sustainability to the economy and to work with business to reform our planning system our pension system and our skill system we have already bring in £ of private sector investment to grow our economy in all part of the country and deliver the job and well wage that constituent in cramlington and right across the country need to see 
 small business owner be work people and they be some of the hard work people that i know the labour party struggle to define they over the weekend but do the chancellor agree that any rise in fuel duty which the conservative freeze or cut for year would be a tax on those hard work people or those hard work small business owner 
 the previous government factor into their forecast an increase in fuel duty this year i will set out our plan in the budget tomorrow 
 can the minister update the house on how the government will help to secure well return for pensioner while also unlock the opportunity for pension saving to help generate growth 
 the chancellor launch the landmark pension review in july which i be lead and which be look at measure to drive more uk pension investment into the uk economy boost growth but also improve pension saver outcome i know that there be interest in this agenda across the house 
 countryside alliance research show that rural household spend up to £ a year more on fuel than urban household so far to the question from my hon friend   the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti will the chancellor protect rural community in the budget tomorrow 
 the hon gentleman be urge i to comment on the budget but he will have to wait until tomorrow 
 this government have inherit a britain that be now the most unequal country in the g7 bar america the uk ’s rich family own of the country ’s wealth and our tax system exacerbate this inequality with unfair loophole that benefit those who have wealth rather than those who go to work what step 
 order—[interruption no these be topical question and i decide 
 my hon friend will have to wait for the budget tomorrow but he will know that we have commit to close some loophole include vat on private school the non dom loophole and crack down on tax avoidance 
 in south devon the average house price be now time the average salary at £ what measure be the chancellor take to ensure that rural and coastal area such as the south hams which face huge digital and transport connectivity problem will be include in measure to boost economic growth 
 our commitment to build home be about ensure that all our constituent get the chance to have a roof over their head include in rural area with more social housing as well so that people can have a secure tenancy the hon lady be also right to raise the issue of digital connectivity and we will be set out more detail on infrastructure investment in the budget tomorrow 
 buy now pay later be attractive to young people who be try to survive on hour contract with irregular hour what assurance can the chancellor give i that the come regulation will protect this group from problematic debt 
 the propose regulation will drive high standard of conduct among buy now pay late firm ensure that consumer receive clear information and have access to strong protection our proposal will also allow the financial conduct authority to require buy now pay late firm to carry out affordability check ensure that firm lend only to borrower who can afford to repay 
 during the last election campaign labour candidate across somerset say that a labour government would cut energy bill by £ will the chancellor set out the timescale for fulfil that promise 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i note the number of labour mp we now have in somerset and across the south west of england we will set out more detail in the budget tomorrow but our commitment to invest in home grow energy will boost our energy security create good job here in britain and begin to reduce people ’s bill as will our programme to well insulate home which the previous government fail to do 
 a council in england have come together to call for key change to unlock much need investment in new council home they will welcome the news of £ of additional grant and change to the right to buy rule but issue they also raise be housing revenue account debt and finance will treasury ministers look specifically at debt allocation and how hra debt be account for to unlock much need investment in council home 
 council housing revenue account be a significant part of local authority finance and it be therefore not right to exclude they from our fiscal rule but i reassure my hon friend that this government ’s commitment to deliver new home will be deliver 
 however work people be define do the chancellor not accept that people on low income and part time employee who earn up to £ a week should be exempt from pay income tax 
 we will set out detail of our tax policy in the budget tomorrow but this government have make a commitment to work people that we will not increase their income tax their national insurance or the value add tax they pay 
 i have note the medium report an assertion from downing street that the pre announcement of budget measure be entirely routine for the avoidance of doubt i be always happy for minister to come to the house to make announcement in the run up to a budget this discourtesy arise when those announcement be make elsewhere 
 urgent question to ask the prime minister if he will make a statement on whether minister disclose policy to the medium before the budget be in contravention of the ministerial code ’s statement that the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the instance in parliament 
 mr speaker i reassure you that what you say yesterday and indeed what you say a moment ago have be hear not just by i but across government 
 the government take their obligation to this house very seriously yesterday the chief secretary to the treasury make a statement to the house on the fiscal rule in which he make it clear that detail will be announce to the house in the chancellor ’s budget statement tomorrow alongside an economic and fiscal forecast produce by the independent office for budget responsibility treasury ministers have also answer question in the house this morning 
 the chancellor will come before the house tomorrow to set out in detail the government ’s budget to fix the foundation of our economy and the house will then have a further day of debate on the measure announce in that budget throughout it all member of this house will see a government who be committed to fix the foundation to deliver the change our country so desperately need this labour government will invest in britain ’s future so that we can rebuild the national health service and our country while ensure that work people do not face high taxis in their payslip 
 the response from no yesterday and labour ’s whole argument seem to be we do   it because you guy do it but i be old enough to remember a fresh faced prime minister come into downing street and promising change labour justify its action base on thing that the conservatives have do do not seem like the change we be promise do it we be learn the lesson of why we lose the election but this government seem to be take lesson from the bad bit of our record and not just our from the last labour government too it be like the great hit of government mistake be replay in just day 
 cronyism be it blair no it be the fresh faced labour government give civil service job to donor a gross betrayal of pensioner be it brown no it be the new chancellor decide that those on £ be rich and do not need their winter fuel payment rampant politicisation of our institution be this not something labour accuse boris johnson of no it be the chancellor again who say this weekend that the ex prime minister and ex chancellor will have to answer to the office for   budget responsibility despite the obr say that the report have nothing to do with previous ministers and lead the times to argue that the obr have be reduce 
 to the provisional wing of the treasury press office 
 disrespectful statement emanate from no.10 about your decision mr speaker not the conservative party but the no press office just yesterday and potentially breach the ministerial code with abandon about budget leak right again it be this government 
 this government ’s false piety have be breach comprehensively by the downing street pass scandal and crony appointment to the civil service and their hypocrisy have be lay bare for all to see yet still they bleat on about the tories like some broken spell they mutter over and over again in an attempt to conjure up the old magic but it be not go to work labour be so obsessed with play political game that its member find themselves go over the budget simultaneously claim that the conservatives spend too much but also spend too little it be nonsense 
 the question that i want to ask the government today be who be go to take responsibility for the budget leak what assessment have the government make of whether this be a breach of the ministerial code 
 as i have say i have the deep respect for this house and its member the come day will be very important to debate the budget in full i be sure right hon and hon member will forgive i if i have a degree of cynicism about the conservative party ’s new find passion for parliamentary convention give the number of time it fail in its year in office to update the house ahead of major announcement 
 the truth be that conservative member be desperate to speak about anything other than the appalling mess in which they leave our national finance there be many group of people who i would listen to on budget management but certainly not member of the party that crash the economy we would think they might have learn some lesson from attack independent financial institution but they have not the shadow chancellor and the shadow chief secretary to the treasury be attack the office for budget responsibility once again 
 family in my constituency and across the country be still pay high rent and mortgage cost because of the mini budget year ago that create and wreak such havoc on our economy unlike the conservative party this government will never play fast and loose with the nation ’s finance tomorrow we will see a budget focus on investment to get the economy move again this government will take the long term decision need to rebuild britain and   fix our school hospital and our broken road the conservatives have not change all they offer be   decline and more austerity with work people pay the price 
 in bury north rent and mortgage be still sky high as a direct consequence of the economic legacy of the last conservative government do the minister agree that it be no surprise that the conservatives want to talk about anything other than their economic record 
 i certainly do agree i be sure it will come as a surprise to right hon and hon member that of the conservative ’s former chancellors decide to comment on the september fiasco what do kwasi kwarteng say the other day okay my budget be n’t perfect”—the master of understatement 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be a sad state of affair when the run up to the budget of this new government so closely resemble that of the previous government with consistent leak and briefing to the medium rather than announcement be make where they should be in this house so that member can scrutinise they on behalf of their constituent the previous conservative government do so much damage to trust in politic include by consistently undermine the ministerial code will the minister put thing right and toughen up the status of the code by enshrine it in law 
 we have already say that the prime minister will publish an update ministerial code shortly there be a stark difference between this and the previous administration the approach of the previous be probably well characterise as if you break the rule try and change the rulebook but we on the labour benches take the ministerial code seriously that be why we want to ensure that it be fit for purpose deal with problem such as the tory freebie loophole and meet the high standard that the prime minister expect of all who have the privilege of serve in his government 
 i be sure the whole house will welcome the constructive response from the minister today will he confirm that the former conservative treasury front bench team have to have paragraph of the ministerial code draw to their attention twice this year in both april and may it be do as they say not do as they do 
 my hon friend be absolutely right frankly when i hear conservative member talk about ethic and standard in government i think that irony have die 
 can we take it that the government do not think that the chancellor ’s announcement in america last week be important i think most people in this house feel that it be therefore if it be important do the chancellor break the ministerial code 
 the chief secretary to the treasury make a statement to the house yesterday the entire treasury team have be here answer question today the chancellor will deliver a budget tomorrow and we will have day of debate on it i doubt that the house have see so much of the treasury team since the tories be force to deliver emergency budgets in september 
 my constituent in north east derbyshire be still pay the price of the mini budget with rise in their mortgage   and rent do the minister agree that the conservatives should be talk about that and hold themselves to account rather than throw out chaff to distract everyone 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in the contribution of the shadow chief secretary to the treasury word be noticeably missing sorry 
 as chair of the procedure committee in the previous parliament i make a point of make sure that when ministers have breach the rule it be clear to they that both the committee and other be very unhappy will the minister confirm that he will make sure that the revise ministerial code make it clear that announcement need to be make to this place as have always be the case 
 with the great respect to the right hon lady she will not have long to wait for the ministerial code in my opening remark to mr speaker i indicate my respect for this house in regard to the matter that she be talk about 
 the chutzpah from conservative members be quite incredible do the minister agree that although they make a point today about process they totally ignore the office for budget responsibility ahead of the disastrous mini budget which be still cause immense pain to my constituent 
 absolutely it be no surprise that we have a conservative party that want to talk about process but it will not take responsibility for the £ black hole that it leave in our finance 
 yesterday mr speaker you make the strong statement of condemnation on a subject of this sort that i have hear from the chair in year in this house the minister be a decent chap and for all i know he may be a skilled cricketer but he must admit that he be bat on a sticky wicket today do he understand that if his defence be just to say we do it because the previous party do it nobody will ever break this cycle his party have a big majority it could just say sorry and resolve to do well in future 
 i have a great deal of respect for the right hon gentleman i be not a cricketer as it happen so i can not comment on the condition of the wicket with regard to mr speaker i do initially set out in my remark today my respect for what he say both yesterday and today and my respect for member of this house 
 i think we all understand that conservative member be desperate to talk about anything other than their record of year of failure in government we hear from hon friend and opposition members how those failure be affect constituent every single day my question be what next how will the conservatives distract we next 
 my hon friend be entirely right about the conservative party ’s desire to distract from its record whether it be the lockdown party or   the ppe vip lane for contract this government be appoint a covid corruption commissioner to get the public ’s money back 
 those of we who have be in this place for some time will remember the outraged indignation of the now government when they be in opposition every time the now opposition pull a stunt like this the only constant be you mr speaker and your effort to have whichever of they be in power treat this house and its member with respect can the minister not see that the government display such arrogant contempt for the rule only feed the public perception that be as bad as the other rather than deliver the change it promise the labour party be really say it ’ our turn now 
 the hon gentleman can not possibly be say that there be any comparison with breach the rule during the covid pandemic he really can not that be not a serious proposition nor be it a serious proposition to suggest that this be comparable with the money that be lose in the ppe vip lane it really be not 
 despite the rumour be spread include by the conservative party can my right hon friend confirm that not a single change to taxation have yet be announce and that they will in fact be announce at the budget tomorrow 
 as my hon friend say the measure will be announce at tomorrow ’s budget in the normal way with the office for budget responsibility ’s economic and fiscal forecast the conservative party may denigrate the office for budget responsibility but this government respect our financial institution 
 can the paymaster general confirm that the chancellor receive £ worth of free clothe and declare they as office support be a breach of the ministerial code 
 rise 
 i must say the conservatives have learn absolutely nothing they trash ministerial standard and standard in this house when in government interruption 
 order mr shannon you be mean to sit down again 
 the conservatives trash standard in government my suggestion to they be to reflect on the past year 
 i be very grateful to several conservative members for admit to quite a lot of the mistake that they make in government people in my constituency be still pay the price in their mortgage and rent for the disastrous conservative economic record be it any wonder that the conservatives be so desperate to speak about anything other than their disastrous record 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the conservatives will talk about anything but their own record be it any wonder that they do not conduct a spending review before they call a general election the reality be that they make unfunded spending commitment and then run away 
 a remit of the new modernisation committee be to enhance the ability of member of this house to hold the government to account in the light of the failure that have be exhibit over recent day would the minister be in favour of refer this issue to the modernisation committee 
 i be not aware that financial mismanagement by the conservative party be a matter for the modernisation committee but it should certainly be refer to something 
 like other i be surprised to hear that conservative members recently rediscover their moral compass the that they lose perhaps when the former prime minister send out the bring your own bottle invite to downing street when he spend taxpayer money jet his girlfriend around the world or when they unlawfully suspend this place perhaps the minister agree that there might be another motivation do   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott   want to keep her job next week 
 of course we wish   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott   well for the reshuffle next week as ever my hon friend make a very persuasive point the conservatives will talk about anything apart from their record 
 at pm last night the government announce a £ increase in funding for radiotherapy as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for radiotherapy i very much welcome that but would it not have be well and right for the government to make a statement to the house so that the policy could be properly scrutinise that £ equal about linear accelerator but it will take linear accelerator just to replace those that be go out of date this year it will not meet the need of people live in rural community such as mine we desperately need a satellite radiotherapy unit in kendal so that people can get to treatment quickly will the paymaster general put that lack of scrutiny right by arrange for a health minister to meet i and the rest of the all party group so that we can work closely to take forward those plan together 
 i will certainly pass on that request to the relevant health minister put aside the point that the hon gentleman make about scrutiny i be sure that he join we in welcome the focus on radiotherapy and there will be a real desire to work on it with he across party line 
 i be elect to keep the promise that we make in our manifesto the conservative party break nearly every promise that it make in its year in government do the minister agree that it be only right for this government to confirm that we will honour the pledge we make at the election 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i be afraid that trust be of the many thing that the conservative government destroy over year and this government be determined to rebuild it 
 the chancellor the education secretary the health secretary and the work and pensions secretary have all make significant announcement to the medium and not to the house will those breach of the ministerial code be investigate why have the prime minister not yet publish an update version of the ministerial code be the government still work out whether it be right to accept suit and glass 
 we have already say that the prime minister will update the ministerial code and publish it shortly to ensure that it be fit for purpose deal with problem such as the tory freebie loophole as i have say and meet the high standard that the prime minister expect 
 we hear a lot about year of failure but it seem to i that this government have have year to learn how the ministerial code work in reality the announcement make by the chancellor last week move the market bond yield go up which mean that mortgage and people ’s bill have go up the right thing for the government to do be to apologise 
 we will see the impact of what the chancellor announce tomorrow and in the day afterwards the ministerial code will be publish shortly that stand in stark contrast to what the previous government do i watch from the opposition benches as they try to tear up the entire rulebook to protect of their friend that be not something that we will do 
 after your statement yesterday mr speaker i think you will have be as disappointed as i be that when the chancellor come to the chamber for treasury question this morning she fail to apologise for the serious and important announcement that she have make outside the house without deflect any far by talk about the previous government ’s record will the minister promise now that the ministerial code and the speaker of this house who represent we all will be respect by the government 
 of course this government respect both mr speaker and the ministerial code but i make no apology whatsoever for hold the conservative party to account for its record
