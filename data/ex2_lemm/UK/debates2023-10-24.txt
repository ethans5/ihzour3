 labour stand in solidarity with the people of sudan who want only peace justice and democracy and who reject the general war what be the government do to support civilian organisation include the sudanese community here in the uk to build unity in opposition to the conflict and military rule 
 it be not just labour that stand in solidarity but the whole house and the whole country in respect of the civilian leadership i speak last friday to abdalla hamdok the civilian political leader he and many of his colleague will meet in addis ababa this week we very much hope that those meeting will yield some progress 
 the all party parliamentary group on sudan and south sudan have hear how people in darfur still face daily bombing killing rape pillage and torture member of the darfur community here be deeply worried about the ethnic cleansing what be happen to try to reduce the flow of weapon and to get urgent humanitarian aid to the people who desperately need it

 what recent discussion he have have with the government of israel on the situation in gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with representative of the palestinian authority on a state solution 
 what recent report he have receive on the situation in israel and palestine 
 whether he have have discussion with his israeli counterpart on the a compatibility with international law and b proportionality of israel ’s response in gaza to the attack by hamas 
 what recent discussion he have have with the government of israel on the situation in gaza 
 what step his department be take with international partner in the middle east in response to the situation in gaza and israel 
 since hamas ’s brutal terror attack on   october my right hon friend the prime minister and i have visit the region and have speak and meet extensively with counterpart total almost country as part of our extensive diplomatic effort to prevent escalation to sustain the prospect of regional peace and to secure the free movement home of british national in gaza and the release of hostage 
 it have be report that the palestinian authority be to pay up to $ a month in so call martyr salary to the family of dead and capture hamas terrorist will my right hon friend join i in condemn those payment to rapist torturer and murderer some of whom have kill brit will he use his good office to ensure that no british aid money have go towards this filthy practice 
 i can reassure my hon friend that we always ensure that uk aid money be protect from misappropriation i can confirm to he and the house that no british aid money go directly to the palestinian authority we have raise this issue with the palestinian   authority and highlight our belief that it be not conducive to good relation and a future state solution 
 what be the prospect of a state solution give the pace of israeli settlement on the west bank 
 the government ’s long stand position be that we oppose settlement expansion for the reason i have highlight extensively in the conversation that i have have with the israeli government and the leadership of country in the region despite the terrible circumstance we be experience there be a renew desire for a meaningful resolution that mean that the terrible image that we see on   october   will never be repeat 
 close to constituent have contact i deeply concerned about the situation in gaza the humanitarian crisis that be unfold and the need for a ceasefire nearly people have die in gaza include child while the whole house rightly condemn the hamas atrocity we must be unequivocal in our condemnation of violation of international law will the foreign secretary set out in what circumstance he believe it be legal for israel to cut off water fuel food and electricity in gaza 
 there be always much debate in this house about the interpretation of international humanitarian law i have raise directly with my israeli counterpart the need in whatever action they take to secure their protection defend israeli citizen and secure the release of hostage for they to act in accordance with international law i have receive assurance from the israeli president to that effect 
 there have be countless reiteration from the israeli authority include in a joint speech with the prime minister last week that they be take precaution to avoid civilian casualty however more than palestinians have be kill in gaza in the last day palestinian life matter so what more action other than just repeat promise about civilian protection be the foreign secretary ’s department take meaningfully to ensure that innocent palestinians be keep safe 
 i be on record mourning the palestinian life that have be lose in this conflict just as we mourn and i mourn the loss of israeli life in this terrible situation i can assure the hon gentleman that the uk government take the loss of life from whichever community incredibly seriously 
 i remind the hon gentleman and the house that hamas routinely and consciously put civilian in harm ’s way specifically to generate fatality that they then use as part of their medium operation we be conscious of that and the israeli armed force be conscious of that that be why they explain to i they have give notice of future area of military operation we have see evidence that hamas be routinely prevent palestinians from leave area that be go to be engage by the israeli defence forces 
 in contrast to the last question from the opposition benches i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state and our prime minister   for their important recent visit to our ally israel the government ’s unequivocal message that israel have the right and must be able to defend itself against the hamas terrorist group be right and just what step be my right hon friend take to support israel in its effort to secure the release of the plus captive still hold in gaza include any british citizen can the secretary of state ensure that they receive immediate assistance from the international red cross 
 my hon friend remind the house that the government remain focused on the protection of british national in israel the west bank and of course gaza it would be inappropriate for i to go into detail but i can assure he and the house that we speak with all party who we believe could have influence on those hold hostage hamas palestinian islamic jihad and other it be incredibly difficult we do not have direct line of communication but we will not rest we will not rest in try to secure the release of hostage and the evacuation of british national from gaza 
 i be clear that the international community back by the un must now work together to dial down the rhetoric open humanitarian corridor encourage restraint and protect life will the foreign secretary commit the uk to expand the abraham accord as a priority which will not only bring strategic partner to the table but may offer a future peace between israel and palestine 
 i have say regularly how much i value the abraham accord the improving of relationship between israel and the arab nation in its near neighbourhood be an extremely positive step there be a realistic belief that part of the aim of the attack of   october   be to derail future normalisation and negotiation again i think that highlight the fact that hamas be not a friend to the palestinian people they be not try to improve relationship between israel and the arab world they bring down the oslo agreement and they have consistently block all attempt to normalise relationship between israel and the wide arab world we must not let they win in that endeavour and we must work to bring peace between the palestinian people and the israelis 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i have be inundate with email from constituent terrify for the future of the internally displace palestinians in gaza since   october nearly internally displace person have be shelter in united nations relief and works agency facility unrwa staff have be kill and unrwa installation have be damage when the ground invasion inevitably start where be these people mean to go who be expect to host they who will administer they and where will the support come from finally and fundamentally what do the foreign secretary believe be the israeli politician long term objective 
 all the conversation that we have have with israel with egypt and with intermediary who be able to maintain line of communication with   hamas have be about the preservation of human life let i put this on the record once again we completely support israel ’s right and indeed duty of self defence we be only just start to see the scale of the brutality video evidence retrieve from those individual who brutalise and murder israeli citizen on   october   have now be put in the public domain and it be bad than any of we could have imagine we absolutely stand by israel ’s right to self defence and we have say that we want to work with israel with egypt with the country in the near neighbourhood and of course with those who be the de facto government in gaza to minimise civilian casualty we have have that commitment from israel we have have no such commitment from hamas 
 since i raise this question with the prime minister last week indiscriminate airstrike and a total siege block food water and medical supply have kill thousand of innocent palestinian man and woman and more than child let we be absolutely clear in this house this be now beyond a humanitarian catastrophe even as we stand here today innocent blood continue to be spill on the street of gaza and mosque church school hospital bakery water plant and home continue to be flatten by the israeli military 
 i have a very simple question for the foreign secretary just what will it take how many thousand of innocent palestinians must be slaughter before this government condemn the brutality and bloodshed 
 we have consistently say that we want to minimise further loss of life and the life lose among the palestinian people be of course something for which we grieve but we must never lose sight of the fact that during the period since   october thousand of rocket have be fire from gaza into israel indeed accord to an assessment that we now have of the most high profile loss of life in gaza which be cover extensively by the british and international medium be likely cause by a rocket emanating from gaza and target israel while i respect the hon gentleman ’s passion about the preservation of life and i assure he that i share his passion we must be thoughtful and we must remember why this be happen it must not be forget that the single large murder of jews since the holocaust be initiate by hamas who then put palestinians intentionally in harm ’s way as part of their operation 
 of the appalling hallmark of the terrorist attack by hamas on the state of israel have be hostage taking and we be now see hostage take increasingly be use in state sponsor terrorism with that in mind and give the number of british hostage who be currently be hold do my right hon friend the foreign secretary think that now be the time to appoint a prime ministerial envoy for hostage with full diplomatic immunity so that the british state can keep in touch with britons who be be hold and use our soft power to negotiate their release 
 my right hon friend raise an important point we have of the large and most effective diplomatic network so our diplomat on the ground   be often well place to initiate those negotiation but he raise a good point and i will take his suggestion seriously 
 i like many other have receive hundred if not thousand of email from my constituent express their despair at what they be see happen in gaza it be more than a humanitarian emergency do the secretary of state agree with labour ’s call to work with international partner to give un agency such as unrwa the long term resource they need as well as to insist that fuel be allow into gaza 
 the prime minister my right hon friend the development minister and i have have extensive and regular talk on ensure that humanitarian supply get to the palestinian people in gaza indeed the development minister have virtually daily conversation with martin griffiths the head of the office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs and the prime minister have recently announce an additional £ of humanitarian support on top of our pre exist £ make we of the most generous contribute nation to humanitarian support for palestinians in gaza 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 george mitchell the great american peacemaker say that diplomacy be 
 day of failure and day of success 
 labour recognise the hard quiet diplomacy require to secure the release of hostage and eventually long term peace but in this bloody war we can not afford day without success overnight we see report of the possible release of hostage only to learn that those talk have stumble can the foreign secretary update the house on the progress to secure the release of all the hostage so cruelly take by hamas terrorist 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for the calm professionalism that he have display throughout i can assure he and the house that this remain an absolute focus of our attention it be raise by the prime minister by i by my right hon friend the development minister and by other in our bilateral conversation with leader around the region and i can assure the right hon gentleman that we will stay relentlessly focused on this 
 the situation in gaza be heartbreaking and deeply troubling do the foreign secretary agree that israel must follow the law of war by take every possible step to protect civilian and by ensure that aid be rapid safe and unhindered that block to water food medicine and fuel be lift immediately and that palestinians who be force to flee be not permanently displace do he also agree that uphold these law be not just a legal and moral obligation but necessary to prevent israel ’s campaign from undermine long term prospect for peace and stability 
 i can assure the right hon gentleman that that be exactly the tone of the conversation we be have the preservation of civilian life remain a priority and we discuss this regularly and at every level with the   israeli government of course we reflect on the point that israel itself as well as the country in the near neighbourhood be try to prevent this from become a regional conflict as i say professionalism and restraint by the israeli defence forces be an important part of prevent this from become a regional conflict 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 have the secretary of state see any evidence be make aware of any evidence or have reasonable ground to believe that israel have breach international humanitarian law in its response to the hamas atrocity on   october 
 i be not in a position and indeed it be not my role to make an assessment of the interpretation of event that be unfold as we speak there will of course be assessment of the nature of international humanitarian law we be try to make sure that in all of its action for its legitimate self defence israel abide by international law 
 if it be not the foreign secretary ’s responsibility to make that assessment i wonder whose it be he know that international humanitarian law be unambiguous in say that the collective punishment of a civilian population be illegal be he tell we that he be unaware or have see no evidence that people have be force from their home and that their water food power and access to medicine have be cut off or be he actually say that all of this have happen but the uk government have unilaterally decide that international humanitarian law do not apply to this conflict 
 the hon gentleman undermine his own question by make the assertion that his interpretation of international humanitarian law be by default to which i have to subscribe his definition of what be happen be not that i necessarily agree with 
 whether he have receive report on the potential role of iran in provide financial and other support for hamas for terrorist attack on israel 
 whether he have receive report on the potential involvement of iran in provide support for hamas for terror attack on israel 
 hamas be responsible for these appalling terrorist attack we know that iran have be a long term funder and supporter of hamas hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad iran ’s support for these militant group have a destabilising impact on regional and international security and we remain ever watchful of its action 
 i be grateful to the foreign secretary for that answer iran ’s fingerprint be all over hamas ’s brutal massacre in israel iran ’s blatant arming funding worth $ a year and training of terror group   around the region be no secret hamas ’s leader have even publicly lavish praise on iran and the islamic revolutionary guard corps for their support do my right hon friend agree that we must be absolutely clear about the threat pose by iran abroad and at home and that now be the time for a policy reset 
 i completely agree with my hon friend ’s assessment of iran ’s malign influence the government and the fcdo be well aware of this and i can assure he that we have be clear eyed throughout the work we do with regard to iran and its influence in the region we will remain ever watchful i be sure that no reset be require because we be very conscious of iran ’s impact on the region 
 what diplomatic effort be his majesty ’s government take to protect and indeed enhance the abraham accord in the light of the fact that the iranian regime be clearly seek to engender discord and indeed conflict in the middle east 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the abraham accord have be a force for good we need to protect they and ideally enhance they anything that see great co operation between israel and the arab world have to be a step in the right direction when it come to the creation of a sustainable state solution i can assure he that we remain focused on that outcome 
 this government have rightly impose sanction on those state and organisation that support terrorism can the secretary of state therefore clarify that if it be find follow an independent investigation that israel have also break international law and commit war crime in gaza his government will consider the introduction of appropriate sanction 
 the hon gentleman invite i to speculate about our future response to future event at the moment i be deal with event in the here and now i be try to prevent loss of life i be in constant conversation with the leadership in the region to try to prevent further israeli and palestinian loss of life 
 yesterday i have the privilege of meet family whose loved one have be take hostage they come here to share their testimony which be deeply move they raise the fact that iran be very much behind this so why have we yet to proscribe the irgc it be time a year ago so it be surely time now what be the excuse for wait 
 i have a huge amount of sympathy for the plight of the family who have either lose love one or have love one who be still hold hostage in gaza i will be meet family who have member hold hostage later 
 as i have say regularly we be well aware of iran ’s influence any decision about proscription will be a cross government decision the advantage and disadvantage of proscribing will always be at the heart   of any decision make process but as the hon lady know we do not comment on future sanction or proscription designation 
 follow on from the question of   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran i emphasise that labour have be call on the government for many month to proscribe the irgc evidence be emerge of iranian involvement in the hamas terrorist attack in israel we also understand that the united states have call on the united kingdom to follow its example i therefore press the foreign secretary when will the government act by use either exist terrorism legislation or a new process of proscription direct at the irgc 
 i remind the house that the irgc as well as certain individual who be member of it be sanction in its entirety as i say in response to the question of   the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran no international measure come without cost there be advantage and disadvantage to proscription which fundamentally would mean that we could have no direct diplomatic relation with iran as i have say we always take those issue seriously and any decision will be make cross government but we do not speculate on future sanction or proscription designation 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to provide rapid resettlement route under pathway of the afghan citizen resettlement scheme 
 the fcdo have refer more than people under acrs pathway to the home office we be support more than afghans in country for instance with accommodation and we be grateful to pakistan for the work we do together to that end of course we remain committed to relocate all eligible afghan family to the uk we be work closely with the home office and the department for levelling up housing and communities to ensure that they all have suitable accommodation on arrival 
 before i ask my supplementary question i would like to put on record that my thought be with everyone who be affect by the disturbing scene we have witness in israel and palestine 
 shortly after the evacuation in afghanistan i tell ministers that many of my constituent have relative in afghanistan who work for the british government what be the minister do to keep the government ’s promise of further support for those who help the uk ’s mission in afghanistan 
 we continue our diplomatic effort include through support those afghans in country we have relocate more than afghans under the afghans relocation and assistance policy arap and the acr and we will continue to do that 
 last week the government make the right decision to lift the quota for pathway thus allow all eligible british council contractor to come to the uk however many contractor and their family be wait in pakistan for clearance to come to the uk because accommodation have yet to be arrange may i urge the government to resolve that housing issue urgently give the pakistani authority threat to return the contractor to afghanistan next month that would be a disaster and we need to sort it out now 
 we be acutely aware of the challenge to which my hon friend allude we be work at pace with our mission in pakistan and we be seize of the natural justice require and the fact that we need to do our duty to those people that be why the full pace of our institutional effort be focus on do just that we look forward to keep colleague update 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i too wish to put on record my solidarity with those who be live in fear and heartbreak in gaza and israel 
 the withdrawal from afghanistan be an absolute debacle it be a continue source of shame to this country that so many people who help we trust we rely on we have be absolutely abandon we be hear horrify report from those who have do the right thing and take terrible risk to escape to pakistan who be now live in constant fear of arrest or deportation because this government have leave they in limbo my question be simple how many be still wait and how much long will they have to wait 
 respectfully we have not leave they in limbo the situation be extremely difficult it be difficult because of the depredation of let i be very clear the tyrannical regime of the taliban that be why we be in this situation we have relocate more than people and we continue to work at pace with our mission in pakistan and elsewhere to ensure that these people despite the local trouble and difficulty get the support they need 
 what step his department be take to support the monitoring of potential human right abuse in a israel and b the occupied palestinian territories 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help ensure access to gaza by humanitarian organisation 
 what diplomatic step he be take with his international counterpart to help open humanitarian corridor in gaza 
 what step his department be take to help ensure the safety of a palestinian and b israeli civilian in the gaza israel conflict 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help ensure access to gaza by humanitarian organisation 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help ensure access to gaza by humanitarian organisation 
 i talk to martin griffiths the head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs almost every day and on friday i attend a meeting with development ministers convene by samantha power the head of the united states agency for international development 
 how be the foreign secretary and his ministers work with international counterpart to prevent any deliberate targeting of civilian and civilian infrastructure in israel and palestine 
 by draw all party attention to the international rule of war 
 at a vigil outside parliament this morning the name of some of the more than child kill so far in gaza be read out child in gaza have begin write their name on their hand so that they can be identify and bury with their family when they be kill what action be the government take to prevent more child be harm in israel ’s military action and to ensure a rapid end to this conflict 
 the prime minister set out yesterday very clearly what our policy be we be do everything we can to protect child british aid be already make a difference by support the international relief effort which be go in through rafah 
 i completely endorse what my hon friend   the member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft   just say about the impact on child truck at the rafah crossing be welcome but the aid get through be nowhere near enough to avert humanitarian catastrophe in gaza fuel be urgently need for the desalination plant that would ensure drinking water and for the energy generator that would power hospital which would prevent huge loss of life why be that fuel not be allow through 
 the hon lady be entirely right that the rafah crossing be currently the only way we can get food and relief supply in supply be come to el arish but the number of truck go through every day be far too small we will continue to press all the relevant authority to allow humanitarian support and aid of the type she describe through the rafah crossing to help those whose circumstance be precisely as she describe 
 with thousand of innocent civilian dead ten of thousand injure hundred of thousand displace and a denial of humanitarian need what level of civilian suffering will it take before this government back call for a ceasefire 
 the hon gentleman set out the tremendous suffering that be happen but he like i will agree with the prime minister that the source of this be the appalling terrorist murderous action by hamas which as the foreign secretary say a few minute ago kill more jewish people than on any day since the world war and the holocaust 
 as the fighting continue the un estimate that about woman will give birth every day in gaza meanwhile the life of at least newborn in incubator be at risk due to lack of power fuel medicine and water these woman and child be not terrorist will the secretary of state listen to the increase call for a ceasefire which would be the good way to ensure the release of hostage who be in a terrible situation and the delivery of aid for palestinian citizen 
 on deliver aid and support i have the opportunity to meet a very large number of the british charity and non governmental organisation that be try to help in gaza and i keep in very close touch with they on the issue of access and support through these trust agency we will do everything that we can to help 
 thousand of innocent people have be kill and aid worker be include in that devastating loss un expert on the ground have give repeat warning that the current israeli military strategy could lead to the permanent ethnic cleansing of palestinians yesterday the prime minister say at the dispatch box that there be mechanism to deal with breach of international law can the minister tell we more on what the government be do to support independent investigation and the international criminal court 
 the answer to the hon lady ’s perfectly proper question be that international and legal organisation all around the world will be look at this and give their opinion 
 people in cheadle be deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in gaza and welcome the doubling of aid that be announce by the prime minister however we know that hamas have a history of divert and misusing aid that be give to they for their own terrorist purpose what step can we take to ensure that this much need aid get to the people in need 
 my hon friend be quite right to warn about the proper use of aid i can tell she that this be probably the most scrutinise programme of humanitarian relief and support that britain have if ever we see anything that we think be untoward we immediately stop use that group none the less we operate through trust partner and the proof be that they be trust and be partner 
 last week the united nations relief and works agency state that hamas have steal fuel medical supply and food intend for palestinians it then subsequently delete that statement but the way that hamas have repeatedly compromise unrwa operation in gaza have be well document in recent year what assurance   can my right hon friend give that that aid will be target correctly and will reach the people who so desperately need it 
 my right hon friend be right that unrwa operate in difficult circumstance but i can tell he that we talk to it all the time about the proper use of these resource and we will do everything we can always to make sure that they go to the intended place 
 my constituent in hyndburn and haslingden and i thank the foreign secretary for all the work that he be do to ensure that aid be get to gaza but we know that the un have state that it need at least truck a day to take the aid to those who desperately need it can my right hon friend set out what conversation he be have with his israeli and egyptian counterpart to make sure that that aid be get to where it need to be 
 foreign office official the foreign secretary and other be talk to all the relevant authority in egypt and israel my hon friend will understand that the key thing be to increase the number of lorry that be get through rafah the current number be wholly inadequate i talk to martin griffiths virtually every day about the operation that the un be conduct to try to beef up that number 
 yesterday the prime minister say that we would finally challenge action that undercut legitimate aspiration for palestinian statehood and there be none more fundamental than year of breach of the geneva convention by the illegal occupation of the territory and then with jewish settler be place in those territory make a state solution very very difficult be we actually now go to do something about that or do my right hon friend share my concern that the meaningful resolution to which the foreign secretary refer may include the transfer of the people of gaza and gaza itself out of the state of israel into the hand of another state or state system and more concerningly that that would be follow by the expulsion of the palestinians from the west bank 
 my hon friend have a long standing and principled view on these matter i do not share his view and nor do the government nor do i think that the latter part of his question and the specific point that he make be likely to come about 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i take this opportunity to thank the minister of state for development and africa for the constructive cross party way that we have be able to work together since i be appoint to this post in such grim time he will know that every minute count right now in gaza incubator have be switch off and child be drink dirty water fresh water and power be the most pressing issue but despite our share hope of progress this week fuel be not permit in the convoy that enter gaza while several hospital have be hit and many give multiple warning to evacuate can he share with the house what the government be do to help broker an agreement that   will protect hospital and get fuel into gaza so that international law be uphold hospital can power up and water and power can flow 
 i welcome the hon lady to her new position it be that i hold for year from and i very much hope that she will hold it for years—[laughter it be of the good job in opposition and in government she will know that we be have humanitarian discussion with everyone intent as we be on get humanitarian supply to those who need they she ask specifically about attack a hospital attack a hospital be a war crime we should be in no doubt about that 
 what step his department be take to help ensure that humanitarian support reach people affect by the conflict in the nagorno karabakh region 
 follow the conflict in nagorno karabakh last month the government call for an end to the violence direct talk between party to the conflict and urgent humanitarian access we have provide £ to the international committee of the red cross to meet humanitarian need and of course the un have have access to the region we encourage azerbaijan to continue co operation in that regard 
 i thank the minister for his answer and i refer the house to my role as vice chair of the all party parliamentary group for azerbaijan what support be the uk government and british company provide in the karabakh region of azerbaijan to help to clear the landmine lay by armenian force as well as to support the reconstruction of the town and community that be destroy and loot during the occupation 
 my hon friend speak with great knowledge on this subject and i be pleased to confirm that the uk be continue to assess humanitarian need in the region include in relation to de mining in armenia and azerbaijan we have provide £ to the un development programme since to aid de mining effort in both armenia and azerbaijan and our embassy in baku have have discussion with the azerbaijani government on reconstruction and reintegration of the region 
 while unspeakable horror unfold in israel and palestine we must not forget other conflict around the world in which crime against humanity have be commit against innocent civilian follow azerbaijan ’s military intervention in nagorno karabakh almost all of the ethnic armenian population have be force to flee with more than people displace and report that as few as but a maximum of remain in the region do the minister agree that it bear the hallmark of ethnic cleansing 
 i do not agree but i should say that we have urge both side to resume dialogue talk will be the basis of a sustainable peace i have make that point to foreign ministers from both country in recent week i will make that point again when i travel to both country in the come week 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 in response to the terrorist attack on   october my right hon friend the prime minister other ministers and i have of course engage intensively with ally in the region but we be equally determined to deliver on other vital priority notably support ukraine tackle illegal migration support stability in sub saharan africa and alleviate poverty around the world 
 the foreign secretary will be aware that the government of france have announce today that they be send their foreign minister to the united nations security council to argue for a humanitarian truce in gaza which in their word would be capable of lead to a ceasefire and necessary for the distribution of aid to civilian population it would also allow the focus to concentrate on the release of hostage which i would have think would commend itself also to the government of israel will the government support 
 order be on the order paper be not permission to take all the time topical should be short and sweet the right hon gentleman have be here long enough to know that 
 i can assure the right hon gentleman that we be try to find every avenue to alleviate humanitarian suffering we will be represent at senior ministerial level at the security council later today we want to take action that will actually deliver aid and support to the palestinian people who be suffer in gaza 
 year ago my dartford constituent george lowe be brutally murder in cyprus we know who the killer be and the cypriot police know who the killer be yet they have never be bring to justice although i accept that this be a complicated diplomatic situation will the minister assure the house that the foreign office will not rest until justice for george lowe be forthcoming 
 my sincere condolence go out to george lowe ’s family consular staff remain in contact with the cypriot authority and the family on this case we pass to the cypriot authority a letter from george ’s family regard the investigation and have follow up for a response most recently on   october i be very grateful for my hon friend ’s advocacy in this case we will of course keep in touch to see what we can do 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on   june this house pass labour ’s motion call on the government to bring forward within day legislation to seize and repurpose russian state asset for ukraine ’s recovery but it have now be day since that motion be pass and we have hear nothing but vague word when will the foreign secretary do what labour have call for and deliver what ukraine need by take difficult but necessary step to ensure that russia pay 
 the state seizure of private asset be a serious act that we typically condemn in other country the government have make it absolutely clear that the people who be responsible for brutalise ukraine will ultimately pay for its reconstruction 
 do my right hon friend the foreign secretary agree that of the most important message that palestinians need to hear from the international community right now be that the state solution be not dead will he say a bit more about his discussion with israeli counterpart on what more can be do to resuscitate faith and optimism in a state solution 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the prospect of a peaceful and secure israel alongside a peaceful and secure palestine a state solution be our good route to navigate these terrible situation successfully and it will remain at the heart of uk foreign policy in the region 
 do the minister agree that the delivery of fuel supply into gaza be essential to prevent further humanitarian catastrophe and to ensure that the delivery of aid achieve its full impact 
 we be do everything we can the hon gentleman will understand that these be complex negotiation both to get the food and other humanitarian supply into the region and to deliver they to those who need they all i can assure he of be that all those negotiation be take place with vigour and speed 
 on my recent visit to the pinner united synagogue i hear from constituent about the impact of the hamas terrorist attack on their family and friend in israel will my right hon friend restate the commitment that we all share to ensure that promoter of terror be unable to do their work from the sanctuary of safe country such as ours to that end will he work with our ally to proscribe the activity of the islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 with regard to the proscription of the irgc my hon friend will have hear the answer that i give some minute ago the work that we be do in close co ordination with the home secretary and her team to ensure that community here in the uk feel safe and secure remain an absolute priority    for we limiting and ideally stop the ability of organisation and country to fund terrorism will remain a priority for we 
 the united nations high commissioner for human rights say yesterday that an immediate and 
 broad humanitarian ceasefire be essential for both gaza and israel 
 and that 
 if more aid for gazans include fuel medicine food and water do not arrive in day many more people in gaza will die 
 he add 
 the violence will never end unless leader stand up and take the brave and humane choice that be require by fundamental humanity 
 will the secretary of state hee those call from the international community and support an immediate humanitarian ceasefire 
 in order to have a ceasefire all party have to agree to it i refer the hon gentleman to other answer that have be give during this session of question we be do everything we can to address the humanitarian problem that he set out and we will continue to do so 
 build on the legacy of successive government on the threat of antimicrobial resistance will my right hon friend commit to build a coalition of high income country pledge to improve access to antibiotic diagnostic education and prevention which we all know be vital to stop amr 
 my hon friend be absolutely right amr be the big killer now meeting take place at the un general assembly and i be there in april attend an amr meeting we will do everything we can and we be greatly enhance in our ability by the presence of sally davies who be an envoy on amr i can tell my hon friend that this have the absolute attention of the government 
 woman in gaza be pregnant with due to give birth now in truly hellish circumstance if bomb a hospital be as the minister just say a war crime how would he describe the deliberate withholding of fuel to power those hospital and keep they work 
 the hon lady be ingeniously ask the same question that she ask early i can tell she that we be do everything we can to address the issue she have raise it be as much a concern to we as it be to she and we will continue to do that 
 it be vital for peace that the rule of law be establish and uphold in both palestine and israel have my right hon friend make an assessment of whether the weakening of the judiciary in israel will impact on legal decision relate to the israel defence force rule of engagement in the current conflict 
 my hon friend raise an important point while i be in israel prior to the   october   incident we of course discuss the proposal for judicial reform those proposal have not yet be take forward by the israeli government but i can assure she and the house that we remain committed to international law and will always communicate that to all party involve 
 if government will not back an actual ceasefire will they at least consider support a humanitarian pause to allow essential supply to reach the civilian trap in gaza 
 the government along with their partner be do everything to try to progress humanitarian support and supply into gaza 
 strong parliamentary democracy be crucial to the commonwealth and the commonwealth parliamentary association   have a central role as of the old commonwealth institution with you as of our co president mr speaker my right hon friend ’s department acknowledge that new legislation be need to recognise the cpa as an international interparliamentary organisation to keep it headquarter here in the uk when do he plan to have that new legislation in place 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right about the extraordinary contribution that the cpa make around the world we be very anxious to address the issue she have raise and to find a mutually acceptable solution i hope that this can be do by legislation once parliamentary time allow but if it be not possible to place it in the king ’s speech she will know that there be other way of pursue the matter 
 do the government agree that there need to be a full independent international inquiry into the recent terrible event in israel and gaza with full access to the gaza strip as well as israel do the government agree that the only way forward be a proper process of accountability for those responsible for the commission of any crime include war crime identify whether israeli or palestinian will the government review their position on the jurisdiction of the international criminal court 
 i have no doubt that in the aftermath of the brutal terrorist attack on   october   and israel ’s defensive response there will be an assessment of what have happen we would want any such assessment to be as comprehensive and independent as possible 
 will the foreign secretary make representation to his pakistan counterpart about deeply worry human right abuse commit against hindus and other minority especially woman and girl subject to force conversion and force marriage 
 notwithstanding the challenge in israel and gaza protect freedom of religion or belief include   for minority community remain central to the uk   government ’s human right engagement include in pakistan my right hon friend the foreign secretary raise the persecution of religious community which include hindus with pakistan ’s prime minister on   september 
 on saturday i stand with thousand of glaswegians whose overwhelming message be clear that we need a ceasefire now the only way we can begin to de escalate this conflict a conflict that have lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on both side be by end the bombardment of gaza ensure the flow of humanitarian aid and create a space for engage in diplomacy and dialogue in the light of all that why do the british government not call for an immediate ceasefire now 
 as we have see over and over again this morning call for a ceasefire be the easy bit actually negotiate something meaningful be considerably hard as my right hon friend the prime minister have say repeatedly from the dispatch box we be work with all party   the hon member for glasgow east david linden   have make reference to israel ’s action but i remind the house that a ceasefire without hamas stop its bombardment of israel be not a meaningful ceasefire 
 last week china put export restriction on graphite which be essential for electric vehicle battery out of of the top producer of graphite be commonwealth member will the government pursue a partnership agreement on critical mineral with the commonwealth to reinforce those supply chain 
 i commend my right hon friend on his pursuit of this subject which i know be very much in his thinking when he be in my position i can assure he that a critical mineral strategy be something that i regularly discuss with commonwealth leader and other particularly in africa it be in their interest and our that they protect their natural resource 
 let we have another try have the international development minister have direct discussion with his israeli counterpart about get fuel into gaza once the fuel run out hospital stop and people die 
 i have not have those discussion with my israeli opposite number but the hon gentleman may rest absolutely assure that the contact with the israeli government not least during the visit of the prime minister and the foreign secretary over the past few day focus on every aspect of this issue 
 the war in ukraine be undoubtedly the large land war in europe for decade notwithstanding other pressure around the world will my right hon friend the foreign secretary reaffirm the uk ’s commitment to its support for ukraine and the ukrainian people 
 i can confirm to the house that ukraine ’s ability to defend itself remain a focus of the government the prime minister the defence secretary and i discuss this matter regularly and i continue to   have regular communication with the ukrainian foreign minister this matter may have fall temporarily from the headline of the british newspaper but it have not fall from the mind of the british government 
 when atrocity take place we have a duty to call they out when hamas murder and kidnap innocent civilian we rightly call it out and when putin target innocent ukrainians and assad targeted hospital we express our horror in this house now we also have a duty to speak on behalf of innocent palestinians who be be collectively punish starve and indiscriminately bomb in their home by israeli force child ’s body be lie in the street it be wrong and it be why we need a ceasefire will the secretary of state convey that to his israeli counterpart 
 again the hon lady assert her interpretation of international law which be not necessarily that be share by the government the preservation of all life include palestinian life remain at the forefront of our thinking 
 what discussion have my right hon friend have with ministers kamikawa of japan and wang yi of china about their respective country role in ease tension in the israel gaza conflict 
 i have not have the chance to speak with the chinese foreign minister on this issue but i have speak a number of time with the japanese foreign minister about it of course we be more than happy to work with any international partner that can alleviate the pain and suffering of both israelis and the palestinian people particularly those in gaza and we will continue to do so 
 i be sure the whole house will want to join i in congratulate narges mohammadi on be award the nobel peace prize for her outstanding work to raise awareness of the struggle for woman ’s right and equality in iran will the minister publicly support the brave woman who be campaign against the forced hijab law in iran and once again will he commit to proscribe the woman hat regime that be the islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 on the proscription of the irgc the hon gentleman will have hear the answer i have already give a number of time from the dispatch box but i can assure he that we continue to stand with the brave woman of iran who be stand up for their right in the face of their government ’s oppression indeed i meet with woman iranian campaigner a number of week ago and the hon gentleman and the house should know that we stand in full solidarity with they 
 i pay tribute to the prime minister the foreign secretary and their team for their important diplomatic effort in the middle east in recent day the potential implication of the conflict between israel and the terrorist group hamas be deeply concern for the wide region so can the foreign secretary update the house on the step the government be take to prevent this conflict from spread to the wide region 
 in the conversation i have with the israeli government in the immediate aftermath of the   october   attack they express a desire for this not to turn into a regional conflict that desire be echo by all the leader of the arab world that i have speak to it remain an absolute priority for this government and indeed the government of the region to prevent this from turn into a regional conflict that be exactly what hamas want and therefore be exactly what we do not want 
 be it not simply impossible to get aid in on the scale that be need if we be to end the humanitarian nightmare under way in gaza without a ceasefire 
 the hon member have hear the detailed response from the dispatch box today on the difficulty entail and i reiterate what i say early we be do everything we can to try to make sure that we help those who be suffer in gaza today 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on the war in ukraine 
 since i last update the house in my opening remark in the debate on ukraine on   september the situation on the ground have remain largely unchanged slow and steady progress be be make by the ukrainian armed force which continue to grind their way through the main russian defensive position defence intelligence estimate that the number of russian permanent casualty in other word those who be dead or so seriously wound that they can not return to action now stand at between and troop total casualty be estimate to number up to 
 a limited russian offensive be under way at avdiivka on the outskirt of donetsk city fighting have be fierce and we assess that the average casualty rate for the russian army be around per day in the week of the offensive as ever putin and his general show no more regard for the life of their own troop than they do for the people of ukraine 
 however even this ex soldier can admit that war be not only about the fight on the land since the last debate on ukraine the ukrainians have open up a new front in the black sea destroy a kilo class submarine and amphibious ship as well as make a successful strike on the russian black sea fleet headquarters the consequence as president zelensky have rightly say be that the russian black sea fleet be no long capable of resistance in the western black sea as we move beyond day it be day to be precise of putin ’s day illegal war he have still not achieve any of his initial strategic aim and he have now cede sea control in the western black sea to a nation without a navy 
 the uk continue to donate significant amount of ammunition and matériel pay for from the £ commitment for this financial year that follow the same amount be give the year before and that be an important point our gifting be about more than headline make capability such as challenger or storm shadow it be the delivery month after month of ten of thousand of artillery round air defence missile and other small but necessary item of equipment that position the uk as of the big and most influential of ukraine ’s donor the uk be also the only country to have train soldier sailor aviator and marines in support of the ukrainian effort we have now train over soldier sailor aviator and marines since 
 event in the middle east have dominate the headline but in the ministry of defence and across the uk government and clearly in his majesty ’s opposition as they bring forward this urgent question ukraine remain a focus i think that see this very timely question will matter enormously to our friend and colleague in kyiv i remain every bit as confident   today as i have be on all my previous visit to the dispatch box over the last year that ukraine can and will prevail 
 member from across the house and people across the world be rightly focus on the middle east after hamas ’s horrific attack that terrorism must be condemn civilian must be protect humanitarian corridor must be open international law must be follow and escalation risk must be manage i welcome the defence secretary ’s gulf visit later this week and i hope that he will report back to we in the house i also welcome president biden ’s oval office address in which he say 
 hamas and putin represent different threat but they share this in common they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy 
 today let president putin know that the uk remain focused on and unite in solidarity with ukraine 
 last week as the minister say we pass the grim day milestone since putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine war still rag city be still bomb and civilian be still rap and kill ukraine have make important gain in recent day on the dnipro river will the minister update the house on that i be proud of the uk leadership on ukraine but we must work to maintain that leadership and accelerate support i fear that uk momentum be flag there have be no statement on ukraine to parliament from the new defence secretary since his appointment in august and no statement from any defence secretary in this house since may 
 labour back the recent announcement on uk military aid the new british army training to protect critical infrastructure and the £ raise with ally that will come from the international fund for ukraine but ukrainians be ask for winter support air defence and more ammunition and where be the uk ’s plan response no new money for military aid for ukraine have be commit by this prime minister the £ for this year be pledge by his predecessor and the £ for last year be pledge by her predecessor this year ’s money run out in march month after announce £ for uk stockpile in the spring budget not a penny have be spend and not a single contract sign why putin must be defeat just as hamas must be defeat we must not step back we must stand with ukraine for as long as it take to win 
 i echo the right hon gentleman ’s word about the despicable attack from hamas and the absolute right of israel to defend itself as i say i believe strongly that it be important that putin do not see this as a moment of opportunity to sow more chaos and do not think that the western donor community be distract or have a preference for support israel over ukraine he must know that our resolve be to support both 
 the right hon gentleman rightly note that the secretary of state will be in the gulf later this week i be sure that he will want to talk about what he hear there but i suspect that he will also want to keep some of that counsel private as we seek to calibrate how we posture ourselves in the region in order to reassure our ally and deter those who might seek to make a bad situation even bad the secretary of state be in washington last week and have have a number of call with other partner around the region so too have the chief of the defence staff and i as part of a ministry of defence wide effort to ensure that we constantly   calibrate our response alongside that of those who we traditionally work with in the region and we make sure that nothing we do be misinterpret 
 the right hon gentleman and i be i think friend so there be some dismay that he dismiss all my effort at the dispatch box to keep the house update on the war in ukraine i stand here as recently as   september   to lead an excellent debate on the subject and have give a number of statement on behalf of the secretary of state i be sorry if the right hon gentleman be so rank conscious as to deem my effort unworthy but i have do my good 
 the right hon gentleman be right to point to the fact that the excellent financial contribution make over the previous financial year be as yet unconfirmed for the next financial year it will not surprise he to know that that have already be the subject of conversation across government it be not for i to make that announcement in an urgent question today but a major fiscal event be forthcoming and i know that he will not have to wait too long that do not mean that our plan be uncertain in fact i push back strongly on the suggestion that they be for a long time over the past year there have be a sort of misunderstand that the uk ’s capacity to gift be entirely either from our own stockpile or from our indigenous industrial capacity the vast majority of what the uk gift be what we be able to buy internationally often from country that putin would prefer be not provide we with that stuff however we have be able to get our hand on it and get it to the ukrainians with some haste that be exactly the sort of thing that the right hon gentleman ask about 
 it be about the small but necessary thing such as winterisation equipment small arm ammunition artillery ammunition and air defence ammunition and our ability to buy that while in parallel stimulate uk industry i reject what the right hon gentleman say about contract have not be place substantial contract have be place directly to replenish uk stockpile of nlaw starstreak lightweight multi role missile javelin brimstone mm shell and mm rifle round as far as i can see there be a steady state contribution to the ukrainians that amount to ten of thousand of round per month plus air defence missile plus all the small stuff alongside the replenishment of our own stockpile which can only happen at the pace at which industry can generate it but none the less it be happen 
 my right hon friend will be well aware of the situation in the black sea with sea mine and how they be break loose our ally in turkey be do an incredible job in maintain the montreux convention and try to keep those sea lane safe be he have any conversation with our turkish ally about any support they may need in no matter what way to try to ensure that those sea lane be safe if we can get the grain deal up and run again and get grain out through maritime we be aware that sea mine be break free 
 my right hon friend be an expert on these matter and i commend he for the work that he and colleague across the house do as part of the nato parliamentary assembly to ensure that parliaments across nato stand united in our support for ukraine   he rightly note the importance of the montreux convention in keep non home port ship out of the black sea and the turks have apply that scrupulously turkey be entirely confident and comfortable in its ability to continue to enforce the convention clearly for other black sea nation such as romania and bulgaria de mining be already a concern and they be get on with that i meet my romanian counterpart at the warsaw security forum only week ago to discuss exactly that 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 we can not forget this autumn that we be see a broad escalation of the conflict in ukraine into the frontier of our euro atlantic homeland i speak in particular about the recent announcement by the government of sweden finland and estonia that undersea asset link those country have be intentionally damage by party i should declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group on estonia 
 my primary concern which i be sure the minister share be close to home event in the eastern mediterranean and the baltics demonstrate the diffuse nature of the threat we need to face but they also demonstrate the importance of keep a singular focus on the area that the government can well hope to influence while support the heroic and excellent bilateral support for the people of ukraine as they continue their fight on the day that the defence committee publish a report into the government ’s indo pacific tilt can i ask the minister to reiterate his government ’s commitment to euro atlantic security as a central strategic concern of these island of the north atlantic that we inhabit together and critically to update the house on the security of our north sea oil and gas infrastructure 
 it be fantastic to hear the snp ’s epiphany on the strategic importance of north sea oil and gas we take seriously the requirement to protect our subsea infrastructure whether oil and gas fibre optic cable or energy interconnector the royal navy have ship permanently at high readiness to ensure that our national economic zone be secure 
 the hon gentleman make an important point be a time of grow instability in the euro atlantic and the near east also to be commit more military resource to the far east and the indo pacific every defence review the original integrated review and its refresh have be clear that the absolute foundation of all our military effort be around security in the euro atlantic but if our principal ally in the united states be ever more concerned as it be about its competition with china and the challenge in the indo pacific it be surely necessary to show our willingness to contribute to indo pacific security alongside the united states so that the united states remain engage in euro atlantic security too 
 before i ask my question may i quote the former defence secretary my right hon friend   the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace in an important article in the daily telegraph at the beginning of october he say 
 before i leave office i ask the pm to match or increase the £ for ukraine to add to the £ we have spend already the uk be no long the big european donor to ukraine germany be 
 do the minister agree that this be a helpful exchange of view because it will enable he and his team to go to the treasury and express how unite the house be on the need to continue this important indeed decisive level of contribution to ukraine ’s fight for freedom 
 the previous defence secretary never need any help from i in make his case to prime ministers my right hon friend be absolutely right that the uk have win a position in lead the global donor community because we have resource that commitment and have be willing to go through capability threshold before anybody else but our position as a leader internationally depend on our continue willingness   to be so the previous secretary of state the current secretary of state and indeed the prime minister and the chancellor be all on the same page about the importance of maintain that uk position 
 i completely agree with the comment make and concern raise by the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend   the member for wentworth and dearne john healey part of the reason we want the secretary of state in the chamber be that we really need to up the game in convince the british people why it be essential that we continue our massive ongoing support for ukraine and of the importance of defeat russia it be clear that ukraine need more resource equipment ammunition armament and so on so we need to step up far will the minister go back to the secretary of state and his cabinet colleague and say that we really do need to put more resource into support ukraine 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we should not take for grant the cross party and national consensus that have exist on support for ukraine all of we in the house continue to stand in solidarity with the ukrainian armed force and i think we set the tone that the medium and the nation follow but it involve a significant amount of money at a time when everybody else around the cabinet table will also be seek resource for their department so we must make that case as he say as far as i can tell though the case be a completely compelling 
 what the ukrainians be do be stand up to our main adversary the nation that challenge security in the euro atlantic most profoundly and it be through our support for they that we be make a clear stand about how we want the euro atlantic to be and in so do reassure all our nato ally along nato ’s eastern frontier of our resolve to stand up to russian aggression with they under the term of nato ’s treaty 
 i very much welcome my right hon friend ’s clarity about how critical it be for the security of the world and the rule base international order that there be a successful outcome for ukraine in this conflict will he do everything he can to ensure that the critical long range missile   and air defence system which be have a very detrimental effect on the russian armed force continue to get through may i add my voice to that of my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis we take it as read that extra money will be announce in the autumn statement at least as much as before if not more to help sustain ukraine in this dreadful conflict 
 i completely agree with my right hon friend about the need to maintain our support for the ukrainian armed force a number of step change capability will come into ukrainian hand over the next month or so most obviously combat air while the uk be not an f-16 nation it be part of the f-16 coalition and do basic pilot training before the aircraft go on to f-16 nation for conversion i know that the prime minister agree with all in the house who make the case for the need for we to continue to support ukraine into the next financial year 
 in recent day there have quite rightly be a lot of interest about the law of armed conflict a subject about which the minister know from his own time serve in the armed force while the conflict in israel and gaza have rightly make we reflect on the protection of innocent civilian in the last couple of year we have see a war in ukraine in which russia have show little regard for civilian what do the minister understand by the term proportionality in the context of the war in ukraine 
 i think that some of the false equivalence that lavrov and other from the russian government have seek to create be deeply misguided the point of proportionality be not an eye for an eye or a numerical thing it be about military necessity to achieve legitimate and proportionate military aim it be clear in the way that putin have prosecute his war most obviously in place such as mariupol as well as in how he have systematically target civilian infrastructure not as part of the initial shaping of a legitimate military operation but as part of a deliberate sustained campaign to terrorise the ukrainian people that there be no equivalence between what be happen in gaza at the moment and what have be happen in ukraine we must stand up every time that lavrov or his crony try to make the oppose point and be clear on the difference in international humanitarian law 
 it can not be extraordinary that on the same day the russians assault avdiivka iranian back hamas decide to commit their murderous assault on israel we can not fight hamas but we can do so much more to crush their russian ally 
 it be important that i do not suggest that we have any evidence that somehow the kremlin and hamas be co ordinating in the awful event that happen saturday ago what we have see be that the kremlin be incredibly effective at spot opportunity present to it that would far subvert and destabilise we have see that in coup across western africa and in how putin quickly move to contribute to a challenging narrative to the west over what happen in israel saturdays ago 
 i know it be difficult to get exact number but the calculation so far of wound ukrainian troop be anything between and as well as about civilian what support be be provide to ukraine ’s health service to help they cope with the wounded and injure what support be be give with regard to specialist service link up between the uk and ukraine also to provide the good support that we can 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that there be significant casualty on the ukrainian side though it be important to note that they be less than those suffer on the russian side those be both military and civilian on the military side there be a coalition of nation just as there be with all other type of capability to provide military aid there be uk medic base in lviv as part of that when i be rzeszów in poland just week ago my plane pull up alongside a swedish air force plane that be about to evacuate ukrainian troop back to sweden in addition the uk be rehabilitate some troop injure on the ukrainian side to our rehabilitation facility here in addition to that as part of the wide support that the uk government provide to ukraine we be of course always look for opportunity to support the wide humanitarian and civilian medical service too 
 may i return to stockpile and supply chain the minister be right that the uk have provide a great deal of matériel but we need a steady supply of order to restock our own cupboard and to supply the ukrainians will he outline what he be do to make sure that we have supply chain resilience could he reassure i that he will keep a laser like focus on the logistic capacity need to get kit from here to there 
 my hon friend be right on both count the industrial capacity need to be re establish not just to replenish our supply chain which be an important point the department be not seek simply to make a single order to replace whatever have be gift to the ukrainians instead we be look to create order that run on and on so that the industrial capacity can be maintain those contract be be place as the industrial capacity come online in the meantime other contract be be place that allow more like for like replacement from stockpile elsewhere in the world he be right that have all the industrial capacity and the fight echelon work only if we have the logistic enabler to match it all up we be make investment in that as be set out in the defence command paper refresh 
 we must not forget ukraine and we must continue to stand with ukraine but the war effort there rely on a strong supply chain here in the uk a crucial part of that supply chain be the gmb member at defence equipment and support who assemble and transport missile to the frontline but they have have to take week of industrial action over unfair pay ukrainian politician and trade union have urge a resolution to the dispute because they know how valuable those worker be will the minister join i in do the same 
 i be unfamiliar with the issue of which the hon lady speak and i would not want to comment on the fly clearly those who work within our excellent defence industry do very important work in my experience many of they see themselves as contribute to a national endeavour and be motivate by patriotism every bit as much as by money i hope that they will continue to work as hard as they have so that we can support our own armed force as well as those of ukraine 
 give that precision remotely piloted and autonomous weapon system not to mention close air support could be decisive to an attritional land campaign will the minister please update the house on the delivery of air power to ukraine 
 in response to an early question i mention the f-16 coalition which be a combination of both gift the jet and munition and pilot training i have nothing to add beyond what i say early other than that it be expect that those capability will arrive with the ukrainians within the next month clearly everyone be work as quickly as possible 
 if the news be to be believe this morning we be about to see another german u turn this time on provide taurus missile just as we see a u turn on leopards and the f-16s indeed right across the ukraine contact group we keep see the same pattern of country drag their heel on a certain capability only to finally give in admittedly that do not include the minister and the government but why do it keep happen in the contact group will he say a bit more about how the training of f-16 pilot be go 
 i be minded to be much more charitable to nation who have again and again challenge themselves to go through a capability threshold often that the uk have demonstrably go through if we consider the position that the germans have traditionally take and where they be now post zeitenwende the level of gift that they be provide be extraordinary it would be invidious of i to be in any way critical in fact i will go the other way and say how full of admiration i be for the way that german policy have shift so completely over the last year 
 they say that infantry win battle but logistic win war with western stockpile diminish what conversation have the minister have with the defence sector about support ukraine to produce its own munition 
 as keener follower of defence affair will have spot the chief executive of bae systems be in kyiv at the back end of the summer bae have already announce its intention to manufacture in ukraine clearly the british government support that we will look at how the wide uk industry can not only support the uk mod ’s support for ukraine but increasingly manufacture directly in support of the ukrainians 
 due to putin ’s illegal invasion of a sovereign neighbouring nation ukraine be now the most heavily mine country on earth lead to countless death of innocent civilian   as the ukrainians continue make progress with their counter offensive what step be the defence minister take to significantly expand our support in provide mine clear equipment to ukraine 
 with the exception of the northern kharkiv oblast which be recover at some pace last autumn i be not sure that the frontline have move anywhere near enough to start to talk about a civilian de mining effort in the defensive belt that have be lay over the last year or so interruption the hon gentleman ’s gesticulation seem to be suggest that the progress make over the last or month be such that the km defensive belt that be well seed with mine by the russians be still very much within artillery range and a part of the defensive action by ukraine he be absolutely right however that the use of mine even anti armour mine not just anti personnel mine be an appalling reality of modern warfare there must be some urgency in clear up the battlefield thereafter but i gently suggest that the military fact do not lend themselves to any such effort right now 
 with the world rightly focus on the middle east i welcome this question as an opportunity to show our solidarity with ukraine once again i welcome labour front benchers liken hamas and putin as barbaric bedfellow in try to annihilate neighbouring democracy at the recent nato parliamentary assembly summit we have a briefing from colonel maksym suprun commander of the mechanised brigade of the ukrainian armed force he talk about the urgent need for more anti tank weaponry unmanned aerial system electronic warfare capability and of course ammunition how be the minister make sure that we can deliver the munition and military capability that the ukrainian armed force need on the frontline to so bravely defend their democracy 
 for more than year the uk mod alongside the us department of defence have have an incredibly strong relationship with the ukrainian ministry of defence those political and military relationship and the connection between our defence procurement agency allow we to have a close understanding of the ukrainian requirement for the fight not just right now but in month time we will continue to maintain those relationship we will continue to invest in the resource that be need quite obviously we be guide by what the ukrainians need to stay in the fight tonight and tomorrow and eventually to prevail everything that we set out to procure on their behalf be with those plan in mind 
 we all stand with ukraine but there be considerable concern about the likely length of the war early this month i attend the pentlands ukrainian support group for the ukrainian refugee in edinburgh south west which be support by the currie balerno rotary club in my constituency many of the woman there ask i what will become of they if the war continue and their year visa be up have the minister have any discussion with the home office about the need to extend humanitarian visa to ukrainians or to look at give they indefinite leave to remain 
 those be not conversation i have have but since the hon and learn lady mention they i will undertake to have they i commend her local rotary club for lead the support of the ukrainian community in her constituency it be really uncomfortable that while all i want to say to her constituent and the ukrainians live in my constituency be do not worry this will be over soon you ’ll be home soon the reality be that it will probably take a while long yet it be important that when we stand up in this house we show putin our resolve to support the ukrainians for as long as it take with whatever it take even if that take year because putin must not think the west will lose patience 
 deprive russia of the revenue from oil sale be a central platform of the west ’s response to its invasion of ukraine month ago significant effort be make which have a significant effect however at the nato parliamentary assembly a few week ago we hear evidence that all the blockade have now be circumvent and that russia ’s oil revenue have increase what action be my right hon friend take to work with international ally to see what else can be do in this dynamic environment 
 clearly it be a cause of enormous concern when international sanction regime be not work as intend if i may i will follow up with my right hon friend and his colleague in the parliamentary assembly to understand exactly what it be that they hear i will then speak to colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office about it and perhaps write to he and his parliamentary assembly colleague with a government response 
 at the end of last month the defence secretary suggest that the uk training of ukrainian troop could be move in country into ukraine he also suggest that there might be a possibility of uk warship on the black sea can the minister say whether those plan still stand 
 i hear a slightly different statement and that i think be self evidently true in a post war ukraine the uk will absolutely seek to demonstrably support ukrainian security on land at sea and in the air but obviously that be not something that we would do while a conflict be still live for very obvious reason 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to ukraine and i be proud that stevenage base mbda supply storm shadow and brimstone missile but we know from a recent report by the royal united services institute ’s open source intelligence and analysis team that north korea be now massively supply russia be there any plan to work with international partner to try to disrupt that supply or increase our supply 
 there be a number of outcome that might say reflect strategic defeat for putin finland and sweden join nato grow distrust of russia throughout its near abroad and more recently its have to go to country such as north korea cap in hand to seek weapon because it be unable to sustain its own arm industry that be not to mention the rapidly   change dynamic between russia and china of course the uk and our ally look at way of disrupt russian supply chain but that would not necessarily be a matter we would discuss any far in public 
 the minister will have hear concern raise in a number of place about the potential for a loss of focus or a lack of resolve give the pivot of interest and attention to the middle east and the harrowing scene over the last fortnight he have robustly respond to those concern a element of concern he invoke the spectre of our main ally the united states be the political turmoil and turbulence that appear to be go on in the us congress and the dissolution of the resolve that be rightly there for ukraine in certain political circle i be not ask the minister to solve that as a problem but be he concern by it and can he assure the house that from the engagement he have have with his counterpart in the united states in the executive tier their resolve be undiminishe and they will find the resource to continue their support for ukraine 
 the secretary of state be in washington last week indeed his meeting be the he have have with secretary austin since he be appoint within the executive there be absolutely no change in approach whatsoever furthermore although what we see in the news might suggest that there be a grow impatience or a lack of resolve in congress that be definitely not what we be hear in our engagement with colleague in congress america have a very strong sense of what its role in the world be and what this moment of challenge be despite whatever domestic politic may or may not be play out the resolve of congress to stand firm on the side of freedom be as strong as it have always be 
 early the minister highlight development in the black sea clearly they be so important for grain and feed the world will he update the house on the government ’s position on the black sea grain initiative and how we can ensure that grain be get out to feed the world 
 the government continue to be affront by the idea that grain to feed the world should be trade as part of some deal the turks have show admirable leadership in seek to facilitate the movement of grain out of the black sea and the uk continue to support those initiative if i may i will write to my hon friend with a more fulsome response on the black sea grain initiative specifically 
 i recently meet ukrainian refugee in my constituency and they be really worried about the war last a lot long than be originally anticipate what they really want be the security to know that they can remain safe here in the uk for as long as this appalling war continue past   december what conversation have the secretary of state have with the home office about ensure that ukrainian refugee can continue to remain here in safety for as long as they need to 
 the hon lady might have be momentarily distract but that exact same question come up minute or so ago i will add her name to   that of   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry   in my conversation with home office ministers 
 provide matériel support and logistical cover be crucial to push back the russian aggression in ukraine but so be a strong sanction regime early today a worrying report surface state that while the uk have ban russian copper aluminium and nickel the eu have not do the same as it deem they to be critical mineral will my right hon friend update the house on what the government be do to ensure that we present a united front in our battle against russia 
 when it come to eu sanction on russian critical mineral my hon friend have expose a significant flaw in my knowledge i will need to write to he 
 as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on ukraine i would like to thank the shadow secretary of state for defence my right hon friend   the member for wentworth and dearne john healey for call this urgent question and the minister for his update the minister speak about the new and particularly important phase of the war regard the black sea and crimea ukraine will not be free until every russian soldier have leave crimea the ministry of defence have train sea king pilot and i understand deliver sea king but they be for search and rescue what naval aid be the uk supply to ukraine for this next vital phase of the war 
 the uk have provide a number of capability that have be use by the ukrainians in their effort in the black sea none of those be explicitly naval but the challenge with the montreux convention be that for example the minesweeper the royal navy have transfer to the nascent ukrainian navy can not enter the black sea while the convention be in place that of course constrain our ability to generate a genuine naval capability until the convention be lift 
 when putin launch his attack on ukraine he not only expect to conquer a neighbouring democracy but to split the international community instead he unite it because people can not remain neutral when they see that type of behaviour the big rebuff to he would be a strengthen and enlarge nato so what conversation be the minister have in particular with his turkish and hungarian counterpart on ensure that the ratification of sweden ’s membership proceed forthwith 
 it remain our firm expectation that sweden will accede to nato and we continue to press all ally to ensure that that happen soon rather than later it be also of note there have be a great deal of discussion about this in the swedish medium that it be increasingly in putin ’s interest to style out some of the activity that have be happen in sweden precisely to affront the sensibility of some other nato ally it be important for all our eye to be open to that possibility 
 that conclude proceeding on the urgent question i will now pause for a moment to allow a change of dramatis personae before the statement 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i will make a statement on illegal migration 
 the government have make it our top priority to stop the boat because these crossing be not only illegal dangerous and unnecessary but deeply unfair they be unfair on those who be genuinely in need of resettlement as our finite capacity be take up by people overwhelmingly young man come to the uk directly from a place of safety in france but most of all they be unfair on the law abide british public who face the real world consequence of illegal migration through housing waiting list strained public service and at time serious community cohesion challenge and it be the interest of the british public that we have a duty to advance 
 we have develop what be among the most comprehensive and robust plan to tackle illegal migration in europe and over the last year the prime minister the home secretary and i have focus on deliver it the plan start with take the fight to the people smuggle gang upstream long before they be even in strike distance of the united kingdom we have already double the fund for the organise immigration crime work of the national crime agency and at a meeting of the european political community early this month the prime minister announce new tailor initiative with belgium bulgaria and serbia which come in addition to the enhance strategic partnership that we have already agree this year with italy and turkey our agreement with the french government have elevate our co operation to unprecedented level this be degrade the organise immigration crime group and in the last few week new physical barrier have be instal to make it considerably hard for the flimsy dinghy to be launch 
 as we be increase disruption abroad so we be restore deterrence at home we be break the link between arrive here illegally and a life in the uk the number of removal of those with no right to be in the uk have increase by more than in comparison with last year ’s figure since we strike our enhance return agreement with albania in december we have return more than albanian immigration offender and as i see for myself in tirana last month some of those individual be be return home in as little as hour
