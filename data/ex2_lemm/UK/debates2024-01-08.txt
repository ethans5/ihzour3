 be a very good and important question as the hon lady know source steel be primarily a decision for our prime contractor who lead on procure those platform to take the example of type i believe that almost of that be uk sourced so it   vary accord to need and requirement but we encourage our prime contractor to use uk steel where possible and practical 
 decision that my hon friend could make to support defence job be to retain hms albion and hms bulwark will he reassure the house the royal marines the royal navy and the armed force that these vital ship will be keep in operation and not mothball 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who speak with great authority from all his time on the defence committee no final decision have be make on those platform i know that there have be much coverage in the press and inevitably chatter and i know how important they be to our service personnel i reassure he that we be look at this in the round we be absolutely committed to support defence job across the piece obviously we have recruitment challenge but we must also support british industry and that be why the secretary of state be lead on that in his role as shipbuilde tsar

 what step his department be take to help protect shipping route through the red sea 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the royal navy in protect merchant shipping route in conflict zone 
 happy new year mr speaker 
 the royal navy and the government be commit to the protection of maritime trade ensure that both people and shipping remain safe to travel through international water that work be drive by the late intelligence and analysis of that picture as i say on   december   in my write statement hms diamond have join our partner and ally as part of operation prosperity guardian to protect freedom of navigation and merchant shipping in the red sea and the gulf of aden 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer and those in our armed service for their work protect these important route can he update the house on his discussion and work with our international partner to de escalate the tension so that we do not need all the protection work and can go back to the normal free flow of trade 
 as my hon friend will know the houthis have be cause havoc in that part of the red sea in particular attack ship there be a increase in attack on maritime shipping from november to december show that there be no direct connection to the wide conflict in the region but a decision by houthis to attack free trade that be unacceptable we be work with our partner through operation prosperity guardian and other measure to tackle it 
 the secretary of state be absolutely right to point the finger at the houthis but we should not ignore the role of iran in this enterprise what be he and the government do with our international partner to ensure that the merchant marine have the confidence to keep use the red sea which be critical to the smooth operating of world trade 
 we call on the iranian back houthis to immediately cease these attack the houthis will bear the responsibility and i have to say the consequence should they ignore those warning the right hon gentleman ask what more we have be do i issue a statement along with other country during the break in which we make clear that consequence will follow if they do not stop this action to be clear the uk will not tolerate the houthis close international waterway 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome what the defence secretary have to say these attack on red sea shipping must stop they destabilise regional security disrupt international trade and put civilian and military life in danger we back the uk action with ally in the new maritime protection force and the joint statement condemn the houthi attack that the secretary of state just mention he announce today but have not mention to the house that hms richmond be sail to the gulf in the light of these escalating tension what other royal navy ship have he put on stand by for the region 
 i do not mention that specifically because i have already make a write ministerial statement to the house hms richmond be sail to the region because both hms diamond and hms lancaster be already there and eventually they will need to be swap out it be not escalation in term i want to repeat to the right hon gentleman the house and the country that we will not tolerate trade be impact globally in the manner in which the houthis be impact it it will have ramification on everybody ’s bill and on the flow of free trade and good and it must come to a halt we have make clear through that joint statement that we be prepared to take action if require i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s commitment to support we in that action 
 when the uk take the important step of join operation prosperity guardian the secretary of state give the house this update in a write statement he have do the same today alongside his comment at question if further action be require to deter houthi attack and to safeguard freedom of shipping in the red sea will he undertake to provide parliament with an oral statement 
 yes 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 thank you mr speaker and a very happy new year to you and to the house the secretary of state be right to highlight the geopolitical and economic threat from the houthi lead attack in the red sea as well as the need to participate in operation prosperity guardian but could he advise the house of how sustainable this and future joint operation will be when increase number of sailor have leave the service and the intake to replace they in the month to march plunge by 
 i be confident that we will be able to continue or increase our action we complete all our operational requirement at the moment the hon gentleman be right to say that it be a very tight labour market but i think that be a subject for celebration in this house we be see such low sustained unemployment even through some pretty turbulent time we will redouble our effort to ensure that all our military service can recruit the people they need 
 what step his department be take to provide military support to ukraine 
 what step he be take to increase military support to ukraine 
 what step he be take to increase military support to ukraine 
 we continue to support ukraine ’s priority include air defence to protect national infrastructure further artillery ammunition and support to sustain capability include ukrainians to be train in the half of 
 will my right hon friend join i in welcome the new maritime capability coalition which build on the support the uk norway and other be provide to ukraine will he also re emphasise the need for we to continue to work very closely with our nato partner and ally to continue to provide and strengthen support to ukraine and make sure those resource reach where they be need 
 i absolutely will as my right hon friend say the new maritime capability coalition which i launch at admiralty house in december have now be join by further nation together with norway who will help to ensure that ukraine ’s success in crimea and the black sea continue ukraine a nation which have virtually no navy at all be do an incredible job destroy up to of russia ’s black sea fleet 
 in the united states additional aid to ukraine remain stuck in the senate and there be the potential for a shift in its political leadership later this year consider we be still await this government ’s promise action plan for ukraine how assured can we be that the secretary of state be discuss with our nato ally all future scenario to ensure there will be no lapse in collective military support for ukraine 
 i really hope that there can be no doubt about this government ’s commitment to ukraine not only be we with the training but with tank missile and commission to enable ukraine to continue this fight in all manner of different way on a personal level have have a family of ukrainians live with we in my house for a year i be personally committed to this cause as well we be do everything possible include work throughout the christmas and new year period during which i have numerous conversation with my ukrainian opposite number and other throughout its government to make sure we be support their action it be a ukrainian plan that be need to win this war not a british or american 
 labour fully support provide military aid to ukraine but what step be the secretary of state take to speed up the development of a stockpile strategy in collaboration with nato ally to replenish supply and ensure that ministry of defence procurement and part of the defence industry be on an urgent operational footing both to support ukraine for the long term and to rebuild uk stock for any future conflict 
 the hon lady be absolutely right we already have a huge amount of military munition and equipment on order both to replenish and to help continue to support ukraine when it come to ukraine itself the united kingdom set up the international fund for ukraine through which we have numerous different order in place for equipment for ukraine which have raise nearly £ i think up to £ be already commit through those contract 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on the work he have do as defence secretary since take on the department his long experience in government have show to the fore and i be delighted at the work he have do so far in june last year i write at the request of no and the cabinet office to request the funding for support to ukraine the funding request be between £ and £ unfortunately since that time we have hear nothing from the government about what they plan to do for the next financial year planner in the ministry of defence need time as do the ukrainians to get use to it if we do not start make an announcement soon we will fall behind many of our european colleague who have already overtake we with their support 
 mr speaker can i start by thank my right hon friend on behalf of everybody in this house he have the foresight to supply nlaw to ukraine ahead of time and the foresight to start training troop for ukraine ahead of time today i can say that we have train troop include those who have train since he be absolutely right about the ongoing support for ukraine all i can say be that he will not be disappoint and he will not need to wait too long 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in just day last week russia fire drone and missile at ukraine putin be step up his attack so we must step up uk support but current military aid funding run out in a matter of week the former defence secretary say although not today that without new money it be 
 very hard to continue the leadership the uk have be take on ukraine 
 i ask the current defence secretary about the ukraine funding in the house in november the former defence secretary write about it month ago week from when i ask i ask again when will new military aid funding for ukraine be announce and will it be multi year 
 perhaps the right hon gentleman do not hear my previous answer it will not be long to correct the record for the house the funding—£2.3 continue through to april this year so it be not in any way shape or form in danger of run out to reassure the right hon gentleman and the house i be also in constant contact with umerov my opposite number and many other throughout the ukrainian system so they understand where funding be up to and be able to plan accordingly 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the number of woman employ in the defence sector 
 a happy new year to you mr speaker and to all colleague 
 as at october of civil servant be female a rise of percentage point compare with   october and of the uk regular armed force and of future reserves be woman up by percentage point and percentage point respectively in the past year that mean that the trend be in the right direction but we can do well and i be confident that we will do so across the defence enterprise.[official report   january vol c. 4mc 
 happy new year to you mr speaker and to the house 
 i thank the minister for his response many of my constituent work in the defence sector whether at rnas yeovilton leonardo in yeovil or thales in my constituency i commend initiative such as leonardo ’s aerowomen programme which aim to increase gender parity in the sector but i be concern by the barrier   that woman still face the woman in defence charter aim to have woman make up of the uk armed force by yet the current number be a meagre have the minister make an assessment in the last quarter of of the success of the charter since its launch 
 order it might help if the hon lady put in for an adjournment debate 
 i would gladly answer such a debate i know all the site the hon lady refer to and i do understand the issue she will know that we be actively engage with the defence supplier forum to increase the number of woman across the defence enterprise and the target be 
 happy new year mr speaker 
 many woman undertake critical role in our defence industry so the policy by which we procure the equipment they build be very important for they minister have be tell the defence committee since before christmas that we can expect a major announcement on procurement reform in the new year as we be now in january can we have a commitment that we will have that announcement by the end of this month please 
 my right hon friend have cunningly get that question in my understanding be that it be imminent however the point on woman and procurement be well make and my right hon friend will have observe i hope with pleasure the work that have be do for example in procure uniform that actually fit the female form which be not previously the case 
 what step he be take to support the delivery of uk aid to gaza 
 what step he be take to support the delivery of uk aid to gaza 
 what step he be take to support the delivery of uk aid to gaza 
 happy new year mr speaker 
 in support of the foreign commonwealth and development office the maritime delivery of uk aid arrive in egypt at new year rfa lyme bay and raf aircraft have position over tonne of humanitarian aid into egypt distribution of the aid have be impede by challenge around its movement into gaza fcdo colleague continue to work with the un israel and egypt to allow great volume of aid to be deliver 
 blwyddyn newydd heddychlon i bawb.—[translation a peaceful new year to everyone 
 on   december   an aid convoy belong to the united nations relief and works agency be hit by israeli gunfire despite the vehicle be identifiable   with the agency ’s marking and after the idf have designate the route from gaza city in early co ordination give israel ’s target of aid convoy can the minister say whether the ministry of defence maintain a tracker database of allege breach or violation of international humanitarian law in gaza as it have previously say it do for yemen 
 i will have to write to the hon lady on her exact point about the tracker i be not aware of but that do not necessarily mean there be not i will write to she 
 although humanitarian aid be a foreign commonwealth and development office lead we continue to work with partner and ally to advocate for other crossing to be open and to increase the volume of aid deliver into gaza 
 i welcome the news that rfa lyme bay have deliver aid to egypt so it be very disappointing to know that aid be still be hold up give israel ’s activity in gaza the only way we can make sure that humanitarian aid get to the people who need it be by try to secure another cessation in hostility what role be the mod play in try to make that happen 
 the mod have put its shoulder to the wheel in support of the government ’s wide diplomatic effort but obviously the negotiation of a pause such as the that the hon lady rightly say be necessary to deliver aid in great volume be a foreign commonwealth and development office lead mr speaker i believe you have have the foresight to grant an urgent question in which such question may well be answer shortly by a minister from that department 
 we be witness horrific scene in gaza the humanitarian catastrophe there need great focus from country like our own and other around the world to bring it to an end and to get that aid in give that the prime minister say in a statement before prorogation that we would use british armed force capability to make those shipment of aid in great number why be we not get those great number of aid in what be he do to get israel to open the crossing and to get that aid in in the quantity that be need 
 british armed force be be use to deliver aid into gaza and they have do so to good effect my right hon friend the defence secretary have strike up an excellent operational relationship with his israeli counterpart which have allow for the opening of the kerem shalom crossing again i think that be a reflection of the success of the uk ’s engagement with the israeli government on this matter 
 the volume of aid be limit not by the availability of military capacity there be plenty of that but by the availability of crossing and the ability to distribute the aid on which foreign office colleague be work closely with the un israel egypt and other to increase 
 happy new year mr speaker 
 france and jordan successfully deliver medical aid to gaza by air last week have the minister consider the viability of the uk air drop food and medical supply to gaza in the same way 
 i think air dropping be a very imprecise way of do business our preference be to seek maritime route 
 be a feasibility study be undertake to see whether aid could be deliver directly into gaza from ship to shore should the future security situation allow it 
 the defence secretary have lead internationally on exactly such an initiative work with our friend in the cypriot ministry of defence there be idea to do exactly that but they obviously need to be agree with all party before they can happen 
 i have urgently press the minister and the department to secure red sea vessel as well as facilitate aid into gaza people in bolton be demand assurance on both maritime safety and humanitarian support for gaza what assurance can he provide to people in bolton 
 clearly the delivery of aid into gaza be principally a maritime and aviation effort in the eastern mediterranean but my hon friend be correct to say that the security of shipping in the red sea also have an impact that be why royal navy warship be part of the red sea taskforce that be seek to protect those sea lane 
 what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and   their   family 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 the mod deliver a range of service to veteran and their family this include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation the provision of tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service and defence transition services and integrate personal commissioning for veteran 
 veteran homelessness rise by last year accord to the government ’s own figure do the minister agree that his colleague the minister for veterans affairs   the right hon member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer be fail to deliver on his pledge to end veteran homelessness 
 the hon lady will be aware that homelessness be not principally a function of the ministry of defence but all of we want to make sure that   veteran and their family be properly accommodate and naturally reduce homelessness remain a government priority 
 veteran advisory and pension committee across the uk provide the minister ’s department with an important platform for hear and help veteran last year with his help and the help of member on both side of the house my private member ’s bill give the secretary of state great flexibility to use the network to help more veteran in more way can the minister tell the house what progress he have make with the vapc since my bill receive royal assent on   september 
 let i congratulate my hon friend on his work on the bill which should properly be call the millar bill i recently meet vapc chair to discuss next step and we will ensure that the mod engage with representative from vapc in a series of work group to set the direction for secondary legislation that will clarify their future role 
 can the minister give some more detail on how the department intend to take forward the recommendation from the veteran welfare service review and can he outline any timescale to which he intend to work on that review 
 our response to the independent review of welfare service for veteran accept the principle and intend outcome of all the recommendation and we will shortly publish our response to the recommendation of the armed force compensation scheme quinquennial review the review will inform a programme of improvement in the way we deliver the compensation scheme and how we provide welfare support to ensure a consistently high level of service the response will set out our commitment and high level plan in particular how we will make our service less adversarial and more user friendly 
 as promise by the prime minister medal be be issue to recognise those who participate in britain ’s nuclear testing programme during the 1950 and 1960 some family have express a wish for a presentation ceremony for their medal how would the minister recommend that those be organise whether locally or nationally 
 nuclear test medal have be mail to thousand of recipient to ensure that as many as possible have receive they before remembrance sunday and also with the advanced age of some of the recipient in mind my sense be that that be the right thing to do and have be appreciate by recipient naturally there be opportunity my hon friend may have such opportunity himself to thank veteran and mark their contribution i think the lieutenantry in some county have do so but the imperative be to get the medal out before remembrance sunday 
 i spend the recess study the veteran strategy action plan with its odd commitment and think about the view of the minister for veterans affair on what he call the lack of political horsepower why be it after year and so many commitment that of veteran be so dissatisfied with the compensation scheme   for illness and injury and why be veteran household declare homeless every month as we have hear be there still a lack of political horsepower or be there a need for well co ordination between the 
 order i be not be funny but i have a whole list of question to get through we have to have short question that be very long i think the minister get the gist of it 
 i get the gist the armed force compensation scheme and the war pension scheme will be dramatically improve by the ongoing digitalisation of veteran service that be a huge commitment that will bring we into the century and improve the service that be provide to veteran who be seek compensation the hon gentleman will know that in the last financial year there be complaint to veterans uk and expression of thank for the service people have receive 
 what recent progress his department have make on the aukus partnership 
 i be pleased to confirm that we have make significant progress in develop the aukus partnership the aukus defence ministerial meeting last month announce a range of tri national activity take forward advanced capability include our deep space advance radar capability darc australian personnel be train in the uk and the us and £ worth of contract have be award to uk company build ssn aukus finally congress pass legislation to enable aukus to facilitate frictionless trade between partner include the reform of the international traffic in arm regulation 
 the secretary of state together with the australian prime minister be recently welcome at rolls royce raynesway in my constituency as part of the aukus preparation i be sure the minister would also be welcome if he can find time in his schedule for a visit year ago rolls royce open its door to the uk ’s nuclear skill academy which take on apprentice annually and train they to become nuclear engineer have the minister consider how the government can work with rolls royce to further the uk ’s nuclear skill capacity 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her excellent question and i would be delighted to visit raynesway last august i be pleased to announce the launch of the nuclear skill taskforce jointly with the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie the taskforce will drive activity through a coherent action plan bring together government academia and employer crucially from across both civil and defence nuclear sector include from rolls royce it will build on exist work to address the skill challenge across the nuclear sector and will bolster our ability to deliver on our commitment make under the aukus defence partnership 
 aukus have strong support from across the house but although the time scale seem very long in reality there be grow concern in the defence community that they may already be slip often because of bureaucratic inertia what be be do to keep this vital project on track how often be the minister meet his official to monitor and chase progress 
 i be not aware of any slippage we meet frequently and discuss this incredibly important matter i be pleased to hear his confidence that aukus have cross party support it be generate huge number of job for the future an additional job will be create in raynesway to build the reactor for the uk and australia it be an incredibly exciting project and we be committed to it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 let i make clear that aukus pillar and pillar have labour ’s full backing however we be concern about whether the government ’s current focus on implement aukus be sufficient and we want more uk leadership for this national endeavour the late list of ministerial responsibility from october do not even mention aukus or australia although it do mention the usa minister have agree that pillar should have only a part time official responsible for its implementation if aukus be not even in his job description and his official be work on it part time how can we take the minister seriously when he say it be important 
 the way we take it seriously be not by judge the number of official or what we be do in that regard but by look at what we be actually deliver in the real world in term of military capability and for british industry as i just say the us have reform itar and there be thousand of job across the uk boost our indo pacific capability this be an extremely important project we be make huge progress and the government be very proud of the partnership 
 what step his department be take to support armed force personnel with the cost of living 
 defence have introduce a range of measure to support armed force personnel include cap subsidised accommodation charge to freeze daily food charge increase travel allowance by provide wraparound childcare to family and increase the continuity of education allowance rate from august and implement the big uplift in service pay in year which include for the most junior rank 
 the government claim that service personnel be not financially burden by domestic assignment but a constituent of mine a serve officer of the armed force find himself thousand of pound out of pocket while other report turn to food bank   to survive what discussion be the minister have with cabinet colleague to expand measure and address the cost incur as a result of serve this country during the cost of living crisis 
 the cost of living crisis have affect all our constituent have it not covid have make life difficult for everybody but at the ministry of defence we have recognise as far as we can the pressure that bear particularly on the low pay that be why we have accept the uplift in pay which i think be unique across the public sector for the last year have accept in full the recommendation of the armed forces pay review body 
 i congratulate the minister on the excellent work that he have do to support our armed force with their cost of living may i ask he to be especially aware of the burden that fall on member of our special force the additional burden that they bear within family as well as in the field will he consider that when he think far about way to ameliorate and support their living circumstance 
 i understand my right hon friend ’s interest in this matter he can be sure that the special force although we never talk about they be always at the forefront of our mind 
 what military aid his department plan to provide to ukraine in financial year 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the secretary of state ’s early answer to the former secretary of state and shadow secretary of state 
 in the then prime minister boris johnson announce what military aid the uk would make available to ukraine through to april in september the subsequent prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss announce a full month ago what military aid she would make available to ukraine through to april why have there not yet be an announcement on funding for ukraine for the rest of and beyond 
 in the interest of brevity i refer the hon gentleman to the answer give to the former secretary of state and shadow secretary of state early 
 i welcome the successful conclusion of the raf ’s training of the cohort of ukrainian pilot as they move to learn to fly f-16s can my right hon friend commit that in the next financial year we will continue work with our ally to give ukraine the pilot and plane they need to defend themselves 
 absolutely any pilot training pipeline have a foundational level of fly training that we be able to deliver similarly give that english be the international language of aviation we be able to do   language training as well very obviously the more aircraft specific training have to be deliver by f-16 nation but we be proudly part of that f-16 coalition 
 what step he be take to support israel in prevent terrorist attack 
 we have provide intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance to help anticipate any further attack and to assist with hostage recovery 
 some people have be displace from their home in northern israel because of the fear that if hezbollah adopt the same tactic as hamas the carnage could be even bad than on   october what be the uk government do to try to prevent more weapon from get to hezbollah to de escalate the situation and to see at the very least hezbollah retreat far north from the border 
 i thank my right hon friend we be work alongside our p3 partner to de escalate tension on the blue line and reduce that risk of escalation we be continue our effort to support the resilience of the lebanese armed force who we have help elsewhere with the eventual aim of get they to the lebanese southern border and ensure implementation of un security council resolution 
 what step his department be take to recruit armed force personnel 
 we continue to apply an array of measure to support recruitment and retention and refine the armed force offer those include financial incentive flexible service and an improved accommodation offer the haythornthwaite review have a key part to play and team have be stand up across the ministry of defence to implement all recommendation work to establish a reward and incentive architecture that will attract and retain skill 
 colchester be the proud home of air assault brigade the army ’s rapid reaction force my right hon friend know colchester well what step be he take to promote recruitment into the parachute regiment base at merville barracks in colchester of the uk ’s new and most vibrant city where recruit will be embrace by our local community 
 my hon friend and i both have an affection for the city of colchester the regiment continue to meet its operational requirement there be currently an internal transfer bounty scheme that offer a haythornthwaite compliant £ to infantry private soldier on successful transfer to the parachute regiment that support the army in move towards its future soldier structure and will certainly be of assistance to the regiment 
 despite the answer the minister give to   the hon member for colchester will quince the fact remain that this year retention and recruitment into the armed force be become a serious crisis what be the current difference between intake and outflow for the service 
 i be more than happy to write to the hon gentleman with the detailed breakdown per service break down into regular and reserve he be right to point out that right across the western world there be a crisis in retention and recruitment into the armed force but i hope that the measure that i describe in answer to early question indicate how we be try to address that not least by increase the pay to member of our armed force especially the most junior 
 i call jamie stone not here 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of the ineligibility of certain afghan armed force personnel for the afghan relocation and assistance policy on the wellbeing of serve and retire military personnel 
 it be undoubtedly the case that many of those who serve in afghanistan be deeply disappointed that those they serve with either in the afghan national army or the afghan special force or in the wide apparatus of the state have not be able to come 
 i thank the minister for his answer a constituent who serve in afghanistan tell i recently that current and retired member of our armed force face considerable torment when they see their former afghan colleague leave high and dry by the british government what active step be the minister take to provide support to our service personnel in that situation and to reunite the small but fortunate band of afghan veteran that make it to the uk with their british service colleague 
 within the serving cohort such be the turnover of staffing within the armed force that very few will have have direct operational experience alongside either the afghan armed force or even the patrol interpreter and other who be eligible for arap but the hon and learn lady be right that some element of the serve force will be deeply invest in this matter obviously the chain of command be there to support they and answer their question within the veteran community the sentiment be very strongly hold the reality be that there have to be limit to the uk scheme as there be to those of other country no country have make an open offer to those who serve in the afghan security force all country offer be focus on those who work directly with that country clearly what direct service look like be a matter for debate i suspect that a question on that be come 
 surely special consideration must be give to those member of the afghan special force who even if they do not   work directly for we work extremely closely with we can the minister tell the house how many or how few member specifically of the triples and the special force face a constant threat to their life and ought to be rescue 
 the number that be circulate be around to but that be not a number that the uk government can necessarily verify because we do not have the employment record of those unit 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as we enter i pay tribute to and thank our armed force for all their extraordinary work during i know that the whole house will join i in that sadly be likely to be just as busy we have already discuss the intolerable situation of the houthis close international waterway we call for the iranian back houthis to immediately cease those attack the houthis will bear responsibility for the consequence should they ignore those warning 
 happy new year to you and the whole house mr speaker west lancashire man robert hanson and arthur pim serve in the raf ’s photographic reconnaissance unit during world war take million of photo over enemy line their effort help the ally to defeat the nazis there remain no national monument to the pru i be back be the government 
 i be very grateful to the hon lady for raise the subject and i will certainly be happy to arrange for she to meet with a minister to discuss it far 
 innocent ukrainians have just see in a new year under some of the heavy aerial bombardment since russia ’s illegal war begin will my right hon friend please update the house on what step he be take to ensure ukraine have modern aerial defence system to protect innocent ukrainians from these murderous appal airstrike 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about this ongoing illegal war run by putin we immediately respond to the attack over the new year by bring forward the gifting of further air defence missile i have mention already the international fund for ukraine which be help to provide among other thing air defence 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister for defence procurement have today confirm that hms albion and hms bulwark base in devonport which i be proud to represent be still at risk of be mothball he say that no final decision have be make so the risk to these ship be   real when will a decision be make will the ship be cut or will they be tie up alongside fly the white ensign but never really put to sea 
 of course anyone who be serious about the defence budget have to make the decision about whether to put into maintenance ship that have already serve twice their intend lives—18 year and more time and that would come out of that maintenance after brand new ship be at sea there be obviously a decision for the royal navy to make on that but i remind the house that there be type 26 and type 31 under construction or under contract 
 we face a complex range of security threat and challenge in our rapidly change world cyber attack be increasingly common and nation across the world be prepare to become combat ready for space warfare what assessment have the minister ’s department make of support defence job to assist the uk ’s effort against cyber and space warfare 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who ask a excellent question give the grow importance of the cyber and space domain on cyber i can confirm that the national cyber strategy highlight the government ’s commitment to grow the uk cyber ecosystem and that new cyber career structure be be develop across defence with new way of training upskille and reward our people on space we have create a space academy for government industry and academia and be support cross government work to develop a space workforce action plan for 
 do the minister recognise any semblance of truth in this statement by dominic cummings 
 the scandal of nuclear weapon infrastructure which be a dangerous disaster and a budget nightmare of hard to believe and highly classified proportion 
 regard the coulport naval facility and the nuclear deterrent black hole 
 as with our previous exchange while i respect the hon gentleman ’s position we do not comment on speculation what i can say be that nuclear infrastructure be incredibly important to the future of our deterrent his majesty ’s naval base clyde have develop an establish management plan with a year horizon that provide a strategic vision for the future that be clear and simple and that endure and we have a £ programme for faslane and coulport nuclear facility and nuclear infrastructure 
 last month ’s treaty with japan and italy bring the global air combat programme ’s team tempest a step close to reality it follow news that bae systems be to hire graduate and apprentice this year include more than lancashire base role across the air division what estimate do my hon friend make of the defence sector ’s impact on the economy job prospect and opportunity for young people in place like fylde and indeed chorley 
 that be a very good question 
 it be brilliant news and we be delighted to have sign the treaty with japan and italy last month my hon friend ask about the impact it be fair to say that it will have a particular impact on his constituency which house the warton site where we have our factory of the future for the global combat air programme i can confirm that a report by pwc estimate that the programme would contribute £ to the uk economy between and and support on average job per year many of which will be in lancashire mr speaker and particularly in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 i do not know whether the minister have see the article by the   defence editor mark nicol about the lack of transparency on pinch point in the armed force personnel workforce figure on that use to be produce regularly when be the decision take to no long produce they and will the minister commit today to produce they in the interest of transparency 
 i can not give the right hon gentleman a straight answer to that because i can not remember when the figure be withdraw but i can certainly look into it and write to he on pinch point he will be aware that through haythornthwaite type process we be incentivise people to join part of defence that be underpopulate at the moment such as chef and 
 order i call sir michael fabricant 
 my hon friend have already acknowledge the importance of woman in the armed force will he join i in express belate thank to retire air marshal sir baz north who in a difficult constituency case help i to get someone into the royal air force and will he join i in praise that person lowri simner who have just be promote to squadron leader 
 absolutely i join my hon friend in congratulate they both 
 the service family accommodation at clive barrack in my constituency be concern a family who have severe health problem be live in a mouldy house the defence infrastructure organisation do not want to spend the money on fix those problem it want to move they into a different house for the time in year what be the minister ’s commitment on upgrade and maintain the housing stock particularly on site that be earmark for closure such as clive barrack 
 the hon lady be welcome to write to i about that specific case i pay tribute to she because she consistently raise such accommodation issue we have an exchange about they in westminster hall she mention dio money and as i say in that exchange the key be investment we have double the budget for maintenance and upgrade this year as part of the extra £ that we be put in that be   why we can address the damp and mould in so many property i be happy to look at the specific of the case she mention 
 as the medium report the retirement of hms bulwark and hms albion there be obvious question about britain ’s future amphibious capability which be use so admirably during the falklands war along with the unrivalled skill of our specialist troop do the minister agree that our royal marine commando be an asset that we can not afford to lose 
 i absolutely agree i just want to correct a point that i make early i be talk about frigate but i think   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard   be talk about the landing platform dock on which no decision have be make 
 as my hon friend   the member for wrexham sarah atherton   mention the royal marines be absolutely essential i have ask the sea lord to provide a plan for how their excellent work will be take forward 
 the long run industrial dispute at defence equipment and support in beith in my constituency start in july last year and look set to continue as worker fight for free and equal treatment give the important work that be undertake at that facility not least to ensure that vital equipment be dispatch to ukraine will the secretary of state personally intervene to break the stalemate end the dispute once and for all and provide equality for all worker at the beith site 
 i know how important this issue be to the hon lady differ rate be pay for worker with different skill and qualification which be normal practice in both the public and private sector i understand that a generous pay offer remain on the table it would significantly improve the pay of the worker in dispute beyond the recent pay award which have already significantly uplifted base pay for those specific worker alongside over £ in bonus it be disappointing that gmb member have vote to continue industrial action but de&s official continue to be open to talk with the gmb on a constructive basis 
 the pursuit of exquisite exclusivity in defence procurement be to be laud but can the minister confirm that his department be also focus on procure the logistic platform that we need to sustain it be it perhaps time for a defence operational capability audit to look into that key capability gap 
 my hon friend make an excellent point of course he speak with great experience as we have be stress the whole point of acquisition reform be instead of seek exquisite platform to go for to get they into service fast and then to have spiral development we think that that be the future of procurement 
 our nuclear veteran wait year for recognition and be wait even long for justice in a debate last year the minister promise in the day   ahead to examine document relate to blood and urine test hold by the atomic weapons establishment what do his examination find 
 that be certainly my intention i have not see they yet but i intend to the hon lady will have see the list of i think she will be disappoint about the content of those document when she see they because very few of they will give we any information that will take we any further forward but i commit to read they and will certainly do so in the very near future 
 minister know that sir john moore barrack in my constituency be due for disposal in as part of the future soldier programme which will bring phase capability to the pirbright site and put house in its place will a minister meet i to ensure that the current ministerial team be right behind the move and if it be that we have an intelligent masterplan that do not just help winchester city council to meet its housing target 
 i be more than happy to meet my hon friend 
 the armed force satisfaction survey confirm that half of personnel do not believe that their family benefit from be a service family the impact of service life on family and personal life remain a top factor behind the intention to leave so what do the secretary of state propose to do to listen to force family and implement policy to make a difference 
 it be very important that our service personnel feel that they be not only honour when they go to war but comfortable at home of the big thing i be do be press forward with the review of armed service accommodation include by provide £ to improve that accommodation which will make the life of service personnel well at home 
 a 
 short sight militarily illiterate manoeuvre totally at odd with strategic reality 
 be how the defence committee describe in february the proposal to retire hms albion and hms bulwark ahead of their anticipate lifetime date of and may i advise and warn the secretary of state not to be blindside by the people who be raise this matter again after a change of secretary of state for defence 
 i point out that of course they will be year old but i again stress to the house that no decision have be make on the landing platform dock vessel 
 let i take the minister back to the triples there have be some debate about the extent to which the triples be pay directly by uk force i know that that be the case do the minister accept that and if he do do he not think they should be look at under category rather than category of the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 there be a difference of opinion between the advice i receive from official and the position the hon gentleman have set out it would be good to bring he in to meet those official have that discussion and reach some truth 
 will the ukraine action plan ever be publish well still will there be a ukraine action plan and when will that be publish 
 we work hand in glove with the ukrainian government to make sure that the action plan be that can win the war we have see huge progress in particular in crimea and the black sea and we look forward throughout the house to far progress in for our brave ukrainian friend 
 give that homelessness among veteran have go up by and that it be a cross departmental issue what more be minister do to ensure that all our veteran be house 
 as i say in answer to a previous question homelessness remain a government priority whether or not someone be a veteran in general the experience of our veteran when they return to civilian life be a positive and we should celebrate that 
 clyde build hms argyll be the old escort in the fleet she be currently in refit in devonport and have be since august will the minister for defence procurement advise when she will be recommissione re crewed and back in service 
 i will have to write to the hon gentleman on that 
 urgent question to ask the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office if he will make a statement on the situation in israel and palestine 
 let i begin by reiterate our fundamental belief in israel ’s right to defend itself against hamas the event of   october   be truly horrifying israel have a right to restore its security and to ensure that such horrify event can never be repeat we be also clear that too many civilian have be kill israel need to ensure that its campaign be target on hamas leader and operative fulfil its obligation to protect civilian and be consistent with international humanitarian law 
 no want to see this conflict go on for a moment long than necessary that be why the united kingdom play a lead role in secure the passage of un security council resolution which make clear the urgent demand for expand humanitarian access the resolution also call for the release of hostage and for step towards a sustainable ceasefire for which the british government have consistently lead call 
 britain have be push a number of innovative and impactful approach especially but not only maritime delivery to support aid for gaza we be focus on the big picture and long term strategic value uk ministers be lobby the government of israel hard and regularly to allow more aid in and reduce the numerous constraint that be hinder many aspect of our and other effort to help gazan civilian we have appoint mark bryson richardson as our representative for humanitarian affair in the occupied palestinian territories 
 last week a royal navy vessel deliver tonne of life save uk and cypriot aid destine for gaza into egypt we have also support the united nations world food programme to deliver a new humanitarian land corridor from jordan into gaza and tonne of life save food aid arrive in the delivery and a convoy with tonne of critical supply reach gaza last week partly fund by the united kingdom nevertheless the risk of famine be stark and the foreign secretary and other ministers throughout the government be push the need to address this with the israeli government 
 the government be urge all side to avoid further escalation the situation be fragile and an escalation in violence include on lebanon ’s southern border with israel be not in anyone ’s interest in the red sea the houthis attack against commercial shipping be patently unacceptable we have already take action to deter houthi threat and we will not hesitate to take further action as need 
 there be no perfect formula for peace what i can   say be that gaza should ultimately be under palestinian control and we support a state solution that   guarantee security and stability for both israeli and palestinian people 
 mr speaker the christmas period have not bring peace to the middle east there have be no let up to the intolerable suffering in gaza and no end to the cruelty for hostage million be displace desperate and hungry israel continue to use devastating tactic that have see far too many innocent civilian kill with unacceptable block on essential aid nowhere safe for civilian a grow humanitarian catastrophe and now warning of a deadly famine meanwhile hamas terrorist continue to hold hostage hide among civilian and fire rocket into israel 
 this dire situation must not continue the need for a sustained ceasefire be clear the fighting must stop urgently we need a humanitarian truce now not as a short pause but as the step towards what will stop the killing of innocent provide urgent humanitarian relief ward off famine free hostage and provide the space for a sustainable ceasefire so that fighting do not restart i urge the government to do everything they can to work for a sustained ceasefire which will also ease the grow regional tension across the divide and avoid the catastrophe of a wide war those risk be rise 
 will the minister tell the house what step the government be take to urge restraint in lebanon and to see the full implementation of un security council resolution which would allow civilian on both side of the border to return home in the red sea all the targeting of commercial ship and international trade route that put civilian and military personnel in danger must stop so i welcome the approach of the us the uk germany and other to send clear warning to those responsible will the government ensure that this house have the time and space to scrutinise decision of any significance that may be require 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for what he say and the way he say it he be entirely right about the plight of civilian catch up in this tragedy and the urgent requirement for humanitarian support to get into gaza in much great number 
 the right hon gentleman call for a sustained ceasefire and the british government believe that be the right approach that be why we put so much effort into securing agreement on united nations resolution 
 the right hon gentleman be also entirely right to say it be important that the conflict be contain and from the moment britain have move military asset and other equipment to try to ensure that we detect any likelihood of it spread more widely 
 the right hon gentleman mention in particular what be go on in the red sea and will understand that many government be commit to ensure freedom of navigation and trade we be protect in that extent by international law operation prosperity guardian be in full swing and hms diamond will join hms lancaster shortly 
 i call chair of the select committee 
 thank you mr speaker 
 i welcome the £ for additional food and the special envoy that so many of we have be call for now that israel say it have dismantle hamas in the north of gaza what be the plan to surge aid into the area and what be israel ’s plan to rebuild the territory secondly will my right hon friend give   consideration to my proposal for an israel palestine contact group that can start the hard work of a long term peace process by kick off track negotiation 
 i thank the chairman of the foreign affairs committee for her comment about a contact group which we will look at extremely carefully i be grateful for her welcome for the humanitarian aid co ordinator who be work flat out on these matter and also for what she say about the additional funding for food the problem at the moment be not a shortfall in funding they be in get the food and necessary humanitarian requirement inside gaza 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 thank you mr speaker and may i wish you and your staff a very happy new year 
 of course it have not be a happy new year for the desperate and terrified people trap inside gaza for whom bring further constant bombardment as well as the threat of famine and disease with people injure and almost confirm kill that prove that repeat plea from this government and other for israel to abide by international humanitarian law have be routinely ignore 
 scotland ’s minister recently describe what be happen in gaza as tantamount to ethnic cleansing and south africa have ask the international court of justice to urgently declare israel in breach of the genocide convention for its continued killing of palestinians the destruction of home the expulsion of people and the blockade of food water and medical assistance do the uk government think that scotland ’s minister and the government of south africa be wrong in their assessment of the current situation if they be wrong how be they wrong specifically 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment the government respect the role of the icj and we will of course follow what be go on with great care we have always make it clear that it be up to the court to determine these matter and that all party must ensure that their action be proportionate and necessary and minimise harm to civilian 
 what have we learn since we last meet we have learn that hamas be use north korean weapon we have hear of further example of gender base violence we have hear example of hostage be keep in cage and we have hear the testimony of a release year old hostage agam goldstein almog who speak of sexual violence and torture perpetrate against hostage who be still be hold to top it all in the last few day jibril rajoub a palestinian authority representative and the secretary of fatah ’s central committee have say 
 we view political islam and foremost among it the hamas movement as part of the fabric of our struggle and our political and social fabric 
 give what the minister have say about the need for a state solution and the role of fatah and the pa in that what representation be he make to the pa about the radicalise language that they be use 
 the government urge everyone to exercise restraint in the language that they use but i entirely accept my hon friend ’s point like many other member i see the extensive reporting in the new york times about what happen on   october during the recess and it behove everyone to read it as for the palestinian authority britain and our ally and like minded country be do a great deal of work to try to secure a well arrangement for it when the fighting stop 
 as the minister will know a large number of child be be kill but many other have be wound or maim as a result of the conflict we now know that hospital treatment and hospital facility in gaza have virtually collapse a number of non governmental organisation such as save the children be now work to evacuate child from gaza to ensure that they receive urgent medical treatment in country will the minister ask his official to convene a meeting of the ngos to establish what further assistance our country could give in this respect as we do in the case of ukraine 
 the right hon gentleman be right about the plight of child on both side of this conflict we be in close touch with the ngos that he have cite and we be also consider carefully what contribution a uk medical team could make as the right hon gentleman will know field hospital both inside and outside gaza be an important aspect of that they could have a dramatic effect and use they would be much well than take people who be wound either on to ship or to other country we be look at all these matter to try and address the precise problem that the right hon gentleman have describe 
 the conflict be clearly escalate and no single power or indeed alliance be in full control but what we should not lose control over be freedom of navigation and shipping movement in international water surely a red line have already be cross because ship have be target can my right hon friend tell i what will happen if shipping be far target will we not just take out those missile in the air but attack the silos from which they be launch 
 my right hon friend will have see that hms diamond have shoot down an attack drone on i think the occasion that the navy have be in action in that way for year he will also have hear what the government have say like many other country they have make it crystal clear that we will not accept the fettering of the international right of navigation and all those involve in try to frustrate that should hear those word 
 just today medical aid for palestinians have report that along with the international rescue committee ’s emergency medical team it have be force to withdraw and cease activity at al aqsa hospital the only function hospital in gaza ’s middle area as a result of increase israeli military activity around it there seem to be a repetition of the dismantling of health service that we have witness in the north in the south and middle   of gaza can the minister tell we whether the government ’s support for the continue bombing of civilian and civilian infrastructure will now apply in every conflict or whether it apply only in relation to palestinian civilian and palestinian hospital 
 the hon lady know very well that all party must ensure that their action be proportionate and necessary and minimise harm to civilian and it be in that context that we seek on all occasion to urge the israeli government to adopt those key criterion 
 i call sir alec shelbrooke 
 there will not be a single person in the house today whose heart do not break for the death of innocent civilian which be a consequence of any conflict be the government have any discussion in the wide arab region to get hamas to move away from their state aim of destroy israel and to ensure that they disarm which would allow a basis on which to bring this fighting to an end 
 may i offer my right hon friend my congratulation on his honour he be right about the importance of ensure that all pressure be put on hamas to desist from these outrageous and horrendous proposal that make up part of its charter the british government through a whole variety of different mean do everything we can to prosecute that case 
 said zaaneen a phd student at the university of sheffield have be trap in gaza by the war he be an extremely able student who have a full scholarship from the university and he be keen to continue his study the foreign office have be compile list of those who wish to leave but it be currently limit to dual national and their immediate dependant i appreciate all the difficulty at the rafah crossing but would the minister consider extend eligibility for the foreign office list to those palestinian national who like said be in the middle of course at uk university or will he at least agree to meet i to discuss the case 
 i think the answer be for the hon gentleman and i to have a chat immediately after this urgent question and we will see what we can do to help 
 woman and girl be report to have be rap or mutilate by hamas in at least different location in israel in a deliberate systematic and premeditated way hostage have be reportedly subject to appal sexual abuse too these be girl as young as or and they be still there what assessment have my right hon friend ’s department make of the emerge evidence document hamas style savagery what conversation have he have with the red cross which should be stop at nothing to insist on access to these hostage 
 i thank my hon friend for her remark our contact and heavy involvement with the red cross and red crescent be happen daily in term of her   core remark it be the british government ’s endeavour to ensure that there will not be impunity for those who commit these horrendous crime no matter how long it take we will do everything we can to ensure that that impunity do not exist 
 the israeli defence minister have set out proposal for the post war governance of gaza involve a multinational taskforce work with palestinians to restore peace order and normality what be the british government ’s assessment of those proposal 
 we greatly welcome all constructive proposal and we welcome the point that the israeli minister have make that when this dreadful conflict be over gaza must be run by palestinians 
 overcrowding and inadequate food water shelter and sanitation the world health organisation have already warn that these be ideal condition for disease to spread what step be my right hon friend take to support partner on the ground in gaza to help prevent the outbreak and spread of disease 
 my hon friend be entirely correct there be a huge danger that as a result of insufficient food appal sanitation and inadequate shelter make bad by the winter rain these condition will persist and that be why we be intent on try to get the number of truck that get into gaza up to a day it be also why we have deploy this medical team work with other to see what can be do immediately on the ground 
 the israel defence forces chief spokesperson reflect on saturday on the destruction of hamas in the north of gaza before the idf start to tackle hamas more seriously in the centre and the south he say 
 we will do this differently base on the lesson we have learn from the fighting so far 
 what confidence do the minister have that israel will conduct its counter insurgency operation in such a way as to abide by international humanitarian law 
 it be not for i to guess the military tactic of what be go on in gaza but all i can say to the hon gentleman be to repeat the point i have make before all party must ensure that their action be proportionate necessary and minimise harm to civilian 
 member of the israeli government have express their desire that settler should return to gaza at some point after the conflict away from the terrible massacre take place in that awful conflict zone the situation in the west bank continue to deteriorate in a very welcome move the uk government announce that they would bring in travel ban on violent settler but do the minister agree that in order to deter this activity which be worsen by the day something more draconian may be need would he please look at institute immediate ban on trade with settlement 
 i can tell my right hon friend that his point about the importance of these matter be well understand by the government on his point that be not the policy of the government he will be aware that we be oppose to boycott divestment and sanction that be the position of the government 
 senior representative of israel continue to use language endorse genocide against palestinians prime minister netanyahu say that the idf would turn gaza into rubble and a senior leader in the israeli army have say that in gaza 
 there will be no electricity and no water there will only be destruction 
 on lbc radio last week the israeli ambassador advocate the full destruction of gaza and say that there be no alternative last week i write to the foreign secretary to ask he to condemn her genocidal word but he refuse will the minister now condemn her remark and commit to take the strong possible action against she 
 no but i can tell the hon member that in respect of the humanitarian difficulty that he have identify we be do everything we can to try to secure unhindered humanitarian access and we will continue to do so 
 give that hamas will never accept a state solution do the minister agree that any state solution must exclude hamas or any rename successor from any role in the government of gaza after this horror be all over 
 there be clearly no place in any future settlement for hamas and their vile ideology and terrorist action the state solution must be drive forward by people of good will on all side 
 last week when the israeli ambassador be tell she be make 
 an argument for destroy the whole of gaza 
 she reply 
 do you have another solution 
 genocidal rhetoric like that have be echo by a litany of israeli official and be match by a murderous bombing campaign that have now kill more than palestinians that be why israel now face the charge of genocide at the international court of justice will the minister expel the israeli ambassador for her genocidal rhetoric will he support the case against israel at the international court of justice and will he end his government ’s complicity in this atrocity by ban arm sale to israel and demand an immediate ceasefire 
 as i think the hon member will know we be press for a sustainable ceasefire as well as humanitarian cause and we be do everything we can in that respect in respect of the wide matter about international humanitarian law the judgment that the foreign secretary make on   december   on these matter still stand there have be no additional evidence since that time to suggest otherwise 
 regard the south african application into the international court of justice our us ally have describe it as 
 meritless counterproductive and completely without any basis in fact 
 the irish prime minister also appear to have distance himself from it will my right hon friend say a bit more about his view on that application at the icj do he agree that use term such as genocide be actually an inversion of the truth in this context 
 i do think that use such inflammatory term be unhelpful i agree with my right hon friend about that in respect of the icj south africa be entirely entitle to refer this matter right hon and hon member will reach conclusion for themselves on whether something like that be helpful at this time 
 my right hon friend like i will bear in mind that israel be a state party to the geneva convention of so it be oblige to take action against those accuse of grave breach of international humanitarian law because of the nature of israeli society that be something that we would expect it to do be those circumstance to arise 
 blwyddyn newydd dda happy new year more than people have die in gaza since october and entire community have be raze to the ground while the international court of justice have a clear definition of genocide there remain no legal definition of ethnic cleansing will the government act to ensure a definition of ethnic cleansing in law so that this legal test may be apply to the conflict 
 i be sure that there will be plenty of time for these legal concept to be question and advance but the central aim of the british government today be to get relief and humanitarian supply into gaza to help those who be trap there and who have be eloquently describe across the house this afternoon 
 too many civilian and child have die a sustainable ceasefire be need urgently there be concern about malaria scabie and other disease so as well as food and medicine will the minister prioritise fuel for hospital and health worker 
 there have be an increase in the amount of fuel get into gaza but my right hon friend be right that it need to be distribute we be look very carefully at how we can make progress on that 
 more than palestinians have be kill third of they woman and child our own foreign secretary have warn israel that civilian death in gaza be too high now a state have trigger the genocide convention which will be determine by the international court of justice this week yet britain continue to grant weapon licence and to export weapon to israel do the minister agree that it would be reckless to continue to grant weapon licence and to export weapon to israel as that could support a potential act of genocide and render uk government official complicit in genocide under article of the rome statute 
 the hon lady will know that britain have of the tough arm export regulation regime in the world clearly any new application would be consider by that very tough regime in the normal way 
 hamas leader have long enjoy impunity move freely between turkey lebanon and qatar financing and amass international support for their terror activity do my right hon friend agree that this special treatment by those nation have result in hamas accrue the capability that lead to the barbaric evil and frankly medieval   october   massacre will he ensure that more be do to clamp down on state that facilitate the strengthening of hamas 
 my hon friend make a very good case he be right that we must ensure that those who perpetrate the dreadful evil to which he refer be not able to do so again 
 happy new year mr speaker the secretary of state have indicate that he be in contact with the israeli government and be express the government ’s view but have he raise with they the prospect of widespread disease and famine among palestinian people in gaza if so have he receive any sympathetic response from the israeli government that they be aware that how they be conduct their bombing campaign be likely to bring that about 
 these discussion be go on all   the time and they be greatly assist by the british government ’s appointment of mark bryson richardson the humanitarian co ordinator the prime minister the foreign secretary and other ministers have be actively engage in make the point to which the hon gentleman refer so he may rest assure that there be no lack of explanation from the british government in that respect 
 we all want a sustainable ceasefire that lead to a last peace but it be easy to forget that a ceasefire exist between israel and hamas on   october and we all know what happen the follow day do my right hon friend believe that a sustainable ceasefire can ever be achieve while hamas remain in place 
 i hope that my hon friend will forgive i if i do not speculate on his last point but he be right that we need to work towards a sustainable ceasefire we need yet more urgently humanitarian pause because in order for there to be a ceasefire both party must be willing to accept it that be of the reason why britain go to such effort to ensure that council resolution be secure 
 the statement we have just hear really do not measure up to the need of the occasion people already kill displace thousand die in the rubble thousand of child die because of a lack of medical care and food and people die of starvation thirst and hunger in the gaza strip at the present time can the government not understand the anger around the world when they watch this happen in real time and why so many people be very pleased that the government of south africa have take the initiative by go to the   international court of justice to hold israel to account for the death of so many wholly innocent people in gaza can the government not understand that and at least support the south african process 
 the policy of the government support i think by those on the opposition front bench be to secure a sustainable ceasefire the problem with the right hon gentleman ’s analysis in my view be that it do not take adequate account of the quite appalling event that take place on   october when more jewish people be murder in a pogrom than at any time since the end of the world war 
 the government have say that there will be consequence if houthi attack on international shipping continue what will those consequence be when will they start and will they include both the houthi rebel and their iranian backer 
 my right hon friend raise an important point that point be separate from the conflict in gaza but she will have hear what the prime minister the defence secretary and the foreign secretary have say and she will have hear those remark echo by our ally i very much hope that the houthis and other will draw the right conclusion from that 
 the right hon member talk a number of time about resolution but the fact be that the aid be still not get through there be not even sufficient bakery to bake the bread for the people and as member have say disease be rife in palestine how be we go to support the innocent people that hamas be use as shield and that the idf be also use to attack hamas how can those people have any sort of a life when so many have be kill so far and so many be now affect by the huge amount of disease 
 the hon gentleman be right about the danger of disease which i spell out a few moment ago to of his hon friend but the critical requirement be to ensure that we focus on get additional support in that be why we have support so strongly the route in from jordan to gaza and why the british royal fleet auxiliary have be take british and cypriot aid from cyprus down to egypt 
 recently the israeli ambassador to the uk very candidly say that there be absolutely no chance of a state solution have my right hon friend work out whether the ambassador be speak independently or whether she be reflect the view of the israeli government if the latter be the case do that not sound like a slap in the face for uk policy if it be the former that she be make up her own view how can she be rely upon as a faithful conveyor of the israeli government ’s message 
 my hon friend will have note a variety of different comment that have be make by israeli spokesman and israeli ministers but it be very strongly the policy of the british government and many other government that we should work when this appalling conflict be over towards a state solution where both israel and palestine can live behind secure and safe border 
 happy new year to you and your team mr speaker it be clear that any sustainable ceasefire will have to involve an accountability mechanism for the allegation of war crime whether the taking of hostage rape or genocide now that there be the case before the international court of justice bring by south africa uk resident have a right to know the approach that their government be take to that i ask the minister on and   december   to set out what mechanism for uphold international law the government support for the avoidance of doubt will he now say that the government have a position on the court and what role it will play and whether he believe all party should abide by any outcome from it 
 the hon lady be entirely right to talk about accountability mechanism in this urgent question i have make it clear at least twice that the british government be absolutely supportive of that and do not want any culture of impunity to pertain afterwards i have spell out what the government think about the reference to the international court we respect the role of the international court and we be follow closely what be go on it be up to the court to determine these matter whether or not it be helpful to launch that challenge at this particular point be a matter on which there will be disagreement on both side of the house 
 last week i visit kfar aza for the time since i last go there year ago a massacre have take place when i be at the kibbutz last week i feel it be the close to evil that i have ever be i meet the family of some of the hostage i know that the british red cross and un organisation be active on the ground in try to look after the welfare of child however that do not appear to extend to the hostage of whom be only month old will the minister outline whether the government be take any step to make sure that this be happen and that there be a strategy to ensure the welfare of the hostage 
 my hon friend be right to identify the agony be feel by so many of the hostage family relation and love one some hostage remain in gaza and we be work closely with more than country to help to secure their release it be probably not helpful for i to give a run commentary in the house but my hon friend may rest assure that we be do everything we can to secure their early release 
 i hear what the minister say early in response to my hon friend   the member for argyll and bute brendan o’hara   and a government back bencher about the international court of justice but i wonder whether he have have time to read south africa ’s page application it be rather damning and some lawyer say it be a strong application i agree with the minister that it be for the court not politician to decide whether there have be a genocide however if he have have time to look at south africa ’s submission do he at least agree that it seem prima facie that israel have commit some serious breach of international law in gaza for which it must be hold accountable 
 it be not for i to exercise that judgment the truth of the matter be that i have not read all page but i have be brief on they it must now be leave to the court to reach its determination 
 i welcome the government ’s role in send more aid secure the opening of the kerem shalom cross and secure un resolution alongside my right hon friend ’s rightful focus on what we can do to help the dire health and hunger situation in gaza how confident be he however that the economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill will adequately reflect widespread concern about illegal and violent israeli activity in the occupied palestinian territories 
 i think that must wait until wednesday the government do not believe that public body should be able to waste public money pursue their own foreign policy and i be sure that these point will be properly tease out on wednesday in respect of the very difficult humanitarian situation which my hon friend rightly describe the inadequate shelter be make bad by the winter rain that we be see and there be a real danger of disease spread that be reason why britain have deploy a medical team to see what we can do to help with this desperate situation particularly in rafah but also throughout gaza 
 israel be commit war crime on a daily basis in gaza we have see the forced displacement and collective punishment of palestinians starvation use as a weapon healthcare facility and journalist target and much more as we have hear south africa be now take forward a legal case against israel in the international court of justice if as it could that court quickly issue an order for israel to immediately suspend its military operation will the government uphold that order by finally finally call for an immediate ceasefire as many of we have be demand 
 as the hon gentleman know the policy of an immediate ceasefire be not share by either the government or indeed those on the opposition front bench in respect of the work of the court let we wait and see what the court decide he ask i a hypothetical question and i think we should wait and see what the court say 
 it be now almost day since hamas commit their evil atrocity in israel also hostage be still hold in captivity by hamas terrorist the international red cross have not have access to those hostage the old of which be over and the young under year old what action be my right hon friend take to ensure that the international red cross can insist on see the hostage and look after their health 
 my hon friend be right to focus on the appalling agony and plight of the hostage as i say early i do not think it be helpful to rehearse in the house precisely what we be do but he may rest assure that we be in continuous contact with the red cross and do everything we possibly can along with our ally to try to secure the hostage release 
 the idf claim that as many as hamas terrorist have be kill while at the same time there be report that hamas be train child to take their place the position of the more than hostage still be hold by hamas look incredibly precarious will the minister outline what progress can be make and how the uk can ensure that those people can be release and israel can be in a position to begin to seek peace do the minister believe that the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have a role to play in that peacemaking 
 the answer to my hon friend ’s final point be yes and he set out with great eloquence the issue and problem face by the hostage in this appalling situation he will have hear what i say to other hon member in that respect 
 before we reach a ceasefire something need soon rather than later accord to many of my constituent doctor in bolton dr samir naseet and dr ibrahim hamami have ask what preparation we be make to prepare the ground for the post ceasefire period by lead on volunteer medical practitioner go to gaza at that time 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s work in this respect i know how much work he have be do with community in his constituency who be engage with gaza i will take careful note of the point that he have make 
 i think everybody here condemn the heinous attack by hamas on   october   and the taking of hostage and we all want their safe and immediate release but that do not excuse the brutal indiscriminate and disproportionate violence that the idf be perpetrate on innocent gazan civilian our world must operate on a rule base system and that include our ally give the scale of casualty may i press the minister on whether he and the government will support not come to a decision on the icc ’ investigate potential war crime and make all evidence available to it 
 the hon lady will have hear what i have say about any culture of impunity in respect of her central question all i can do be reiterate the point i have already make that the british government be insistent that all party must ensure that their action be proportionate and necessary and that they take account of civilian harm
