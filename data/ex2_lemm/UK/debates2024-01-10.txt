it be a pleasure to have sit through the committee stage of the bill and to hear the government talk about the advantage we have from brexit i be pleased to hear that the government have look and continue to look extensively at the taxation system in particular at the interpretation of vat as mention in this clause 
 interpretation of vat in this country massively affect people who be visually impair and those who can not read perhaps because of dyslexia there be no vat on book but the treasury apply vat at to audiobook if that interpretation of vat be to be take as far as it possibly can i be disappointed that disabled people be not be protect within the structure of the bill in the way that they have be for many year 
 year ago when i be disability minister i be tell that vat change could not happen because we be in the eu we be no long in the eu and we can set our vat rate as we would like it would be fundamentally good if the government come forward with an interpretation of vat that say that people who rely on audiobook through no fault of their own do not have to be penalise by vat at i be not talk only about the visually impaired i declare an interest i be dyslexic and rely on audiobook although not completely people who do not read braille be be punish as well 
 the government continue to look at new taxation rule and new way of make sure that people do not get around the taxation system and it be clear that they be look at the implementation of vat what well spring present for those who rely on audiobook than for the minister to say that he will meet i talk about the issue far and perhaps look at the early day motion in my name 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on trend in the level of private investment in research and development in the last month 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on trend in the level of private investment in research and development in the last month 
 this government have a fantastic track record of mobilise private investment in research and innovation alongside deliver the large ever public spending which will reach £ a year next financial year in november the global investment summit see commitment to invest almost £ in the uk include the decision by flagship pioneering of the world ’s lead life science investor to have its international base in the uk 
 hertford and stortford lie at the heart of the innovation corridor so private investment be very important to business in my constituency do the minister have any assessment of the likely impact of the mansion house reform on that trend and the great track record of private investment 
 like its member of parliament hertford and stortford be indeed innovative the mansion house reform which in my previous role i help the chancellor to deliver will unlock an estimate £ of investment to scale up high growth company across the whole united kingdom include in my hon friend ’s constituency that sit alongside our £ initiative for long term investment for technology and science lifts which will focus particularly on british pensioner invest in long term growth opportunity in tech and the life science when it come to british innovation this government be all in and i hope that in financial institution will be too 
 in october the government announce the £ regional innovation fund to boost university support for regional economic growth wales be allocate £ through the barnett formula however disappointingly there be no evidence of that money   have be spend on its intended purpose in wales what assistance can the minister provide to encourage the welsh government to invest wales ’s proportion of the regional innovation fund in boost the welsh economy 
 as my hon friend say the recently announce regional innovation fund be provide £ of funding across the united kingdom to harness the strength of our university it be intensely disappointing that the labour government in wales have not see fit to spend that in the same way ultimately that be a decision for the labour government and i be sure that the electorate will hold they to account for that 
 private investment will need to ratchet up significantly if it be to offset the loss to the research sector that we be see as international student application plummet as a result of government policy what be the minister and his colleague do to offset that decline in resource 
 once again it be an enormous shame that the hon member for the wonderful cluster of cambridgeshire be so keen to talk down the united kingdom at every opportunity this government be mobilise more public funding for research and development than ever before and mobilise private investment capital on the back of that—£2 for every £ that the government put in 
 yesterday i be talk to a minister in the lobby and he refer to how impressed he be by the northern ireland workforce i be equally impressed as the member for strangford when it come to research and development across the united kingdom what be northern ireland get to help our workforce grow to train our people and to make we an integral part of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 have visit northern ireland i be aware of just how innovative and highly skilled it be and how much opportunity and headroom there be it be very important to i as the minister for science and research that northern ireland punch above its weight i would be delighted to visit northern ireland to meet business entrepreneur and innovator there 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that vulnerable customer be support when their phone line be transition to the digital network 
 on   december i convene the uk ’s lead telecom provider to discuss the next step to protect vulnerable household when provider upgrade phone line as a result telecom provider have now sign a charter commit to concrete measure to protect vulnerable household this be a positive step by industry to make sure that safety continue to be at the heart of the nationwide switchover 
 a concern about the new digital network for vulnerable people in north west norfolk who rely on personal alarm in emergency be loss of service   in a power cut will my right hon friend ensure that those welcome new protection deliver robust back up plan in such circumstance and that they be clearly communicate to customer 
 i absolutely agree that the power resilience of our digital infrastructure be key to keep people connect as part of sign up to the voluntary charter the main communication provider have promise to work towards provide more powerful back up solution that go beyond ofcom ’s minimum requirement i have have multiple conversation with ofcom on this matter it be now consult with the aim of far strengthen the uk ’s resilience on power cut 
 rural connectivity remain a huge problem in my constituency as the secretary of state say the charter have be introduce however it be introduce over a year into the process when thing have already go wrong what be she go to do to rectify that 
 i would like to correct the hon member the decision on the public switch telephone network be make by business because of the problem with the exist copper line and the fact that that too pose significant challenge what we have do be take proactive step by convene industry to ensure that they be go far than their exist commitment and we have involve the regulator at every step 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 great digital connectivity be now absolutely vital to people ’s life chance and we do not want rural area to be leave behind that be why we be put £ into gigabit so that it be in every corner of the country we be put cash into satellite for the hard to reach bit we have a plan for mobile operator to get much more phone coverage the good bit of course be that we have a new rural connectivity champion in my hon friend   the member for barrow and furness simon fell to get the countryside connect 
 i be delighted to hear everything the minister have to say but what further advice can she give to a colleague keen to champion specific rural community face challenge with poor digital connectivity 
 i want to reassure my hon friend that a lot of work be be do on gigabit and mobile reception for rural area there be a regional procurement under way that cover his constituency and a neighbouring but i also recommend that constituent elect great   mp who can hold i and building digital uk to account in the surgery we hold in parliament they already have such an mp in he he be clearly do something right because walsall north have gigabit capable coverage compare with a national average of all i would say to tamworth be take note 
 my hon friend will be aware of the difficulty in secure a project gigabit contract for lancashire once sign a contract will help isolated premise and rural community get a much need superfast connection last month i speak with bduk about progress on the procurement process what step be she take to ensure that timescale do not slip and that we can see installation under way for the half of this year as currently plan 
 i thank my hon friend for hold i to account and i very much share his sense of urgency his constituency have gigabit capable coverage so it be above the average but none the less i understand the frustration that people have when their premise be not cover i reassure he that i raise this matter with bduk yesterday i want to get go as fast as possible we expect that procurement to be sort in the summer 
 i welcome my hon friend back to her place she will know what be come base on the multiple conversation that she and i and various digital ministers over the year have have on the woeful delivery of rural broadband in scotland which be the responsibility of the scottish government the reach scheme be suppose to bring fast internet to property across the north and north east by the end of but so far it have deliver only a little over with over still to go and r100 north contract delivery in the banffshire and buchan coast constituency since my hon friend have return to her post what discussion have she have with the scottish government about deal with the pause implement on bduk and scottish government 
 order i call the minister 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s work in this area he be a tremendous champion for his constituency he will be aware that i speak to the scottish government before i go on maternity leave i ask for an update on that work yesterday when i speak to bduk i understand that progress be be make i be anxious to get that sorted because scotland be miss out and fall behind other part of the uk that be not good enough and i want to help he to do everything he can to get this moving 
 i have raise with the minister over and over again the subject of the village of bryncethin in my constituency where street still do not have connectivity bt broadband have now come in to do the work which it say it will complete in that be just not acceptable will the minister point out to bt broadband again that the position need to be rectify quickly and that the work on those street should not take year 
 as the hon gentleman will know thing be change in wales because the welsh government be start to take some of the contract in house that work be under way but i be happy to look into   that specific issue with openreach on his behalf because i appreciate the frustration feel by his constituent those welsh government contract be be take in house because we think we will be well place to deliver they 
 when it come to rural connectivity nothing can be more important than connectivity for the emergency service do the minister agree that it be a disgrace that the emergency service network upgrade programme be year late and now have a budget of more than £ which be nearly time its original budget 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the vital importance of ensure that the emergency service network be up and run and that it be robust particularly in rural area i be not aware of the specific issue in his constituency i be happy to look into they but as far as i be aware the programme be on track 
 the share rural network be key to improve mobile coverage in rural area but the map show the partial notspot certainly do not reflect the live experience of my constituent what will the minister do to improve the datum that company use for decide where to put their improved service 
 that be an important issue and we have raise it with ofcom because we share the hon lady ’s concern that the data be not good enough and be not be reflect in constituent actual experience i be very alive to this problem and want it to be put right 
 what step her department be take to support innovation in the technology sector 
 the science and technology framework be our clear plan for support innovation through our critical technology that underpin the future of the uk economy we have already commit significant investment to those technology include £ for quantum £ for engineering biology and £ for semiconductor we be also drive innovation through initiative such as regulatory sandbox focus on future skill and establish a new digital market regime to promote more dynamic competition in digital market 
 we have see in recent year how much innovative technology can do to track down criminal and we have see for instance the use of drone in the war in ukraine what some of we can not understand be why we and the french can not use more of this innovative technology to track down the criminal gang who be herd people on beach and put their life at risk why can we not devote more resource to catch these people with new technology 
 i thank my hon and gallant friend for his question i can confirm that my colleague in the home office be absolutely committed to break the    business system of these callous and illegal criminal gang a key part of that be technological innovation and a range of technology be be use 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 business i speak to are excited about the innovation that artificial intelligence offer but deeply frustrated by the government ’s uncertainty over regulation the original white paper be delay for a whole year when it finally land ministers tell parliament that a response to the consultation would happen in but we be now in will business have to wait for an election to be give the certainty they need or will the secretary of state and her ministerial team commit to publish the response this month 
 business have make it clear that they want we to ensure that we understand the risk or ai but also the balance between those risk and the opportunity that ai present we have already commit to publish the response to the consultation in due course 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the propose sale of the rosalind franklin institute a critical piece of national infrastructure will be hugely damaging to innovation in biomedical science i appreciate that the science minister will be meet i later today to discuss the issue but can the minister explain how this sale sit with the uk government ’s plan to be a science superpower 
 i hope that my colleague the science minister will be able to address the hon lady ’s concern at that meeting 
 what step she be take to increase access to ai skill training 
 the government have fund a broad package of ai skill initiative through the education pipeline to address the skill gap and to support citizen and business to take advantage of the wealth of opportunity that ai technology provide we have fund a new ai master ’s conversion course and publish draft guidance to help training provider develop business relevant ai skill training 
 the defence ai strategy acknowledge an ai skill gap across the whole of defence and promise to work with industry to provide expertise in ai and develop a skill framework that be year ago where be it 
 the hon member do not quite grasp the magnitude of what we have do on this agenda we have invest £ in it since we also recently publish guidance to support business to adopt ai we will continue to prioritise that area 
 i call the chair of the science and technology committee 
 just before christmas the eu institution declare that they have agree to a new eu ai act what assessment have the secretary of state make of that how do her intend approach in the uk differ 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s work in this space the eu have take a slightly different tack from we we want to foster innovation in ai seize the opportunity for our public service and ensure that the job be locate here in the uk that be why we have our domestic track we will produce a white paper shortly and also why we introduce an international track and convene the entire world for the ever global ai safety summit we be certainly lead in this area 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be vital that britain grasp the opportunity of ai to grow our economy and to modernise vital public service that rely on have a supply of highly train staff however the government be fail in that their ai scholarship scheme be flounder with ministers find only of the funding they promise why have the department fail when will the secretary of state authorise an urgent review of this vital policy area 
 perhaps the hon member miss my answer to the previous question so i will indulge he by repeat it since we have dedicate £ to ai skill that do not sound like a government who be fail on that agenda 
 whether she be take step with cabinet colleague to help retain researcher from overseas who be work in the uk 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to encourage overseas researcher and innovator to come to the uk 
 i hope that the hon member and their party will join i in celebrate just what a fantastic place the uk be for international researcher to work and live we have of the strong science basis the world ’s lead university and research institution and the large ever public research and development budget with our association with horizon from the beginning of the year we be central to global research collaboration 
 this year the migration advisory committee will review the graduate immigration route international research student who be currently do phds in the uk be attract to come here because of the ability to stay on and work after complete their phd. will the minister engage with the home office to   confirm that research student who arrive in the uk this year will continue to be entitle to a period of post study work 
 in keep the uk an open and welcome place to do international research in order to deliver the prime minister ’s vision of be a science superpower my colleague and i regularly meet home office colleague the fact belie the hon gentleman ’s question of postgraduate research in the uk today be be conduct by researcher who have come from overseas 
 the government ’s recent spousal visa policy to increase the salary threshold be force academic and innovator to leave i give the minister the example of a british constituent of mine who be graduate from oxford with a phd which be fund by uk research and innovation his american wife who be graduate from bangor with a phd can not live with he because the job he have be offer be pay well below the salary threshold why be the government use taxpayer money to educate people to become highly qualified researcher if their immigration policy then force they to leave 
 a fair immigration policy be absolutely part of an open britain it be right that those who come here from overseas and live cheek by jowl with those who clean their lab drive their local bus and empty their bin do their fair share in contribute to the uk economy 
 do my hon friend agree that of the reasons—[interruption 
 order when a member be ask a question other member should wait or be seat 
 do my hon friend agree that of the great strength of our rejoin horizon and the other european programme be that our expert researcher and top professor will lead research team that attract researcher from across the world include the eu that be way to retain researcher here 
 my right hon and learn friend make an apposite point i would ask all member of this house to go back to their constituency and talk to local firm innovator cluster and university to make sure the uk punch above its weight in the horizon programme 
 in my constituency phytome be a fantastic independent researcher of agro pharmaceutical i invite the minister to visit the firm day what more be he do to ensure that we can attract the very good talent from around the world into life science even in cornwall 
 i would be delighted to visit the innovative firm in my hon friend ’s constituency she will know about the global talent visa which have see a rise in visa issue over the last year alone welcome the world ’s good scientist to britain ’s science and technology superpower 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this year my ministerial team and i will be laser focused on delivery we will back the science and tech business that be grow the economy create new job and improve life across our country we want to make sure that british people have the skill they need to take advantage of those job and we also want to support innovative start up across our country to scale up here and stay in the uk we want to use regulation as a tool for innovation by design a transparent set of rule that encourage our entrepreneur to be bold and we want to ensure that the british people truly feel the benefit 
 in advance of the budget what discussion have the minister have with the treasury regard crucial funding for the development and uptake of human specific technology as oppose to use animal for experimentation and research in the uk 
 the day can not come quickly enough when we be able to end the practice of animal testing that day be not now but this government be commit to do everything we can to bring forward and support the development of replacement technology the hon gentleman have my commitment that we will do that at the right pace 
 will the minister join i in congratulate saxavord on gain its spaceport licence from the civil aviation authority do he agree that the site in shetland will serve as a critical vertical launch site not just for the uk but for the rest of europe and beyond and as such be deserve of full uk government support

 i call the shadow minister 
 a recent study have show that through digitisation the uk ’s small business can generate £ in additional revenue and create new job in this country however around in small business do not see new technology as relevant to their company and do not see tech investment as offer good value for money cite a lack of skill and knowledge what be be do to ensure that small business be not leave behind in the technological revolution 
 we work very closely with the department for business and trade on this agenda and we work with the department for education on skill in general we have fantastic programme such as innovate   uk which be help to support business with the uptake of artificial intelligence we recently produce additional guidance too 
 i welcome my hon friend the minister for science research and innovation to of the great office of state and i thank the secretary of state for support the science and technology superpower mission do she agree that as the prime minister plan a rightly robust response to the post office saga we need to learn important lesson about technology procurement to make sure that whitehall never again repeat this appalling misjustice interruption 
 you will see from the loud cheer the popularity of the former minister mr speaker and let i take the opportunity to thank he for his hard work and dedication to the science innovation and technology agenda he work very hard on the science and technology framework an important pillar of which as he know be procurement and i absolutely agree with the sentiment he echo 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 happy new year to you mr speaker now then the horizon post office scandal see hundred of innocent people send to prison people like a former constituent of mine who go to jail for year during this scandal the leader of the liberal democrats be the minister in charge of the post office this be the same liberal democrat leader who in the past have call for the resignation of over prominent people in this country who have make mistake in their job so do the prime minister agree that the leader of the lib dems should take his own advice and start by clear his desk clear his diary and clear off 
 this be of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation ’s history people who work hard to serve their community have their life and reputation destroy through absolutely no fault of their own the victim must get justice and compensation sir wyn williams inquiry be undertake crucial work to expose what go wrong and we have pay almost £ in compensation to more than victim but today i can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convict as a result of the horizon scandal be swiftly exonerated and compensate we will also introduce a new up front payment of £ for the vital glo group litigation order group of postmaster may i also thank my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   for all his hard work on this issue he will set out more detail to the house shortly   we will make sure that the truth come to light we right the wrong of the past and the victim get the justice they deserve 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i hear what the prime minister just say about the post office scandal it be a huge injustice people lose their life their liberty and their livelihood and they have be wait far too long for the truth for justice and for compensation so i be glad that the prime minister be put forward a proposal we will look at the detail and it be the job of all of we to make sure that it deliver the justice that be so need 
 back in when boris johnson claim he would send asylum seeker to rwanda ambitious tory mp have reservation he agree with labour that it would not work it be a waste of money and it be the late in a long line of gimmick do the prime minister know what happen to that mp 
 what the right hon and learn gentleman refer to be a document that he have not see and i have not see and that have be report hand in a bunch of medium newspaper what i can tell he be that i be absolutely clear that we need to stop the boat that be what this government and that mp be go to deliver 
 i notice that the prime minister do not deny it i be not surprised with £ of taxpayer money down the drain no send to rwanda and small boat still come it be hardly a surprise that he want to scrap the scheme when he be try to sneak in as tory leader but he have be catch red handed oppose the very thing that he have now make his flagship policy which member should we listen to the before we today or the who use to believe in something 
 i have always be crystal clear you do need to have an effective deterrence to finally solve this problem in fact the national crime agency agree that you need 
 an effective removal and deterrence agreement 
 that be why after become prime minister i negotiate a new deal with albania thank to which we have see a drop in illegal arrival from albania that be how australia stop the boat that be why italy germany and austria be all look at similar scheme he be the only who be oppose to a proper deterrent not because it do not work but because he do not actually believe in control migration every single time he pick the people smuggler over the british people 
 we should smash the gang process the claim and end hotel use that be our plan but unlike the prime minister i believe in it interruption 
 order i have get to hear the question i do not want interruption this be a very important topic and i take it seriously i hope member also wish to start take it seriously 
 last year the prime minister start the year say he be mr steady then at his conference he be mr change now he have flip back to mr more of the same it do not matter how many relaunche and flip flop he do he will always be mr nobody here be the tragedy of his leadership he spend the whole time try to convince people not to believe their own eye pretend that debt be fall the economy be go gangbuster and the nhs be in great shape when he finally find something he be right about the rwanda gimmick he can not even take credit for it when be he go to stop pretend that up be down and black be white and admit that whether it be on the economy immigration or the nhs he have fail 
 well let we just go through his checklist he talk about the backlog decision make last year a high number than in any year in these past decade he talk about hotel the   be be close and there be more to come he talk about the number they be down by over a last year which be the time that have happen and then he talk about smash the gang if he do care about smash the gang why do he not own up to the fact that when it come to the nationality and borders act he block delay and vote against the power in that act that act have allow we to arrest hundred and hundred of people connect with that illegal trade who have be sentence to hundred of year in prison he oppose that because he choose the criminal gang over the british people every time hon member more 
 order i do not think we be have more 
 we can all see what have happen here just like he know that debt be not fall and taxis be go up he know the rwanda gimmick will not work but he can not be honest about it because he be too scared of his own mps do he not wish that he have stick to his gun rather than allow himself to be take hostage by his own party 
 we be debate this because we have take a stand and we be deliver the tough migration plan ever to end the legal challenge and actually get flight off the ground let we be clear he do not have a single practical idea about how to stop the boat because he do not actually care about control migration this be a person who describe all immigration law as racist he think limit on economic migration be economic vandalism the issue do not feature once in his mission and he do not mention it once in his conference speech the truth be he be pro free movement he be anti border control and he can never be trust to stop the boat 
 i think we should smash the gang and i spend year of my life do exactly that the prime minister ’s party have lose control of the border while he be tend to the tory party the country be leave without government a collapse in dentistry leave people literally pull out their own tooth flood defence completely expose and hundred of thousand of child still out of school his government appear blissfully uninterested in what be go on outside the wall of westminster do he realise how ludicrous it look when he spend his time boasting while britain   be break 
 i be glad that the leader of the opposition have bring up our school there be nothing more important than ensure that our child get a world class education that be why i be pleased that in spite of labour oppose every reform we have make our child be now the good reader in the western world but he be right that attendance be important that be why we be invest million of pound more to provide support for absent pupil we have launch a national campaign just this week we have double the number of attendance hub to support more than at the most vulnerable school i be surprised to hear he raise that topic because from long lockdown to vote against our minimum service law his priority have always be keep our child out of school it be always the same with he there be no plan it be just peddle thing to his union friend and another thing to the british people 
 new year new nonsense every week the prime minister stand here and tell the country that they should be thank he not question he if you point out that the view on the ground be very different to that from his private jet he say that you be talk the country down he just do not get it he do not get what a cost of living crisis feel like he do not know any school where kid no long turn up and he do not understand what it be like to wait for a hospital appointment do the country not deserve so much well than a prime minister who simply do not get britain 
 last week we have yet another half hour speech from the right hon and learn gentleman and what a surprise it do not contain a single new idea we have have year of he as labour leader and it be still all slogan and no plan just this weekend we be deliver on our plan to cut people ’s taxis he do not have a plan we have a plan to stop the boat he do not have a plan and we have a plan to get people off welfare and into work he do not have a single idea it be crystal clear stick with we to deliver the long term change that the country need do not go back to square with he hon member more 
 rise 
 more 
 let the hon member ask the question before shout for more 
 they just know that it be go to be fantastic mr speaker a happy new year to you anyway 
 it be almost spring when a young man ’s fancy turn to tax in scotland the nationalist have decide to increase taxis on hard work people in wales business be be clobber by a increase on rate do my right hon friend agree that there be only party in this chamber that can be trust to cut taxis for hard work people across the country and that be the conservative party 
 my hon friend be absolutely right just this weekend we be cut taxis for an average person in work by £ in wales where labour   be in charge the welsh government be raise they with business there now see double the rate of business rate this year it be the same in scotland under the snp it be the new high tax capital of the united kingdom because of the snp ’s tax hiking decision mr speaker while we have a plan to cut your taxis labour and the snp be go to raise they 
 i call the leader of the snp 
 the horizon system be introduce by tony blair the former labour party leader and of course now a knight of the garter the horizon system be defend by the current leader of the liberal democrats himself a knight bachelor the horizon system scandal be oversee by a former conservative prime minister who now hide in the house of lords as a baron the reality be that sub postmaster never stand a chance against the westminster establishment do they 
 as i have say this be actually of the great miscarriage of justice in our country ’s history all our thought be with those who have work so hard for their community and have see their life and reputation destroy as the hon gentleman point out this scandal have unfold over decade with multiple people clearly at fault since the high court case in this government have establish a statutory inquiry lead by sir wyn williams to uncover what go wrong establish an independent advisory board and establish different compensation scheme pay out £ to more than people with now almost third have receive final compensation but we must go far and fast which be why we have make new announcement today 
 i do not think that the prime minister quite get it this be not just a plague on all their house it be a plague on this house itself because injustice go far beyond the sub postmaster just ask the women against state pension inequality campaign the victim of the equitable life scandal the victim of the infected blood scandal or the family of the victim of grenfell or hillsborough the reality be that when the public come knock on the door of this chamber seek justice the government only ever answer when they have no option leave the leader of the opposition say last week that the public be right to be angry at westminster they be angry at westminster because they know that this place never really change do it prime minister 
 i be sad that the hon gentleman be try to politicise something that have happen over multiple decade with multiple people at fault the key thing be that after the high court case the government act to establish an independent inquiry and independent compensation scheme and as i say we have pay out compensation to people rather than try to politicise it we should be focus on the people affect and make sure that they get the answer justice and compensation that they deserve that be what we be deliver 
 i make a promise to a grandad in my constituency after he tell i that he have not dare to speak up when his grandson   come home say today we be learn if we be in the wrong body draft school guidance to support gender question child be publish just before christmas and be out to public consultation but give that we have all see many individual very publicly cancel lose their job reputation and relationship for simply support biological reality or championing fairness woman ’s safety or child protection how will honest and open engagement be manage through this very important and sensitive consultation process 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question she be right about the safety and wellbeing of child be paramount in our thought that be at the heart of the guidance that we have publish for consultation parent fundamentally must be involve in decision about their child ’s life and their involvement be a key part of the guidance she be right that there be a consultation process that be an opportunity for everyone to engage with the guidance i also agree that those championing safety or talk about the importance of biological sex should absolutely have the freedom to express those view she will see those view express in the guidance too 
 i thank the prime minister for the £ financial package that be now available to any restore northern ireland executive however we still need a discussion around the long term financial framework before the next spending review at present northern ireland ’s public service be in a huge crisis especially health with urgent public sector pay pressure that must be address last month the secretary of state say that the negotiation with the democratic unionist party over the windsor framework have conclude do the prime minister recognise the real danger of continue drift in northern ireland and the urgent need for northern ireland to have a government 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question our focus have always be on deliver for the people of northern ireland who rightly expect and deserve their locally elect decision maker to address the issue that matter to they we have hold talk with the dup and believe that significant progress have be make and that there be now a very good basis for the executive to be restore i thank he for his comment about the £ financial package with that there be a real chance to restore the executive resolve pay for public sector worker rapidly and get northern ireland and its public service move again

 i believe that not all jewish people be bad 
 palestinians be die whilst the zionists be laugh their life away 
 how do you send letter believe the western medium on how hamas be a terrorist group for all i know the only terrorist group be the zionists 
 those be not my word but word produce by pupil as young as in school in this country of whom sign off their letter say that they seek vengeance although that word be cross out pro palestinian activist be invite to another school in the north west of england to educate pupil on the history of palestine and display slide to those student that deny the existence of the state of israel we know that other school have allow absence for people to attend protest where of course there have be many example of antisemitism this be completely unacceptable will the prime minister look at what be go on in our school and hold an independent review of how we can do more in our curriculum to educate about the peril of antisemitism 
 i thank my hon friend for raise what be a deeply concern issue as i have say before there be no place for antisemitism or the glorification of terrorism in britain especially not in our classroom that be why we welcome the recent report from lord mann the government ’s independent adviser on antisemitism and in particular his recommendation on how school can tackle antisemitism we will continue to work together with lord mann on this vital issue i look forward to hear further suggestion from my hon friend too 
 when my good friend and constituent dr laura williams lose her husband suddenly at she be leave alone with child under the age of nothing could have prepare she for that grief and loss i have witness at hand what a remarkable job she have do to carry   on and stay afloat but that have be make much hard by the fact that bereavement support payment have be cut to just month an allowance that be primarily for child who lose a parent will the prime minister be kind enough to meet dr laura and i to hear at hand her experience of lose her husband and to see what can be do for those who like she be bereave with young child to support 
 i be very sorry to hear about the hon lady ’s constituent and her tragic loss i would be very happy to meet she at the early opportunity 
 i call dame jackie doyle price congratulation 
 thank you mr speaker 
 passenger have be cross the thames between tilbury and gravesend in my constituency since but the ferry service today be currently under threat because of the withdrawal of local authority funding with so many people use that ferry service to come to work in tilbury dock and give the upcoming expansion of the thames freeport will my right hon friend encourage the local authority to do all they can to ensure that we take full advantage of the opportunity through a new contract for the service and perhaps expand the service as a way of get more people to work in the new job that be be create 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that the tilbury to gravesend ferry service form an important part of the local transport service provide by local authority obviously those funding decision be for the relevant council but i encourage they to consider the importance of cross river transport in their local community which she highlight as part of their upcoming local transport plan 
 have the prime minister see the utterly damn new unicef report show that in the decade to child income poverty rise way fast in the uk than in any of the other country analyse scrap the benefit cap scrap the child limit and roll out the scottish child payment uk wide could reverse a decade of utter failure so why will he or indeed the so call official opposition not commit to those potentially transformative but affordable policy 
 i point out to the hon gentleman that since the number of people live in poverty have actually reduce by include hundred of thousand of child but the good way to make sure that child do not grow up in poverty which no want to see be to make sure that their parent be in work and then to make sure that they can keep as much of their hard earn money as possible that be why i urge the snp to think again about its plan to make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom for an average worker 
 my constituent know only too well the disaster of live under a labour regime just before christmas the labour council in bradford announce that it be bankrupt and then   spend the hour of the subsequent council meeting debate gaza and israel rather than the perilous financial situation it be in will the prime minister support my campaign and that of my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore   to get our constituency out of bradford council ’s control it be more urgent than ever will he also make sure that the government deliver a swimming pool in bingley which be something that be run down and then close down as part of the mismanagement of bradford council 
 my hon friend make an excellent point whether it be local council in his area in nottingham or indeed in birmingham we see a track record of labour mismanagement of finance in local area we all know as my hon friend point out that when that happen when labour be in power it be work people who pay the price that be why we have to stick to our plan 
 if he will launch a consultation on the potential merit of introduce social energy tariff for disabled people and low income household 
 we be provide extensive financial support worth over £ or £ per household on average between and to help everyone with their energy bill 
 last month marie curie tell i that terminally ill people who want to die at home have be force into hospital to die because they can not afford to heat their home sufficiently will the prime minister meet i marie curie and other organisation include energy company that be fully supportive of a social energy tariff and try to find a way forward 
 i will make sure that the hon lady get the meeting she need with the appropriate minister we be work very closely with ofgem to make sure that the most vulnerable household be protect especially this winter and crucially we be develop the priority service register that vulnerable household include those that be disabled or face particular need can sign up to for free to receive extra help with their energy supplier but as i say i will ensure that the relevant minister meet with marie curie and the hon lady 
 prioritise connect town in the north of england be a big part of network north so you will be pleased that i have a suggestion mr speaker direct train between preston and liverpool do not exist because passenger have to get off because there be buffer at ormskirk science technology and new multi modal battery train be go to allow that to be an accessible possibility and then get midge hall station in leyland reopen do my right hon friend agree that that be a great idea and we should crack on with it 
 network north will significantly improve connectivity across the north include through £ to connect up all the major town and city of the north and £ to improve connectivity between manchester and liverpool my hon friend be a fantastic champion for the region and i know that she and my hon friend   the member for southport damien moore   recently discuss midge hall station with the transport secretary who be look at option we be keen to use every penny that will be save from our decision on hs2 to reinvest back in the north in local community and my hon friend ’s idea sound fantastic 
 every parent ’s bad nightmare be watch their child starve and suffer yet in gaza living hell be be realise with innocent child eat weed and child have lose or more leg with many of they have to have they amputate without anaesthesia or pain relief i be sure the prime minister will agree that this be inhumane so will he please publicly call for unhindered access for food and medicine to reach gaza and tell israel to stop attack healthcare facility 
 as i have say previously we be deeply concerned about the devastating impact of the fighting in gaza on the civilian population and particularly of course child too many people have lose their life already and there be a desperate need for increase humanitarian support to gaza i have stress those point repeatedly to prime minister netanyahu and we be do our bit to get more aid in as i have say we have treble our aid commitment early this month we send in the maritime shipment of aid into egypt which will help and we be work with the united nations to deliver a new humanitarian land corridor from jordan into gaza i agree with the hon lady that we want to see more aid go into gaza to help the most vulnerable people and we should be proud in this house that the united kingdom be play a lead role in make that happen 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on compensation and outstanding matter relate to the post office horizon scandal 
 as the prime minister indicate a few minute ago i will inform the house about the further step the government be take to address the horizon scandal 
 the government be take measure to speed up the flow of compensation we have already set a target of issue initial offer for of group litigation order case within day of receive a complete application i announce in november that we would be introduce a £ up front offer for claim with overturned conviction which people could choose to take rather than go through the detailed assessment process this have already make a real difference before my announcement only of the relevant people have reach full and final settlement i can now report that with the help of the minimum payment we have finalise case this have obviously speed matter along for those who have take this up front offer it have also help those who have choose individual assessment because resource can be concentrate on those case 
 i can announce today that we be take similar measure in respect of the group litigation order scheme we will now make people in that scheme an up front offer of £ which will save they have to go through a full assessment however as with overturned conviction if they believe they be entitle to more they be welcome to continue with the full assessment not only will this allow the department to focus its resource on the large case but it will allow claimant lawyer to do the same the pace at which we can get claim into the scheme be the key constraint on how quickly we can settle they the up front offer be small for the glo scheme than for the overturned conviction because the claim tend to be small we estimate that perhaps a of glo claimant may want to consider this route i be sure the house will welcome this measure 
 when i make my statement on monday i hear member from all part of the house share my desire to ensure justice for postmaster who have be convict of offence as part of the scandal the whole house be unite on this and in the light of last week ’s excellent itv series i believe the whole nation be unite on it too we have all be move by the story of postmaster who have be unjustly convict and the terrible effect over the period of decade on their finance health and relationship indeed we have see whole life ruin by this brutal and arbitrary exercise of power 
 hundred of conviction remain extant some of those conviction will have rely on evidence from the discredit horizon system other will have be the result of appalling failure of the post office ’s investigation and prosecution function the evidence already emerge from sir wyn williams ’s inquiry have show not only   incompetence but malevolence in many of their action this evidence be not available to the court when they make their decision on individual case so far out of more than conviction have be overturn we know that postmaster have be reluctant to apply to have their conviction overturn many of they have decide that they have be through enough and can not face further engagement with authority many fear have their hope raise only for they to be dash yet again 
 the horizon compensation advisory board have recommend that we should overturn all the conviction of the postmaster who be prosecute in the horizon scandal i think its motivation for do so be absolutely right and we will work with it to speed up the process may i put on the record my thank to lord arbuthnot who be in the gallery today and   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   for their work on the campaign generally and on that advisory board 
 follow the recommendation would involve unprecedented action by parliament to overturn specific verdict of the court the government completely recognise the importance of an independent court system and judiciary so the recommendation raise important issue of constitutional principle this be therefore not a decision we can take lightly it also create the risk of a different sort of injustice 
 i be sure that a great many people be wrongly convict in the scandal but i can not tell the house that all of those prosecute be innocent or even that it be or or without retry every case we can not know the risk be that instead of unjust conviction we end up with unjust acquittal and we just would not know how many the only way we could tell would be to put all case through the court far drag out the distress for many innocent people 
 order this be a very important issue so i will allow the minister to continue but that mean the time of the opposition spokesperson will also increase as do sir david ’s it be too important an issue to curtail the minister but official ought to be aware that when they provide speech they be for minute however i want the minister finish his speech because the issue be far too important 
 i apologise mr speaker for the length of this response to the urgent question but the matter be as you say of vital importance 
 we have be face with a dilemma either accept the present problem of many people carry the unjustified slur of conviction or accept that an unknown number of people who have genuinely steal from their post office will be exonerate and perhaps even compensate i can therefore announce that we intend to bring forward legislation as soon as we can to overturn the conviction of all those convict in england or wales on the basis of post office evidence give during the horizon scandal the government will in the come day consider whether to include the small number of case that have already be consider by the appeal court and have conviction uphold 
 we recognise that this be an exceptional step but these be exceptional circumstance as the house know people with conviction that have be overturn be offer a choice between have their compensation individually assess or settle on an up front offer of   £ as far as possible we want to avoid guilty people walk away with hundred of thousand of pound of public money but we can not make the provision of compensation subject to a detailed examination of guilt we have conclude that to ask the court to do that again would be unfair to individual 
 we can not turn this into an administrative exercise all we ask be that as part of their claim for compensation postmaster sign a statement to the effect that they do not commit the crime of which they be accuse anyone subsequently find to have sign such a statement untruthfully will be put themselves at risk of prosecution for fraud i do not pretend to the house that that be a foolproof device but it be a proportionate that respect the ordeal that these people have already suffer it mean that an honest postmaster will have his or her conviction overturn and just by sign document can secure compensation 
 no should take our decision as a criticism of the judiciary the original decision be take in good faith in the understanding that prosecution be properly conduct and that assertion about the robustness of the horizon system be true but as i say early these be exceptional circumstance and we need to act quickly and decisively time be thing that we and the convict postmaster do not have our arrangement will apply to all those convict in england and wales base on post office investigation include those prosecute by other body who rely on the product of those investigation the fruit of a poison tree 
 we have plenty more work to do on the solution we need to prepare the legislation and i want to discuss our solution with the advisory board which i be meet later this afternoon some prosecution have be undertake in scotland and northern ireland where justice be devolve we be of course engage with the scottish and northern irish administrations in respect of wrongful conviction in their jurisdiction we will do those thing as quickly as we can and keep the house inform 
 the house will have hear that we be well aware of the imperfection of the solution i be sure that that will attract some critic but when they criticise i invite they to say what they would do otherwise would they leave many people suffer under the burden of unjust conviction for many year perhaps forever with no access to compensation or would they create some administrative process for decide innocence which would be more onerous for the victim i very much hope that the whole house will stand with the government to deliver rapid justice to convict postmaster who have be wait much much too long 
 i will extend the time it be so important to get all of that on the record i believe that the minister want to make a statement but be overrule at least we have certainly have that statement now 
 as the minister say early this week many of we across the chamber call for this appalling injustice to be solve in month not year it look as though the government have respond correctly to that call ensure swift justice but there be undoubtedly difficult constitutional and legal issue involve as he lay out in detail 
 some of the victim that i have speak to say they need an individual exoneration rather than a grand pardon because they be understandably concerned about be bracket with the very small number of people who will actually not be innocent will the minister undertake to continue look into this matter and address the quite proper concern of the legitimate victim 
 i would also welcome further elaboration on compensation fujitsu which have play a central role in the scandal be still at the heart of government it system will fujitsu will be require to meet some of the cost of the undoubtedly enormously expensive compensation that we be pay out finally will the government accelerate the investigation to convict those who be really guilty of cause the scandal by pervert the course of justice 
 i thank my right hon friend for the urgent question and for his collaboration with we on these matter we have look carefully at the issue of individual exoneration and do not see any way possible to do that without an exhaustive and time consume administrative process which would add further burden to those that people have already suffer 
 the other issue be get people to come forward again which have be of the major problem in get people to appeal their conviction we see the solution that we have adopt as very much the less of evil nevertheless we be keen to discuss mitigation and safeguard with other member of the house i set out early on the requirement to sign a statement of innocence and i be keen to work with he to look at other mechanism that we can use to ensure that those people who get their conviction overturn and access compensation be actually innocent of the charge 
 my right hon friend make the important point about fujitsu which have be raise many time as he know part of what the government do be to put in place a statutory inquiry chair by sir wyn williams it be due to complete by the end of the year and hopefully it will report soon after at that point in time we will be able to assess more clearly who be actually responsible many people may have already form a view on that but we think it right that we follow a process to identify individual or organisation who be responsible for the scandal of course we would expect those organisation to financially contribute there be financial and legal measure that we can take 
 as regard individual it may be that there be sufficient evidence for the authority to take forward individual prosecution and i think many in the house would welcome that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question i congratulate   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   on secure it this issue have rightly leave the public outrage at the scale and shocking detail of this injustice as i say on monday labour believe the horizon scandal to be of the great miscarriage of justice in british history where people lose their livelihood liberty and their life then when try to find justice they be delay at every turn 
 it be unconscionable that despite the landmark legal ruling several year on people have still not be able to access the compensation that they be entitle to we be all united in this house in want the sub postmaster to be exonerate in full it be important to say exoneration and not a pardon because a pardon imply guilt that be forgive and for they to receive compensation with urgency we recognise that that be not straightforward and the result may be imperfect but this be an unprecedented scandal that require an unprecedented response the alternative of not act be even less desirable labour stand ready to work with the government to deliver a solution that achieve that long await justice and compensation at pace 
 may i thank the minister for the ongoing conversation we have be have on this matter can he guarantee that compensation payment will immediately follow any exoneration under the term of the compensation scheme as they stand today could he indicate a timescale for that i know he appreciate that victim can not continue to wait year for payment 
 give what the minister say about the implication of a blanket exoneration we will need to consider what safeguard might be necessary to ensure that as well as possible public money do not flow into the pocket of those who be not entitle to it he mention that people may be ask to sign a statement will that be draw up consistently with the work of the advisory board 
 crucially we discuss on monday the case that have now be identify from the pre horizon pilot scheme which be identical to those come out of horizon will those case be cover by any proposal that the government bring forward any plan that do not cover all conviction will rightly not command the full support of the house 
 as the sub postmaster they must surely get the credit for these extraordinary measure have repeatedly say what matter now be get compensation to people swiftly the whole house be unite in its determination to deliver the justice truth and compensation that have be deny and delay time and time again 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his response to my remark i appreciate his offer to work with we and to stand with we to deliver compensation and the overturning of conviction the step will be legislation again we be happy to work with he on that that may take some week to deliver but the soon the well the introduction and passing of that legislation will be a matter for both houses but our intention be to get on with that very quickly 
 from there it should be a simple process a statement need to be sign as the hon gentleman and i both refer to we will work with the advisory board to ensure that the statement be appropriate follow the signing of that statement if people choose the detailed assessment route that will be more complex because it will look at not just financial loss but personal impact such as on health or on other livelihood and consequential loss if people choose the fix sum award route of £ that process can be very quick which be of the reason why we have manage to complete full and final settlement already many use the fix sum route 
 the hon gentleman raise the issue of people use the pilot version of horizon of which we be cognisant every postmaster around the country have be write to and should be aware that the compensation scheme be available we believe that these scheme cover that pilot period for horizon i be very happy to work with he and   the right hon member for north durham mr jones   to ensure that the people they have identify have already be contact the good news be that follow the excellent itv dramatisation we have see a good number of new case come to light we be keen for people to come forward whether they have suffer conviction or financial detriment through shortfall we be keen to ensure that those people get access to compensation as quickly as possible 
 i thank the minister and the lord chancellor for their work it have be long in the making than the drama series but they meet their promise over day by come up with the stage of the solution too many victim want nothing to do with the british justice system the post office or government they have have enough do my hon friend agree that there be no perfect solution the good we can aim for be that be fast and provide life change money to restore these people ’s life as well we can 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for the sterling work he do as my predecessor in this job many people recognise the incredible work he do follow the outcome of the court case with the compensation scheme that he instigate he be right that there be no perfect solution but we have work across government to try to find the well possible if we want a fast solution that as he say provide life change compensation to people who have be deprive of that in recent year we believe that this be the good 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   for secure this very important urgent question i be sorry that it be not a statement because then i would have have prior sight of what the minister be go to say 
 when we stand here on tuesday i ask how long some time would be and i be glad that thing be progress quickly although with a note of caution i totally understand the hesitation to introduce any kind of blanket bill or whatever we need to move thing forward and keep up the momentum from the itv series in the press here and everywhere 
 we also still need to listen to the victim only this morning some of the postmaster say that we should all stop refer to compensation but refer instead to financial redress this be not compensation but money due to they and we need to get it to they as quickly as possible   the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully   say that some people do not want to go anywhere near justice or the post office we must encourage people to come forward i be meet constituent who be involve who have not officially approach i yet and i be sure that many other across the house will be in exactly the same position 
 scottish law be different as the minister be well aware the cabinet secretary for justice make a statement yesterday and say that the scottish government be look at fujitsu contract which be really important i can not speak for the scottish government but i know there will be no hesitation in move thing forward as chair of the all party parliamentary group on post office i will write to the crown office and procurator fiscal service in scotland 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and once again for her work in the all party parliamentary group for post office i be sorry that i be not able to share a statement with she and i appreciate she welcome what we have do today 
 i be very happy to term this redress it be only about put people back where they would have be and try to make good what have happen to they i understand what she say about compensation but this be there to compensate people financially for loss and impact on their life 
 i could not agree more that as well as deliver compensation more quickly and fairly the no thing we would like to happen be for more people to come forward a simplified process that do not require postmaster themselves to file an appeal will mean that this be do more quickly the route to compensation have be simplify and we very much hope that people will come forward that seem to be our experience right now we will continue to engage with the devolved administration to ensure that they have everything they need as they may want to adopt similar measure 
 i welcome this legislation and i thank the minister for the amount of work he have do at such great speed we be still at a midway point in the journey there be still criminal prosecution to come question that have never be answer be just how much money be take unlawfully from thousand of innocent man and woman the post office take that money and we have never know that figure even the most basic accountant know that it will run into hundred of million of pound could the minister force the post office to publish the grand scale of the money it steal from people 
 i thank my hon friend for contribute to these important debate in the house once again he bring hand experience as the only postmaster serve in the house he be quite right to say that money be take and someone must have notice it would think that the finance department or auditor would have notice it as it would have appear in some kind of suspense account and be presumably transfer out at some point i will endeavour to find out the number as i do not have it we do know that prior to horizon be instal in the post office network there be around prosecution a year that suddenly jump to about a year we know that there be significant number of prosecution and the fact that there be around postmaster in the various compensation scheme illustrate the scale of the problem i will endeavour to find out a number for he 
 i thank   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   for secure this uq i know the minister want   to make a statement but be overrule by no so that the prime minister get the glory of make the announcement a serious point be that have we not get this uq there would have be no debate today which be a disgrace 
 the minister know that the advisory board have be tie in a gordian knot for quite a few month which be why we write our letter to the justice secretary before christmas he be right that this will be messy whichever way we do it but it need to be do because people be still out there with conviction that need overturning i welcome the advisory board have discussion later this afternoon and in the next few week on how thing should take place but i urge the minister i know he will to engage with all political party in this house if we can get all party support for the proposal that will make it a lot strong 
 the point raise by my hon friend   the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds   about the pre horizon scheme be important i welcome the change to the compensation as they will speed thing up for some victim but in the case of those who have die whose conviction be overturn will their estate be able to access compensation 
 once again i thank the right hon gentleman for all his work on this campaign over many year and for his work on the advisory board which have be an essential part of seek a resolution i will of course continue to work cross party as i have do all the way through on this matter from the back benches and now from the front bench i appreciate the support and engagement we have have from all political party in this area both front benchers and back benchers 
 yes we be cognisant of the pre horizon pilot scheme and we will keep work to make sure the people involve be include in compensation yes if people have sadly pass away over have pass away wait for compensation and justice the compensation will go to their estate and therefore to their family that be an assurance i can give he 
 the minister have announce that approximately of the individual involve in the group litigation will benefit from the up front payment of £ what other support will there be for those in that group litigation who suffer loss way in excess of that £ how will the government assess not just the financial loss but the reputational damage they suffer the health impact and the family breakdown that many endure how will it work in practice as the minister outline time be press this be very difficult and there be no size fit all answer but individual need recompense soon rather than later and to feel that justice for this institutional state failure will actually act in their favour 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and for the number of time she have raise this particular issue and set out her thought which have prove very useful we think that of people from the group litigation order scheme have choose the £ fix sum award route clearly that be an estimate we at least have some evidence from the other scheme on how effective that be 
 if people choose not to go down that route and if they believe their loss be in excess of that they can go down the full assessment route we be try to make that as rapid as possible it be a process of alternative dispute resolution potentially thing can happen very quickly but if that can not be agree then it go to an independent panel for assessment there be independence at every part of the process people go down that route can get interim payment if they be need so that they do not suffer financial hardship we be keen to make sure not only that people get a fair amount but that it be also see to be fair independence be an essential part of that process 
 i thank   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   for secure the urgent question and i thank the minister for the swiftness with which he have act and particularly for his recognition of the need to talk to the devolved administrations and of the fact that the situation in scotland be slightly different as the post office be not able to prosecute there and that be do through the official crown service with that in mind and give the need he express to encourage people to come forward in scotland it be very much more difficult to gauge how many people be affect it be not just enough for we to say please come forward we need a proactive campaign to encourage people to come forward and reassure they that they will not face the same sort of delay that the victim of hillsborough and the infected blood scandal have face but that this will be act on swiftly 
 i thank the hon lady for her remark although they be prosecute under different authority in scotland and northern ireland the case be generally prepare by the post office itself so i do not think we have any great confidence about the status of those conviction than we have in those in the rest of the uk we be therefore very keen to engage with the scottish administration on what we be do hopefully there will be a consistent scheme across the uk 
 i agree entirely with the hon lady that we need to be proactive in our message to people about come forward and in our message from the house that we be work together and that this process be now much more streamlined it will not even necessarily require sub postmaster to make an application for their conviction to be overturn that will happen much more quickly and any access route we have now for compensation will be make swifter and more rapid i think those thing alone will mean more people come forward as i say we have see a good number of new people come forward hudgell of the solicitor involve in claim for some of the victim have have i think new people contact they on the basis of the tv programme and possibly because of the new action we be take to make sure compensation be more smoothly and easily available 
 the minister and indeed all of we in this house will recognise the desire to get the swift possible redress for the victim of this appalling injustice but do he   also accept that legislate to overturn conviction that be impose by our independent court be constitutionally quite exceptional therefore in justify that will he set out in full what consideration be give to the practicality of go down the normal route of refer those conviction to the court of appeal before the legislative route be decide upon what discussion be there with the senior judiciary about its practicality give the novel and constitutional nature of the legislation will he seriously consider commit to the committee stage of any bill be take on the floor of the house and because it be novel and constitutional will he consider that it be appropriate for a draft bill to be give swift pre legislative scrutiny 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his willingness to work with we he and i have discuss the matter in the past few day and i appreciate his expertise and advice yes absolutely this be a very significant step and not that we would take lightly we fully respect the independence of the court we set out very clearly the reason why this be different that be important we be set a precedent but it be clear why we be do so the involvement of private prosecution be very relevant and that also relate to work that he have do on the justice committee my right hon friend the secretary of state for justice have engage with the people he refer to in the judiciary to ensure that they understand what we be do and why we be do it those conversation be constructive rather than resist but i be very happy to take up my hon friend ’s offer to continue that engagement and to discuss the draft bill with he 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 i thank   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   for secure the urgent question i be very much look forward to cross examine the minister when he come before the business and trade committee next tuesday when we will be hear evidence from mr bates and his colleague we will also be put question to fujitsu can i push the minister on the point i make on monday night year after the landmark case of conviction have not be overturn only of the case have result in a full and final settlement and we have hear evidence from victim this week already that even when settlement have be make the cash have not yet be hand over can i ask the minister again what his target be what be his goal approximate or otherwise when will those wrongfully prosecute have their full and final settlement deliver in cash 
 i be very much look forward to appear before the right hon gentleman ’s select committee and hear some challenging question which i would welcome to be clear of all those affect by the scandal have receive full and final compensation he talk about the small cohort who have come forward in relation to conviction only have have conviction overturn in order to try to expedite the payment of compensation to those people we have introduce the fix sum award route which be prove very successful i be not aware of his point   about people not actually receive the cash but i be very happy to engage with he on that because there be every intention that once a decision have be take to go down the fix sum award route the sum be pay pretty much instantly i be very happy to find out what exactly be happen in those case where people have go down a full assessment route that be understandably more complex as various consideration about loss financial forensic information health and reputational loss a key facet in most of these case will be take into account
