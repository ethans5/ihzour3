 this government be focus on enhance and spread opportunity and grow our economy we will ensure that a high quality range of post-16 qualification be available to form through the independent curriculum and assessment review which be well under way and through the continued roll out of t level 
 in spelthorne we have secondary school only of which provide a level the rest be middle school take pupil only up to gcse level there have be plan in the past to increase form provision in spelthorne but they have be in abeyance for year will the minister please agree to meet i so that we can work out what be cause this blockage and unlock the opportunity to which she have just refer 
 obviously many thing need attention because of the last government and many thing be not accomplish but i be sure that my noble friend baroness smith of malvern will be willing to meet the hon member to discuss his concern 
 in my constituency there be no a level provision some student have tell i that they have to travel for hour just to study and other consider this a barrier to continue at school at all will my hon friend work with i to bring a level back to knowsley 
 i thank my hon friend for her thoughtful question the government be commit to ensure that young people have access to appropriate education and career opportunity but the focus must be on deliver provision that offer they the well learning experience and opportunity possible in knowsley a level provision have not be deem viable owe to a lack of demand but student there have access to high quality post-16 academic provision in surround borough 
 i call the shadow minister 
 staff in non academise form college be not be offer the same pay increase as staff in academise college it be understand that a sum of money be available for post-16 education but college have be leave completely unclear about whether that sum will be enough to offset the national insurance increase or whether they will find as university have that it be entirely eat up by that increase will the minister agree to publish the cost of the national insurance increase to form college and if she will not publish it why on earth not 
 i find it shock that the shadow minister have take no responsibility for the many circumstance in which we have find ourselves have to make decision that be in the good interest of student and college we be conduct various review to try to ensure that we put right the mess that we inherit 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of introduce free primary school breakfast club on child 
 breakfast club break down barrier to opportunity so that child be ready to learn they be prove to boost attendance attainment wellbeing and behaviour and they also provide essential childcare option for parent in only a few day hundred of school have apply to become early adopter because they know that these club can improve child ’s life chance and crucially academic standard 
 as a former youth worker and a former school governor i know that this initiative will make a huge difference and i have write to all the school in my constituency encourage they to apply will the secretary of state please outline the next step 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the work that he be undertake in make his local school aware of the opportunity that breakfast club present the early adopter scheme will enable up to participate school to start provide they from april onwards we have triple investment in breakfast club follow the budget school have until   december   to apply for the scheme and i would encourage many more to do so 
 thousand of school be already participate in the national school breakfast club programme include many special school and secondary school but the club actually have a big effect on attendance the secretary of state have talk a great deal about breakfast club in primary school but what be the future for the exist club in those special and secondary school 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for the interest that i know from his former role he take in this issue we be build on the exist programme expand investment and opportunity but i agree with he that we need to ensure that breakfast club be available to all child include   those with special educational need and disability to ensure that the roll out be a success some of the early adopter will be in special and alternative provision school 
 i welcome the decision to introduce breakfast club which will have an amazing impact on pupil in my constituency and everywhere else will the secretary of state tell we a little about the logistic of roll out the programme throughout the country and how quickly that can be do 
 as i say school have until   december   to apply to take part in the early adopter scheme that be because we want to ensure that we establish the scheme and understand the benefit and challenge before we roll it out across the country we be determined to get this right and we will build on the early adopter to deliver universal free breakfast club in every primary school in england 
 while the child ’s wellbee bill propose statutory breakfast programme research from the food foundation show that such club be more likely to benefit wealthy family because of the convenience that they offer work parent by contrast offer child free school lunch be know to help iron out inequality some child in poverty be ineligible for free school meal and more than eligible child be not register do the secretary of state agree that expand school lunch and implement auto enrolment for free school meal for all child would be an effective and equitable approach to tackle food insecurity and support our child ’s health and academic performance 
 the hon lady be right to identify the importance of ensure that all our child have healthy balanced and nutritious diet include at school however she will know that the situation that this government inherit from the previous government mean that we have have to take some very tough decision we will set out more in due course as we set out legislation that we promise in the king ’s speech i slightly take issue with some of the evidence she point to because the evidence on breakfast club demonstrate wide benefit for all child in attainment wellbeing and overall performance 
 i call the shadow minister 
 because of the increase in national insurance the early years alliance be warn of a increase in fee for early year parent which affect nursery and thing like pay for breakfast club it say that the budget will be a recipe for total disaster with up to in early year provider close unless drastic action be take as a step towards avert that disaster will the secretary of state now agree to publish the department ’s estimate of how much the national insurance increase will cost early year provider if she will not publish it why not do the house not deserve to have this information 
 i take the concern of early year provider very seriously indeed and we will set out in due course the funding rate and the approach that we be take the hon gentleman and the conservative   party be very keen to complain about and criticise the measure that we set out in the budget yet the leader of the opposition herself say that she would refuse to reverse they they want all the benefit the teacher the breakfast club and rise standard but they be not prepared to take the tough decision that be necessary as a former treasury minister the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott should know well because she see the scale of the fiscal inheritance that this government inherit from her party

 i begin by thank all the teacher support staff and senior leader in my constituency of southgate and wood green and across the country for their hard work ensure that our child receive the high quality education they deserve teacher pay their workload and the environment in which they work have be highlight as reason why they leave the profession can my right hon friend tell the house what step she be take to address the reason for teacher quit the profession 
 i join my hon friend in praise the amazing teacher and support staff in his constituency and across our country for the vital work that they do i want to ensure not only that we keep teacher in the profession but that they thrive in it which be why i be pleased to agree to the recommendation of a pay award but we know that there be much more to do to keep experienced dedicated staff in the profession i know from speak to many of they that many of the challenge they face go way beyond the school gate that be why i be proud to lead the work on child poverty together with the work and pensions secretary to address some of the driver of workload and pressure that many of our school staff be face 
 some woman in their 30 leave teaching in this be the single big age group leave teaching in bath and across the country will the government improve maternity pay for teacher and teaching assistant 
 the hon lady be right to identify that challenge and i have use that statistic many time myself i be really concerned about the big number of experienced woman particularly those in their 30 who leave teaching because they find it too difficult to combine work with family life that be why as part of what we have set out to the school teachers review body process we have ask it to look specifically at some of those challenge as part of our wide work across government to make work pay we be ensure well right at work and that maternity protection be roll out for worker across our country 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests which show that i be in the year of be a proud primary school governor the secretary of state will know that school be lead by teacher but also that many volunteer go towards make our school the brilliant place of learn that they be too many of the school in my constituency have vacancy for governor will the secretary of state tell we what she be do to increase the recruitment and retention of school governor 
 i congratulate the hon lady on the important work that she do as a school governor they be the unsung hero across our community in term of the support they provide to our school i recognise the increase challenge that she set out around how we can ensure that people come forward to take on those important role that be why we have be work with the body represent governor to ensure that we attract more people into those important role to drive forward standard in our school

 what step she be take to increase the availability of breakfast club in primary school 
 school with primary age pupil can now apply to become early adopter of the universal free breakfast club programme start from april up to participate school will be fund to provide access to a free universal breakfast club last at least minute that include food

 i have contact all the primary school in my constituency to encourage they to become early adopter child poverty in my constituency stand at and food bank use have rise by over the last year do my hon friend agree that breakfast club will be part of the solution by help to lift child out of poverty give they food in their belly to start the school day and encourage their parent back into part time employment 
 parent and carer up and down the country be still struggle with the cost of living as part of our mission to bring down barrier to opportunity breakfast club give parent and carer the confidence that their child can access a breakfast should they need and we be support family to work with the cost of childcare it be a pity that the conservatives can not say whether they back our plan to deliver well life chance for all child in all part of the country 
 nursery and the small business that provide before and after school club be be whack by national insurance increase and there be little clarity from the government about how these breakfast club will work which have the potential to undermine another part of their business model what representation have the education secretary make to the chancellor to deal with the massive hole that she have blow in her plan 
 we take no lecture from the conservative party on how it fail child over the last year i have hear provider concern about early year funding and i recognise the importance of local authority and provider plan ahead for the pivotal expansion year we will be update the house very soon on that issue 
 recently i meet my constituent farhan adam a winner of headmaster of the year who lament the fact that he spend more   time address issue such as food insecurity than do what he love which be teach this be not surprising as accord to the food foundation approximately of household with child be experience food insecurity do the secretary of state agree that in addition to breakfast club lift the child cap would help to alleviate this problem 
 breakfast club offer a huge amount include food and club provision i encourage the hon member to consider that for roll out in his constituency more broadly he will be aware of the ministerial taskforce focus on child poverty which will report in the new year

 a recent national audit office report make it clear that without reform the sen system be financially unsustainable the minister will know that since local authority such as buckinghamshire council have be able to exclude their dedicated school grant deficit from their main revenue budget that statutory override mean that local authority do not breach their duty to set a balanced budget but it be due to end in march and there be currently no identify solution can the minister share more on what urgent conversation she be have with colleague to ensure that local authority get the certainty they need 
 the ministry of housing communities and local government regulation which ringfence dedicated support grant deficit from council wide financial position be amend the statutory override go up to march when it expire and we be currently consider how good to continue support for local authority with deficit fundamentally this be about reform the system to ensure that more child can be educate within a mainstream setting and that we have special school place available for those with the most complex need 
 perranporth academy in my constituency plan to provide significant sen provision but it be of school currently under a value for money review as of last week the head of perranporth primary school have not be consult on this will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the plight of perranporth academy 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s concern and we recognise the unprecedented pressure that local authority be under high need funding which we recently increase will benefit both mainstream school and special school because we will ensure the funding reach child who need it however i recognise the issue and concern that he raise and will be happy to arrange a meeting to discuss this far 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 last week ’s announcement of capital funding to ensure that mainstream school be more inclusive for child with special need be of course welcome but the minister will know that for many child with additional need even the most inclusive mainstream school simply be not appropriate with in special school at or over capacity can she provide a timeline for when the plan special free school will be deliver will she commit to look favourably on local authority application for such school 
 i thank the hon lady for her recognition of the additional funding we expect the funding to create thousand of new place particularly in mainstream school but also in special school and other specialist setting we will confirm the allocation for individual local authority in the spring as they know good how to invest in their local area we be keep the free school programme under review and will provide that confirmation in due course 
 what step she be take to improve support for kinship carer 
 support kinship placement be critical to deliver our opportunity mission to ensure that child grow up in safe and love home we have recently announce a £ package to trial a kinship allowance the trial will test whether an allowance can support more child to settle with family and friend

 this government acknowledge and appreciate the crucial role that kinship carer play i be pleased that the virtual school head scheme have be expand to support kinship child i encourage kinship carer and school to work together to support kinship child and those with identify need the department will continue to review the matter to ensure that child get the right support 
 i welcome the minister ’s response about kinship carer what progress have be make on offer kinship carer respite provision so that they can be give short term break to ease the pressure face kinship family 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his very good question it be important that kinship carer as well as the child they be look after have the support they need through the process of family group decision making family will come together to have conversation about how good to support child in kinship care respite and other related matter will be discuss to ensure that the right provision be in place this government be commit to get it right for child especially where the previous government fail 
 what step she be take to reform skill training 
 what step she be take to reform skill training 
 what step she be take to reform skill training 
 what step she be take to reform skill training 
 the previous government leave behind a skill system that be fragment and fail fall number of apprenticeship for young people adult unable to find the training course they need business confuse and no plan to equip people with the skill for the economy and opportunity of tomorrow we be turn the page by establish skills england to unify that fragmented landscape and bring forward a plan for post-16 education and skill which will deliver the education and training pathway that our economy employer and learner need 
 some people age and over benefit from skill education in england every year i pay tribute to all the hard work professional employ in further education include at shipley college in my constituency however business in saltaire tell i that they struggle to recruit people with the digital and tech skill that they need locally i welcome step take by the government to address skill shortage vacancy will the secretary of state assure i that the benefit of skills england will be feel by business in shipley 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to the staff at shipley college she be right that it be time that we as a country take skill much more seriously we be leave with skill shortage in many key area include those she identify we will be give business the flexibility they have be ask for to unlock growth and drive opportunity through the reform growth and skill levy 
 when i speak to small business in my constituency of hexham they regularly decry an inability to recruit young people from the area who want to remain in the area where they grow up will the secretary of state assure i that we will be work with small and medium sized business to ensure that young people can remain where they grow up should they wish to do so which sadly be very hard under the previous government 
 follow on from small business saturday we all recognise that small employer be the backbone of our economy my hon friend be right that it should not be the case that young people in place such as hexham should have to get out in order to get on we be create skills england to fill the skill gap we see across our country skills england will also work with our regional mayor to ensure that we address some of the regional inequality we see as well as some of the opportunity area because we know that particular part of the country have a real ability to drive forward growth job and opportunity 
 south staffordshire college ’s creative art faculty be base at lichfield college in my constituency in january it will open a new state of the art recording studio and rehearsal space that will allow student to develop skill in both music performance and music production ensure that they be well prepared for career in the creative art for their entire future do the secretary of state agree that such investment be essential for the uk to maintain its role as a global leader in the creative art and that the government should support they wherever they can 
 absolutely that be why we set out in the budget an additional £ of capital investment for our college i be sure that the opportunity that my hon friend set out be just the kind that we need to see across our country the creative industry have a crucial role to play in drive growth in community right across our country and through our curriculum and assessment review we will ensure that all young people have the chance to study a wide range of subject 
 this morning i have the pleasure of visit south essex college in my constituency which offer a significant variety of post-16 skill base course from theatre and music production through to digital skill robotic and hospitality the college be keen to raise the aspiration of local young people match their ambition with the need of employer in the region what role do the secretary of state see the further education sector playing in deliver the government ’s skill agenda 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that our further education college have a crucial role to play in provide opportunity for our young people and for adult returner to education college have a strong impact on regional economic growth we think that they have a big role to play still which be why they will be a central part of what we take forward through skills england 
 at the general election the government say that they would specifically target technical training in area such as construction engineering and digital in order to   take pressure off immigration into key role so why be they fail to act on the pay gap between further education teaching post and those in school 
 i agree that there be a very big pay gap for further education i gently say to the right hon gentleman that it take place over the last year during which his party be in power i absolutely accept the challenge that more be require because our further education college have a crucial role to play but that be the situation we inherit from the conservative party 
 the secretary of state will be aware that all analysis of the supply of green skill such as the recent global climate talent stocktake show a massive undersupply of such skill demand be grow at double the rate of supply what be the government ’s plan to address that important shortfall and will the secretary of state or her official meet i to discuss how such plan might include unblock the approval of new qualification for example the currently block natural history gcse 
 i agree that there be lot of job opportunity in the year to come in clean technology green job and much more besides that be why we have start work very quickly to begin the process of legislate to establish skills england which already exist in shadow form it have already undertake an audit of what more be require i know that there be lot of fantastic new job out there connect to construction and engineering that align very much with our drive towards net i be more than happy to ensure that the hon lady get a meeting on the topic 
 there have never be great urgency for we to equip our young people with the skill they need to enter a career in farming yet only half of those who take level agricultural apprenticeship in cumbria last year complete they and no level apprenticeship be available will the secretary of state look at this worrying situation pay personal attention to it and provide the funding necessary for we to have agricultural apprenticeship in britain ’s lead agricultural county 
 i be more than happy to look personally at the issue that the hon gentleman set out to ensure that we do more in this area he will be aware that we have a review under way of level qualification but we know that as a country we need to do much more on level and qualification as well if he will share further information with i i will happily look into the matter 
 lytchett minster school in my constituency be proud of its record in deliver level btecs in fact its form would not survive without btecs what assurance can the secretary of state give i about the continuation of these really important qualification which suit less academically able child 
 we be make good progress on our post-16 qualification reform review which will report by the end of the year so the hon lady do not have long to wait to hear the outcome of that review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 before the election labour promise to let business spend of their apprenticeship levy money on non apprenticeship but now minister say the commitment be under review minister be take away the flexibility of business to spend their own money on level apprenticeship a big change to the principle of the levy will the secretary of state confirm when the review of her own policy will conclude and will she rule out do to level apprenticeship what she be do to level apprenticeship 
 we remain committed to reform the fail apprenticeship levy and turn it into a growth and skill levy with up to flexibility for employer drive new opportunity in growth area across our country alongside ensure that we deliver many more apprenticeship start for our young people we inherit a situation where apprenticeship start be fall at a time when we urgently need to invest in the skill of the next generation we will work with business through skills england to drive forward what be require for adult learner as well as young people 
 what step she be take to support creative education in school 
 all child deserve a rich and broad education so that they do not miss out on subject such as music art and drama as part of our opportunity mission we have launch an independent expert lead curriculum and assessment review and we be commit to ensure that young people be support to study creative subject 
 over the past year the amount of creative education particularly at primary level have be reduce and reduce so i welcome what the minister say there be evidence that do creative thing and learn creative subject improve our wellbee mental health and academic learning would the minister support my campaign to bring musical instrument teaching to every primary school in the country not just the more well off one 
 my hon friend speak with great wisdom we have confirm £ of funding for a national network of music hub to give child and young people the opportunity to learn to sing or play an instrument to create music and to progress their musical interest and talent we have also launch the music opportunity pilot with £ of funding over year to support student with special educational need and disability and those with less mean to access the opportunity to do so 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state have make it clear that she would like more time spend on creative subject but she must ensure that do not come at the expense of an academic education last week ’s international education stat find that english   child be the good at math in the western world that be brilliant news and testament to the hard work of teacher and pupil it be also down to a world class curriculum put in place by the previous government will she finally celebrate those result and instruct her curriculum review that it must not dilute academic standard and put that progress at risk 
 from their shameless sense of pride we would never know that the conservative government leave england ’s school standard get bad conservative members may be happy that half of disadvantaged pupil in state school do not meet the requirement in reading writing or math at the end of primary school but we do not think their record be anything to be proud of standard be the watchword for this labour government and not just for some of our child but for all of they 
 if she will take step to educate child about the harm of commercial sexual exploitation 
 secondary school be require to teach about sexual exploitation and this labour government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade education have a key role to play in address that 
 i agree entirely as we near the end of the day of activism it be really important that we continue to talk about commercial sexual exploitation which be the exchange of money accommodation service or good for sex act it have an impact on all young people ’s life include in my constituency of monmouthshire particularly through exposure to violent online pornography as well as via the damaging message convey by the fact that there be legal impunity for run pimp website do the minister agree that school should be support in address these issue through a whole school approach to combat sexism and sexual harassment as advocate by organisation such as uk feminista 
 of course i agree with my hon friend that take a whole school approach to tackle sexual abuse and violence be incredibly important the statutory guidance be very clear that relationship and sexual health education should be deliver through a whole school approach through our safe street and opportunity mission the government be consider how good to support school in tackle this issue 
 what progress her department have make on its review of applied general qualification 
 we be make good progress with the review of qualification reform which have focus on the level qualification that be schedule to have their funding remove on   july we be work   quickly to provide certainty to the sector and will publish the outcome of the review before the end of the year 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my declare interest i be the governor of a form college i thank the minister for that answer but she will know that the certainty that she hop to give be simply not there college have have to put off printing prospectus they have have open evening and assembly for school at which they have not be able to confirm what they will teach there be staff allocation issue and they have even be ask to make projection about t level funding for t level that they be not sure they will have the pupil number for because they do not know which equivalent btecs will be stand down they will enter not know what they can teach do she think that be acceptable what support will there be for college that will have to turn thing around very quickly whatever the outcome of the review 
 i thank my hon friend for really push i on this issue and for explain the situation so well i acknowledge to he and the sector the uncertainty and difficulty in this area follow the election we move quickly to pause the defunding that be schedule for   july i fully appreciate that college need time to plan their provision and that student need time to plan what course they will take we be work as quickly as possible to conclude the review and we will publish the outcome before the end of the year 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to reduce level of child poverty 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to reduce level of child poverty 
 tackle child poverty be at the heart of our opportunity mission after a decade of conservative government far too many child be grow up in poverty it be a scar on our society a blight on young life and the centrepiece of the conservatives shameful legacy the secretary of state for work and pensions and i be get on with the job of chair the child poverty taskforce which have start the urgent work need ahead of the publication of our child poverty strategy in spring 
 during the summer i visit the holiday activity and food programme run by stockton borough council which provide a healthy meal for low income family in my constituency can my right hon friend provide some assurance that funding for that programme will continue into next year 
 i join my hon friend by extend my thank to the staff at stockton borough council for their hard work on the holiday activity and food programme over the past year we be work through our budget settlement to agree measure to support family during the holiday and in due course we will   set out what further step we can take he will know as i do that while talent be spread across our country opportunity be not his constituency be full of child whom the conservatives let down this labour government will break down barrier 
 we know that child grow up in poverty on average do less well in education with many child also have to miss out on other enriching school activity such as day out because they simply can not afford they do the secretary of state agree that every child include the almost child live in poverty in my sherwood forest constituency should have the same opportunity to thrive at school and that tackle child poverty be essential in ensure that every child can succeed 
 i agree it be absolutely right that child in my hon friend ’s constituency deserve every chance to achieve and thrive and that be the ultimate goal of our child poverty taskforce as the prime minister set out just last week through our plan for change we want to give every child the good start in life and that be just not possible if million of child across our country be grow up in poverty 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 the government ’s ambition be that all child with special educational need receive the right support to succeed where possible in mainstream school we will strengthen accountability and improve inclusivity through ofsted and we will support professional to develop their send expertise high need funding will increase by almost £ in the next spending year 
 child with special educational need and disability in shropshire be relatively poorly fund compare with those in the rest of the country top up funding for those with the high level of need be just £ mean that the school that support they can not even afford a full time teaching assistant to help they progress can the minister describe what she be do to ensure that funding be fairly distribute across the country so that child with special educational need can get the help they need wherever they live 
 we know that local authority have be significantly impact by increase demand for education health and care plan as well as challenge in workforce capacity we expect the £ of additional investment to create thousand of new place in both mainstream and special school and in specialist setting we will confirm the allocation to specific local authority which know how good to invest in their local area to increase capacity as need in the spring 
 across surrey last year more than child with special educational need be absent from school for more than a of the time special educational need co ordinator be incredibly frustrated that ehcp be come back from our local council with the wrong name describe the wrong condition and offer the wrong package of care teacher be stretch headteacher can not stretch their budget any far and or both parent be have to give up employment to look after their child yet the leadership of surrey county council have say that there be not a problem with special educational need but that there be parent who be too articulate would the minister please meet i and senco to discuss this very serious 
 order can i just say to the hon gentleman that it be much easy if he get to the question instead of have all the preamble i can not get other people in i think the question be clear 
 follow the most recent local area send inspection by ofsted and the care quality commission in september the department work alongside nhs england continue to track the progress that the surrey partnership be make against the area for improvement that be identify offer support and advice to the local authority i appreciate the significant concern that the hon gentleman outline and we will continue to keep the situation under review 
 bradstow special school in my constituency support some of the most vulnerable child across the south east more than half of those child be from family in kent yet tory lead kent county council have refuse to pay £ in fee contribute to that school now face closure kent have be offer the school for free include all of its land yet it be refuse to keep the school open will the minister join i in urge kent county council to take responsibility and work with the govern body staff and child ’s family to ensure that we can keep this vital school open 
 if we be to improve the situation that far too many child face in relation to special educational need and disability and to meet demand which we know be outstrip supply it be vital that area work together in partnership that be why we very much recommend that local authority work together with health partner and local school to solve some of those challenge together the department for education will work closely with they to make sure that every child get the education they deserve 
 a national audit office report publish in october highlight that special educational need place in independent school can cost and a half time as much as in state school do the minister agree that if we be to ensure that child get the support they need in future we will have to assist local authority in expand their number of special need place 
 my hon friend raise an important point we know that the situation need reform and that we need much great capacity within mainstream   school so that child with special educational need and disability can be educate alongside their peer where that be the appropriate place for they to be but also so that special school place be available where need that be why we have put in £ of additional investment to support mainstream school to expand their specialist provision 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 child grow up in our country deserve the good start in life and nothing less that be why last week the prime minister publish his plan for change include an ambitious target to ensure that by the end of the parliament a record proportion of child be ready for school we will do this by transform the early year create and expand nursery roll out childcare strengthen family service and focus on early intervention 
 mr speaker as we approach the end of the term i wish you and all the staff of the house a very merry christmas and send my thank to all the staff work across education 
 i have meet private school in and around tatton that be attend by my constituent child and they have all i tell that despite have apply for a vat number not of they have receive it will the secretary of state explain to i what discussion she be have with the chancellor to put this right particularly in the light of the rush implementation of this misguided ideological policy in january 
 i would be happy to make sure that the point the right hon lady raise be look into but on the wide policy priority i say to she that this party and this government be determined to expand opportunity right across our country for the vast majority of child who go to state school the opposition may be happy to defend the indefensible but should they wish to oppose what we be set out they need to say how they be go to pay for it 
 i have be contact by many parent who be desperate to secure a place in a special school for their child but in nottingham there be a severe lack of availability while i wholeheartedly support effort to improve send support in mainstream school and to deliver an education system that be truly inclusive it seem clear that we also desperately need an increase in the number of special school place what step be the government take in this area

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the higher education freedom of speech act be pass by parliament prior to the election by the end of its passage through both houses the labour party have agree in principle with the need for the act however just after the election government source say the act be a tory hate speech charter now i read in the paper that the department may commence the legislation without the tort can i ask the secretary of state to clear up this mess and to tell the house what her plan be for the freedom of speech act 
 this government be absolutely committed to freedom of speech and academic freedom we want to make sure that our university be place of intellectual challenge and rigour where people will be expose to view with which they may disagree we pause commencement of the previous government ’s legislation because of the serious concern raise by very many people include from minority group about how the act would apply we be consult with stakeholder and we intend to set out our position in due course

 i do accept that academic should be free to express a wide range of view and there will be view that people sometimes find challenging but it also matter that we have legislation that be workable i be afraid that the legislation the right hon lady ’s party set out just do not achieve that and we have have to consider so many challenge raise by minority group the former universities minister herself say that she be concerned about what it would mean for holocaust denial on campus we need to get this right

 we have launch our curriculum and assessment review to make sure that issue such as the that the hon gentleman identifie be take into account it be a shame that we seem to hear nothing from the opposition but negativity about the curriculum and assessment review we be determined to make sure that all our child get a brilliant education with high standard and strong academic outcome as well as the kind of life skill that he be right to identify

 itchen form college in my constituency be recently judge to be outstanding by ofsted will the secretary of    state join i in congratulate the college do she agree that future success require we to sort out financial inconsistency such as lecturer pay and vat liability 
 my hon friend identify a number of the challenge that we have inherit as a new government we be work as quickly as we can to address they we want to ensure that teacher right across the sector whether in our school the fe sector or college get the support the pay and the recognition that they deserve 
 in brighton ’s non academy form college the current teacher strike action stem largely from the government not provide the same funding to cover pay uplift as they do for school and academy will the secretary of state urgently correct that unjustified funding anomaly 
 at the budget we set out an additional £ for further education the hon lady will know that the government be not responsible for and play no role in set or make recommendation about teacher pay in fe college we be look closely at form college too as part of this which again be part of the challenge that we inherit from the last government 
 i welcome this government ’s ambition to ensure that extra child be school ready every year however at school such as west end school in oswaldtwistle in my constituency there be no extra classroom to make extra nursery provision available will the minister consider capital funding to ensure that lot of primary school have the opportunity to extend high quality nursery provision 
 the government be commit to roll out school base nursery i would welcome the opportunity to meet my hon friend to discuss those issue far 
 i assure the education secretary that we be very positive about school in this country i be sure that she will want to thank all school leader for their work to help english school to soar up the ranking for the programme for international student assessment and programme for international student assessment ranking pisa and timms but will she join i in send personal congratulation to katharine birbalsingh whose approach to discipline the curriculum and teacher lead instruction make her school michaela the good in the country 
 i will always celebrate the fantastic work of our school leader and teacher because they be how we will drive high and rise standard across our school system the hon gentleman and i probably have more in common than he realise he might recognise these word 
 the great injustice in britain today be that your life be still largely determined not by your effort and talent but by where you come from who your parent be and what school you attend this be wrong 
 they be take from the conservative manifesto which he be involve in writing this government will right those wrong and break the link between background 
 order it might be easy if i say it side say it ’ all their fault and the other say they ’ve be in power that be the answer to every question 
 i recently visit heasandford primary school in my constituency which   be in a dire state will the minister meet i and lancashire county council to see what we can do to repair the school the big in lancashire by class number and make sure that it be fit for child ’s ambition in burnley 
 we be committed to improve the condition of the estate through the annual funding programme i will happily meet my hon friend to discuss those issue far 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state to make a statement on plan for the reform of planning committee 
 as the house will be aware in our king ’s speech in july the government announce their intention to introduce a planning and infrastructure bill design to streamline the delivery of essential housing and infrastructure across the country and support sustain economic growth we make clear at the time that an important component of that bill would be measure to modernise the operation of planning committee 
 planning committee play a vital role in provide local democratic oversight of planning decision however if we be to undo the damage that the previous government do to housing supply in this country and deliver home in the place that our community need we must ensure that they be operate as effectively as possible as we look to develop government policy in this area we be determined to avoid the mistake of previous conservative administrations who be rightly criticise for bring forward planning legislation without sufficient engagement or consultation 
 we also want to ensure that the change to the operation of plan committee that we ultimately take forward be as robust as possible draw on feedback from those who navigate england ’s planning system on a daily basis that be why today we have publish a work paper that set out our initial thinking for modernise planning committee this be just the late in a series of work paper on planning reform and it be explicitly design to kick start engagement before we launch a formal government consultation on a more detailed proposition as such i assure members across the house that there will be plenty of opportunity to engage with and debate these matter in the month ahead 
 the work paper seek view on potential change a national scheme of delegation set out which type of planning application should be determine at committee and which by expert planning officer we believe that that would bring clarity and consistency to both applicant and community about how application be determine secondly the introduction of dedicated committee for strategic development would allow member of those committee to dedicate energy to the most significant project thirdly the introduction of mandatory planning training for committee member would enable applicant to be confident in the knowledge of those make these decision take together the change be design to help streamline local planning decision making maximise the use of professional skill and judgment of train planner and focus the time of elect councillor on the most significant or controversial application 
 as i say a moment ago the work paper publish today be merely the start of our engagement with the sector on this important issue it be not a firm set of confirmed proposal and we will use discussion in the new year to   refine our approach we will then prepare final policy proposal on which we will launch a consultation in the usual way 
 let i finish by make it clear that the proposal that we be test through the publication of this work paper be merely part of a much wide set of reform to the ail planning system that we inherit from the previous government i look forward to update hon member as we proceed to deliver on other aspect of the government ’s ambitious housing and planning agenda 
 many of we be surprised to hear the secretary of state tell we over the weekend that there be enough home in this country the planning system be an area of interest to all member and to our constituent i know it be to you in particular mr speaker and to your constituency planning matter because it impact the look and feel of our community it have be the subject of numerous parliamentary question both at the dispatch box and in writing in response to all those question we have be tell to await the national planning policy framework it therefore seem a discourtesy to we to hear so much about the propose reform to the planning system in a series of medium interview over the weekend 
 some question emerge from this it be clear from the department ’s figure that of planning application be decide on by officer use delegate power that be up from in it be that to which the local democratic voice be so relevant on the planning reform work paper what assessment have be make of the impact on local democracy for example on the ability of ward councillor to call in a controversial application or on case in which reserved matter be approve but then there be a breach by the developer so the application need to come back before a committee for further consideration and enforcement 
 give that of major application be decide within either week or the agree deadline will the full council still be able to call in major strategic application that will have a significant impact on their area already of application be grant by local authority will neighbourhood plan retain the legal status that enable the community that write they to have a say on what go on in their area give that of minor application be already agree within timescale who in the local authority will decide whether a matter be to be refer to a committee give the huge increase in housing planning permission grant under the previous government when do the government intend to start work on get developer develop and builder build rather than tinker with a democratic system that have already deliver more than home with consent in england 
 i have to say it be quite rich hear the hon gentleman crow about plan permission in the system we be experience the low number of planning permission and completion for a decade as a result of the conservatives change to the national planning policy framework make in december which torpedo supply and hit growth across this country 
 the hon gentleman also ask about the nppf we fully intend to bring forward a revise nppf before the end of the year these change do not relate to the nppf   as i make clear in my initial response we be consult in an initial sense on the change before bring forward formal proposal for consultation alongside the planning and infrastructure bill another part of the government ’s reform agenda 
 the hon gentleman rightly make it clear that of decision be already make by planning officer the other of decision though be incredibly important they represent a substantial portion of total unit in the planning process because many major application go to a planning committee for consideration while we know that there be good practice out there the number and type of application that committee consider still vary widely between local planning authority some committee decision be not make in accordance with material planning consideration and some committee repeatedly revisit or relitigate development that have already be consider by elect member through the local plan process we need to streamline the local planning system in order to provide the home and place that we need and to empower train planning professional to get the good use out of the system 
 the hon gentleman also ask about neighbourhood plan i have be very clear on several occasion in the house that the protection for neighbourhood plan in the nppf will remain as well as firm proposal on this proposition around modernise planning committee we will bring forward further detail about change to the national planning policy framework in due course 
 my hon friend will know that i be passionately commit to local council and local democracy but do he understand the frustration that many of we feel when a planning authority democratically approve a local plan after consult the community but then when an application be make to build home the same councillor turn down the application despite it be consistent with the local plan be the minister ’s main objective to try to remove that sort of decision making which hold up the whole process and to ensure in consultation with the local government association and other in local government that we can find a well way forward so that we can get the permission to build the home that the country badly need 
 i thank my hon friend for that question he have huge expertise in this area from his time as chair of the housing communities and local government committee and he be absolutely right we have be clear that the good way for local community to shape the decision about what to build where be through local plan it be appal that we have inherit a situation in which less than a of place be cover by up to date local plan we need to boost that and—[interruption if   the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes   will allow i what we be look at in the change that we be consult on in a soft form through the work paper be how we can ensure that plan committee make decision on the most significant and controversial application include those that be not in line with local plan rather than spend their time pore over decision that have be make in an allocation framework through the local plan process hon member will see in the work paper that of our proposal for a national scheme for delegation would require all application that be in accordance with the development plan to be determine by officer   that will free up committee to focus on controversial development that be out of step with the local plan that elect member and officer put forward after consultation with their community 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as there be people in england with unmet housing need the liberal democrats welcome the plan for further house building for we the priority have to be the delivery of social home we need annually and we need housing that local people can genuinely afford on the topic of social housing i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests let we be clear when whitehall take planning decision out of the hand of local councillor it be take decision out of the hand of local people that be undemocratic and we would reverse that instead government should unblock the thousand of permit home that be not be build for example through use it or lose it permission by have more than just extra planning officer per local authority and by allow council to set their fee and to ringfence that income for planning department will the minister allow council to set their application fee and ensure that that funding be ringfence for plan department 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that set of question and i be glad that he personally welcome housing when it come to his party on this issue as on so many other the view you get depend on what part of the country you be in we be absolutely committed to increase the delivery of social and affordable home we have take decisive early step to bring that forward include by secure an additional £ in the budget for the affordable home programme 
 until the liberal democrats set out how they will pay for social rent home a year i find the hon gentleman ’s ambition in that area a little lack in credibility we be take step to get serious on build out that be part of our planning agenda but on these change we think it be right that plan committee should operate as effectively as possible in exercise democratic oversight not revisit or relitigate the same decision and focus on application that require planning committee member input he be absolutely right that we need more planning capacity in the system that be why we be make change through the nppf to support that and why at the budget the chancellor announce a £ package of investment to support capacity and capability in local planning authority 
 when i be leader of manchester city council i spend a large percentage of my time try to right the wrong of labour and conservative governments in the 60 and 70 who have make a similar dash to build many many house i spend my time find way to fund the demolition of deck access housing as a result i become convinced that the solution to every problem be not more power to the centre the people in chorley know what be good for chorley mr speaker just as the people in manchester know what be good for manchester will my hon friend assure i that he will look at the mistake that be make in the 60 and 70 in the dash   for building and ensure that we do not have really bad decision make from the centre or the exclusion of local council 
 i thank my hon friend for that question he be right about some of the bad decision that be make in the past i be a keen student of history and be well aware of some of they and we definitely take they into account when make our own decision on what he say about seize power from the centre this be absolutely nothing of the sort we be propose a national scheme of delegation to provide consistency in how council make these important decision that involve a national scheme of delegation which balance vital local democratic oversight with ensure that plan committee operate as effectively as possible in instance where local councillor be not make the decision and application can be deal with by train local planning officer not by i or by official in whitehall we think that be the right thing to do in order to streamline the delivery of essential housing in part of the country that be cry out for those home 
 i call the father of the house 
 there be nothing more controversial than government seek to bypass local democracy i see that with the desire of the last government to bypass local democracy by impose a special development order on raf scampton and i see it now with the many application to build solar farm that be ostensibly national infrastructure project the present planning system be largely create by the labour government and have stand the test of time can the minister assure i that whatever he decide finally we will not degrade local democracy it be essential that people join a council and join a planning committee know that they have real power and be not under the cosh of government or plan impose by government 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that question we have to take step to fix the ail planning system that we have inherit it be fail on a number of front and trust and confidence in it be at a record low as for the assertion that we have hear for all the hyperbole from conservative members we be not seize power from the centre we be say to local community put an up to date local plan in place and when site be allocate through that local plan you can be confident that they will be build out in the manner that you have specify it be through local plan that you get your control however when it come to the decision on specific site let we ensure if we can that elect member be direct towards the most significant and controversial application as oppose to some of the minor application that involve technical reserved matter question i have sit on a planning committee i do not know whether the right hon gentleman have in the case of those application the initial decision can be re litigate and revisit rather than the technical issue be put to we let we ensure that those decision sit in the hand of train planning professional and get planning committee member time focus on the application that deserve it 
 it be good to see the government ’s recommitment to the importance of local plan in july this year milton keynes city council go through the important process of develop a local plan during the election campaign the former prime minister   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak visit my home town and describe the development of a local plan as reckless will the minister reassure we that this government do not believe that local plan be reckless but consider they necessary for the sustainable delivery of the home that the country need 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and i absolutely agree with he we have a local plan lead planning system in which few than a of area have an up to date local plan and that be unsustainable we be absolutely determined to drive towards universal local plan coverage the measure on which we be consult and i emphasise that this be a work paper we be seek view and hon member be more than welcome to submit theirs as we refine our proposal will reinforce and support the plan lead system by ensure that officer and member time be focus on the application where that be most need community can have confidence that once they have an up to date local plan it can be decide what to build and where in accordance with the wish of local community and the wide national planning policy framework 
 as the housing and planning minister will be aware both dacorum borough council and rivers district council in my constituency be lib dem control rivers have be for over year both council do not have an up to date local plan can the minister advise the house about what would happen if the government impose a local plan on an authority would those decision be delegate to officer if so the process would have no democratic mandate at all 
 we have not outline any proposal in the work paper that relate to call in or the takeover of local plan from the centre the hon gentleman be absolutely right though that ministers already have power to take over a local plan in extremis they have not be use before we be more than willing to use all the power at our disposal to ensure that we have up to date local plan coverage if there be local authority out there i say this very candidly and openly to the house that resist the change that we be try to make and take no step towards put an up to date local plan in place we will consider use all the power at our disposal it be through local plan that we will drive sustainable housing supply in the year to come 
 i welcome the mandatory training as a former chair of a planning committee i know that training be part of the process that we implement so it be good to see that it will be deliver across the board we approve some development multiple time on the same site such as a maternity block in my constituency which be then flip and sell on to another developer could the minister please tell we what step be be take to account for land banking or flip site via developer 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that there be good example of training across the country hon member seem to indicate early that they think that mandatory training for councillor be in place it be not in place we know there be good example out there but provision be inconsistent and we think that we need to take forward mandatory training to ensure that all councillor have the necessary knowledge to make the good decision on individual application 
 on my hon friend ’s point about trading of land she be absolutely right there be far too much speculative development in this country we have a dysfunctional land market again i come back to the importance of up to date local plan it be through up to date local plan that community have the ability to shape development in their area in the good possible way in accordance with their wish on build out more generally we be consider what option might be available to we to ensure that the build out of consent site go forward alongside our new home accelerator which be announce a few month back 
 until september this year i be a proud elect member of stockport council i make decision on planning because in stockport we decide at ward level what be appropriate for each ward if i understand the government ’s suggestion correctly the power to decide for ourselves have be take away from stockport council could the minister confirm my understanding 
 i be afraid to say that the hon lady ’s understanding be not correct i encourage she to read the work paper it be a work paper and we be seek initial view on a national scheme of delegation there be option in the work paper i look forward to she submit her view in full and i will happily consider they 
 i welcome the government ’s new ambition on home and note that the stated aim be to ensure that 
 skilled planning officer in local authority be give the appropriate amount of trust and empowerment 
 unfortunately that be not the case in middlesbrough because the last tory government hand over power to the unwanted middlesbrough development corporation which totally undermine the council ’s planning department and instead use a private planning consultancy at a significantly high cost to the public purse and with a considerable loss of democratic authority what assurance can the minister give i that middlesbrough will get the trust the empowerment and indeed the affordable housing that it need and that local democratic legitimacy will be restore 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of local empowerment and of local community shape development in their area most importantly as i have make clear in answer to several question through up to date local plan 
 my hon friend will forgive i if i do not comment on the specific of the development corporation in his area but on plan officer more generally the government want to make sure this be what we be   test through the proposal in the work paper that skilled planning officer in local authority have the right level of trust and empowerment to resolve select application more quickly in the service of resident and business we also want to ensure that planning professional be fully support in their role and that their experience and skill be put to good use which will allow member to focus on the most significant and most controversial application include those out of line with up to date local plan 
 there be a remarkable number of contradiction the minister say that he want more democratic oversight while remove the democratic local voice of councillor he say he be be decisive while also say he have exist power that he have not use and that this be not a firm set of proposal he be not propose anything around tech and improvement while the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster be give a big speech this week on exactly that as the centrepiece of government change why do the minister think that the way to bring clarity to the transport system and local plan be to tell people to engage with the local plan then at the same time tell they that if they do so the people most engage with that the democratically elect councillor will be ignore if they then follow that local plan 
 i gently say to the right hon gentleman that for a start he have clearly not read the work paper his question be a mess of contradiction what we be clearly say to local community be get an up to date local plan in place you can then have confidence that that local plan will be deliver you can have confidence that application in line with that local plan will be deliver and you can have confidence that elect planning member will be focus on the most significant and the most controversial application and that local planning officer in those authority can ensure that other application that need not go before member be determine in accordance with the local plan as well as the national planning policy framework 
 we have have trouble with house building because the speed with which house be build have be dictate by developer what we need to see when planning permission be grant be that the developer must either use it or lose it we can not allow those company to continue to land bank and use their land only when they be confident that house price be continue to rise do my hon friend intend to deal with those aspect of the housing market 
 on many site across the country there be genuine reason include those of viability why site be not build out it be not as simple as say that every consent site that be not be build out be be sit on deliberately by developer but we know that land be trade speculatively i want to reassure my hon friend and constituency neighbour that as i have make clear in answer to previous question there be exist power that we can consider bring into force and there be measure that we take forward in the consultation on the national planning policy framework that we think will help build out particularly on proposal around   mix use site but there be potentially more that we can do in this area and we be keep the matter under close review 
 speak as until recently the leader of a district council and a long term member of our planning committee i do not recognise the issue that the minister be cite a lot of the thing he say relate to the absence of a local plan i fully agree with that my council have just put in place a new local plan which be hopefully be approve right now a well way to get more affordable housing would be to look at the way local authority can finance the building of those house and fix that it would be well to allow local authority to charge appropriate amount to cover the cost of the planning so that they can get the necessary planning officer and far well to look at how many council already do mandatory training i hear from liberal democrat colleague that they all have to do mandatory training as i do in my council so that be in place i would like to see a list of how many council do not do that we also need to make water company statutory consultee so that we do not hit flooding problem those change will help the problem be not in the planning process more than application have be allow but not build 
 order i think we could have build a whole estate by now 
 indeed mr speaker and i get a strong sense that an adjournment debate application will be come your way on several of those issue let i address a number of they the hon gentleman say that training be in place in most part of the country in which case local authority should have no problem with mandatory training be request by the centre and only a small number of authority if it be a small number would have to put such training in place
