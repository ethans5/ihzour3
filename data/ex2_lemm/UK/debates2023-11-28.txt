resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of a report date   november entitle independent inquiry into the issue raise by the david fuller case phase report.—(mark fletcher 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if she will make an estimate of the proportion of household that spend more than of their income on energy cost in a and b 
 in england the share of household require to spend more than of their income on energy after housing cost be in and in follow the invasion of ukraine that year we provide close to £ of energy support to household and business last winter of the most generous level in europe since then we have see the ofgem price cap fall from £ at its peak in january to £ from january 
 more than of rotherham household be live in fuel poverty yet the government ’s flagship energy policy will not by their own admission save a single penny from those household energy bill bill be set to rise again in january how can the minister justify the government ’s appalling failure to act to support my constituent struggle to heat their home this winter 
 the extra support announce by the chancellor last week bring our total cost of live support to £ over the period to that be of the large support package anywhere in europe on top of that we be provide £ in cost of live payment across and to ensure that support get to those most in need 
 i recently bump into christopher thexton who be of the green doctor work out of college house in barrow he do an amazing job with his team go into home to try to help people to save money on their energy bill and reduce the cost of living whether that be help with energy debt fix draft in their home or even change the lightbulb to make they more energy efficient but demand be massively outstrip supply can my right hon friend speak to whether any more support be available to such team to help people on the ground to reduce their energy bill 
 we be spend £ on energy efficiency over this parliament and the next we can be proud of the step we have take so far when we take over in just of home be energy efficient now the number be and we have plan to go far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 an estimated household be in fuel poverty across the uk ofgem have announce that energy debt have reach £ with million of people face another difficult winter the government promise to consult on a social tariff to help the most vulnerable can the secretary of state provide an update on that consultation 
 people mean many different thing by a social tariff but fundamentally it be about provide people with support to help with their bill just in the autumn statement we have increase the national living wage which be worth £ to people increase benefit by which be worth £ and cut national insurance contribution which be worth £ those be all on top of the £ cost of live support we already have in place 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 thursday be fuel poverty awareness day and recently the scottish fuel poverty advisory panel estimate that nearly of household in scotland be face extreme fuel poverty up from in do the secretary of state agree that at the very least that be concern somehow a of my constituent in the north east of scotland home to a year bonanza for his majesty ’s treasury live in energy rich scotland but find themselves in fuel poverty be that what unionist mean by pool and share resource 
 we have take energy price go up incredibly seriously which be why we have spend £ protect the british people that be of the most generous package anywhere in europe if the hon member care about the income of people in scotland i suggest that he back british oil and gas job 
 what recent assessment she have make of the impact of the us inflation reduction act on level of investment in low carbon industry in the uk 
 in the uk we have see nearly £ worth of investment in low carbon sector since that be more than the us as a share of gdp at the global investment summit just yesterday it be clear that business see britain very much as open for business and that be back up by £ worth of investment 
 in the summer i hear about president biden ’s plan to use america ’s industrial might to power up new york use offshore wind give that we need to turbocharge the green economy why will the government ’s response to the inflation reduction act not come into effect until 
 we have take many step already we have set out new plan for auction round of renewable energy and for permanent economy wide full expensing we change planning and we be unlock the grid the fund that the hon member mention will unlock supply chain across the uk what have people say scottish renewables have say it be 
 a shot in the arm for the sector 
 the offshore wind industry council have say that it will help we retain our position as a global leader it have be welcome by make uk energy uk and many other business as well 
 last week the chancellor ’s autumn statement include an important commitment on the government ’s part to bring forward legislation to modernise the crown estate ’s investment and borrowing power which be a vital step for deploy gw of float offshore wind in the celtic sea that will benefit the whole of wales and we hope in particular my constituency and the port of milford haven when be the government likely to bring forward that important legislation 
 my right hon friend have be a doughty champion for the celtic sea he know that we have a commitment to unlock an additional gw of wind power in the celtic sea that be important to we and we will bring forward the legislation in due course 
 i call the shadow minister 
 instead of properly respond to america ’s inflation reduction act the government hold a meeting with business yesterday you might not have see it mr speaker as it do not make any of the front page be the global investment summit not just a distraction from the same old fundamental business confidence be down export be down and growth forecast be down after year of instability and uncertainty do the secretary of state think that lack of business confidence be because her government trash the economy last year because her government tell business to eff off or because as mark carney say the government have juvenilise the climate debate instead of use it as a driver of good job do she not agree with those from a global pension fund i speak to this morning who say it be time we get some adult in the room 
 what we see yesterday be £ from iberdrola for uk electricity network and renewable and £ from aira the heat pump installer in the last couple of week we have have £ from sea wind £ from nissan and £ from siemens gamesa what the hon lady should understand be that there be a difference between what the government be offer which be £ of investment and what labour be offering which be £ of borrowing 
 what recent discussion she have have with business on the government 's net target 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of the contribution of business to help meet the uk 's net target 
 as a fellow lancastrian i hope you have a good lancashire day yesterday mr speaker 
 as a yorkshire mp i resent that remark laughter 
 i meet regularly with business leader and organisation i chair or co chair among other the offshore wind industry council which i will be go straight to after question the solar taskforce the green job delivery group which meet yesterday the north sea transition forum which i will attend tomorrow and from a strategic cross cutting point of view the net council of course the secretary of state and i meet global leader yesterday 
 well as the minister seem to meet so many business leader he must have hear their shock and horror about the government ’s roll back on net early this month the aviva chief executive officer amanda blanc say that the government be put our climate goal as a country under threat put at risk 
 job growth and the additional investment the uk require 
 she be not wrong be she 
 the hon gentleman have a well found and highly esteemed reputation for anger under this government this country have cut its emission more than any other major economy on the planet and we have the most ambitious plan for when i attend cop28 next week we will be invite and support other to join the uk which under this conservative government have lead the way on a pathway to net 
 the industrial decarbonisation research and innovation centre base at heriot watt university in my constituency be do incredible work on the green transformation across the uk ’s industrial heartland it be work with all the big industrial cluster and be support more than university and research initiative look at all aspect of the government ’s decarbonisation challenge as such it be well place to assist business to meet our net target the problem be that its funding be come to an end next march and at present there be nothing to replace it the science   minister promise i a meeting about this urgent issue several month ago but it have be cancel a number of time will the minister advocate with his colleague so that i can get this meeting arrange and get funding in place for idric to continue its fantastic work 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for champion vital research not least in scotland i be look forward to meet scientist when i be in scotland over the next couple of day we have all hear her request and it will be note 
 i call the chair of the environmental audit committee 
 my right hon friend mention that he will go to cop28 next week could he remind member of the house particularly those on the opposition benches of the measure take in last week ’s autumn statement to help to promote the green energy agenda in this country 
 my hon friend be quite right we must never forget the parlous state of this country in less than of our electricity come from renewable that be the legacy of   the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband in the quarter of this year that be nearly opposition members raise the issue of people be cold and unable to pay their bill but just of home be insulate properly now it be in last week ’s autumn statement we hear announcement about the grid and 
 order the minister talk about emission and we be get a lot of they from he today 
 my constituent put in of the energy into the national grid from nuclear power station we be no on the template for new build so i would like to invite the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   to come to heysham to see for himself the good work of edf and the new nuclear power programme that be come to my constituency 
 my hon friend be a stout champion not only of the pathway to net but of the job and prosperity that come with it it be with great alacrity that i accept on behalf of my hon friend the minister 
 what assessment her department have make of trend in the level of fuel poverty since 
 the share of household in fuel poverty in england reduce every year between and with energy efficiency be the key driver although fuel poverty be devolve we continue to engage with the devolved administration include on specific scheme such as the energy company obligation and the warm home discount 
 across the world and in the united kingdom human right be be erode and fuel poverty be on the rise this government could address both by declare access to energy a human right it would mean that people could not be cut off willy nilly simply because they could not afford to pay for their energy at that time do the minister agree that energy should be a human right if not will she tell i which human being she believe should not have the right to heat their home 
 as the hon lady indicate the government take fuel poverty incredibly seriously everybody have the right to heat we have be help people with their energy bill include a £ cost of live allowance as well as all the great thing that we announce in the autumn statement 
 what step her department be take to support the development of community energy scheme 
 the government have create a new £ community energy fund to support community energy project in england we be work with the sector on content and a timetable for a consultation on barrier for community energy project 
 do the minister recognise the frustration and disappointment at the length of time and legislative barrier that remain for campaign community group who want community energy scheme to move forward it be the most secure way of generate electricity the conservatives be suppose to be the party of free market and competition so why be they deny consumer the choice that would come with an exciting community energy scheme 
 far from deny consumer opportunity we be already begin to work with organisation such as the community energy contact group on the content of the consultation we launch and whether it should include solution to barrier i will need to take a view when it respond 
 my right hon friend the minister for energy security and net early mention the solar taskforce will my hon friend the under secretary liaise with his colleague and the national farmers union on combine community energy scheme with farmer and the rural sector the solar taskforce mention acre of supermarket rooftop be available for solar but make no reference to farm building it make sense that community scheme work with local farmer in rural area can deliver community energy and allow farmer to diversify 
 i hear very much what my right hon friend say and understand his concern it be therefore with equal alacrity that i accept a meeting on my right hon friend the minister ’s behalf to discuss those issue move forward 
 if she will make an assessment of the impact of the mandatory code of practice for the involuntary installation of prepayment meter on vulnerable household 
 if she will make an assessment of the impact of the mandatory code of practice for the involuntary installation of prepayment meter on vulnerable household 
 the secretary of state and i meet ceo of energy supplier recently we emphasise that ofgem ’s new rule must be implement and lead to improve protection for vulnerable consumer we be work closely with ofgem and the industry to ensure that that be the case 
 the minister will be aware that the ban on the involuntary installation of prepayment meter will be lift soon that will mean family with child over year old and pensioner under who be still vulnerable will potentially face the high cost of prepayment meter there be the possibility of course that when they run out of token they will be cut off be that right 
 of all we have be mindful of ensure that there be no high cost to prepayment meter we be mindful of the fact that prepayment meter have a place in certain household because we be very sure that we must not increase debt however reason why we scrutinise the process so carefully be to ensure that it do not impact negatively on vulnerable customer 
 i thank the minister for that answer but what be it about the code of practice that mean year old be vulnerable but year old be not what be the difference between those household why have scottish power be able to go to court to obtain warrant to install prepayment meter forcibly before it have be able to demonstrate any compliance with the code be that not the wrong way around 
 just for assurance we have hold conversation with ofgem and supplier to make sure no force instalment have take place yet we be scrutinise the system to ensure that all vulnerable people be able to access the energy they need 
 if she will take step to increase the number of onshore wind farm 
 this have be a record year for onshore wind which be already the large renewable technology the late contract for difference add an unprecedented gw 
 the minister seem to be compare figure i have not see if it be a record year why have we see such a dramatic drop in planning application for onshore wind farm and in the number of onshore wind farm deliver from a peak of application in it go right down to in and now to in the late figure the house of commons library could provide that do not seem like a record year to i be it not time the government stop shilly shallye on onshore wind and back the builder not the blocker 
 the hon lady be renowned in the house for her arithmetic skill but in this case they seem to have fail she the gw be a tremendous success i share her enthusiasm for onshore wind where community support it in september the government announce change to planning policy for onshore wind in england to help make it easy and quick for local planning authority to consider and where appropriate approve onshore wind project where there be local support 
 in the kettering constituency there be large wind turbine together with solar panel they generate enough renewable electricity to power all home in the constituency be this not yet another case of where kettering lead other follow 
 my hon friend have champion do champion and i be sure will continue for many year to champion the good people of kettering and the fact that they be provide such leadership on net and the delivery of renewable after our parlous inheritance from the labour party let we make sure that we never go back to a system in which renewable be not bring on to our grid in the way they be today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister be be a little shameless with his figure we really ought to look at what be continue to happen in england in england industry and other body warn that the suppose change to onshore planning restriction that be announce in september be far too timid to make any real difference to the dearth of new onshore wind 
 i recently visit the site in leighton buzzard of the only turbine that have be put in place onshore in england since those suppose restriction be lift it turn out that it have be in the planning process since and be not on a new site anyway the department ’s renewable energy planning database show that there be precisely new scheme in the pipeline in england should the minister not go away and reconsider the remain planning and funding restriction on onshore wind so that it really can get go again 
 as i have say i share the enthusiasm on both side of the house for onshore wind the government have set regulation that require onshore wind developer to consult community in advance of submit a planning application as well as have it consult on post submission we make no apology for   roll out this transformation in renewable technology in concert with community rather than seek to ride roughshod over they 
 when she plan to make a decision on the application for development consent for the propose aquind interconnector project 
 the propose aquind interconnector project be a live planning application currently be redetermine by my right hon friend the secretary of state who be progress the work in the normal course of business that mean that as set out in the planning propriety guidance i be unable to give any further information on the progress of this live case 
 portsmouth people have wait far too long for the government to decide against aquind will the co owner ’s donation of more than £ to the tories include £ to the prime minister ’s constituency party and over £ to the chancellor be a factor in the minister ’s decision on what be a disastrous project for portsmouth 
 the secretary of state be follow a well establish planning process i be sorry that i can not say any more about this live case beyond what i have say already it be with the department and the secretary of state for a decision 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the climate change committee ’s progress report to parliament 
 the climate change committee itself have say that there be no material difference in our overall projection after we make the change to policy in september the government have take considerable further step since then include our introduction of the emission vehicle mandate our agreement with tata steel on industrial electrification in port talbot and reform of electricity grid connection 
 the climate change committee have state that the uk need to 
 regain its international climate leadership 
 but last year the prime minister be uninterested in attend cop27 the committee ’s recent report to parliament make it clear that the uk be 
 no long a climate leader 
 since then we have see approval for massive oilfield weakened climate target and the resignation of a minister because the prime minister be so uninterested cop28 be day away and there be still confusion over whether the government will push for the phasing out of fossil fuel give all that be it not fair to say that the government be fail to do everything possible to halt the climate breakdown 
 the uk have of the most ambitious climate target in comparison with any of our international peer the un ’s emission gap report publish just last week show that the uk be expect to reduce emission between and at the fast rate in the g20 group we remain extremely ambitious about climate change we have over deliver on all our carbon budget to date and the work that have be do show that we will continue to do so 
 the committee ’s recent progress report advocate a fast transition to low carbon energy what fiscal and regulatory measure be the government take to encourage more capital investment by business in this important area 
 we be already take step we have set out new plan for another round of renewable auction and we have set out the most radical plan to unlock the electricity grid since the 1950s we have also launch a new gigafund that will unlock supply chain across all these area and we can see that investor be vote with their foot 
 when it come to national and household energy security ownership matter as champion by the co op party the labour party be commit to owner of uk produce renewable energy with gw that will be cheap green and own by the people here in the uk so why will the government not meet that ambition 
 i think the hon gentleman ’s argument be completely wrong headed let we look at what the uk government have do since we now have the and large offshore wind farm anywhere in the world as i have say the plan we have set out mean that yesterday we be able to secure £ of investment into this country that will drive job and prosperity the opposition ’s plan be to borrow £ which would only drive up inflation 
 yesterday be lancashire day and today be bedfordshire day happy bedfordshire day to all member it be the job of the climate change committee to be enthusiastic about achieve our net goal it be the responsibility of the government to be fiscally prudent in achieve that objective do my right hon friend agree with the prime minister that we need to be clear with the british public all the way along about the cost that will be incur to achieve our net ambition 
 my hon friend make an excellent point it be really important that we be honest with the british public we be pursue the most ambitious climate target but we will do so in a sensible way that protect the economy grow job and investment and ensure that we can deliver for the country not only on energy security but on our climate change ambition 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i have to say that i spend the year of my life in bedfordshire and i have no idea that bedfordshire day be a thing but happy bedfordshire day anyway 
 year ago the labour government introduce the climate change act a landmark piece of legislation that have guide climate policy and progress in this country and inspire similar action around the world admirably lead it have to be say by my right hon friend   the member for doncaster north edward miliband but where be that leadership now how can the prime minister show his face at cop when in the word of the climate change committee his entirely cynical backtracking have create 
 widespread uncertainty for consumer and the supply chain 
 have increase 
 both energy bill and motor cost 
 and make 
 net considerably hard to achieve 
 i think the hon lady be put a lot of word into the climate change committee ’s mouth there what it actually say be that in term of emission it would make no material difference as i have say the un ’s emission gap report show just last week that the uk be expect to reduce emission between and at the fast rate in the g20 group this be yet more doom and gloom from the opposition if we look at what we have actually achieve we can see that we have the most ambitious target in the world and we have set out unprecedented level of detail we will continue to do so 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the energy bill support scheme alternative fund and the alternative fuel payment alternative fund 
 the government provide energy bill support through the energy bill support scheme alternative funding to over household and via the alternative fuel payment alternative fund to nearly household that could not automatically access this vital support 
 energy bill be up since but there be no mention of this in the autumn statement and £ earmark for the most vulnerable household go unspent last year yet in my constituency of edinburgh west pensioner carer and disabled people who often have to use more electricity for life save equipment be pay those big bill all of they be also pay high standing charge than elsewhere in the uk if the chancellor will not commit to reopen the energy bill support scheme or the alternative fuel payment scheme will the secretary of state do so 
 of course as a government we be look at the standing charge it be imperative that we do that and ofgem be work through that we have also give an unprecedented amount of support to household and non domestic organisation i reiterate that there be support at the moment we have the £ for the cost of living we also have the disability allowance and other allowance to give assurance i meet regularly with all stakeholder 
 what discussion she have have with national grid on its plan timetable for build new substation pylon and cable in the east of england 
 i frequently meet the network company to discuss their important work develop our electricity transmission network i have also be pleased to meet community and mps from east anglia to discuss concern about network infrastructure however as the decision maker for planning consent the department do not get involve in individual project 
 i feel move to find a clacton day why not 
 i have call for the old bradwell site on the dengie peninsula to be use for the arrival of undersea cable as oppose to wreck the environment of essex and other area with substation pylon and so on with the scrapping of high speed as an example do my hon friend agree that public body now need to do a well job of assess possible alternative instead of just barrel forward with boatload of taxpayer cash and destroy our beautiful countryside 
 i thank my hon friend for that question as he know from when we meet to discuss this in june the electricity system operator be responsible for plan the design and location of grid reinforcement while transmission owner develop individual project i understand that bradwell have be assess but be not deem appropriate for this project however i can not comment on specific project in order to avoid prejudice planning decision i would be very happy to meet my hon friend again to discuss this in further detail 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on support for worker in the offshore wind sector 
 this government be proud to have make the uk a global leader in offshore wind and the industry believe that uk job in the sector will rise from the current plus to plus by if of course conservative stewardship continue 
 job for whom that be the question we have already see the shameful situation of uk seafarer who work in the offshore wind sector be lay off to be replace by low wage exploit migrant labour as the sector develop as we see people go out to work on the turbine for long and as we see the building of float accommodation for they to stay on there be a huge risk that those worker not just those on the supply ship will also face exploitation will the minister work with cabinet colleague to ensure that the national minimum wage apply in the offshore sector beyond the mile territorial limit that be the solution to protect our worker and those from abroad from be exploit 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i share his enthusiasm for make sure that we continue the development of good well pay job and the development of the skill require to help people access those job and that we do not have exploitation onshore or offshore during that development it be a huge opportunity for the united kingdom and for scotland work together i be sure we can develop it 
 as we know from the excellent rampion wind farm in sussex bay hopefully it will soon be expand offshore wind farm support worker not just in energy production but in tourism fishing and leisure too this year we celebrate year of the protection of wrecks act it be estimate that there be more than wreck around the uk coast but only of they be list so will my right hon friend speak to his colleague in the department for culture media and sport about how we can co ordinate activity between new wind farm and marine archaeologist so that we can boost both our effort to combat climate change and our cultural protection which will give particular assistance to coastal community 
 as ever my hon friend put his finger on an important point exist asset such as wreck have so many us all of which need to be understand our sea look so large but they have multiple us for shipping defence and energy we be work to ensure that we have a strategic join up energy plan and a spatial strategy so that wreck marine protect area and other interest can all be protect in an integrated manner 
 what step her department be take to support people in shropshire with their energy bill 
 the government be continue to provide up to £ of cost of live support throughout to help vulnerable household which be an increase on the £ that we provide the previous year as well as targeted support such as £ through the warm home discount 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer farmer in my constituency and the neighbouring ludlow constituency be among the most productive in the united kingdom and speak as of the prime minister ’s trade envoy we be very proud of their contribution to british export at the moment they be rather adversely affect by rise energy cost what additional assistance will the government give to the agricultural sector to help this very important industry survive 
 my hon friend be a champion for shropshire and for the farming industry farmer in shropshire constituency and across the uk have already benefit from the energy bill relief scheme which end on   march   and provide more than £ of support 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 i wish to welcome faroese politician who be here watch today in the past year the energy bill support scheme alternative fund be set up to help household as the minister say early only about 150,000—141,000 in fact get the £ promise which mean that eligible household miss out on their £ with in bill payer now in energy debt will the government keep their promise and make good to those who miss out on that money when the scheme close in may 
 as i state the alternative fund be an incredible support and provide household with that support the government lend in to try to ensure that everyone who be entitle to the funding be able to receive it now that the scheme have close the money will return to his majesty ’s treasury 
 what step her department be take to help energy intensive industry to decarbonise 
 what step her department be take to help energy intensive industry to decarbonise 
 the government have commit £ to support early development of ccus carbon capture usage and storage and £ to the industrial energy transformation fund to help industry to decarbonise with phase expect to open for application in early 
 we be still wait for a lot of that to happen the tees valley host a huge number of energy intensive industry but we have lose many of they over the year a few year ago it be steelmaking but more recently we see the demise of the cleveland bridge engineering company at darlington which build the sydney harbour bridge the last ammonia manufacture plant in the country that of cf fertilisers close its door this year as do mitsubishi ’s cassel work with both cite that their energy cost be way high than those of their european and american competitor what be minister go to do to ensure that we do not have any more closure as a result of their policy failure 
 it be a shame that the hon gentleman could not find it within himself to congratulate mayor ben houchen on all the work he be do to bring steelmaking back to the tees valley for the time in a generation the government be engage with the steel industry on a sustainable future as announce on   september tata steel expect to invest £ include a uk government grant worth up to £ in a new electric arc furnace frankly the hon gentleman should start talk up the tees valley 
 sheffield have a proud history of steelmaking so much so that we be know globally as the steel city to this day steel support thousand of job in sheffield but repeat failure by this government   mean that more and more family be worried about the future of this key industry and the livelihood that depend on it will the minister commit to give this vital sector the support it need to decarbonise in a fair way while ensure that the industry have a green sustainable and prosperous future 
 i thank the hon lady for that question and yes i can give that commitment because we be already engage in that work we be work with company up and down the uk to ensure that they be able to decarbonise and deliver secure high wage high skilled job into the future which will be the backbone of this economy as we move forward 
 let i thank the government for the support they give for ccus and not least the acorn project in my constituency do my hon friend agree that ccus need to be develop across the uk at pace do he recognise the particular value of new ccus power station such as the plan project in peterhead in my constituency which will generate more than mw and in conjunction with the acorn project will do so emission free 
 yes i thank my hon friend and congratulate he on his relentless effort to decarbonise the north sea and the north east of scotland and his support for the acorn project i be pleased to join he and the prime minister at the announcement on that in the summer as my hon friend know ccus be a priority for this government and we be progress at pace power ccus will be a vital component of our route to net which be why we be commit to support at least power ccus plant by the mid-2020 
 the government be take significant step to support industrial cluster around the uk they be each at a different stage of development and much of the technology be emerge as we speak but the target be quite close and the scale of investment run into billion of pound what engagement be my hon friend undertake to discuss investment plan with individual business to ensure that they meet the target and use the late available technology 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right that investment be key to deliver our ambitious plan which be why the secretary of state be at the global investment summit yesterday work with the department for business and trade and the minister for investment we be engage with company on a daily basis inspect their investment plan to ensure they be fit for this country and the future and will deliver the ambitious world lead target we have set ourselves to decarbonise and provide the job of the future for this country 
 if she will make an estimate of the number of household that have energy efficiency measure instal in a and b 
 in measure be instal in around measure be instal in government scheme be aim at low cost easy to install measure in our funding scheme focus on high cost measure 
 upgrade home to energy performance certificate band c would create a huge economic and social boost to britain in my constituency of chester more than half of home be below epc c and almost of the housing stock be class as historic as it be build before what plan do the department have to upskill the workforce and speed up the roll out of energy efficient home include historic building such as the one in my constituency 
 the hon lady make a good point about upskille the workforce good progress have be make and around half of all home will now reach the government ’s ambition of epc c by compare with just in 
 whether she be take step to support the development of an offshore grid for wind farm energy in the east of england 
 grid reinforcement be critical to deliver our world lead offshore wind target the electricity system operator be responsible for design a modern grid that use a mix of upgrade exist line offshore transmission network and new underground and overhead line to bring this low cost homegrown generation to consumer 
 my constituent be angry about the ill think out proposal by national grid to impose mile of pylon and overhead powerline between norwich and tilbury will the minister share with i the house and my constituent what work he be do to ensure that the government do all they can to encourage national grid and developer to build an offshore grid that will provide more investment and growth in renewable and pull the plug on these awful pylon 
 as my right hon friend know i visit east anglia a few month ago and i plan to visit again i hear the frustration and the concern of her constituent which she have bring to the house today as she know the eso remain responsible for electricity network design offshore routing be more expensive and the cost would be bear by consumer across the country however we will continue to engage with the eso as it develop proposal that strike the balance of offshore and onshore infrastructure 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party who must have a great connection with the east of england 
 it come as a great relief that the minister be listen certainly to my constituent and his own there be extraordinary level   of cheap green scottish renewable energy transmit to large consumer in industrial basis in the south by the network this north south transaction should rightly be do by subsea transmission cable negate the need for onshore pylon and their attendant visual blight environmental degradation loss of productive farmland costly compulsory purchase and wayleave charge why be angus and other scottish community now threaten with a new kv pylon line instead of transmit that energy south use subsea method 
 i think there would have be well question time be a bit tight but please answer the question minister 
 the hon gentleman should probably direct that question to my scottish government counterpart who be in the same party as he he want to ride roughshod over the scottish planning system to allow for a fast deployment of this new energy infrastructure across scotland include in his and my own constituency the scottish government have control over planning the eso have control over develop those plan and 
 order let we come to topical question 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 since my last appearance at departmental question in september we have show that britain remain open for business through our announcement on ar6 we have take the next step towards gw of offshore wind energy we have announce £ of investment in advanced manufacturing for key net sector include offshore wind network carbon capture usage and storage hydrogen and nuclear we have set out the most radical plan to update the grid since the 1950s i have sign a memorandum of understanding with south korea to ensure close co operation on nuclear and offshore wind bring in £ as well 
 give the success of exempt the ceramics sector from the climate change levy and the risk of carbon leakage from offshore the industry will my right hon friend seriously consider exempt the ceramics sector from the emission trading scheme 
 i know that my hon friend be a long stand champion of the ceramics sector the sector receive free allocation under the ets reduce carbon price exposure and mitigate its risk of carbon leakage the government be review the free allocation policy and will consult this year to ensure that we effectively support at risk industry 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the world sorely need leadership at cop28 but the verdict of our most globally respect climate expert lord stern   early this month be damn he say that the government ’s backslide on climate action be a deeply damaging mistake”—damage for the uk the world and the future of we all will the secretary of state take this opportunity to place on record her response to lord stern 
 the right hon gentleman should understand that we have the most ambitious climate target of any of our international peer if he look at the delivery today he will see that we overshot on carbon budget and and we be on track to overshoot on carbon budget in fact the un gap report show just last week that between and the uk be expect to reduce emission at the fast rate of any of the g20 country 
 the secretary of state have no response to lord stern the problem be that he see a government preach thing and do another her negotiator at cop will argue to phase out fossil fuel but she want to drill every last drop at home and open new coalmine she will tell develop country that climate action be good for the economy but the government use climate delay to divide people here at home do she not realise that climate hypocrisy   just trash our reputation and undermine our   leadership 
 i completely reject that characterisation at cop28 we will be talk about the uk ’s leadership when it come to cut emission we have cut emission more than any of our international peer by even if we look forward to our target for we see that we will still be cut emission by more than any of our international peer that be something that the right hon gentleman would do well to welcome 
 paragraph of the national policy framework statement en-3 state that new solar farm should avoid the use of 
 good and most versatile agricultural land where possible 
 use the designation of the agricultural land classification but there be concern that field survey can artificially downgrade land will my right hon friend say that both she and the planning inspectorate will be vigilant in protect well and most versatile land and in ensure the integrity of land classification 
 i thank my hon friend for all his work champion both this area and the concern of his constituent as he rightly say plan policy and guidance encourage large solar project to locate on previously developed or low value land and we will indeed undertake to be vigilant in ensure that those principle be respect 
 give the uk ’s decline under this government to place behind the us and germany in attract green investment as per ernst and young ’s analysis what urgent step be the secretary of state take to boost our competitiveness in green industry 
 the hypocrisy and the ignorance come from the labour party be extraordinary we have decarbonise more than any major economy on this earth and we will decarbonise more to and we be do it by unlock a level of investment into renewable energy double that we have see in the united states so labour can take its selective fact and put they where the sun do n’t shine 
 i think that we have have a few problem with language already i be sure the minister will think carefully before he answer again 
 what plan do the uk government have to buy the wylfa site and associate intellectual property from horizon to expedite gigawatt development at wylfa in my constituency of ynys môn will the nuclear roadmap lie out a clear role for large gigawatt scale nuclear project like wylfa after sizewell c 
 it would not be energy question without a question on wylfa from my hon friend who be such a champion for that technology and for her constituency we all agree that wylfa be a great candidate for new nuclear and of several potential site that could host new projects—[interruption ignore the luddite on the snp benches as a step towards a new national policy statement the government will consult later this year on a way forward to determine how new nuclear development might be locate 
 in energy rich scotland roughly in household in my constituency be live in fuel poverty a properly design social tariff would at least alleviate some of that poverty why have the government break their promise of a year ago to consult on a social tariff 
 as my right hon friend the secretary of state indicate early a social tariff can mean different thing to different people we be consult supplier and many stakeholder to ensure that what we be do be the right thing we be also look at flexibility around the warm home discount 
 in february the minister for energy security and net assure i from the dispatch box that a decision on hydrogen blending be come soon month later in september the department ’s consultation again promise that a decision would come soon how can our constituent trust that this government know what they be do when they keep dither over prove technology that would cut our carbon emission our constituent energy bill and our dependence on foreign gas import 
 the government aim to reach a strategic policy decision before the end of the year on whether to support blending of up to hydrogen by volume into the gb gas distribution network we be build the evidence to determine whether blending offer strategic and economic value and meet the require safety standard 
 on the subject of fact my hon friend the member for southampton test dr whitehead just say that there be currently planning application in the pipeline for onshore wind in england can the minister please confirm whether that be true 
 as i have say in early answer we be seek to encourage more application as far as i know   the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead   may be right which be exactly why we be consult on improve community benefit and have consult on change the planning system 
 i welcome the fact that the uk be do more offshore wind than any other country in europe but fisherman in leigh on sea be deeply concerned about the effect of expand offshore on fish stock can the minister assure i that renewable power production on the south essex coast will also focus on tidal and will he join my vision to make southend pier a shin beacon of renewable completely power by tidal energy 
 i share my hon friend ’s enthusiasm for tidal we have have a specific pot in previous round of the cfd precisely to develop that we be the world leader in deployment and will continue to be and i hope that her vision for her local area will be fulfil 
 over the past year the north east have see a dramatic collapse in   the number of home be upgrade through the government ’s sustainable warmth and eco scheme that poor record be cost household in my constituency dearly what be the minister go to do to put it right 
 i have previously answer question on that and indicate that we have commit to make sure that we eradicate fuel poverty and support all people with their energy bill 
 with organisation such as the dalton nuclear institute and the university of bolton institute for materials research and innovation combine with the greater manchester vision for atom valley will my hon friend update the house on the part that it will play in britain ’s nuclear future 
 i thank my hon friend for his continued support for this grow and important sector alongside the work of the nuclear skill taskforce we be currently in phase b of our advanced modular reactor research development and demonstration programme we aim to demonstrate that technology by the 2030s to decarbonise industry and we welcome his support in that work 
 as part of the recent float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme ambitious and comprehensive bid for funding to support development by major industry player on the tyne be unsuccessful will the minister meet i and those key tyne business to discuss what further opportunity the department can bring to mobilise the high quality asset of our great river 
 the government be collaborate with industry to identify solution to unblock barrier to offshore wind deployment i know that the uk infrastructure bank be provide support to the port of tyne the flowmis project be currently live so i can not comment on it but i would be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss these issue 
 my right hon friend the secretary of state have make a lot of progress in try to bring together a holistic network but it be too late for community in suffolk norfolk and essex in that regard will she request that the electricity system operator publish its survey of the bradwell site and that it undertake a fresh with a full cost benefit analysis as a pilot for future connection 
 as my right hon friend know the eso have conduct an investigation into bradwell and its suitability but i be happy to meet she again to discuss bradwell the location of future project and how we might work together to ensure that her constituent see the benefit of any future energy infrastructure build in that part of the country 
 it now seem clear that the fund that the government plan to commit to loss and damage at cop28 will come from the uk ’s exist climate finance commitment we can not tackle the climate crisis by rob peter to pay paul give that a properly resource and operational loss and damage finance fund have to be a litmus test of success will the minister commit to look at new and additional form of funding include a permanent windfall tax on fossil fuel company and a tax on high emission travel to deliver new finance and make polluter pay 
 the hon lady be right to highlight loss and damage as we approach cop28 we be pleased to play our part on the transitional committee in get a recommendation to cop and we look forward to its be operationalise in the near future i agree with she that if we be to get the scale of finance that be require particularly for the most vulnerable country at the front end we need to look at innovative way of add to that finance 
 wind energy project have a standard compensation scheme for all local community but solar project do not industry will not act so i urge my right hon friend the secretary of state to bring in a standard measure for all solar project to bring fairness to clean energy in our community 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for pursue this matter assiduously we have meet and discuss it among other issue i think both industry and community would appreciate great clarity about community benefit and i look forward to discuss that with she far 
 in household in my constituency be now live in fuel poverty compare with the national average of in why do the government continue to give million   to gas and oil giant which enjoy billion in bumper profit while our constituent continue to be drag into poverty 
 regrettably the content of so many opposition member question this morning be absolutely not in line with reality oil and gas production in the uk not only typically have low emission than the alternative of import but support job all of which would be at risk if the labour party come to power to answer the hon gentleman ’s specific question it be expect to raise £ of tax over the next year all of which include the safety of his constituent would be at risk if labour ever come to power 
 do my right hon friend the secretary of state and the minister for nuclear and networks my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie agree that the very good location for mw rolls royce small modular reactor be next to sellafield which will use some of the power and be a centre of nuclear excellence 
 my hon friend be another great champion for nuclear it give i great pleasure to visit her constituency just a few week ago to see the great work be do at sellafield as we have set out we aim to deploy up to gw of nuclear energy by and we remain open to all available technology that will deliver it we be develop a new national policy statement that will provide the planning framework for new nuclear power beyond we be consult on a propose way forward for determine how new nuclear development might be locate 
 include in lancashire 
 this year receipt from the emission trading scheme will reach a new peak of £ the effect of attack on energy intensive industry be feel by worker in the aluminium and steel industry and this week by worker at grangemouth where of our few remain oil refinery be go to close despite what the minister say early be it not a fact that rather than help energy intensive industry net policy be destroy they and send they overseas 
 the right hon gentleman will be aware that the eu have already legislate for a carbon border adjustment mechanism follow our hosting of cop26 of global wealth be cover by net pledge at the beginning of that conference the figure be just the right hon gentleman may not see it but this be the direction the world be go in and if he want to future proof british job he will get with the decarbonisation programme oppose it be to oppose the interest of his constituent and the sustainability of their of their job 
 melton clp have of the big site in hyndburn and haslingden the renewable obligation certificate be due to end in and certainty be need on whether the scheme will be   extend or another scheme will take its place will the minister give we some assurance as to what come next 
 mindful of how loquacious i be i simply say to my hon friend that i will meet she to discuss the matter 
 over the space of a year live in a cold home cost of my constituent their life reason behind that tragic   figure be that home in rural community be more difficult to insulate on that basis will the minister urgently review the eco4 and eco+ guideline to prioritise the hard property to insulate so that we cut bill and save life 
 of course it be always a tragedy to hear such figure i have regular meeting with the hon gentleman and i will have a meeting to discuss this issue far because this government be commit to support all vulnerable people include all those who have disability and additional need 
 nomination close at noon for the election of the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee nomination have be receive a ballot will therefore not be hold for this position i congratulate sir robert buckland on his election as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee he will take up his post immediately and serve as chair until the end of this parliament 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence to make a statement on the war in ukraine 
 since i last update the house on   october the situation on the ground have remain largely unchanged the armed force of ukraine continue to make slow but steady progress in their fight to retake their country while a small crossing of the dnipro have be establish russian force have make small advance in the northern axis of a pincer movement with which they be attempt to surround the town of avdiivka 
 over the weekend russia launch what be likely the large wave of way attack drone strike on ukraine of the war so far ahead of another likely winter campaign of strike against ukrainian energy infrastructure ukraine neutralise most of the incoming weapon from the late assault and international partner include the uk be work with ukraine to far strengthen its defence 
 we will continue to support priority area for ukraine in the come month include air defence and harden critical national infrastructure site our foundational supply of critical artillery ammunition continue we also continue to develop ukraine ’s maritime capability help it to deny russia sea control in the western black sea with government help a uk base commercial insurance provider have develop an insurance facility for shipping use the ukraine maritime corridor the facility charge premium in line with those under the black sea grain initiative which be crucial for re attract commercial shipping 
 the uk have commit £ of military support to date as we continue to donate significant amount of ammunition and matériel from our own stock as well as those purchase from across the globe in addition we have train more than soldier since our support for next year be be finalise both internally within the government and with our partner around the world and will be announce shortly 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 early on saturday morning siren sound across kyiv for hour family take to shelter and fear spread across the city that day drone be launch on kyiv the big strike on ukraine since putin ’s brutal illegal invasion begin as the minister say with attention on the middle east this be a wake up call about russia putin can still unleash fresh horror on ukraine still show contempt for international law and still want to redraw sovereign boundary by force and day on ukrainians be live with fear every day fight every day and die every day the defence of the uk start in ukraine because   if putin prevail he will not stop with ukraine i pay tribute to the uk troop who be train ukrainian force fly out military aid and reinforce regional security through nato 
 last month the defence secretary say 
 let ’s not forget about ukraine 
 so why do the autumn statement do just that there be no military funding or action plan for ukraine at the very time when ukraine need confidence that it have strong continue support from ally the prime minister be step back uk leadership on ukraine be flag this year ’s £ of uk military funding run out in march while this month germany announce € of military aid for next year when will the defence secretary himself make a statement on ukraine when will ministers announce the next delivery of uk weapon when will the government pledge funding for fresh military aid and publish a action plan for the military economic and diplomatic support that ukraine need when will the prime minister demonstrate by his decision and action that britain will stand with ukraine for as long as it take to win 
 i do not think there be any doubt in kyiv in fact i know there be no doubt about the uk ’s continue support and indeed its leadership on gift within the international community while i appreciate that the right hon gentleman be keen to make a political point i think that deep down he know that too because he speak to the ukrainians i know as he do that they continue to regard the uk as the standard bearer globally for encourage other to donate ever more and crucially to donate weapon system with ever more complexity i have no doubt as i think deep down the right hon gentleman have no doubt that the ukrainian government maintain their confidence in we as of their key ally if not their key ally and that the uk ’s leadership be certainly not flag 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the announcement of weapon the reality be that we be give a very broad range of weapon while he might think it be militarily sound to focus on always give something new just be resilient in our ability to keep give what we be give be every bit as important to the operational planning that the ukrainian armed force need to do this be not a set of gimmick a set of announcement this be about the resourcing of a military operational plan that uk military operational planner be key in develop with the ukrainians i be entirely comfortable that across a whole range of weapon system the pipeline that we now have in place to deliver every month not only from our own stockpile and manufacturing capacity but from those that we can access globally be a reliable dependable part of the ukrainian plan 
 as for the plan for next year i completely accept that the right hon gentleman be right to say that a number could have be give in the autumn statement but surely it be more important to give a number that reflect the discussion that the chairman of the joint chief the chief of the defence staff and general zaluzhny have have and those that senior us uk and ukrainian politician have have in order to understand the ukrainian ambition for their operation next year so that we can resource that properly all the way through what the uk have do well than anyone else in the world be understand what the ukrainians want to do next and get there in deliver that capability in so do embolden other to follow as soon as the plan for next year be confirm i be certain that the amount   that it will cost will be announce to parliament and the plan firm up so that the right hon gentleman will be satisfied 
 that be an intriguing rationale for the fact that we give £ for the year of the war and £ for the year of the war can the minister convey to his colleague in government that member on both side of the house would be dismay if we give less than £ for the year ahead in his discussion with the chancellor might the defence secretary remind he that when he stand for the leadership of the conservative party he recommend not but of gdp to be spend on defence 
 i certainly can 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 at the weekend the ukrainian government and people commemorate the holodomor the genocide inspire by the government of joseph stalin during those celebration as the minister rightly say the russian federation launch its large air attack on kyiv to date which include iranian make shahed towards the capital part of the financing of the iranian regime come from the islamic revolutionary guard corps back in january ministers intimate to the house and to members that they be consider proscribe the revolutionary guard a financer of the iranian regime that be feed the russian federation ’s military might when will the minister ’s government stop consider and start proscribe it 
 these be not conversation to which i be directly privy so i be loth to offer detail that i do not have suffice it to say that the debate be more nuanced than the hon gentleman imply in his question but i suspect he know that when we proscribe an organisation such as the irgc which be so integral to the iranian state we can make it quite hard to have any sort of communication with the iranian state but those be matter for colleague in the foreign office i will bring his question to their attention and encourage they to write to he or seek to respond in some other way 
 i very much welcome my right hon friend ’s comment about insurance for shipping in the black sea to encourage grain export can i ask he if the british government intend to carry on do everything they can to make sure that those export happen he will be aware that lebanon rely on those grain export and with the current situation in that region we must ensure that starvation do not become another factor in an already exceptionally tense situation 
 there be lot in my right hon friend ’s question on all of which he be entirely right many country around the world be dependent on grain export from ukraine it be a source of constant frustration to i and government colleague who go overseas on diplomatic mission to find that the russians try to claim that somehow ukraine be use food as a weapon of war when it be they who be seek to limit those crucial export secondly the more that ukraine   be able to export the more that the ukrainian economy survive and potentially grow consequence of the insurance initiative alongside the military success or the naval success that the ukrainians have have in the western black sea be that ship from odesa be grow which be encouraging it be a sign that the new front in the black sea be succeed not only militarily but economically 
 in august the defence secretary ’s predecessor   the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace promise a action plan for ukraine but that be still nowhere to be see with just over a month leave in surely the uk must provide our friend in ukraine with the long term certainty of uk military support to repel russia ’s illegal invasion which be so important to ukrainian friend and family in feltham and heston and across the country will the minister explain why this action plan have not be publish and when there will be for 
 the former defence secretary be a great man the opposition front bench team have rightly seek to hold the government to account for his commitment to an action plan but i would reflect personally in a rare moment of slight disagreement with he that the masterplan for ukraine next year be the ukrainians plan for next year and we as their key lead supporter have a duty to resource their plan understand what that plan be and resource it both through straight cash in year as well as commitment over to year thereafter be all thing we undoubtedly need to do i think there be complete agreement in the house on that i understand the disappointment that the commitment be not make in the autumn statement but for the uk to publish ukraine ’s plan would clearly be the wrong way of do thing we need to understand what ukraine ’s plan be and then announce how we will resource it and we will do so 
 ukraine be hold firm against of the big military in the world and it still rightly refuse to see the mass loss of ukrainian life will my right hon friend reassure i on the follow point as there be report that we be already see a reduction in artillery delivery to ukraine be enough get through secondly follow medvedev ’s threat to poland what be we do to make sure our ally such as canada meet their of gdp commitment to nato as we need they to stay in the fight and protect that eastern flank 
 on the point enough be what there be part of military planning be to moderate consumption level to meet the scale of delivery ukraine ’s military planning must reflect manufacturing capacity and stockpile across the donor community enough be get through but we will not find a single ukrainian general who would not want time that amount if it be available on the point my hon friend be absolutely right we must ensure that the donor community remain foursquare behind ukraine in all probability the plan for next year will need to be more around consolidation than the plan for this year but it be very important that those in the donor community see whatever consolidation be necessary as the right military strategic   judgment and still worthy of maintain donor support rather than peel away because it do not feel as sensational as plan in previous year 
 the previous defence secretary   the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace   be well think of for the support he demonstrate for ukraine and in september last year he tell the house that the government have write letter of comfort to industry outline the government ’s intention to place order with manufacturer in last year ’s autumn statement the treasury announce £ for the replacement of the uk stockpile to be fund from the treasury reserve rather than the mod procurement budget where do the minister think industry ukrainians and british service personnel should look for comfort give the silence in the autumn statement on the subject of continued uk support for ukraine 
 i suspect the line of the hon gentleman ’s question would make it into the leaflet of my right hon friend   the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace   if he be stand again as that be rare but much deserve praise i be not sure i understand the rest of the hon gentleman ’s question the ukrainians know what they be get this year and they have see time and again the uk seek to lead the world and catalyse donation we have be the to go through every capability threshold they know that and they continue to know that 
 uk service personnel will take comfort from the fact that in the autumn statement the chancellor promise to maintain the commitment we be actually comfortably exceed that and that the complete modernisation and recapitalisation of the fight echelon across all service be well under way with investment too in sort out all the strategic enabler that bring credibility to our warfighting force i do not see where any further comfort be need either on the ukrainian side or for the man and woman of the uk armed force in fact it be quite the reverse i think they know exactly what the government be do 
 will the minister assure the house that political resolve in nato will remain as strong as ever in the event that this campaign become endure protracted and attritional will he also assure the house about what be be do to ensure that all nato country step up and pay their 
 nato ’s resolve be clear but its part in this be to deter escalation beyond ukraine whereas the donor community that have form around ukraine be a rather separate entity that extend beyond nato ’s border that be an important distinction my hon friend be absolutely right that as we prepare for a summit in washington at which our american colleague will want to see progress in meet the nato commitment all nato country that be not meet the commitment will perhaps want to consider their spending plan before get on the plane to washington 
 how be it possible that our nato ally turkey have see a more than threefold increase in export to russia this year of good vital for putin ’s war machine and what be the minister and our nato ally go to do about that 
 i be not familiar with that detail and will have to write to the right hon gentleman on it 
 you mr speaker and the minister will know that strength that the government and people of ukraine have get from this place both with their president ’s visit and the visit of member of parliament be the cross party consensus on uk support for ukraine do the minister agree that it be concern unless i have get this wrong that today the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey perhaps for the time slip into party political fighting over this i have a great deal of respect for the right hon gentleman and hope that will not be the case as we get near to the election because of the strength offer by this place through the cross party consensus for support for the ukrainian effort against russia ’s illegal invasion 
 the right hon gentleman the shadow defence secretary have a job to do and it have be a feature and a great strength of the uk response that it have be largely non partisan i think the right hon gentleman see an opportunity through the omission in the autumn statement but i hope in my initial answer i be able to explain to he why understand the ukrainian plan must come and announce what the uk will do to support that plan necessarily come 
 there be a benefit to have these regular session and there be of course the opportunity for more regular ministerial statement rather than just urgent question i encourage the minister to think about that in the future he will remember that on the last occasion i raise the issue of lethargy and concern that event in the middle east could be a distraction from support for ukraine and i question some of the political dynamic evident in the us system on this occasion i want to invert that question and ask if he have assess the impact of the ongoing issue in the middle east and their consequence for country such as iran and their support for russia and whether that might present an opportunity for ukraine 
 i must be careful not to stray into intelligence matter but my sense be that it would be overoptimistic to think that raise tension in the middle east might lead to a reduction in iranian support for russia i think that support be now well embed on the other side of the formula as the hon gentleman imply in the part of his question there be of course a concern that the wide donor community might be distract by what be go on in the middle east and it be important to take moment like this to reassure ukrainians and remind friend and partner around the world that we must remain steadfast in our support of ukraine even while we all work together to deter escalation in the middle east 
 effective military support to ukraine be more than just about provide weapon it be also about stop russia produce and get its own weapon   the right hon member for exeter mr bradshaw   ask about this in   relation to turkey but i would broaden the question be the minister aware of western technology be source by russia and do he think we be do enough to stop it 
 i be certainly aware that there be an alarming level of content from the west in a number of russian system that be compromise in the early part of the war that lead to further point there be the reassurance that if we be constrain our supply chain to russia which the sanction regime largely be albeit not completely and we need to work on that its capacity to develop complex weapon be diminish secondly that also suggest that russian industry do not have the ability to do these thing itself 
 it do seem now as if this war will be much long than we have all hop in that context political leadership will change while it be important that nato maintain its present position nato leadership may change over time what step can be take include by our ministry of defence to make the case across the world that the defence of ukraine be in the global interest not simply the ukrainian national interest 
 the uk have be make that case from the outset the stated aim of the uk government have be that russia must fail in ukraine and be see to fail that be because that be the right moral outcome for ukraine it deserve to restore its territory and live as a free sovereign country and secondly because if putin do not fail in ukraine he will be embolden to go again and again euro atlantic security over the next to year would be profoundly affect as a consequence 
 with much of the medium and world now focus on the ongoing conflict in the middle east do my right hon friend agree that we must not lose sight of the ongoing suffering of ukrainians at home and on the battlefield 
 i absolutely agree we certainly be not allow it to become a sum thing where we focus only on the middle east or on ukraine we can do both and the western balkans and everywhere else where the uk ’s interest be challenge 
 it be clear that despite heroic effort by the ukrainian people at good a military stalemate will be achieve what be the minister ’s estimate of the civilian and military casualty on both side of this conflict to date what be the prospect of negotiation to bring the bloodletting to an end 
 i will need to write to the hon gentleman with estimate on both side the number i have in my mind on the russian side be dead and wound but clearly there will be ukrainian casualty as well and those be number be military not civilian i will do my good to respond on that 
 i be not sure that i accept the hon gentleman ’s assessment that there be an inevitability to stalemate the effort require to maintain the current apparent stalemate on land in the black sea thing be still   quite dynamic be incredible it be not an inevitable consequence but the consequence of an extraordinary amount of effort on both side if side lose the strategic depth or patience to maintain that effort it be perfectly possible that a very different outcome will be achieve way or the other that be why it be important we be completely committed to maintain the current level of effort as the question from   the hon member for rochdale tony lloyd   point to we continue to make that case to friend and partner around the world so that the donor community remain strong because there be nothing inevitable about the outcome of this war 
 russia ’s financing of this illegal conflict be derive from international trade particularly the export of oil i have highlight how russia be circumvent the unprecedented sanction that have be introduce do my right hon friend agree that in this dynamic situation we need to be constantly alive to how international trade be make so that we can prevent and block the financing of this conflict will he agree to work with international partner in reassess what far need to be do 
 absolutely there be a military line of endeavour but so too there be a diplomatic and economic the minister for europe the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for aldershot leo docherty be on the front bench to hear my right hon friend ’s question my right hon friend be absolutely right to note the importance of advance on all front with equal vigour 
 the renew attack on kyiv at the weekend and the threat to power plant remind we how widespread the impact of the war be on ukraine could the minister update we on what recent talk he or ministerial colleague have have with ukrainian ministers about recovery and reconstruction can he give detail of what the uk be do to help now 
 the prime minister and other ministers include the defence secretary this mostly sit in other department meet the ukrainians all the time to discuss exactly that issue indeed the new foreign secretary be in kyiv only last week it be hugely important that alongside ukraine ’s military resilience its economy and democracy remain equally resilient and be not strangle out of existence which would undermine the existence of the state of ukraine just as much as any military failure in answer the previous question i note that it be important that we advance on all front that we support ukraine militarily and that we help ukraine to maintain resilience and even growth within its economy it be important globally that a key part of that economy the export of grain flow as freely as possible hence the amount of effort we be put into the western black sea 
 i thank my right hon friend for the work that he continue to do he mention the number of ukrainian military recruit we have be able to help with training in the uk can he say any more about that training how many recruit will we be able to assist in the come month 
 our aim be to maintain that pace for colleague who have have the opportunity to visit i know it be regard as of the moment of a lifetime to see the determination in the eye of those man who be train to go to war to train for or week in the absolute certainty that active combat wait immediately at the other end of that training pipeline focus the mind in an extraordinary way i pay tribute to they for their courage and heroism in volunteer to undergo the training but also to the brilliance of the uk and other nation armed force that be here in this country deliver that training all day every week of every month 
 i have always love the opportunity to put my support for ukraine and ukrainians on the record i appreciate that the minister be not the correct minister for this point but i can see that the immigration minister have arrive for the next urgent question we have be get a lot of casework about ukrainians find it difficult to get their biometric residence permit process in any meaningful time include who have be wait since july can the minister help with make representation to the home office to ensure that people can get those permit in swift time so that they can rebuild their life 
 i make those representation now 
 i welcome the continue work that my right hon friend and the whole government do to support our friend in ukraine 
 may i return to the question of grain export just a couple of day ago at a food security summit president zelensky be clear that he believe air defence be the missing link to secure those export do my right hon friend share that assessment if he do how can we help make those air defence a reality 
 air defence have be an important part of the ukrainian response to russia ’s belligerence from the very beginning air defence be necessary to protect critical national infrastructure the ukrainian frontline and port and other key economic infrastructure as well as the sea lane through which ship travel the reality be that we be do our good to source as much air defence globally as we can and we will continue to do so 
 a few of we who be member of the all party parliamentary group on the holy see visit the ukrainian catholic cathedral in mayfair this morning and visit the fantastic welcome centre that have provide so much support to ukrainians who have come here seek refuge and safety of the key message we hear i have hear this from constituent too be about the uncertainty they be face as the visa programme extend by the uk government be start to come to an end can the minister assure we that colleague be work across government to provide ukrainians with the certainty they desperately need that they will continue to be welcome here in the united kingdom and will not have to pay for the privilege of extend their visa 
 the home office will be seize of the need to provide as much certainty as it can indeed on friday i have the pleasure of visit the welcome hub in my constituency and meet ukrainian family who be ask i the same question as i explain to they i share this with the house now while i completely understand why they individually want as much certainty as possible it be also important that putin do not get to see all these country across europe that be host so many million of ukrainians between they offer they an opportunity to stay permanently the danger be that we would end up with ukraine lose million of its good people to economy around europe when ultimately we hope they will be able to go home to a free sovereign ukraine 
 i thank the minister very much for his determination and leadership which we all endorse ukraine have report territorial advance of km to km in the donetsk region which have be hard fought the cost have be in life and injury but the determination of ukrainians to retake their land from russia be as strong as ever what can the minister do to allocate more high grade military equipment to strike russia hard in its backyard 
 the uk be do a lot indeed it be do more than most and we have be the to go through every capability threshold although unfortunately it can not yet be discuss openly in public or even in the house the uk have also be able to use our ability to support the ukrainians in develop their own complex weapon that when the time come will be of the great story but it be of course something that we be do all the time 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on the publication of net migration figure 
 the most recent publish datum from the office for national statistics estimate that net migration in the year to june be at that place untold pressure on housing supply and public service and make successful integration virtually impossible as the prime minister and the home secretary have repeatedly make clear it be far too high the government remain committed to reduce level of legal migration in line with the manifesto commitment on which every single conservative mp stand in and the express wish of the british public as articulate at every single general election in the last year 
 early this year we take action to tackle an unforeseen and substantial rise in the number of student bring dependant into the uk to roughly that mean that begin with course start in january student on teach postgraduate course will no long have the ability to bring dependant only student on designate postgraduate research programme will be able to bring dependant that will have a tangible effect on net migration 
 it be crystal clear that we need to reduce the number significantly by bring forward further measure to control and reduce the number of people come here and separately to stop the abuse and exploitation of our visa system by company and individual so far this year we have initiate a significant number of investigation into sector such as care company suspect of breach immigration rule we be actively work across government on further substantive measure and will announce detail to the house as soon as possible 
 where be the home secretary and what on earth be go on the medium be brief that he be go to make a statement on net migration yesterday or today but we have have nothing and he be nowhere the immigration minister have be everywhere madly brief all his idea but who speak for the government 
 net migration figure be now time their level at the general election when the conservatives promise to reduce they that include a increase in work migration this year which reflect a complete failure by the conservatives on both the economy and immigration the immigration minister be complain today he will be furious when he discover who have be in charge of the immigration system for the last year 
 net migration should come down immigration be important for britain and always will be but the system need to be properly control and manage so that it be fair effective and properly link to the economy net migration for work have treble since because of the government ’s failure on skill and training their failure to tackle record level of long term sickness and people on waiting list and their failure to make the   system work social care visa have go from a year to more than a year yet this spring ministers halve the programme for recruit care worker here health visa be up yet minister cut training place last autumn visa for engineer be up while engineering apprenticeship completion in the uk have halve 
 will the government immediately agree to labour ’s plan to get rid of the unfair wage discount that mean employer can pay overseas recruit less than the go rate and which prevent training and fair pay in the uk will the government immediately ask the migration advisory committee to review salary threshold for skilled worker in shortage occupation which have not keep up and where the mac have warn repeatedly about low pay exploitation will the minister link the point base system to training and employment standard in the uk and have a proper plan for the economy and the immigration system 
 the government have no serious plan they be just ramp up the rhetoric they have no plan for the economy no plan for the immigration system and no plan for the country britain deserve well than this 
 i listen to the right hon lady for minute or so and detect absolutely no trace of a plan from she 
 order i be worried because i can only allow minute please do not go tell everybody that i have allow minute honestly it be only minute 
 i will keep that as a secret mr speaker 
 the only policy that the right hon lady articulate be something that be barely use and would have a de minimis effect on net migration but that should come as no surprise to any of we she have spend her entire political career campaigning for uncontrolled migration she have campaign for freedom of movement she back a leader of the opposition who campaign for freedom of movement she have always support and lobby and campaign for unfettered access to the united kingdom she say that there be chaos on the government side of the house but all we hear from she be rhetoric and posturing it would be laughable if it be not so serious 
 every single conservative member of parliament campaign on a manifesto commitment to bring down net migration i do not see that in the labour party ’s manifesto at the last election although she may be do what she be because she be read the poll or want to posture we be do it out of deep political conviction we believe that the number of people come into this country be too high that it place unbearable pressure on our public service and on housing and that it be make it impossible to integrate people into this country and harm community cohesion and national unity it be also a moral failure because it be leave people on welfare and enable company all too often to reach for the easy lever of foreign labour for all those reason we be determined to tackle this issue we understand the concern of the british public and i be here to say that we share they and will bring forward a serious package of fundamental reform to address the issue once and for all 
 i congratulate the shadow home secretary   the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper as it be clear from the idea she lay out that she have read the point in the new conservatives immigration plan she be more than willing to copy and paste just as the shadow chancellor would have she have the opportunity
