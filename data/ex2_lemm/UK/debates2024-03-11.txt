 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help increase the number of occupation for which apprenticeship be available 
 what step her department be take to help increase the number of occupation for which apprenticeship be available 
 i join you in your comment mr speaker my thought be with the family of tommy mcavoy 
 thank to this conservative government nearly of all occupation be accessible via an apprenticeship that be a far great reach than country admire for their technical education such as germany and switzerland i be sure that many member join the prime minister the chancellor and more than ministerial colleague out and about during national apprenticeship week i be delighted to join harry chloe and other edf energy apprentice off the coast of blyth as well as apprentice who be launch exciting career at j.p. morgan in the city apprenticeship be the route to a successful career no matter where apprentice live or what they want to do 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer last month the prime minister visit the harrogate bus company to view the new fleet of electric bus and to meet the company ’s apprentice could my right hon friend detail how the government will ensure that new apprenticeship route be available in fast develop sector of the economy such as digitisation and artificial intelligence or the sector that will deliver our decarbonisation pledge such as those new emission bus in harrogate and knaresborough 
 i thank my hon friend for his support at the recent parliamentary apprenticeship fair importantly our apprenticeship programme be future focused it include a new battery manufacture technician apprenticeship which will benefit electric bus and other include charge point installation and electric vehicle maintenance whether through t level high technical qualification or apprenticeship there be more training opportunity in industry of the future than ever before in everything from ai to net 
 i be most grateful to my right hon friend for those answer progress be be make though the feedback that i be receive be that the current math and english functional skill requirement be an obstacle   to a wide range of employer take on apprentice to remove that barrier will my right hon friend consider embed english and math element into the apprenticeship standard so that they be relevant to the job role and employer can be confident that apprentice be acquire the skill that they need to succeed 
 the institute for apprenticeships and technical education work closely with employer to ensure that all essential skill include english math and digital be embed into apprenticeship standard and it will continue to do so we be also increase funding by to help more apprentice achieve up to a level english or math qualification alongside their apprenticeship if they do not already hold to help they get on in work and in life 
 as someone who start his work life with on the job training at international computers limited a company that be now part of fujitsu but we will not mention that name in this house i very much support apprenticeship particularly at the high and advanced level that be require for occupation in information technology what be the secretary of state do to address the worrying fall in the number of apprenticeship start particularly to get kid into high and advanced level apprenticeship 
 i be sure that the hon gentleman will be delighted to learn that apprenticeship start be up by so far this year that be because apprenticeship be back by record investment of £ never before have a government invest so much into high quality apprenticeship and achieve so much in spread opportunity across the country 
 like the questioner and the secretary of state i be very keen to increase the number of occupation category have perhaps not be consider what discussion have she have with the department of enterprise trade and investment back home to ensure opportunity for new apprenticeship in farming and fishing 
 the hon gentleman put his finger on a very important point we work with employer in farming and fishing and we have a number of apprenticeship standard across those industry we be always happy to work with any industry that see an opportunity for more apprentice to be train in their industry 
 order before i call the question mr speaker would like i to convey to the house his apology for his unavoidable absence from question this afternoon as he have to attend the commonwealth service in westminster abbey which be about to start at any minute now 
 what assessment her department have make of the impact of funding decision on maintain school since 
 in school funding be £ next year it will be £ that be the high ever level in real term per pupil 
 recent figure show that the bad impact school in luton north have endure more than £ of real term cut since there be school roof with hole in bucket scatter across corridor collect rainwater and entire building hold up by scaffold those be the define image of year of conservative government year of budget cut and teaching staff expect to do more with less we need change child in luton north deserve well if the minister agree why will he not give child what they deserve 
 on the condition of school building the hon lady will know that there be £ worth of capital for maintain and improve school building on the broad question about school funding she might have be allude i be look for some visual recognition to figure put together by the national education union if so i have to tell she that we believe those figure to be flawed in multiple respect include in assumption they make about the money and the number of child in school in previous year i hope she will join i in celebrate the record resourcing rightly go in to educate child 
 i welcome the record real term funding flow into our school but will my right hon friend join i in look very carefully at the case for extend funding for tutoring it have raise attainment in particular for the most disadvantaged in many of our school and be see as a great success story when it be introduce it be intend to be a long term intervention may i urge the minister to continue to look at that and ensure we find money in addition to the pupil premium to support that noble aim 
 i absolutely agree that tutoring be important in multiple contexts in particular in the year since the pandemic it have play an essential part i will add that tutoring by undergraduate can help to introduce a wide range of people to the potential of a career in teaching i want tutor to continue as my hon friend rightly mention part of the function of the pupil premium be to make such intervention and it can be spend on they 
 a teacher in frome recently reach out and tell i that too few pupil be successful in their education health and care plan application without a plan and the accompany support for child ’s life chance they be diminish can the minister reassure my constituent that the government ’s plan to reform the ehcp will still ensure that child receive care that be personalise to their need and not a size fit all approach to cut cost 
 i absolutely and wholeheartedly agree with the hon lady on the central importance of that support and how vital it be to have it there be of course many more ehcp than there be statement under the old system with more child receive   support she will understand that i can not comment on the individual case she mention but i will mention the special educational need and disability and alternative provision improvement plan that we have in place 
 i welcome the substantial additional funding that have be give to maintain nursery school in my constituency but do the minister agree that it be vital for we to continue to increase funding for all barnet ’s school 
 as ever my right hon friend be a great champion and advocate for barnet ’s school and indeed for maintained nursery school which as she say play a unique role in our system in carry out those particular function 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last year the national audit office report that child be be teach in school need major rebuilding work on top of the problem cause by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete construction issue be emerge daily with block and beam flooring high alumina cement and asbestos all long past their shelf life up in north tyneside and down to luton and beyond year of conservative government have leave child learn under prop and in portacabin and shed give that this government ’s plan seem to be to leave it for the next labour government to sort out those problem can the minister at least inform we of the late estimate of the total school repair bill 
 keep our school estate in the right condition for optimally educate child be of the foremost importance since we have allocate £ to keep school safe and operational i pay tribute to everyone who have be involve in the most recent raac issue include the school and pupil who deal with it and my colleague who help to ensure that we reach this point all school have be tell what will happen next either they will receive a remediation grant or they will be part of the school rebuilding programme 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 our send and alternative provision improvement plan publish last march include the development of new national standard to improve provision in mainstream setting for child with special educational need as for child require special school place last week we announce funding for an additional wave of special free school which come on top of the that we have open since and the whose opening have be approve 
 i visit school in my constituency virtually every week and i see more and more of they struggle financially and in term of staff with the number of send pupil moreover too many staff   member be have to go out and fetch child to bring they to school in the morning and need to have social worker base in their school this be not about individual school it be a systemic problem what be the government do about it 
 in cambridgeshire there have be a increase in funding per head for special educational need since and a special free school be in the pipeline along with local authority special competition free school cambridgeshire be also part of our safety valve programme which help authority to run a sustainable special educational need system 
 i wonder whether my hon friend might be able to help my constituent ella wakley who be disabled and travel to her college on the bus but her blue badge do not allow free transport for she and her assistant until am which be a little late for the start of the school day 
 i do not know the specific of the case that my hon friend raise but if she write to i i will happily look at it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 high quality early year education can be transformational for child with special educational need help to ensure that they be identify and support at the most important time for their development but last year few than in local authority in england report have enough childcare place for disabled child that be a shameful failure be the minister confident that family with a disabled child will be able to access the childcare to which they be entitle from april 
 we be do thing in this regard we be review the special educational need inclusion fund as we roll out the new entitlement to ensure that it be work appropriately secondly we have provide a contractor local authority have a statutory duty to provide place for all child include those with special educational need and the contractor will work with local authority to ensure that be do 
 if she will issue statutory guidance on teach economic education in school as part of the pshe curriculum 
 it be essential that young people be equip to make important financial decision later in life my hon friend will recall our curriculum reform and the national curriculum for mathematic and secondary citizenship equip pupil with the essential knowledge understanding and practical skill need to manage their money 
 the minister be absolutely right to suggest that good financial education help people to avoid debt and poverty and to build up a saving cushion for a rainy day prevention be undoubtedly well than cure   yet while statutory guidance ensure that student learn about threat such as drug or unplanned pregnancy money and finance be more optional should they not be take as seriously as everything else 
 i agree with my hon friend there be relevant content in different part of the curriculum not only in mathematic which be statutory throughout key stage to but at secondary level in citizenship further element such as computing be particularly relevant to online fraud in relationship sex and health education some aspect of fraud be cover as be gamble but i absolutely agree that it be important to keep these thing under review 
 what recent discussion she have have with her counterpart in the devolved administration on the potential merit of provide additional financial support to student in the context of increase in the cost of living 
 the hon gentleman will know that high education be a devolved matter and that each administration be responsible for determine the student finance arrangement that apply to student eligible for funding 
 new datum reveal that in most area of england state school pupil who have receive free school meal have less than a in chance of enter high education reason for that be that poor student decide not to pursue that path because of the prospect of be saddle with huge debt which take decade to clear do the government believe that they should follow the scottish government ’s example and abolish tuition fee so that education can be make accessible to all 
 this government believe that we need to be fair not only to student but to taxpayer it be worth note that in england those from disadvantaged background be more likely to go to university than they be in we have put together a substantial package to help student with the cost of living include a £ welfare support fund which we give to the office for student to ensure that student with difficulty be help 
 i call the shadow minister 
 follow last year ’s increase the government have announce a paltry increase in maintenance loan this september with a compound inflation rate of that amount to a massive real term cut meanwhile the welsh government have announce a increase even in scotland there will be a £ special support loan for all student across the country student be be force into work multiple job to try to make end meet what have this government get against student 
 i be proud that we have a record number of student go to university i have already mention the fact that the disadvantaged be more likely to go to university than they be before i will tell the hon gentleman what we be do to help student we have a £ welfare fund that we give to the ofs we have increase loan by we have freeze tuition fee family across the country have be give on average £ to help with energy bill and other bill we have give hundred of million of pound to the household support fund to support all family student know that they can have their loan reassess if their family income fall by and finally we have introduce degree apprenticeship so that student do not need to take out a loan but can earn while they learn and get a good skilled job at the end 
 whether she be take step to help improve the morale of teacher and school support staff 
 support teacher wellbee be crucial to our commitment to a supportive culture in school and for encourage teacher retention that be why we co create the education staff wellbee charter with the education sector and we have invest over £ in school leader mental health and wellbeing support 
 be the truth not that retention be down recruitment be down and early retirement be up what be the minister go to do to boost the morale of teacher they say to i would not it be wonderful to have a cabinet who have be through a state sector education and send their child to state school 
 i think the hon gentleman need to do some research before he start ask question in parliament on recruitment and retention i join he in stress the importance of retention which we be absolutely focused on include through our workload programme we have a good set of scholarship and bursary for encourage entry and a range of different route into teaching to get the full range of talent that can benefit our child and young people 
 would my right hon friend agree that good and enthusiastic teacher be vital to ensure that we have good successful school and pupil what more can be do to assist school with discipline and truancy issue because it would obviously help teacher morale if they could have some more support 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of brilliant teacher i think he might have some personal experience of that he be also right about the central importance of behaviour in relation to retention we hear back in survey that we need to improve far on this this be of the reason that we have the network of behaviour hub so that school can learn from another about what work well 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 morale among teacher and support staff be affect by their pay and working condition and now the teacher be be threaten with minimum service level which would limit their fundamental right to strike surely the minister can recognise that this course of action will lower morale far and ultimately impact the recruitment and retention of teach staff 
 nobody be talk about take away the right to strike all that we be seek to do be balance that right which we absolutely recognise and protect with the right of a child to have an education 
 what step she be take to increase the provision of special educational need place in essex 
 i be pleased to inform the house that new special school open in essex last year with another in the pipeline we have also provide £ of capital funding to essex over the last year to create more place for child with special educational need or who require alternative provision 
 last july stand here i launch the campaign for a new special need school in south essex in february this year work closely with essex county council which i commend for its effort we be able to announce a consultation to build a brand new special need school in rayleigh for plus pupil a through school for year to to open in the academic year it have go down very well locally but the concern be that at the moment it be plus pupil and give the great demand for place a lot of people would prefer something near be there any way perhaps with a little help from the department that we might be able to achieve that too 
 my right hon friend be run an excellent campaign and we be impressed with the speed with which essex have move to consultation i can not pre empt the department ’s decision but what we have hear so far suggest that a very strong case will be put to the department we be also about to allocate the remain £ of capital funding for special educational need school from which essex will of course benefit 
 what progress her department have make on ensure that more school achieve good and outstanding rating by ofsted 
 under the last labour government only of school be rat good or outstanding let down a generation of child thank to this conservative government that number now stand at nearly in the last year alone more child now attend good or outstanding school and i be delighted that this now include the lord derby academy in knowsley which   i visit last week our plan to give every child a world class education be work labour have no plan remember that it have twice stand on a manifesto to abolish ofsted it be clear that every time labour get into power child ’s education suffer 
 out of of the school in my constituency be good or outstanding reflect this government ’s commitment to high standard and the incredible hard work of the staff and the school leadership but special school have struggle to achieve the same in my constituency how be my right hon friend help they to get to where we want they to be where they can all be good or outstanding 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right that basingstoke ’s school have be transform over the past decade up from just rat good or outstanding under labour we have recently bring in of our strong specialist multi academy trust to drive improvement in special school solent academies trust be now responsible for dove house school and chiltern way academy trust will shortly be take over local underperforming special and alternative provision school of which will receive significant capital investment from the department to support the education of vulnerable child 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the number of level and apprenticeship start since the apprenticeship levy be introduce 
 per cent of all apprenticeship start so far this year have be at level and with level remain the most popular level account for of all start over apprenticeship standard be at level and cover more than half of all apprenticeship 
 i can understand why the minister do not refer to the trend because he know that level apprenticeship be way down the government ’s reform have see level apprenticeship start fall by third since and the number of people employ on an apprenticeship with a small and medium sized enterprise have fall by since the levy ’s introduction the minister talk powerfully about apprenticeship but why do he think that young people be now half as likely to be on an sme apprenticeship than they be when the levy be introduce 
 i hugely respect the hon gentleman i know he be a bruiser but i have be look forward to his question i think he would celebrate the apprentice in chesterfield since may the apprentice at level and or the £ investment in chesterfield college.[official report   march vol c. 11mc correction if i be he i would be urge his party to stop its plan to destroy the apprenticeship levy which would halve the number of apprenticeship start overall it would be back to square 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be not just that level and apprenticeship start have   plummet by over since the levy be introduce but that to year old apprenticeship start be down by research by the sutton trust and the london school of economics far show that by the proportion of apprenticeship start by those from poor background have drop significantly opportunity for all our young people to earn and learn expand every year under labour be it not now painfully clear that the big barrier to opportunity be this tory government 
 as always labour front benchers be obsess with quantity over quality we have transform the quality of apprenticeship per cent of occupation be cover by over apprenticeship standards.[official report   march vol c. 11mc correction there have be a increase since this time last year in the number of under-19 start and overall start be up by over the same period the crucial thing be achievement which be up by female stem start be up by start by people with disability be up by and start by people from ethnic minority be up to of start compare with in not only be we focus on quality over quantity we be improve the number of start and achievement too 
 what step she be take to increase childcare provision 
 we be remove of the big barrier for work parent by vastly increase the amount of free childcare that work family can access by we expect to spend more than £ every year on free hour in early education double what we be spend now to help work family with their childcare cost 
 my constituent diane bennett who run a small group of very popular local nursery tell i how appreciative she be of the government ’s plan for childcare and early education particularly the £ of additional funding that have be secure clearly as she and other nursery provider look ahead she be concerned that although the government have a clear plan there be no clear plan come from the opposition can my hon friend set her mind at rest 
 my hon friend be right last week the chancellor announce that we will be increase rate until the end of for early year provider which be something they have ask for i can not give my hon friend any reassurance about labour ’s plan because it have no plan the shadow secretary of state say that childcare be her top priority yet she have no plan for it what do that say parent should be very worried about labour get into power both for the childcare on which they rely and for every other area of education 
 family right across my constituency be find it increasingly hard to access affordable childcare locally from speak to provider last week it be clear to i that the current level and structure of free hour funding even   with the government ’s recent announcement be not go to go far enough to allow these provider to expand give the capacity and staffing cost that would entail what reassurance can the minister offer family in my area that finally the government be go to get on top of the childcare crisis we be face and make sure that family in my constituency will not have to go without 
 we set our rate base on a survey of more than provider in order to get those right last year we see a increase in the number of staff in the sector and a increase in the number of place we work with every local authority to make sure that they have sufficient place and i be confident that the hon gentleman ’s area will have that too 
 gloucestershire county council care about our childcare business and listen to my call to make sure that monthly payment be go to childminder as we have hear the chancellor be put in another slug of money—£500 but local childminder be tell i that thing such as the propose date of payment mean that they be still out of pocket and still can not pay their staff therefore all the work be not be feel on the ground will the minister meet gcc and i to iron out some of these mechanical issue at local authority level so that everybody can benefit from what the government be do 
 i thank my hon friend for continue to champion this sector she be absolutely right about the importance of pay on a monthly basis which we encourage all local authority to do we will be say more about that in the come week and i will be happy to meet she to discuss this far 
 the minister will be aware that private equity firm have be cause great damage in other part of the education sector such as child ’s home and special school but we be now start to see this in childcare oakley capital have acquire lilliput nursery in hersham and elmbridge and have hike up price by a staggering that be an additional £ per child per month which parent simply can not afford do he agree that it be quite wrong for private equity firm to be make these eye water profit on the back of hard work parent what be he go to do to stop this happen 
 the hon lady be right to raise the issue of profiteer that we have see in some area of child ’s care and social care we will be set out some step that we will be take on that shortly i do not know the specific of the case she have just reference but again if she write to i i will be happy to look at it 
 what progress her department have make on rebuild skelton primary school in cleveland 
 skelton primary school be announce in the round of the school rebuilding programme in july it be the school in a batch be deliver by the contractor   tilbury douglas we therefore expect construction work on this complete new build to begin in late summer and complete next year 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer which be reassure news because skelton primary be a very good school but it be in need of a comprehensive rebuild the headteacher mrs walker work through last summer in the expectation that the rebuild could begin as soon as this easter but that have not happen because the builder come back say that more money be require will my right hon friend assure i that that date of the end of the summer be now fix will it be possible for i to meet the civil service team in charge to discuss this with they far 
 i acknowledge all that my right hon friend say i can reassure he that the scope of work include all funding commit have be confirm on this new build however of course if it would be helpful to have a meeting i would be happy to do this 
 what step her department be take to encourage take up of degree level apprenticeship 
 i note that the labour front benchers do not mention the start on degree apprenticeship since their introduction in there be now more than employer design degree level apprenticeship available include in occupation such as doctor space engineer and midwife we be spend an additional £ in the next year to support provider to promote degree apprenticeship 
 business in my constituency regularly tell i that they much prefer apprentice and those who have take degree level apprenticeship to traditional graduate that come up time and again in a recent engagement event i hold with buckinghamshire business at ercol in princes risborough will my right hon friend tell i what more the government be go to do to send a clear signal to all pupil across the whole country that degree level apprenticeship be out there they should sign up for they and they will have fantastic career ahead of they 
 my hon friend be absolutely right he be a champion of the automotive and motorsport industry in his constituency he will be pleased to know that we now have ucas for apprenticeship which will transform the apprenticeship scheme when student apply for university or apprenticeship the apprenticeship skill and knowledge network go to thousand of school interact with many hundred of thousand of student as i mention we be spend £ to promote degree apprenticeship among provider we have strengthen legislation to ensure that school do more to promote apprenticeship and technical and vocational education 
 what step she be take to ensure school pupil be inform about apprenticeship opportunity 
 my hon friend be a champion of fe and skill he have ask a lot of question about the subject over the past month we want apprenticeship to be part of the career conversation in every school we have strengthen the law so that school must offer pupil at least education and training provider encounter we have invest £ in the apprenticeship skill and knowledge network which reach over school and college in 
 vandyke upper school in leighton buzzard which i visit last week tell every student about apprenticeship and have an excellent apprenticeship ambassador as the minister will know sadly not every school do this most teacher have be to university and they may not know about apprenticeship so what can we do to ensure that every school tell every student about apprenticeship as vandyke upper school do because they can be life transforming for the right student 
 my hon friend speak a lot of wisdom i congratulate vandyke upper school on its work i have be to apprenticeship fair and career day at the oasis academy in brislington huge amount of work be go on with the careers enterprise company and the apprenticeship ambassador network to ensure that there be a network member engage at every secondary school and college i have mention some of the other thing we be do to promote career and apprenticeship in all our school 
 what step she be take to promote post college opportunity to pupil with send 
 we know that with the right preparation and support the overwhelming majority of young people with send be capable of sustained and pay employment the national careers service offer young people with send age to tailor support from career adviser we be invest £ until to build capacity and support an internship programme we have also launch a mentoring pilot for disabled apprentice 
 homefield college base in mountsorrel and sileby in my constituency be a community base independent specialist college that offer education training and independent living skill for people with learn disability and communication difficulty what step be be take by the department to promote and support such excellent fe college and to help create opportunity for work experience life skill and development for student so that they may go on to live happy and fulfilling life as an integral part of their local community 
 i be pleased to visit loughborough not so long ago with my hon friend she be passionate about fe and skill i know homefield college well it be a brilliant college and i be glad it be recently allocate £ for capital spend we have the £ support internship scheme for those with special educational need an fe bursary scheme for special need teacher specialist national careers service advice for young people and the send code of practice to prepare young people for adulthood.[official report   march vol c. 12mc correction we be do everything possible to support fe for those with special educational need to ensure that they get on the ladder of opportunity 
 what step her department be take to help improve teaching and learn in school 
 great teaching be truly transformational in child ’s life thank to our brilliant teacher and the focus on high standard in the curriculum attendance and behaviour and year old in england be now the good in the world for read 
 we have see how child in english school be the good reader in the western world thank to this government in uxbridge and south ruislip we see how that work be be translate into outstanding or good ofsted rating will my right hon friend join i in congratulate the team at ruislip high school and the child ’s service team at hillingdon council on their recent outstanding rating and will he pledge to work with i to ensure that child across uxbridge and south ruislip have the good possible education 
 i join my hon friend in congratulate ruislip high school and hillingdon council ’s child ’s service team nearly of school in uxbridge and south ruislip be now rat good or outstanding by ofsted up from under in follow the great work of teacher and our relentless focus on improve school standard 
 what step she be take to help ensure the availability of high quality childcare for child with special educational need and disability 
 to ensure high quality childcare for child with special educational need we be invest hundred of million of pound to increase hourly funding rate and the amount of dedicated additional send funding such as the disability access fund for all eligible child and fund the training of early year special educational need co ordinator 
 to the surprise of no who look at what the government be propose my inbox like those of many other mp be full of email from parent who can not get the free hour in april without pay for a massive hike in their fee group in   particular that be struggle be parent of child with special educational need or a disability that be entirely predictable because the government ’s own impact assessment say explicitly that change the ratio could have a negative impact on the provision of place for child with special educational need 
 the minister stand at the dispatch box on   january   and pledge to i that every parent who want the free hour for their eligible year old would be able to get a place can he restate that pledge today explicitly for parent of child who have special educational need and pledge that they will not have to pay a high fee yes or no 
 i appreciate that it must be very frustrating for the hon lady who genuinely care about childcare to be in a party that can not be bother to come up with a plan for it and have have to ask someone else to write it because it can not think of on her specific issue as i say we be work with every local authority to ensure that they have the place that they need for all child 
 whether her department be take step to ensure that initial teacher training course include early identification of autism 
 the department for education recently review the mandatory initial teacher train core content framework alongside the early career framework particular attention be give to the need of trainee and early career teacher when support pupil with special educational need 
 that be a very useful response for which i be very grateful i recently bring my minute rule bill to the house which be specifically about mandate autism training in the initial teacher training framework because we all know that early identification be vital if education staff all have autism training right from the start we could put in place a system so that autistic child receive support very early on in their school career will the minister assure i of the step that he have take to include autism training specifically in initial teacher training and meet i again to discuss support my minute rule bill 
 my hon friend be run a strong campaign from september initial teacher training and the early career framework will contain significantly more content on support pupil with special educational need include autistic pupil we have commit £ to the universal send service programme which have so far give training to more than professional regard autism awareness but i be happy to meet my hon friend again 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 we be deliver the large ever expansion of childcare in england ’s history which begin roll out in just week time from   april we do it before when we more than double the entitlement there have be under the previous labour government and i be delighted to update the house that our late projection show that more than new fund place will be secure by early april we expect that number to grow in the month ahead save parent more than £ in childcare cost 
 april be just the phase from september parent with child from the age of month until they start school will be able to benefit from that support only the conservatives have a plan that hard work parent can rely on as they grow their family labour have no plan so why do it not support our to give family the certainty they deserve 
 i recently visit fairfield spencer academy in my broxtowe constituency where i meet craig jones who be do good work with the junior adventures group a lead provider of school age childcare during my visit i observe staff provide crucial support to child beyond regular school hour however it be evident that that level of support be not consistent around the country and that fund for the school age childcare sector need reform i welcome the £ for the wraparound care sector but will my right hon friend the secretary of state commit to introduce a universal funding model link to parent earning similar to that for the early year to ensure provider remain affordable and sustainable 
 we be make wraparound childcare available for all parent who need it and we be support hard work parent to balance have a family and a successful career our £ investment will help school develop exciting programme before and after school which will provide more flexibility for work parent i be sure the minister for children families and wellbeing my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston will be happy to meet my hon friend to keep he update on progress 
 neither the secretary of state nor any treasury minister meet representative of the early year sector in the month before last year ’s budget announcement on childcare now with just week to go parent provider and even the government ’s own civil servant be sound the alarm more than in provider say they will not offer additional place and a quarter say they be likely to close within a year will the secretary of state now guarantee that all parent will be able to access the childcare place that she promise 
 absolutely i set that out in my topical statement we be work with every local authority to ensure the place be available i be glad the hon lady mention childcare because it be yet another policy area that the labour party have no plan for we be deliver the large expansion of childcare in history so that work parent of child from the age of month to the start of school will get hour of childcare a week the real question be what be labour ’s plan nobody know because it do not have it be clear that the conservatives be the only party with a plan for work parent 
 there be way we can find out what the public think call a general election 
 last week we hear another promise from the chancellor for a new funding mechanism for early year provider there be talk of hundred of million of pound more for the sector but strangely no news about where the promise £ will actually come from there be nothing at all in the budget document will the secretary of state tell we today where the money be come from or be this yet another reckless unfunded pledge without a plan from the conservatives 
 there would be no childcare on the table if the labour party be in charge so i urge all work parent to support the conservative party which have a plan for they like everything we do the £ will be fully fund it secure the rate in the future so that businesse up and down the country have the confidence to invest the labour party have absolutely no plan for childcare and for support work parent in this country 
 my right hon friend the secretary of state have rightly champion childcare and early education i congratulate she on the £ in this year ’s budget on top of the billion commit last year to the sector 
 indicate dissent 
 it be in the red book i be happy to meet the hon lady to show she where it be 
 i urge the secretary of state to keep press on some of the education committee ’s other recommendation include on extend family hub remove rate and vat from childcare provider and reform tax free childcare to drive take up 
 this conservative government be back this country ’s brilliant childcare provider as we roll out our historic childcare offer as my hon friend have point out that be on top of the roll out of universal service in family hub to give certainty to the early year sector we have confirm that average funding rate will increase over the next financial year as he state the detail be in the red book give they the confidence to invest and expand only the conservatives have a plan for hard work parent 
 i call the snp spokesman 
 academic independence be central to a function democracy so in light of the false accusation level at an academic on the board of uk research and innovation by the secretary of state ’s colleague the secretary of state for science innovation and technology and her subsequent apology what action be the secretary of state take to assure academic that they remain free to make legitimate comment on issue of concern 
 of course academic independence and the ability to speak freely be very important they be thing that we hold dear and that we must protect at all cost within our university and academic institution   that be why we pass the higher education freedom of speech act and it be why there be a free speech director in the office for students who have take up that post and will work to ensure we do whatever we can to protect those thing in our country 
 i have grammar school in my constituency which provide an important and very popular element of a diverse education system therefore will the minister please commit today to continue her support of grammar school both now and in the future

 in the spending review we commit £ for school capital over the year i do not know offhand the specific of the school that the hon gentleman have mention but i would of course be very happy to meet he to hear further detail 
 i recently hold my annual skill and apprenticeship fair at the iconic pioneer house kirklees college building in dewsbury will my right hon friend visit the college and meet some of the apprentice employer and college staff who help make that event a great success 
 i would be absolutely delighted to visit kirklees college and i congratulate my hon friend on his apprenticeship fair i note that the college have a great record on apprenticeship achievement and that apprentice have start their future overall at kirklees since there have be something like apprenticeship start in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 an estimated child in england be attend illegal or unregistered school that provide limited or no appropriate education often in an unsafe environment do the minister agree that while effort to introduce a home education register to keep track of child who be outside a school setting be welcome more legislation be need to close the loophole exploit by proprietor of illegal school and ensure that child be keep safe and educate appropriately 
 the hon gentleman will of course know of our plan and our support for the private member ’s bill on that subject he and i use to serve together on the education committee back in the day these be issue that have be long stand include under previous government from the school white paper he will also know of the other thing we have commit to do when legislative time allow 
 i recently have the pleasure of visit berrynarbor primary school where i discuss the challenge that rurality impose on that school and how hard its staff have work to overcome those challenge what step be the department take to support rural primary school which often have a vast catchment area and difficult building 
 i recognise what my hon friend say about rurality of course the lump sum element in the funding formula be important for small school we have more than double the national funding formula sparsity funding in year with £ for devon in we be also invest to improve the condition of school building and devon county council receive an annual capital allocation of £ this year 
 minister will be aware that school in north tyneside close just over a month ago because of a structural problem not relate to raac the pupil have be relocate thank to the council and to the school work together can the minister assure i that funding will be make available either to rebuild or to restructure the school as soon as it be need 
 yes and i be aware that the hon lady have meet my noble friend baroness barran inspection by structural engineer be ongoing as i think the hon lady will know but the early indication be that this be a historical and isolated issue about the way the school be build we continue to work with the local authority and with the school and i would of course be happy if appropriate and if it would help to meet she in due course 
 about year ago follow the government ’s reform the number of adoption in england double but year on they have halve why 
 my hon friend raise a very important point we be take a number of action to increase the number of people who adopt and foster and to support kinship care as well but i would be happy to discuss this matter with he far 
 many of the child with special educational need mental health challenge and childhood trauma who be not in school in york be not able to access their education because of insufficient estate and placement and because of the environment and specialist personnel what be   the government do to ensure that every area have a workforce plan and an estate plan and the funding to match 
 through our special educational need and disability and alternative provision improvement plan we be take a whole range of action that have include increase the number of special school place by more than since this government come to power as well as train a lot more special educational need co ordinator 
 headteachers in denbighshire flintshire and conwy have recently write to all parent about the dire financial situation face their school my understanding be that school in england be receive the high funding ever per pupil in real term will my right hon friend confirm that and outline what discussion he have have with the welsh government to ensure school in wales also see the benefit of that funding 
 i regret that as education be a devolved matter the labour party be in charge of education in wales it really sadden i to hear of child in my hon friend ’s constituency suffer from its mismanagement of that system despite the great work of brilliant and inspiring teacher in wales he be absolutely right that in england under this government funding be at a record level meanwhile in wales i be sad to say that education standard be not only the low in the uk but lower than the oecd average i be afraid it be clear that every time labour get into power child ’s education suffer

 i be delighted to attend the association of school and college leaders conference alongside sir martyn oliver who announce the big listen which be part of make sure that we get the cultural reform require i be concern by report that some teacher and headteacher feel that they be not listen to or be treat in a dismissive or rude manner i hope everybody will engage fully with the big listen because i think we need to make sure that ofsted be respectful and treat our service and our teacher and headteacher with respect

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence to make a statement on the state of the uk armed force 
 it be an honour to set out how our outstanding armed force be do incredible work around the world protect the uk and our ally that include operate on every single nato mission support ukraine against putin ’s aggression and tackle houthi attack on shipping in the red sea we be spend a record amount on defence that include an extra £ in cash term between and which be the large sustained increase since the end of the cold war the government fully recognise the grow security threat which be why we have set out our long term aspiration to invest of gdp on defence when fiscal and economic circumstance allow we be already spend more than of gdp on defence exceed our nato target we be deliver the capability that our force need significantly increase spending on defence equipment to £ over the next decade and introduce a new procurement model to improve acquisition 
 for the royal navy that include dreadnought astute and aukus submarine as well as fleet solid support ship type and type frigate for the army future soldier will deliver the large transformation in more than year re equip and re organise to be more deployable and lethal the raf will become an increasingly digitally empower force with the global combat air programme provide a generation fighter jet capability build on that provide by our typhoons and f-35 generation aircraft today our defence command paper set out our plan to deliver a credible war fighting force generate and employ to protect the nation and help it prosper now and in the year to come we will embody a fully integrate approach to deterrence and defence include across all domain and across government by exploit all lever of state power and with ally and partner 
 i pay tribute to hms richmond ’s action over the weekend defend shipping in the red sea against a large scale houthi attack those be the demand that our armed force face as threat increase 
 the defence secretary owe the public and parliament an explanation he say that we be move into a pre war world and ahead of last week ’s budget he write to the chancellor and state that 
 we must take bold action in your budget to commit to defence spending increase to in it would re establish our leadership in europe 
 but there be a grow gap between the defence secretary ’s rhetoric and the reality for our armed force who be charge with prepare for this new dangerous era in the budget there be no new money for defence nothing new for ukraine and nothing for gaza or the uk ’s operation in the middle east bad both the treasury and the house of commons library confirm that the defence budget will be cut by £ in cash term in this next financial year the of gdp which the   minister refer to be not mention once in the treasury red book the last time this country spend of gdp on defence be in under a labour government 
 while putin wag war in europe ministers be war with each other challenging defence policy in public the minister for security be on tv this morning call for now that be a serious breakdown in collective ministerial responsibility but i be most concerned about the serious state of the uk armed force what signal do it send to our adversary when our force have be hollow out and underfunde for the last year when the public accounts committee find the large ever fund deficit in the mod ’s equipment plan when the british army have be cut to its small size since napoleon when force recruitment target have be miss each and every year for year and when satisfaction with service life have hit a record low 
 i have simple question for the minister where be the plan for well defend britain it be clear that our armed force can not afford another year of a conservative government 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his comment about hms richmond i be sure that we all agree and pay tribute to our royal navy personnel who be there ultimately to defend not only themselves but freedom of navigation for the rest of the world we should recognise the importance of the role that they be undertake on behalf of our government 
 the right hon gentleman talk about the funding for next year to be clear that will represent a increase in real term and not the cut that he suggest if we spend the money that we expect it will amount to £ about of gdp which be traditionally how we measure our spending that be significantly above the just under in so it be a significant increase as a percentage of gdp 
 the right hon gentleman also talk about recruitment which be an important issue my right hon friend the minister for defence people and families be do a lot of work on that and as the right hon gentleman will be aware in january we see the high number of application to the army in year a more positive picture be develop recognise the importance of the mission we should not talk down our armed force when we expect people to apply and to want to be recruit into they 
 i note the range of comment about the and want to make several point the be that the right hon gentleman say that we have not spend that percentage since labour be in power well something extraordinary happen at the end of their time in power they crash the economy we have a full on banking crisis and a letter be leave for our government say there be no money it be no surprise that we have to take difficult decision but despite that we have show our commitment to the armed force 
 when he be chancellor of the exchequer the prime minister approve the large ever increase in defence spending since the cold war and there have be further money since then in the budget of course we be commit to when the circumstance allow for all the right hon gentleman ’s bluster he have not even   commit to match our current spending on defence let alone we challenge he on that at defence oral and he be not able to give any commitment whatever to spend 
 the public know where we stand in the year ahead and when the economic allow we do not have a clue where labour stand 
 i agree with the minister that we have extraordinarily capable armed force whose productivity be to none however as be set out in ready for war our defence committee report they be extremely engaged globally and have a great deal to do much of which be invaluable at the same time they be have to prepare for the pre war phase to which the defence secretary refer in that context do my hon friend agree that the timing of the target that be very welcome and a very good step need to be determine by the level of threat as a priority expenditure rather than as economic condition allow 
 i do not think that we can commit to level of public expenditure or tax cut for example without be confident that the economy can support they in a prudent fashion an entirely reasonable and rational approach however i totally agree with my right hon friend the chair of the defence committee we all recognise that we be live in a more dangerous world the secretary of state have allude to the threat we face not just in ukraine but in respect of other adversary around the world and i totally understand why there be the wide debate on what we spend but we already have a significant budget and we must ensure that it be spend well and deliver value for money that be why a key priority for i be reform of our procurement system so that we can ensure that our armed force can prioritise effectively ultimately it be the capability that we have now that will determine our ability to warfight 
 i call the snp spokesman 
 i congratulate the shadow defence secretary on secure the urgent question and join he and the minister in remember those on hms richmond 
 on friday the public accounts committee ’s find that the 
 mod be increasingly reliant on the uk ’s ally to protect our national interest nato membership deter hostility but the report warn such deterrence can only be effective if our armed forces be credible 
 to paraphrase the report give that many of our ally face similar capability challenge be the ministry of defence develop mitigation for deal with the risk of allied support be curtail or withdraw if critically there be a change of administration in washington come november 
 to be fair to the hon gentleman he make an important point about the importance of alliance nato be fundamental to the defence of our country the wide western world and our ally beyond critically to put this in context when we talk about the state of the armed force which be what the urgent   question be about and the alliance that he refer to let we remember that we have just launch steadfast defender which be of the large ever nato exercise involve personnel of which almost be from the uk i believe that we make up of the land force that be an extraordinary contribution by the uk we also offer our nuclear deterrent to nato we be support our ally we stand together under article and we should all do everything possible to support nato in its year 
 may i commend to anyone interested in the historical context a report produce by the defence committee in july in call shift the goalposts defence expenditure and the pledge an update hc it show that for the last year of the cold war this country spend between and of gdp calculate in the same way we do today on defence do that not show both side of the house that we have an awful long way to go now that there be a hot war in europe before we match what we use to do when there be a cold war in europe 
 my right hon friend put that eloquently and he speak with great passion and expertise on the cold war and our recent history as he know in the cold war era we have the working assumption that an invasion or certainly a confrontation could be launch on the border in germany very quickly we have a huge number of force deploy and give that threat we spend understandably a high percentage of gdp on defence since then we think we have a more peaceful era those illusion have be shatter by putin and we have all have to wake up to that that be why we have do so much to support ukraine and yes why we will do everything possible to support our armed force 
 the secretary of state say he want to ensure that 
 our entire defence ecosystem be ready 
 to defend but here be the reality of our armed force under this government capability delay and shortfall stockpile shortage lose personnel woeful recruitment level a £ black hole in finance and as of last week no real boost to the mod ’s budget the secretary of state be fail be n’t he 
 when the hon lady talk about procurement and delay i would have think she could at least recognise the support we have give to ukraine where we have procure an extraordinary amount of ordnance into the country to help ukrainians to defend themselves much of that have be at great pace not least from gift for example our as-90s a whole range of munition and artillery shell have it not be this country ’s role i think we can safely say that russia would have be successful 
 whether it be covid the war in ukraine or the middle east it be clear that our world be become more dangerous not less many of we in the house have be call for increase defence spending and for a recognition of the symbiotic relationship between our economy and security that have be illustrate by what have be go on in   the red sea that be why we need to spend more but how might we spend it will the minister consider a defence review because ukraine continue to illustrate how the character of conflict be change on that note will he agree that the big international security threat be russia as it move to a war footing we have do well to slide across £ of support but unless more be do the tide will turn in ukraine and that will change the economy and security of the whole continent 
 my right hon friend as ever make some excellent point he be right to mention how we spend the money it be thing to talk about gdp figure and spend but what be our priority as procurement minister and as i set out in my recent statement on the integrate procurement model i want much great use of datum particularly from the frontline in ukraine to inform our own defence industry so that we can bring forward at a much great pace those technological innovation whether in uncrewed system or complex weapon that will truly help strengthen our defence as for a review he will appreciate that be a matter for the prime minister and the secretary of state for defence but he make an excellent point 
 we have the small army since the napoleonic era so can i press the minister on this be a cut of £ in cash term announce in the budget last week 
 i hear this point about napoleon many time if it be the labour party ’s position to significantly increase the size of the stand army that be a massive financial commitment the hon gentleman need to have a word with the shadow defence secretary and the shadow chancellor because as yet they have not once commit to current spending level let alone when the economic condition allow 
 i strongly support my hon friend ’s powerful commitment to defence in general but i be rather disappointed by his tepid promise about move to of gdp i also find myself in the career wreck position of strongly agree with the shadow secretary of state for defence who put the argument extremely well the fact of the matter be that last week ’s budget reduce both kind of defence expenditure by £ and we be not face any kind of move towards which no less a figure than the former secretary of state for defence my right hon friend   the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace publicly call for last week serve ministers have say how disappointed they be by the budget by what possible arithmetic do the minister conclude we be in fact increase defence spending when every expert in the world say that we patently be not 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who always speak with such expertise on defence matter on be tepid we have to be able to sustain that if it be a off the army the navy and the air force would not be able to plan accordingly it have to be   an investment that we can sustain and thereby the economy of the country have to be able to sustain it forgive i for sound like i be still in my previous job at the treasury but the country have to be able to afford it and we need to be prudent in the commitment we make on public expenditure not least so that they be sustainable in the long term and not a off which would be the bad thing we could do 
 the minister keep say we should not talk down our armed force but we be not the armed force be do a splendid brilliant job what we be do be run down what the government be do which be not enough let we put it that way we have the great threat since the cold war we have war in ukraine the middle east in disarray and china increase its spending the real blame for the situation with defence lie with the prime minister and the chancellor do the minister think in these circumstance that most reasonable people would have think it okay not to put extra resource in the budget for defence 
 when the prime minister be chancellor he oversee the big increase in spending since the cold war the current chancellor significantly increase defence spending in the previous budget for the year ahead we be not cut defence spending as i say if the hon gentleman take the figure in totality it will rise by in real term if we spend what we expect to next year we will spend of gdp on defence around £ 
 may i make a suggestion to my hon friend it be perfectly clear that the mod want to increase defence spending as do the opposition spokesperson   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey if we be to take his criticism at all seriously be the right question to ask whether we be spend enough to prevent a war not to fight a war how much more do we need to spend to be an effective deterrent which we do not appear to be at the moment 
 as i say it be important that we engage in the key capability question it be thing to talk about spend more but what capability would we purchase and where be our shortcoming it must be a new development at the heart of defence to have a constant feedback loop of datum on integrate warfighting and what be happen in ukraine with the armed service and with industry so that we know what capability will make the difference to give example we have see the extraordinary impact of uncrewed weapon in ukraine we have make assumption about technology in our equipment plan which be probably far more expensive than those option we need to look at this from a warfighting point of view to support deterrence the important thing be to back our armed force that be why we have our spending commitment but it have to be balance against the ability of the economy to support it and sustain it in the long term 
 the times recently illustrate that the british army will shrink in size to within the next year due to the current recruitment and retention crisis our senior and   close ally include the us have express their grave concern and even senior conservative have concede that our armed force have be hollow out since as threat to the uk increase why have the government shrunk our army to its small size since napoleon 
 the hon gentleman talk about a crisis in recruitment but as i say january see the high number of application to join the army for year that be an important and positive development on the size of the armed force we should talk about not just the number of soldier but the amount of accommodation to support they and the platform the weapon and the capability that be an extremely expensive undertaking if the hon gentleman think that that be the right thing to do he need to lobby his colleague on his own front bench because they have not commit to spend of gdp on defence let alone 
 as a former armed forces minister i pay high tribute to his majesty ’s armed force but not to his majesty ’s treasury the red book the budget bible show clearly in table and that next year ’s core defence budget have be cut by £ that be true it ill behove any government let alone that purport to call themselves conservative to use off payment to ukraine or overspend in the nuclear budget from the consolidated fund and pretend that they be part of the defence budget when everyone in this house know that they be not as the son of a d day veteran i say to the government if not to the minister for whom i have great regard more in anger than in sorrow that what they have do be deeply dishonourable and they should be ashamed of themselves 
 my right hon friend be a defence minister and i respect his great passion about all thing relate to the armed force particularly because of his father when we spend on the nuclear deterrent or on support ukraine purchase weapon and provide ordnance ultimately to help defend ourselves that be legitimately describe as defence expenditure after all how else be we to pay for that and from which budget compare with last year there be a real term increase of which if we spend what we expect will amount to £ and of gdp 
 many citizen will be rightly concerned about the use of the phrase pre war world what require clarification be not simply the scale of the british military in year to come but where the armed force be currently deploy and what they be do be british serviceman fire weaponry in ukraine as suggest by german ministerial source be british force assist israel in its genocide through the provision of military intelligence know the answer to those question be fundamental to our security and indeed to our know whether the uk be uphold international law never mind it be a basic democratic right and something that our citizen be entitle to know 
 the hon gentleman know that we do not comment on speculation particularly on sensitive operational matter relate to the armed force and   that be the right approach yes we have a duty of candour but we also have to protect those serve on the frontline 
 the fighting in ukraine prove that size matter the minister should reconstitute the territorial army which demonstrate that with economy quantity have a quality all of its own 
 my right hon friend have a quality all of his own as show in how he put his question he make a very good point we tend to talk about the regular army but we must remember our reserve they be incredibly important and we pay tribute to they ukraine have show that this country be able to make an extraordinary contribution this be speculate but it be likely that if it have not be for the contribution we make ukraine would not have be successful in repel the russians as far as it have do 
 so there we have it president putin will be order his officer to stop sabre rattle with the west because the british be change their procurement rule the reality be that the minister can not fight the war he want to fight with the capability he have he will be present with the conflict that develop and we need the capability and resilience to meet threat that emerge what assessment have he make of the threat to the united kingdom and how will he meet those threat with the armed force he have 
 the hon gentleman ’s rather trite comment on procurement be a total failure to understand how the military work he want to talk about the deterrent everything from our nuclear submarine right down to small arm be part of the procurement system they all have to be procure my priority be ensure that we have a procurement system that be agile get equipment to the frontline as fast as possible and can engage with the late technological development think of laser and uncrewed system technology be move at an extraordinary pace we have use technology to support ukraine so far we have provide drone and will increase our support to around we be do everything possible to support ukraine all that be do through the procurement system if i may say so highly effectively 
 i join my hon friend in commend the professionalism of our armed force and in point out that labour have not commit to an increase in defence spending but may i remind he that the duty of any government be to ensure that defence spending primarily reflect the threat rather than the ability to pay we have a war in europe we have an increasingly belligerent russia i chair the defence committee of the committee conservative back benchers be very much behind the idea that we need to increase defence spending what do the minister think it will take to increase defence spending 
 of all we have increase defence spending crucially the last spending review see the large allocation of spending to defence since the cold   war yes we have set an aspiration of and the answer to when that will happen be when economic condition allow it would be imprudent to commit to such a level of spending if we do not think it could be sustain the bad thing would be to have that spending for maybe or year and then have to go backwards because we do not think it be sustainable this be about balance affordability against commitment but we need to be absolutely clear that at over £ this be the most we have ever spend on defence there be an extraordinary effort in support of ukraine and we have highly capable armed force who be make an extraordinary contribution to nato include through the late nato exercise and will continue to do so 
 i do not want to make too much play of your early remark madam deputy speaker but i be bear on the night the house be bomb and this chamber be burn out as i have listen to the minister i have be say to myself i hope that he will recall this that he represent the party of winston churchill and margaret thatcher but now that the world be more dangerous than i can recall it be in all my year we be not able to defend the country adequately i say to member on both side of the house that this be a wake up call we must act now 
 i pay respect to the hon gentleman ’s longevity and seniority and to the fact that on the day he be bear the house be bomb during whichever war it be i think it be the world war he say that we be unable to defend ourselves and i totally and utterly reject that claim if putin have succeed in his invasion of ukraine yes we would have be look at a situation similar to that in the late 1930 but that invasion have not succeed the reason for that be the involvement of this government who take extraordinary step to train ukrainians provide vital munition such as next generation light anti tank weapon before the war start ensure that we be the country to provide tank and encourage other nation to provide enormous amount of arm without that the world would be an even less safe place but i accept that it be become more dangerous which be why we be support our armed force and why we be play such a massive role in nato ’s steadfast defender exercise 
 the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman   refer to member on both side of the house be there not a clear distinction between member on either side of the house namely that from the prime minister and the chancellor downward there be a commitment and an agreement to defence spending amount to of gdp while in stark contrast labour members while suggest that they be a government in wait be not prepared to commit themselves to or even to our current spending commitment there be unity on the conservative side and complete disunity on the other 
 in my hon friend ’s constituency which i have the pleasure of visit recently there be many defence interest and he have hit the nail on the   head we have hear all the theatric but the fact be that we have not a clue what the opposition will spend on defence labour members have not even confirm that they will spend the exist let alone 
 the conflict in ukraine be a stark reminder of why we must take our defence incredibly seriously the minister have just say that the world be become a more dangerous place do he therefore agree that his government ’s decision to cut our uk troop to be irresponsible and will he commit himself to reverse those cut and ensure that the british army be the requisite size to defend the united kingdom and its ally 
 as i have say we have just commit of the land force personnel to the steadfast defender exercise nato be the key to the defence of this nation and indeed the whole continent in conventional term we should recognise the enormous contribution of our armed force and the fact that we have increase spending significantly however i hear what colleague be say as do the secretary of state we have set out the case for but we want that to be sustainable so that the economy can afford it over the long term and that will be possible through growth and sensible measure on fiscal policy 
 the minister concede early that funding for ukraine and the escalate nuclear cost be at the expense of restore the viability of our frontline readiness but deterrence be a lot cheap than war surely our support for ukraine and the deterrent should be a charge on the general fund rather than far hollow out our conventional armed force 
 i do not believe i make that point about nuclear the right hon gentleman have say that these factor be at the expense of the frontline but nuclear be the frontline we have have the continuous at sea deterrent patrolling in defence of this country every year since as i recall we have have it for a long time and it be fundamental to our defence the idea that that be not frontline spending be extraordinary 
 look at the figure for resource and capital departmental expenditure limit it look like there be a 7%—£2.5 cut for this coming year the office for budget responsibility say that defence spending will be flat as a share of gdp with russia ’s expenditure on its military at of its total economy why do the secretary of state accept the reduction from the chancellor and the prime minister 
 i have explain why we do not believe that there have be a reduction we believe that there will be a increase in real term the hon gentleman say that spending as a percentage of gdp be flat i point out that in it be 2.08%—just under we believe that if we spend everything we expect to in the next financial year that will be which be a significant increase 
 i be sure that the procurement minister be aware of survitec in my constituency which have provide equipment to the armed force for decade he will acknowledge   that the last few year have teach we the importance of have secure uk supply chain and of get good job to the whole country through the power of procurement i invite he to come and speak to survitec so that he can hear directly from the company about its frustration with the procurement process 
 before i be injure play football for parliament versus the army i always use to enjoy play a side with the hon gentleman i would be delighted to accept his invitation to visit because small and medium sized enterprise and business be absolutely critical as the minister for defence procurement and have run an sme i believe that we have to have an environment that encourage investment in defence and support our domestic supply chain a key part of that be exportability i look forward to discuss these matter with the company that he mention 
 the shocking state of army accommodation be a big driver of the recruitment and retention challenge that we face so it will not come as a surprise to hear that i be yet again raise the issue of the shocking standard of accommodation at the chicksands base when i catch up with serve personnel over a pint or at our local pub in shefford there be a grow sense of resignation about the future of the base but there be real concern that its plan closure will mean that the situation go unadjusted and that really poor accommodation unit be not improve to do right by those personnel will the minister commit to revisit the government ’s decision not to upgrade either of the service basis in my constituency where hundred of bed fall into grade or 
 we engage with this issue in the hon gentleman ’s westminster hall debate on accommodation in which i announce our plan for chicksand i entirely accept that this be a matter on which there should be   engagement with the local community and that there will be a range of view i emphasise that we have put an extra £ into accommodation which have allow we to deliver our winter plan highly effectively there have be a massive increase in the number of property in the defence estate benefit from damp and mould package but also from new door and so on to deal with long stand issue in the estate and i be keen to do more 
 finally i call jim shannon 
 i thank the minister for his answer to the question pose to he there can be no doubt that the government must do more to increase defence spending give that a large portion of our defence budget have rightly be spend on assist ukraine however we must ensure that other issue be not leave behind unfortunately there be no mention in last week ’s budget of an additional funding increase for our armed force will the minister increase our defence budget so that we can ensure that our action speak louder than word and so that promise be keep and our armed force can keep we safe
