order 
 that tom morrison be discharge from the committee of selection and charlie maynard be added.—(mark tami 
 the chancellor of the exchequer be ask 
 what the annual cost to the public purse be of a increase in the cost of service government debt 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of recent trend in the level of interest on government debt 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on level of debt interest spending 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on level of debt interest spending 
 when we enter office debt be at high not see since the 1960 my commitment to the fiscal rule be non negotiable and we will drive debt down to a sustainable level there have be movement in global financial market and the uk be not immune the office for budget responsibility will produce a forecast in the usual way and i will respond with a statement to parliament on   march i will not be give a running commentary on that forecast 
 labour come to office promise to kick start growth instead it have kick growth into the gutter over the last few month we have see some of the slow growth in the g7 in the actual figure rather than the projection where will the money for the public sector and public service come from with economic growth 
 yesterday ’s pwc report show that the uk be the most attractive place in the world to invest for global ceo it be the time in year that we have be in that position in the league table and the international monetary fund forecast on friday that the uk will be the fast grow major economy in europe next year 
 last time i raise the market concern about debt with the chancellor she tell i to get real what be real be that the cost of debt interest be over £ what be real be the choice she have to increase taxis on people and business in earl shilton burbage and across the country to cut service for people in hinckley donisthorpe and across the country or to borrow on the country ’s credit card will she now be real with the public and tell they which of the it be go to be 
 we inherit a high amount of debt from the previous government and we have to pay interest cost on that debt the forecast i set out in the budget in october show that debt fall to a sustainable level as i say the obr forecast will be publish on   march and i will make a statement at that time 
 the chancellor ’s increase demand for government borrowing drive up its price and crowd out investment by productive private enterprise do n’t it hon member no 
 let i have a go there have undoubtedly be move in global financial market this year and the uk be not immune to those movement the obr have not yet start its forecast it will update that in due course and i will make a statement on   march 
 since come to office the chancellor have increase taxis by £ and borrow by £ and her employment rights bill have increase the cost of employer by a furth £ do she accept that her decision have lead to a loss of confidence in the british economy and an increase in our borrowing cost 
 i do not think the borrowing cost in every major country in the world can be explain by the decision make by this government as i say to   the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans   last week the hon gentleman have to get real there have be global movement in financial market that have affect the united kingdom but if he look at the pwc report from yesterday the most recent report on market confidence global ceo see the uk as the good place in the world to invest after the us 
 the international monetary fund forecast that the uk be set to be the fast grow major economy in europe which would have think conservative members would welcome i know my right hon friend the chancellor will not be satisfied until resident in bracknell and across the country feel the benefit of economic improvement in their pay packet and their day to day life so will she set out what more she can do to ensure we tackle the cost of live and fix the economic mess we have inherit from the conservatives 
 after year of stagnant growth and the decline in living standard during the last parliament my hon friend be absolutely right that we must turn around that performance that be what this government be determined to do the planning and infrastructure bill will come to parliament shortly follow by the pension bill which will unlock long term pension capital and make it easy for business to get thing do in this country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the chancellor make reference to the pwc report but half of the survey in that report be do before the budget the chancellor and i spend a very happy year sit next to each other at the treasury committee and she be incredibly good at demand straight answer from the witness that come in front of the committee she have already be ask question about the fact that the fiscal headroom be only £ and the increase in the cost of borrowing be now go to go through the roof so at some point she will have to raise taxis cut investment or increase debt which will it be 
 the headroom in our budget be large than the headroom that we inherit from the previous government so we have put aside more money for change in economic prospect the obr have not yet do its forecast which will take a whole variety of factor into account and we will make decision base on that i have be really clear that our fiscal rule be non negotiable because unlike the conservatives we be determined to meet the fiscal rule not break they time and again 
 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party 
 the rise cost of borrowing will bring more misery to mortgage holder with report suggest that some mortgage holder could pay an extra £ a year give that potential global trade tension could far affect the uk ’s financial stability what assurance will the government provide that uk lender remain in a strong position to support household and small business 
 labour and liberal democrat members be mindful of the last government ’s impact on mortgage borrowing cost for many of our constituent and we be determined to tackle the cost of living crisis as the hon member know i have write to financial regulator include the financial conduct authority about regulate for growth not just for risk so that we can help more people get on the housing ladder and help grow our economy 
 what the fiscal circumstance be that would allow official development assistance to return to of gross national income 
 the government remain committed to restore oda spending to of gni as soon as fiscal circumstance allow the late obr forecast show that the oda fiscal test be not due to be meet within this parliament   but we will continue to monitor future forecast closely and each year we will review and confirm in accordance with the international development official development assistance target act whether a return to spending at of gni on oda be possible 
 i thank the minister for protect the level of oda give the fiscal situation we inherit but there be more war go on in the world than at any time since world war will he review the fiscal formula which he and the chancellor rightly vote against when put forward by the previous government put the oda budget on a long term settlement and meet i to discuss how we can improve uk safety through the oda budget 
 i thank my hon friend for her question on a topic that i know she have great expertise in she will know that it be important that spending across department whether on military humanitarian or economic support be align with our oda spending the multi year spending review be under way and we will confirm budget in june for the year ahead as i have confirm we will come back to the house every year to review and confirm the fiscal test as they relate to of gni on oda 
 give that the office for budget responsibility forecast that the fiscal test of return to will not be meet in this parliament and that there have be no equivalent uplift to the £ that the conservatives put to spend on in country refugee cost be the minister and this labour government content to have preside over a real term cut to the oda budget compare with the previous conservative government 
 of the issue to which the hon lady allude be that under the last administration when they lose control of the border and the asylum system the cost of hotel to house asylum seeker wait for their decision be include in the oda definition of spending that be why the home secretary be work at pace to reduce that backlog as quickly as possible and we be make much more significant progress than the previous administration do in many year 
 to follow on from the minister ’s answer member will be remind of the fact that oda cost spend in the uk be now at record level thank to the last government that should not be the case oda should be spend as much as possible in the world ’s poor country what step be the government take to help the home office bring down those cost so that more aid can be spend where it be truly need 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that be why both deal with the home office backlog in processing claim and return and work with counterpart in the ministry of justice to ensure that the tribunal process be up to speed be intrinsically important to the oda budget under the last administration crucial oda for bilateral aid in country around the world that be in desperate need of it be   cut at short notice because of their mishandling of the asylum system that will not happen under this government 
 i know that member on the treasury bench attach great importance to the international development budget not least because i recall that the chancellor of the exchequer support my effort to stop the be cut by my own government even wind up the debate with great skill and flair will treasury ministers therefore follow in the footstep of the chancellor ’s predecessor my right hon friend   the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt and top up the budget with an additional £ so that the foreign office and the government can achieve their own international development objective 
 i thank the right hon gentleman as i be sure the chancellor do for his kind word a key part of the test on oda spending in term of fiscal circumstance require those circumstance to improve of the reason we be in this problem in the place be because of the mess the previous administration leave this country in we be work hard to turn that around 
 i call helen maguire

 we take very seriously the need to protect community from flooding and to deliver on our commitment on climate in the year ahead it be important that we consider both principle and that be what the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department for energy security and net be do

 get real 
 i think that remark be direct at the hon member in a previous life 
 we have commit to year allowance and to maintain that go forward but unless we deliver secure energy generate at home through cheap renewable there be no energy security to be have in the year ahead

 it be great to see strong advocate for stoke in the chamber today a number of local authority and indeed labour mayor have raise with i bus procurement and the importance of bus for the local economy i look forward to work with they particularly david skaith in york and north yorkshire and steve rotheram in liverpool to boost bus service in community and particularly rural community to support job in the uk at the budget i allocate more than £ for local bus service and that include £ for local authority to support and improve bus service in the next financial year 
 museum make an important contribution to our cultural life but also to our economy the arts council and the museums association find that net expenditure on museum and gallery have decrease by almost in real term since i welcome the chancellor ’s recognition that the creative industry be key to deliver growth and that national museum be give support in the recent budget but what step can the government take to support regional civic museum such as derby museum which do not benefit from that funding 
 the culture secretary be pleased that the creative industry be of the sector include in our industrial strategy she host an event with member of the creative industry taskforce in newcastle just last week to emphasise the importance of have good cultural offer and art and museum in local community i be happy to sort out a meeting for my hon friend with the relevant minister to discuss access to the art and culture in mid derbyshire 
 as my right hon friend know south shields be a gorgeous coastal tourist town we pride ourselves on our small business and our strong hospitality industry but she will also know they be struggle after year of neglect by the conservatives to help those business will she outline what consideration she have give to reduce vat on our hospitality leisure and tourism sector 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i remember a very nice dinner of fish and chip with she in her constituency just a few year ago and she be a strong advocate for local business in south shields in the budget we be able to extend business rate relief to the retail hospitality and leisure sector of for the next financial year and then to move it on to a fair footing so that high street business and small business pay fair rate of business tax compare with for example the online giant 
 the bus manufacturer alexander dennis build innovative electric bus employ people in scarborough the chancellor have speak about the need for public procurement to take well account of employment and environmental standard as bus service be bring back into the control of mayor and local authority will the government use public procurement to back british company such as alexander dennis to boost economic growth 
 my hon friend be a good advocate for business include alexander dennis in scarborough the government will soon publish a new national procurement policy statement which will set out our priority for public procurement in support of our mission to grow the economy in addition to the answer i give my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent north david williams we recognise the importance of bus in grow our economy by get people to work but also the opportunity to use public procurement to buy more bus make in this country support good job here in britain 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 former chair mr speaker but thank you very much for call i 
 it be clear that we all want to see economic growth in rural area and across the uk but i be concerned that some of the measure in the chancellor ’s budget be have the opposite effect which statistic worry she most the fact that we be at a year high for business closure or the increase in millionaire leave the uk 
 i have already outline some of the positive number include the upgrade in the imf forecast the pwc report and the fact that the economy have return to growth in the most recent datum and inflation be fall instead of talk our country down i will be bang the drum to bring in investment and job to our country 
 a new hospital in eastbourne would help to drive economic growth in my town and across rural sussex but year of tory tumblewee and i be afraid yesterday ’s announcement mean that it will not be deliver and build until will the chancellor accelerate the release of fund to the department of health and social care to bring forward the building of our new hospital to support patient in eastbourne and beyond and of course to support wide economic growth 
 i recognise the strength of feeling about this issue we be leave a terrible situation by the previous government with a £ black hole in the public finance and the promise of thing for which absolutely no money have be put aside we have now do the responsible thing by review the programme that we inherit from the previous government that mean that the timetable for some project have have to be push back but it be because the previous government make promise know that the cheque would bounce 
 business in my constituency and across the country be still reel from the chancellor ’s damage budget she make a commitment at the confederation of british industry conference that she would not come back for more taxis do she stand by that commitment 
 i have to do a once in a generation budget in october to fix the mess in the public finance leave by the previous government i will never have to do a budget like that again because we have now fix that terrible inheritance 
 devastating change to inheritance tax increase environmental cost because of net policy and diversion of farming support to foreign country with those kind of policy how do the chancellor ever expect to generate economic growth in rural area 
 bring stability back to our economy by fix the public finance be the no thing we can do to help business to grow alongside our planning reform to make it easy to build thing in britain and our reform to the pension system to help business access long term patient capital as for agricultural property relief the late figure show that the top of claims—117 claim account for of the total value of the relief cost the taxpayer £ we can not afford to carry on like that which be why we make those progressive and fair reform in the budget 
 i call the shadow minister 
 farming ’s vital role in grow our rural economy grow our food and protect the countryside be threaten by labour ’s family farm tax the self proclaim iron chancellor be prove herself to be the tin eared chancellor ignore evidence from the national farmers union and other show that the tax be base on flawed assumption ahead of saturday ’s farming day of unity rather than threaten family farm will she speak to farmer think again and withdraw those damaging proposal 
 the problem with the conservatives be that they support increase spending in vital area but they have not support any of the tax increase necessary to pay for they which frankly be why we be in the situation we be in today have inherit a £ black hole in the public finance the hon gentleman will know that in the budget we announce £ for the farming budget over year include the large funding direct at sustainable food production and nature recovery in this country ’s history and £ to support farmer affect by flooding 
 what step she plan to take to help protect the steel industry from high emission steel be divert away from the eu to the uk follow confirmation of the uk carbon border adjustment mechanism for 
 the uk carbon border adjustment mechanism will be introduce in it will ensure that import face a carbon price that be comparable with domestic product give uk industry the confidence to invest without its decarbonisation effort be undermine uk steel producer will continue to benefit from high level of free allowance in the uk emission trading system until at least the end of protect they against carbon leakage via high emission import 
 newby foundries and alucast in my constituency of tipton wednesbury and coseley have raise with i the impact of the uk cbam come into effect later than and differ from the eu cbam this could threaten domestic steel production and make the export of metal product to the eu more difficult can the minister please support the uk ’s steel and metal finishing industry by reassure i that the uk cbam will not be weak than the eu cbam and will he meet i and other steel mp to discuss this 
 as i have set out the uk cbam will mitigate the risk of carbon leakage by place a carbon price on some of the most emission intensive industrial good import into the uk include in the iron and steel sector the uk cbam be design for the uk context and in some area its emission scope be wide than the eu cbam in respect of indirect emission for instance the cbam industry working group be hold early this week and i understand that a representative of the uk steel sector attend i will make sure that my official continue to engage with the industry sector most affect and i be very happy to discuss this far with my hon friend 
 heavy industry whether it be steel ceramic or so many other area be totally dependent on low energy cost the trajectory be that energy cost be rise especially in industry whether as a result of regulation or world market many other country be do more to protect their heavy industry by make sure they can have low input cost for energy what more can the minister do to protect our heavy industry in the future 
 the no thing for industry and household be to bring down the cost of energy that be why we be invest in renewable home grow energy for the future to make sure we have energy independence energy security and crucially low bill for those household and business 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her regulatory policy of recent trend in level of money laundering in retail business 
 this government be commit to tackle money laundering money launder through cash base high street business be a known issue and the treasury work closely with law enforcement agency to monitor trend in criminality and ensure resource be deploy towards the most significant threat 
 hard work shopkeeper and entrepreneur across the country include in bromsgrove and the village play by the rule and pay their taxis what be the estimate loss of revenue to the exchequer from money laundering in retail environment in town and village across the country and what be the government do to crack down on this 
 it be right that we take a robust approach to money laundering and we have a tailored approach to cash deposit limit to reflect the difference in need and risk profile across business customer basis i be committed to work with the financial conduct authority and other to ensure we strike the right balance that allow business to continue their operation but also ensure that we assess the risk pose by those who might be use their business to launder money 
 what additional support can the government offer to customs and excise local authority and police force in gathering support evidence that can then be provide to his majesty ’s revenue and customs high street money launderer be brazen front for significant criminal enterprise 
 we take this issue very seriously the treasury own the money laundering regulation but the fca have a key role as a major supervisor and we work very closely with the criminal enforcement agency of course those agency be independent but we be absolutely committed to clamp down on money laundering 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to uplift former mineworker pension 
 what step she have take with cabinet colleague to uplift former mineworker pension 
 this government recognise the contribution that miner make to the prosperity of the nation and the challenging circumstance in which they work that be why the government agree to transfer the investment reserve   fund to member of the mineworker pension scheme so that the mineworker who power our country receive a fairer pension 
 do my right hon friend agree that end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme be great news not only for the former mineworker in my constituency who will benefit but for the economy of the local community where they live which be leave behind by the previous government will he and his colleague in government continue to engage with the trustee of the british coal staff superannuation scheme to ensure that in the same way the fund build up in that scheme be use for the benefit of its member 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and his work on behalf of his constituent he may know that in the previous parliament i and colleague work on the mineworker pension scheme through the business and trade committee to lay the ground for the initiative that this government be quickly able to implement on come into government unfortunately that work have not yet be do for the british coal staff superannuation scheme which be why ministers be meet the scheme ’s trustee to consider the option 
 this be an important issue for south wales family my uncle jacky be a deputy at cwm marine pit and my uncle georgie be a deputy at oakdale sadly they have now pass but they be member of the british coal pension scheme many of their mining friend will be in their 80 and 90 and their pension deserve uplift so will the minister please commit to make good progress here time be run out for the man and woman who fire our industrial past 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that question on an issue that i know be deeply important to he his constituent and his family and on which he have work for many year the government be actively consider proposal from the scheme ’s trustee and we will set out the next step in due course my hon friend the minister for industry in the department for business and trade will be work on the detail and i will be meet she shortly to consider the option 
 i have significant former mining area in the douglas valley and upper nithsdale in my constituency constituent there be concerned about the british coal scheme because many people in that scheme actually work underground before be promote into other job to ensure fairness in the implementation of this government policy will the minister make sure that the timescale on which they be compensate be the same as that for those in the other scheme 
 i thank the right hon member for his question and i think fairness be the right word that be why we work in opposition to try to persuade the last government to act on the mineworker pension scheme but we fail because the last government do not think this be an urgent issue for they to consider the labour government have implement this change at our budget and that be fairness in   action we will continue to work with trustee of the bcsss and we will come back with further option in due course 
 let we go to the member for that well know mining area of strangford 
 mr speaker i speak to the minister beforehand so he know where i be come from with my question 
 i understand that some family of those affect who have pass away have retire to northern ireland and they deserve their pension that be the case have the right hon gentleman have an opportunity to ascertain the number of those in northern ireland who will qualify for such pension and will he chase up those people to ensure they get the money they deserve 
 i thank the hon member for his question i be afraid i have not have time to do so since he tell i minute ago that he be go to ask that question but i have hear it clearly i will take that away and come back to he in course 
 what step she be take through the tax system to support sme 
 what step she be take through the tax system to support the retail sector 
 what step she be take through the tax system to support the hospitality and tourism sector 
 the government announce a range of measure at the autumn budget to support sme include in the retail hospitality and leisure sector they include more than double the employment allowance freeze the small business rate multiplier extend rhl relief to maintain the small profit rate and reduce the duty on qualify draught product which represent of alcoholic drink sell in pub 
 the labour manifesto commit to replace the business rate system however last week at the treasury committee the minister seem to rule out the kind of comprehensive reform that the liberal democrats and other have be campaign for and indicate that there might only be a tinkering around the edge of rate and relief can the minister confirm today whether the government still intend to replace the business rate system or will they just be tinker around the edge of this break system 
 i think that retail hospitality and leisure business which be the backbone of our high street might object to the idea of permanently low tax rate as tinker around the edge that be a fundamental change that we want to bring in from april to make sure they have stability certainty and permanently low rate alongside it be our wide   ambition in the transforming business rates discussion paper which i invite the hon gentleman to read and respond to at last week ’s treasury committee 
 i draw member attention to my declaration in the register of interest 
 retail be an important part of the economy in my constituency which include many wonderful independent business will who run the excellent wandering palate in monton write to i about the challenge he be face will the minister outline the measure the government be take to support small business owner like will in my constituency and across the country to enable our high street to thrive 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for reference wonderful palate the business in his constituency i do not know the detail of the rateable value of that property but i point the owner to the fact that we be retain small business rate relief freeze the small business multipli next year and extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief in i also point the owner of that business and other business to our future plan as i mention to have permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure business with value of below £ as well as to consider reform to small business rate relief to well support business that want to expand into a premise 
 what consideration have minister give to exempt the seasonal tourism industry from the national insurance hike set to kick in this summer that would benefit paignton zoo and splashdown in the torbay constituency 
 we set out the detail of our decision to increase the rate of national insurance contribution from employer and to reduce the threshold and we have add the different benefit we will give particularly to small business and charity by more than double the employment allowance the employer national insurance contribution change be among the tough we take in the budget but they be necessary to repair the public finance and deliver the economic stability that be so crucial for investment and growth 
 we have have the former chair of the treasury committee so let ’s now have the current chair 
 my hon friend the exchequer secretary rightly say that small and medium sized enterprise be a vital part of our high street and our economy and of the big change be of course the change to business rate he be not tempt at the select committee last week to give more detail on the timeframe for that but many business want certainty about business rate as they go forward may i tempt he to give an indication of the government ’s think about how quickly this change might be introduce and whether the small business rate relief be likely to survive or to be subsume into a new regime 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for her question if she do not succeed in tempt i at the select committee i doubt she will succeed today but i can reassure she that the decision we have set out   about introduce the permanently low business rate for rhl retail hospitality and leisure property below a £ rateable value will be come in from april specifically in relation to small business rate relief i can confirm that the government be commit to retain that of the option we be look at in our transform business rate discussion paper be how to support business that want to expand into a premise thereby grow the business because at the moment there be the cliff edge where they lose small business rate relief 
 i call the shadow minister 
 confidence on britain ’s high street be slide fast than the chancellor will be down the ski slope of davos later today with retail sale down rather than up as expect in the run up to christmas and with the british retail consortium say that third of store will raise price to cover her national insurance increase when will the minister accept that the chancellor ’s economic strategy of raise taxis and increase regulation be not work 
 i be glad to know that the shadow minister ’s morning be well spend cook up that line about the davos ski slope what he will know and what sector across the economy will know be that have a stable economy be a prerequisite for the investment we need to get the economy grow that be why we have to take difficult decision at the autumn budget include those to increase the rate of employer national insurance contribution alongside that increase however we more than double the employment allowance and set out our plan to have permanently low tax rate for high street rhl property from april 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 a number of small high street business will be hit hard by the government ’s job tax and the dramatic reduction in business rate relief and house of commons library research that i commission show that from april the government ’s reform to business rate could leave small and independent business in effect subsidise the big chain will the chancellor meet i and a delegation of small and independent business from st albans so that we can make the case for fair reform and for wholesale reform of the break business rate system 
 of the problem with the liberal democrats be that they support all our spending plan but they do not support any of the tax change to fund they this be a prime example when we talk about increase employer national insurance contribution we acknowledge that that be of the tough decision we take at the budget but it be necessary to fix the public finance and provide support for those public service which i note the liberal democrats be very keen to support 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 when i become chancellor there be a £ black hole in the public finance we simply could not carry on like that which be why i have take control of our public finance and make growth the no priority of the government to improve living standard 
 in december i launch the phase of our spending review where for the time in year every single pound of taxpayer money will be investigate line by line to ensure that it be be spend well the spending review will set resource or day to day departmental budget until and capital departmental budget until on   june when we conclude the review i will present departmental budget to the house 
 the recent drop in the rate of inflation be welcome news for those face financial pressure across coatbridge and bellshill as be the expectation that the uk will become the fast grow economy in europe what further action be my right hon friend taking work in partnership with cabinet colleague to ensure that work family continue to see price fall and living standard rise 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i know that the cost of living have a deep impact on all our constituent include in coatbridge and bellshill like my hon friend i be pleased to see the reduction in inflation last week the bank of england ’s independence be sacrosanct to carry on those effort in addition we increase the minimum wage in the budget we have reform universal credit to reduce deduction and we have extend the household support fund all to help ensure that work family have more money in their pocket 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 a moment ago the right hon lady speak about the importance of spend money wisely so in the light of the treasury committee ’s conclusion that her new office for value for money be a waste of money do she agree that of its early action should be to abolish itself in order to save money

 the chancellor ’s answer be an answer but i do not think that it connect in any way with my question could i perhaps ask she about national insurance hike a full third of the revenue raise through labour ’s job tax be simply go on service the additional debt be run up by this profligate government give that do she really believe that the catastrophic effect of that tax on business right up and down the country be a price worth pay

 during the passage of the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill we set out clearly how the scheme would work to reimburse cost for public department or local government that measure be in line with what the previous government attempt to do with the health and social care levy where party private contractor be engage those cost will be consider by local government or other public sector organisation in the round

 the hon gentleman know that in order for we to restore public finance and put they on a firm foundation departmental settlement have to reflect the cost of the civil servant they employ that be how the departments be work as the chancellor have previously confirm the department for education have receive money to cover the cost of run the education system and the detail will be provide to school in the normal way in due course

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make a statement on community engagement principle and extremism 
 national security will always come for this government and we will always treat the threat of extremism with the seriousness that it require as the prime minister say this morning 
 britain now face a new threat 
 a threat of extreme violence from people who be drive by material online they be often now lone individual who be drive by a twisted desire for notoriety it be a threat that we must contend with alongside that from traditional terrorist group 
 the house will be aware that the home secretary will make a statement to the house shortly all aspect of this change threat will be consider in her rapid review order last year which will inform the government ’s counter extremism strategy the review panel be consider the current understanding of extremism include islamist and far right extremism and its work will include a focus on how good to tackle the threat pose by extremist ideology both online and offline early finding be set out in december alongside initial measure to tackle the challenge that we face the home office will provide a further update on the measure and action arise from the counter extremism sprint shortly 
 our department retain responsibility for community and cohesion policy and the deputy prime minister have convene a new cross government community recovery steering group to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the underlie cause of division in our local community in particular it seek to address some of the cause of the disorder across the uk follow the southport tragedy last summer we have make it clear that a new approach be urgently need and we have back that with an initial £ from the ministry of housing communities and local government community recovery fund to support area that be impact over the summer 
 this question relate to an announcement make last march by michael gove who be then secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities in which he set out some new definition of extremism include the activity of islamist and far right group and robust non engagement principle for the government to apply when there be serious concern that be particularly relevant to the mhclg portfolio which cover social service department and other organisation youth justice and prevent through which public service engage at community level with a variety of organisation to gather intelligence help people to move away from extremism and intervene and disrupt emerge challenge such as those pose by   groom gang the issue be also important for our often vilify muslim community who contribute so much to our nation 
 the principle have be set out the aim be to set out a new system for structured engagement however in july the chancellor announce £ of saving in the mhclg from small project it subsequently emerge in answer to write parliamentary question that an element of that be reduce funding for legal fee which be no long expect 
 to arise from the previous government ’s 
 cross party 
 approach to extremism 
 a series of ministers have since then find it very challenging to determine exactly what this mean but ministers have tell the house in answer to write question that the march statement reflect the position of the last government in other word that this government have choose to ditch the last government ’s policy on the non engagement principle 
 i be conscious that this be very sensitive give the statement about the southport case that we will hear later but will the minister answer some question do the department still adhere to that work definition of islamism do it still have a work definition of non violent extremism on which public body can rely should they need to defend themselves when challenge can he tell the house why ministers have not be to quote from the ministerial code”—“as open as possible on this issue will he share with the house detail of correspondence and any meeting that have take place and in particular the membership of the steering group to which he refer so that more transparency and confidence surround this process 
 i do not think it will be a revelation for member to hear that a change of government often mean a change of approach to what have be share view and share problem i believe that the last government deeply want to tackle extremism in all its form across the country and we share that desire where we differ be on the approach take by the department 
 in last year ’s write ministerial statement this i have to say be something with which i simply can not agree the previous secretary of state for whom i have a lot of respect choose for the department to assume a great deal of responsibility for the issue essentially on the part of the entire government i do not think that be the right approach for very good reason counter extremism should i believe be the fundamental purview of the home office not least because of the home office ’s access to confidential information that be often not available to the mchlg the approach that we have choose in the new government be to have a cross government but home office lead counter extremism sprint which will lead in due course to a counter extremism strategy that shape the government ’s way forward that be a different approach to what be i believe a commonly understand problem 
 i can not accept the hon gentleman ’s characterisation of the previous process as robust let we be honest it be not use the previous secretary of state make a detailed write ministerial statement and set out a system that could have lead on this issue he name some   organisation but it be very clear in the write ministerial statement that he be not prejudge any process for those organisation and he subsequently do not use the process i would question the hon gentleman ’s attachment to a previous process that the previous government choose not to use 
 on the point about openness i have answer multiple question from the shadow secretary of state and the shadow minister i will continue to do so and we will be as open as we possibly can be similarly with regard to the steering group i do not think we have make that information public but i be sure there be no problem in do so i will make sure that it be available 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 at a time when we be see such an increase in religious hate crime include islamophobia and antisemitism we all have a duty in this house to be careful about the language we use i hope that the government will look at their language because it be vital for community cohesion that we be careful and do not unintentionally inflame tension 
 there be some really critical issue to consider not just in this country but around the world the minister say that he be look at the definition of extremism and at change measure put in place by the previous government will he outline whether the government will consult on any new definition if we be honest and look back there be a lack of consultation by the previous government 
 i be grateful for the chair of the select committee ’s question language be important and it be reasonable and right that our constituent expect we to be robust with those who choose to challenge and undermine democracy and the basic principle that guide our society but also that we do not use our very privileged platform to give succour to hateful idea and prejudice indeed thing that we know about the change nature of terror be that individual be take cue from organisation that stop short of the threshold for inflame terrorist type behaviour they be use that as encouragement so we all have a responsibility to be measure in our response with regard to the engagement with the home office we want to make sure that anything that come out of the cross government sprint and into the strategy can be buy into and own by community across the country so there will be engagement 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as we know the world be a fast move and scary place and people who feel disempowered and isolate often turn to the internet they be often vulnerable and their reliance on the internet for everything in their world put they at even great risk we must work with our community leader to make the most of the information that they hold and get early notice of problem 
 what worry i be that if we make assumption and do not work with our community there be a risk of authoritarian decision making that affect all of we   what consultation have there be with community on the change and what additional burden might fall on local authority follow change to how the government work furthermore with such extreme thing take place online especially on the platform of social medium giant base across the pond what be the government actively do to unite faith and cultural leader environmental group industry and people across generation to foster unity and stop extremism across the whole spectrum 
 i agree with a lot of what the hon lady ’s say about early intervention and tackle isolation at its root as she say local authority be really important partner in that endeavour that be why we will ensure that whatever come out of our community and recovery steering group lean into the partnership with local authority and local law enforcement where possible to ensure that the right resource and support be in place 
 the hon lady ask about engagement and ensure that we have a contribution from those affect across our faith community my noble friend from the other place lord khan the faith minister have meet representative of all faith and will continue to do so the government will keep have that important dialogue with different faith group to ensure that the idea that we bring forward will be effective and be root in real life but we will also promote inter faith work which she mention i know from my own community that when we have have challenge the good thing we have have to lean on to tackle hate wherever it might emerge be the inter faith relationship 
 there be real division in our community and extremism be change at great speed although the vast majority of member in this house treat such division as a tragedy and as something that need to be solve calmly there be some sadly who appear to view it as a political opportunity do the minister agree that member need to be calm in their dialogue on this issue and that when they be not they should be call out by all political party 
 i have always feel that there be type of politician there be those who seek to move thing forward politically by bring people together and those who seek to exploit division it be up to individual hon and right hon member to decide which be their personal approach when there be divisive or border on hateful language in political party we would expect they to resolve that in their normal way with regard to leadership in this country we be certainly the lucky people in the country we get to come here every day and tackle these issue head on in the interest of our community and our country almost exclusively member use that platform for good we have important distinction and difference and that be great in a democracy but we want to bring the country together and move it forward together that be certainly the approach that i will be use 
 can the minister reassure the house on the government ’s approach to the muslim council of britain the previous government decide to break off engagement with the mcb for very real reason   include the infiltration into that organisation that have happen can the minister tell the house that he and his government will not be engage with it 
 those whom i and all my ministerial colleague in the department and all minister include the prime minister and across the government meet with be a matter of public record which can be interrogate in its right way i be go to stop short of provide a running commentary organisation by organisation with regard to who we will not meet—[interruption as i say i be not go to provide a running commentary on that organisation it be very clear from the record who i do and do not meet 
 i be a little bit concerned by the shadow minister ’s conflation of extremism with child sexual exploitation and grooming gang do my hon friend agree that how we use language be important if we be to avoid eradicate the social cohesion that many of we have spend many many year establish in our community 
 it be important that we be careful with our language and with conflation thing i know about after the many year of build trust in my community be that it take a long time to build that trust but it can be lose very quickly if we be thoughtless in the language that we use 
 when a crime have the attribute of a terrorist outrage but the police in their engagement with the community proactively announce that it be not initially be treat as such be that not bind to give rise to public suspicion that the truth be be cover up 
 i do not know what in particular the right hon gentleman be refer to—[interruption well he do not have to use cod language if he mean a specific incident there be rightly a distinction between what the government of the day do and what the police do we be not here to direct the police in line with what i have say however all public body need to be careful about the language they use because it have real world consequence 
 member across the house will know how important community engagement be to build strong community and that work together with those whose view we may not share but can respect be really important i want to pay tribute to the fantastic work of the bracknell forest interfaith forum for do exactly that in my community the conservatives when in government cut funding to the inter faith network which be work at national level what can we do to support organisation such as the bracknell forest interfaith forum to bring religious group together and to help we understand that we do indeed have more in common than that which divide we 
 there be real sadness when the previous government move away from interfaith as a model my hon friend the faith minister have be clear about how important he think it be and that be why promote interfaith work have be a core part of the work he have do so far 
 we know that a number of the individual who be radicalise be encourage to find that radicalisation by high risk platform on the dark web will the minister and the home secretary ensure that they work together with the department for culture media and sport to ensure that the online safety act do as it be intend to do which be to regulate those high risk platform rather than the secretary of state for culture media and sport just allow ofcom to step away from they and let they do what they like 
 i share the hon lady ’s intent we know that whether it be in publicly available online forum or on the dark web there be people who will use all corner of the internet to promote their view and to promote hateful ideology as part of our counter extremism sprint and the strategy that will follow from that we be look very carefully at this and at the tool that we need to tackle it 
 we will all be sadly familiar with the shocking and racist remark make by the conservative party donor frank hester last year i do not intend to repeat they in this house so that we do not have to relive they but do the minister agree that that kind of language encourage extremism and have no place in our politic 
 we all have to be careful both as individual and collectively within our party about the individual with whom we choose to associate and from whom we choose to take money so that we do not send message that we would not want to send 
 the minister mention a rapid review perhaps he can give the house a timetable as part of that review could he include the charity commission and ask what charity might be divide our community rather than unify they also could more official from the cabinet office and the home office be second to his department so that the decision around prevent and this review be take in a well way 
 on the development of the strategy i do not want to pre empt the home secretary because i be conscious that she be make the next statement on cabinet office resourcing and secondment our commitment as the house would expect be that fundamentally we be government and we must find internal way to work effectively come what may we will not hide behind that as an excuse for why thing be not effective instead when minister ask question we will address they in the spirit of government 
 i commend both side of the house on how they have respectfully approach this statement because that be really important the minister talk about the robustness of this topic and i be keen to pick he up on that because tenet in the uk be all about safety and the other be freedom of speech can the government rule out change any definition that could lead intentionally or unintentionally towards blasphemy law because free speech be really important 
 the home secretary will have the chance to talk about the counter extremism strategy in due course but i assure the hon gentleman that we have be look at the early sign from that review and these be talk about in december by my hon friend the security minister to some degree these be about the place in which hate fester rather than about legislative change 
 our thought today be with the family of those poor little girl and with everybody who be hurt in that terrible event last summer it be inexcusable that state agency miss vital opportunity to intervene in this devastating case include at crucial point follow prevent referral these failing shine a grim light on the significant crack in our public service follow year of spending cut and underinvestment will the minister join i in call for the public inquiry to consider the role of austerity since as a contribute factor to these terrible failing 
 again i be afraid i can not pre empt what the home secretary be about to say but the hon lady will have the chance to put that point to she soon in our community strategy and our attempt to ensure that community be resilient one where people can live together in harmony we be of course consider what be say in dame sara khan ’s review and of the underlie cause that she raise concern about be austerity we need to make sure that we have well resource public service we also need to ensure that people do not feel that there be any division in the allocation of resource that be in some way target against they we know that that should never be the case and would never be the case so of course we be consider that as part of our community work 
 the independent review of prevent the government programme that try to stop people be radicalise by extremist view say on its very page that 
 the fact clearly demonstrate that the most lethal threat in the last year have come from islamism and this threat continue 
 the last government know this to be true do this government 
 this government have take on the independent review of prevent and of its recommendation have be implement we be engage in the counter extremism sprint and our counter extremism strategy will flow from it the hon lady will have a chance to see that 
 i will have a go at get an answer from the minister even if he do not answer the question of my hon friend   the member for weald of kent katie lam   and my right hon friend   the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson 
 yesterday the department confirm in answer to a freedom of information request that there be internal government correspondence about the muslim council of britain that it refuse to publish can the minister overturn that decision publish the paper and confirm that there have be no discussion and no correspondence within whitehall propose re engagement with the mcb 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that the position have not move i have previously state in answer to write question that we be not meet the muslim council of britain hon member say it again i be not sure i can say it any more clearly than at the dispatch box in the chamber of the house of commons the position have not change from the previous government 
 i thank the minister for his answer to all the question in northern ireland of course we face extremism from the left and right but at the same time we have manage to have community engagement and i believe lesson can be learn it be essential that our police force have the wherewithal to deal with threat through an appropriate mechanism the designation of community threat and extremism be truly essential will the minister outline whether the process of designation can be streamline to ensure that the police have all the power they need to work within community to root out and deal with paramilitary and extremist with safeguard for human right 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s question his work on the persecution of christians across the world read across to some of those challenge in make sure we have cohesive community across the uk of course police in northern ireland be a devolved matter so it be not for a minister in the uk parliament but i assure he that we give the good insight to make sure that public institution be interact in the good way possible i often feel for junior officer who early in their service be have to deal with what be often quite complicated issue in live time we want to make sure they get the good information so that they be able to do so 
 before we come to the home secretary ’s statement i want to say that i appreciate that it have be most frustrating for the house that we have not be able to discuss the issue relate to this case because of ongoing prosecution although the case be still technically sub judice until sentence on thursday give that the accuse have plead guilty to all charge and that there be strong public interest in the house be able to discuss these matter i be grant a waiver so that members may discuss it freely i be confident that the house ’s sub judice resolution have be follow correctly and i be grateful to member for their patience in not discuss this case substantially before now i be go to ensure that the house ’s sub judice resolution be review to ensure it be fit for purpose 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on the southport murder 
 none of we will ever forget the event of   july the school holiday have just start and little girl be at a dance class to have fun dance and sing a moment of joy turn into the darkest of nightmare we think especially of little girl elsie dot stancombe bebe king and alice da silva aguiar their precious smile and the dream their family have and we think of their family agony to have that future so brutally destroy they be in all our heart and prayer as be those who survive the attack but live with the physical and emotional scar nothing will ever take away their trauma and loss and we will ensure that they receive the support and care they need in the year to come 
 we think too of the police and responder who run into that scene of unspeakable horror the courage they show and the life they save be public service at its very good 
 yesterday axel rudakubana plead guilty to all charge he stand responsible for of the most barbaric crime in our country ’s history the most vile and cowardly attack on little child who could never defend themselves carry out in the most horrific and traumatic way the crown prosecution service have describe he as 
 a young man with a sicken and sustain interest in death and violence 
 who have 
 show no sign of remorse 
 on thursday before sentencing the prosecution will set out what happen that day and the nature of those offence 
 now that the conviction have be secure the family the people of southport and the entire country need answer about how this horrendous attack could ever have happen the government have be constrain in what we could say up to this point about rudakubana ’s past to avoid prejudice any jury trial in line with all the normal rule of our british justice system because nothing be more important than secure justice but now we can start to lay out that background 
 multiple different agency be in contact with rudakubana and know about his history of violence he be refer to prevent time between december and april when aged and   between october and may lancashire police respond to call from his home address about his behaviour he be refer repeatedly to the multi agency safeguard hub he have contact with child ’s social care the early help service and child and adolescent mental health service he be convict of a violent assault against another child at school and be refer to the youth offending team he be exclude from school and have long period of absence from another 
 all those agency have contact with he yet between they they completely fail to identify the terrible danger he pose how do he fall through so many gap it be just unbearable to think that something more could and should have be do there be grave question about how this network of agency fail to identify and act on the risk there be so many sign of how dangerous he have become yet the action against he be far too weak family need the truth about why the system fail to tackle his violence for so many year 
 that be why we be set up an independent public inquiry like the angiolini inquiry into wayne couzens it will begin work on a non statutory basis so that it can move quickly into action but with statutory power add later as require we will set out the term of reference and appoint the chair once we have consult the coroner and give the family the opportunity to comment in addition to examine what go wrong in this horrific case i be also ask the inquiry to consider the wide challenge of rise youth violence and extremism 
 i have be deeply disturb at the number of case involve teenager draw into extremism serious violence and terrorism include islamist extremism far right extremism mixed and confused ideology and obsession with violence and gore in just year there have be a threefold increase in under-18s investigate for involvement in terrorism some people be refer to prevent last year for concern relate to school massacre the met commissioner have warn about 
 young man who be fixate on violence graze across extremist and terrorist content 
 and eyes counter terror partner have warn about grow radicalisation of minor happen as so many of our child and teenager be be expose to ever more disturbing material online an online ecosystem be radicalise our child while safety measure be whittle away 
 the online safety act illegal content code of practice come into force in march and the child safety code should be in place this summer but company should take responsibility before then the prosecution will provide more detail on thursday about material rudakubana search for online but i can tell the house that the government be this week contact technology company to ask they to remove the dangerous material that he access company should not be profit from host content that put child ’s life at risk 
 let i set out other area where we be take action in advance of the inquiry on prevent the government and counter terrorism policing jointly commission an immediate prevent learning review during the summer and i will publish detailed finding follow the sentencing the referral take place between and year before the southport   attack include follow evidence rudakubana be express interest in school shooting the london bridge attack the ira mi5 and the middle east 
 on each occasion rudakubana ’s case be assess by counter terrorism policing but in each instance there be no onward referral to specialist channel support the learning review have conclude that the referral should not have be close and that case such as these give the perpetrator ’s age and complex need should be refer to channel it conclude that too much weight be place on the absence of ideology without consider the vulnerability to radicalisation or take account of whether he be 
 obsess with massacre or extreme violence 
 and that the cumulative significance of those repeat referral be not properly consider 
 the prevent programme be vital to our national security and its officer work with huge dedication to keep we safe but we need it to be effective some change have already be make since include new prevent duty guidance new training for frontline worker on radicalisation and strong policy on repeat referral in september a new prevent assessment framework be launch supplement by robust training for all prevent police officer but those change do not go far enough 
 give the importance of the programme i can not understand how it have be allow to operate for so long without proper independent oversight that be why i announce before christmas the introduction of a new independent prevent commissioner with power to review case and ensure standard be be meet i be today appoint lord david anderson kc as the interim prevent commissioner to start work immediately his task will be to conduct a thorough review of the prevent history in this case to identify what change be need to make sure serious case be not miss particularly where there be mixed and unclear ideology 
 i have also task my department with conduct an end to end review of prevent threshold include on islamist extremism where referral have previously be too low we be look at case where mental ill health or neurodivergence be a factor and develop new arrangement with other agency for case that may not meet the threshold for channel counter extremism support but where violent behaviour must be address urgently 
 secondly shocking fact around knife crime have emerge from this case the prevent learning review find that rudakubana admit to have carry a knife more than time yet the action against he be far too weak despite the fact that he have be convict for violence and be just he be easily able to order a knife on amazon that be a total disgrace and it must change we will bring in strong measure to tackle knife sale online in the crime and police bill this spring 
 thirdly as the prime minister have set out this morning we need to ensure our law keep up with the change violent and extremist threat that we face it be for the police and cps to decide whether individual case meet the definition set out in the terrorism act when make charge but give the grow number of case   where perpetrator be seek to terrorise even without a clear ideology we need to ensure that the law power and sentencing be strong enough to cope i have therefore ask the independent reviewer on terrorism power to examine the legislation in this area in light of the modern threat we face 
 finally let i address the issue of contempt of court the british way of justice mean that information be present to the court by the police and cps with restriction on what can be say beforehand so that the jury do not get partial or prejudicial information in advance and to ensure the trial be fair and justice be do social medium put those long establish rule under strain especially where partial and inaccurate information appear online and the law commission be review the contempt of court rule in that light but let i be clear that where the police government and journalist be give clear advice from the cps about contempt of court and about not publish information in advance of a trial if we do not respect that and a killer walk free we would never be forgive 
 there be time when something so unfathomably terrible happen that whatever word we find feel grossly insufficient and that be how it feel over the southport attack let there be no doubt responsibility for this outrage lie squarely with the perpetrator equally in the wake of such a monstrous atrocity we have to ask every question no matter how difficult and where change be need we must act that now be our task we owe that to the victim and their loved one and we owe it to the country because protect the public be the duty of the government and the share purpose of this house i commend this statement to the house 
 rise 
 order let we start and i will try to call everybody who be here on time i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement and for the briefing she kindly arrange 
 let we remember the young innocent victim of this savage and senseless attack bebe king be just year old elsie dot stancombe be and alice da silva aguiar be year old their life be cruelly cut short as they attend a taylor swift dance class it should have be a time of joy part of a precious and innocent childhood to be cherish and remember and yet the dark of shadow fall over southport that day as those girl be rob of their young life let we not forget that more child and adult be seriously injure on that day as well many of we in the house be parent or grandparent and many people listen today will be too we can only begin to imagine the pain and grief the parent and family of bebe elsie and alice must now be feel we should recognise and thank the responder who arrive at the scene
