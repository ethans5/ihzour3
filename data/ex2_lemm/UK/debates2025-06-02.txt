last month i have the honour of visit rbsl rheinmetall bae systems land in my constituency along with many defence company and organisation it be so proud of its effort to help britain to defend itself here and around the world the sdr provide certainty to industry but we need to go far to ensure that every government agency body and department from skill and infrastructure to planning and the availability of land get behind its ethos do the secretary of state agree that create growth cluster zone will provide certainty to local community and assist in that mission 
 far to that point of order mr speaker we have followed—[interruption you want an answer from i mr speaker and i will certainly give you this we have follow the procedure from the last defence review when the shadow defence secretary   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge be a defence minister i be the shadow defence secretary at that time we have no advance copy of the defence review we be not offer a briefing which i have offer he and the other front benchers i be really concerned to ensure that the house have proper access to the report but we have be follow convention you be quite right mr speaker that copy of the defence review be in the vote office as be establish procedure they would normally be make available when i sit down after my statement in these circumstance follow your encouragement i suggest that member of this house be give access to they in advance of my statement 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of uk visas and immigration processing time 
 uk visas and immigration process million of visa application each year most of they be process to the publish customer service standard which be a huge tribute to our hard work staff and indeed most straightforward application be decide within week in the year end march more than visit visa more than work visa and more than health and social care visa be issue on occasion as the hon member may be aware there be some technical or processing error which be resolve as quickly as possible when they come to light 
 this be not about call centre answering and application processing time it be about the backlog in digital status become fully operational a north east fife constituent have settle status and have do all the step in set up her ukvi account yet on both her recent trip abroad she be tell that her passport be not link to her e visa be this a off in which case can the minister review what have go wrong or be it a system failure in which case what be the minister do to address it 
 i thank the hon member for her question i would be happy to look at that case the personal detail on the document associate with that person ’s e visa may well have not be update update the detail may be the step necessary after which the issue may go away 
 the problem with the immigration system we inherit be that it have very high level of low skilled immigration but what the economy actually need be low level of high skilled immigration we need to attract worldwide top talent for some key sector many of which be base in edinburgh east and musselburgh so that we remain globally competitive but business tell i that long visa processing time work against that now that we be see low level of immigration will the government be reprioritise resource so we see fast processing of skilled worker visa 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he will be aware that visa processing time can vary base on the type of visa and where people be apply from however for most application even those make outside the uk decision be usually make within week he will also be aware that we be look at how to reform our immigration system as a result of the record level of net migration under the previous government and make sure that we focus our immigration on the need of our economy be a priority for this government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 new research show that foreign national be claim almost £ in benefit each month we now face the high number of asylum claim ever record up another since labour take office meanwhile the appeal backlog at the end of be project to more than double to almost by the end of this year the home secretary herself have admit to the medium that her white paper would cut immigration by just this be utterly inadequate without real deterrence and strict measure the visa processing delay will only worsen so will the minister commit to concrete measure implement the previous conservative threshold of £ and introduce a legally binding annual migration cap that actually deliver accountability 
 order can i just say to the shadow minister that we have a lot of member to get in i want to get to question on the order paper and i need her help to do so 
 this be yet another example of the opposition want to rewrite history the conservatives quadruple net migration to record level i think the hon member will want to correct herself on the immigration white paper which will be reduce net migration by considerably more than she suggest the home secretary have say so the late figure show that since this government come to power almost foreign criminal fail asylum seeker and other with no right to be in the uk have be remove that include an increase of enforce return in the last quarter compare with the same period last year which be a much well record than the shadow home secretary could achieve 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood police in bracknell forest 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 what recent progress her department have make on improve neighbourhood policing 
 what step her department be take to improve neighbourhood policing 
 we be provide £ across england and wales this financial year to increase neighbourhood policing as part of our neighbourhood policing guarantee every community will have name contactable officer dedicate to address local issue alongside that during the course of this year we will have additional officer and police community support officer work in neighbourhood team i be pleased to tell my hon friend   the member for bracknell peter swallow   that for thames valley police that will include an extra police officer on the street this year 
 bracknell forest have see a spate of tool theft recently tool theft be a double whammy trader have to fork out thousand for new tool all while they be out of work i have raise this issue with thames valley police and the police and crime commissioner but what more can be do through the government ’s neighbourhood policing guarantee to stamp down on this cruel crime 
 my hon friend be exactly right to raise that serious crime honest hard work tradespeople in community across the country be be rob of their livelihood as a result of this kind of crime that be why we be work with the national police chiefs council on how we target the serious and organised crime that be often behind such equipment and tool theft and put neighbourhood police back on the street in community so they can both work on prevention and go after the criminal responsible 
 under the previous government the number of pcso more than halve in warwickshire indeed in summer local teacher be force to police a park in warwick and leamington after a knife gang terrorise pupil steal their bike more widely constituent be feed up with crime and antisocial behaviour say that they have be personally impact by crime in the past year will the home secretary outline how the government will address these crime and make our street safe for everyone 
 my hon friend be right to raise the importance of pcso as well as police officer in neighbourhood team work to prevent crime he be also right to raise concern over the last year of the previous government both street theft and shoplifting increase by more than at the same time as neighbourhood police be cut we be put the bobby back on the beat 
 this week i will be meet new community police officer who begin their role on the beat thank to the government ’s investment through the national policing guarantee do the home secretary agree that invest in community policing be the good way to tackle so much of the crime that blight our community will she join i in wish these vital officer all the good as they begin their new role 
 my hon friend be right to welcome the additional neighbourhood police in thurrock she will know that that be part of additional neighbourhood police officer across essex just this year as a result of our neighbourhood policing guarantee and we will go beyond that she be right too that local police who know what the problem be in thurrock and across essex be crucial to tackle local crime 
 across neighbourhood in my earley and woodley constituency i have see too many incident of electric bike and electric scooter be ride dangerously include on pavement resident have tell i of collision in area such as woodley precinct and kennet island i have be raise the issue with thames valley police and i be very glad to hear the home secretary ’s announcement of neighbourhood officer across our   region but what more can she and the home office do to support the work of the police in crack down on dangerous rider 
 my hon friend be right we need to make sure that thames valley have the additional neighbourhood police just this year and give they the power they need that be why we be strengthen the crime and policing bill both on dangerous cycling and dangerous riding and give the police strong power to take e scooter and off road bike literally off the road 
 i recently meet the chief constable of west mercia to discuss neighbourhood policing the west mercia area cover worcestershire herefordshire and shropshire and the word be that the integrate care board reorganisation will split that area into that cover warwickshire and that cover some of shropshire i have have a letter from the police and crime commissioner cite the chief constable ’s concern that amid that reorganisation and the local government reorganisation safeguard the most vulnerable and child could fall between the crack will the home secretary have a word with her cabinet colleague to ensure that do not happen 
 the hon member make a really important point because have link between local service be crucial we will ensure that the home office look into and take up the point she raise so we can ensure strong local partnership work to tackle crime 
 last week i visit many retail business in north devon that be suffer from prolific shoplifting this be a big problem across the country will the home secretary explain what she be do to help police force resource the tackling of shoplift and deal with antisocial behaviour 
 the hon member be right there have be an increase in shoplift in recent year at the same time as neighbourhood police number have fall as a result of the neighbourhood policing guarantee there will be additional neighbourhood police officer and pcso in devon and cornwall police over the next month that be important but we be also strengthen their power to tackle shoplift 
 will the home secretary acknowledge the role that special constable play in neighbourhood policing and do she agree that grant special constable the right to unpaid time from their employment to perform their duty would assist in their recruitment 
 the hon member make a really important point about the role of special we want they to be able to play a much strong role not just in neighbourhood police but across the board people who take time out to be part of police force can bring all kind of additional skill we be work on what more can be do to support special and their recruitment which have plummet in recent year it be important that that trend be turn around 
 in north ascot neighbourhood police have be out on the street try to clamp down on pavement parking which force disabled and vulnerable people on to the road and into dangerous situation will the home secretary outline what more could be do to help neighbourhood police when it come to pavement parking 
 the hon member will know that neighbourhood police understand the challenge in each area whether it be in north ascot or other part of the country and local police can target those issue and work with local council there be different rule for different council so combine work between the council and the police be the good way to tackle local crime 
 i call the shadow minister 
 of britain ’s most senior police officer have warn that the government ’s action be make it hard to keep our street safe from the damaging job tax to release criminal early labour be push force to the brink do the home secretary agree with met commissioner sir mark rowley that he will be force to cut police officer pcso and staff this year 
 i gently remind the hon member that thousand of police and pcso be take off our street under the conservatives that be why the number of people who say that they never see the police in their community double under the conservatives this government be turn that around with additional police on our street this year alone that include more neighbourhood police on london ’s street 
 we do not get to whether mark rowley be right or wrong and i notice that the home secretary forget to mention the hundred of million be gobble up by labour ’s job tax or the fact that police number reach record level under the last government 
 that aside the national police chiefs council have publish its anti racism commitment say that racial equality do not mean treat everyone the same or be colour blind and call for arrest rate to be artificially engineer to be the same across racial group do the home secretary agree that the police should respond to people ’s action regardless of race if so why do the police minister endorse this barmy document 
 the shadow minister be as he know talk nonsense the police have to police without fear or favour that be the standard that they apply and sign up to i be really sorry that he want to undermine the important work of police across the country just as his party in government undermine the number of police on the street take they off the street so we end up with thousand few police on our street this government be finally put they back into community and back on the beat where they belong 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 peaceful protest be a fundamental right in any free society but for protest to remain safe and orderly a visible well train and effective police presence be often need on top of exist   neighbourhood police team city such as manchester be see rise number of demonstration which the combine authority estimate will cost up to £ this year to police while the met receive specific grant to cover the cost of police protest greater manchester police receive no such allocation that be not only unfair to my constituent but unsustainable in the light of the worry highlight by police leader about their funding be cut in the upcoming spending review can the home secretary ensure that area such as greater manchester receive the funding they need to police protest properly without take away from the neighbourhood police our community deserve 
 we will continue to support greater manchester police and police force across the country it be right that they should be able to deal with issue and challenge include public order we be strengthen the system in that area as a result of weakness in the national co ordination that we have inherit i can tell the hon lady that greater manchester police will be get additional police officer for their neighbourhood team over the course of this year 
 what step her department be take to help tackle the antisocial use of off road bike 
 what step her department be take to help tackle vehicle nuisance 
 off road bike career through estate and community be dangerous and an antisocial nightmare we be give the police strong power to seize bike without the need for repeat warning in order to help keep our street safe 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer my constituent around weston shore have have enough of exactly the kind of thing she describe antisocial motorbike be race outside their home every night   the constant noise disturb everyone ’s sleep yet they have see no meaningful enforcement in recent year the secretary of state have outline that further power be come will she confirm that she expect local police force to use these power fully to tackle this issue seriously so that this blight on my constituent life can be stop 
 my hon friend be exactly right the issue he raise will resonate with people across the country whether it be southampton or south tyneside too many area be face the blight of off road bike and street racing at the moment the police have to give people multiple warning it can be strike or strike and the bike be still on the street that be not good enough we want to make it much easy for the police so that it be strike and out 
 i thank the home secretary for her response in kent we be use section power to confiscate bike include in snodland and walderslade in my constituency however the police have state that   the legislation be not powerful enough and that they welcome power to seize bike can we ensure that police inspector and police and crime commissioner be give guidance and that the number of vehicle seize be monitor so that we can stop this problem once and for all 
 my hon friend be right we need to ensure that the police have the power that they need and be able to act swiftly we want to make it easy for they to crush bike more quickly as well as to seize they and take they off the street and that require additional neighbourhood police in kent that mean an additional neighbourhood police officer and there be similar number for hampshire 
 many resident in my constituency complain about motorcycle noise from illegally modify exhaust can the home secretary inform i of her plan to help local police and local authority address this nuisance 
 the hon member be right to raise this issue noise and speed be use deliberately in order to harass people and intimidate local resident it be disgraceful antisocial behaviour and it be really unfair on local family that be why we need to give the police strong power to clamp down on it 
 off road bike be often use illegally across private farmland cause damage to crop spook animal and leave farmer feel scared and vulnerable while the crime and policing bill include a provision to make it easy for the police to seize vehicle associate with antisocial behaviour avon and somerset police have little or no resource to police rural crime properly what step be the secretary of state take to stop the illegal use of off road bike on farmland 
 as well as strengthen the law we be work with the national police chiefs council on a strong rural crime strategy i can tell the hon lady that avon and somerset police will be get additional neighbourhood police officer across the area this year as a result of the neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against shop worker in rural area 
 under the previous government shop theft be allow to reach epidemic proportion there be a increase in the last year of the previous government we be work hard to tackle this epidemic in every area of our country include rural area through our crime and policing bill we be introduce a new stand alone offence of assault against a retail worker we will not tolerate worker face abuse and violence simply for do their job whether that be in town or in rural area 
 convenience store be at the heart of our community and provide employment for over people in shop in north west leicestershire but worker often face abuse when i visit of my   local shop recently i be tell that just a few day early the assistant manager have be punch in the face when he be just do his job although the assault have be report the police have yet to pay a visit will the minister share her plan to support rural policing in constituency such as mine so that we can tackle violence against shop worker 
 may i express my concern about the attack on my hon friend ’s constituent it be totally unacceptable under the retail crime action plan the police make operational commitment to prioritise attendance where violence have be use some progress have be make but much more need to be do i will ensure that every police force understand how seriously the government take this offence the additional police officer and police community support officer who will be in place as a result of our neighbourhood policing guarantee might go some way to help with that 
 i recently visit the huntingdon branch of barclays bank in my rural constituency where staff highlight to i that although the crime and policing bill will make assault a shop worker an offence branch staff in bank and building society be not include in that classification despite the fact that they work on the high street and be subject to the same threat and intimidation as shop worker there be over instance of abuse in branch last year what rationale can the minister provide for exclude branch staff in bank and build society from the protection give to retail staff who work next to they 
 a case have be make over several year for why retail worker should be cover by this specific offence work be do with the co op the union of shop distributive and allied workers and many other to get the evidence together if there be evidence from the financial sector and from bank i want to see it so i ask the hon gentleman to talk to the people with whom he be have conversation about this i be very open to look at this but at the moment we have draw up the offence on the basis of the evidence available to we 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of create a visa scheme for people in gaza relate to uk national 
 i know that we be all desperately concerned about the intolerable humanitarian situation in gaza the uk along with france germany and many other continue to call for an immediate ceasefire the release of hostage and more aid into gaza there be a range of route available for those wish to join family member in the uk and we be work with the israeli palestinian and other authority in the region to help british national and other eligible people to leave gaza via safe route 
 the situation in gaza be beyond devastating more than life have be lose hospital be be bomb people be be torture and starvation be be use as a weapon of war palestinians in the uk be rightly scared that they may not see their mother father brother or sister survive these atrocity the government rightly respond to the war in ukraine by offer a family visa scheme so that ukrainians could travel here to join their family be it not time for a similar scheme a gaza family scheme that offer the same solidarity and respect for life 
 the statement that we recently issue with france and germany call for israel to immediately restart a rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to gaza be vital we still need to see so much more action be take any decision to implement a bespoke visa scheme would need to consider a range of factor include the unique crisis situation and the relevant impact on security compliance and return as i have say immediate family member be able to join those in the uk use of the exist family route 
 my constituent in taunton have a proud record of support refugee they would support refugee from gaza as they do those from other country but charity that support refugee come to i with concern about the asylum accommodation be allocate to the town will the minister meet i to discuss the concern about the late allocation on which i be not consult and about which i receive no notification 
 i will be very happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the incidence of fraud 
 what step she be take to help tackle fraud 
 what step her department be take to help protect consumer against fraud 
 we monitor fraud trend very closely fraud be a grow transnational threat that require urgent action that be why the government be develop a new fraud strategy which cover well collaboration with industry improve public awareness and improve collaboration with international partner 
 the figure be of course come down but the incidence of fraud much of it online be now back up to a new high many factor be involve but will the government look at take further step include require enhanced intelligence sharing between platform and bank and well mandatory user identification on site such as date app and online marketplace 
 i know that the right hon gentleman take these matter seriously but i gently remind the house that under the last government lord agnew then minister with responsibility for counter fraud literally resign at the dispatch box among other thing he accuse the treasury of have little interest in the consequence of fraud for our society it be precisely because of the important point that the right hon gentleman raise that a national fraud squad of some new specialist investigator be be recruit that will be lead by the national crime agency ’s national economic crime centre work closely with the city of london police we will do all we can to protect the public from fraud 
 a study last year show that more than in people over have be scamme in the last year lose an average of £ in each scam in half of those case the money be never recover and that be just at the small end of the scale even in the past week as a result of development in artificial intelligence there have be exponential improvement to scam which be more convincing and realistic than ever before what be the home office do to protect people especially the more vulnerable by inform they about ai scam 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to raise concern the number that she reference be deeply concern combat fraud and beating scammer require raise public awareness and i be grateful for the work that she have do on this i can tell she that the home office be work closely with the banking telecom digital and tech sector to improve system and share datum fast with law enforcement over stakeholder from across industry be involve in the development of our new fraud strategy public communication target support for the most vulnerable and ai be key part of our strategy 
 the government have outline a clear ambition to make the uk a global hub for the crypto industry to support our growth mission many of our constituent be already regularly engage with crypto what assessment have the minister make of the crypto sector and particularly of the step require to protect consumer and investor while ensure that we allow the industry to develop 
 stability and security remain key to ensure the health and growth of the uk economy protect investor and consumer be central to that we be continually evolve our capability include by work closely with industry partner to ensure that security be front and centre of the uk ’s framework for the crypto sector 
 facebook marketplace be responsible for quarter of the fraud on social medium yet it seem uninterested in do anything about that will the minister assure the house that he will take facebook to task in order to clamp down on that fraud and make sure that consumer be protect 
 the online safety act will require tech company to take measure to prevent fraudulent content on their platform or face significant fine   under the act the large firm will be require to do all they can to prevent fraudulent advertising from appear on their platform 
 what step her department be take to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 we be already take significant step to make sure that violence against woman and girl be treat as the national emergency that it be that include launch our domestic abuse protection order and invest almost £ this year in specialist service for victim and in project to help prevent vawg and improve our response to it later this year we will publish our cross government vawg strategy which will set out our long term plan to tackle the crisis 
 for some family of victim further review of release decision can provide some solace but it can not do so for my constituent doreen soulsby her daughter ’s murderer be release before the victims and courts bill pass through this place will the minister meet doreen and i to discuss clause of the bill and the release of life prisoner 
 yes of course as my hon friend know i have have a strong bond with doreen for many year of course i would be delighted to meet he and she 
 research undertake by women for refugee women have find that ban work for woman seek asylum lead many woman sadly to stay in unwanted and abusive relationship will the minister consider lift the ban on asylum seeker work and will she specifically include woman seek asylum in the government ’s upcoming strategy to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 it be well beyond my remit as safeguard minister to make asylum policy but i can absolutely guarantee the hon lady that migrant woman and their experience will be part of the violence against woman and girl strategy this issue have receive some of the money from the recent uplift in victim service work together with by and for service across the country we will always take account of the experience of all woman and girl in our country 
 i call shadow minister katie lam 
 on   april the minister be clear with this house that the framework for local grooming gang inquiry and baroness casey ’s audit would both be publish in may it be now june presumably there be a new timeline for publish they so will the minister share it with we please 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and i apologise for the month ’s wait i wait year for anyone to do anything baroness casey have request a short extension to her work from the home secretary   and the home secretary have inform the home affairs committee of this we expect the report very shortly and when we have it the government will respond to it and will lay out their plan with all the evidence in hand 
 what step her department be take to help tackle knife crime 
 we have take action to ban zombie knife and the ban on ninja sword will come in this august we be also bring forward ronan ’s law which put strong restriction on online sale through the crime and policing bill there will also be additional funding through the hotspot action fund for high visibility patrol in the area with the most knife crime and antisocial behaviour 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer and for the seriousness with which this government be tackle the scourge of knife crime in constituency like mine in redditch the anti knife crime campaigner pete martin be make a real difference by educate young people in school about the danger of knife crime will the secretary of state consider visit redditch to see pete ’s work at hand and the real difference that it be make in our school 
 can i pass on my thank through my hon friend to the team who be do such good work in his community we be certainly keen to know more about that because he be right about local work prevent young people from be draw into knife crime that be why we be set up the young futures prevention programme and we be introduce a new law on child criminal exploitation to go after the gang who draw young people into crime 
 as sussex police consider how to tackle knife crime in eastbourne and invest in community policing i have be urge they to prioritise investment in their grove road premise in the town centre as oppose to their hammonds drive industrial estate premise do the secretary of state agree that we should prioritise investment in town centre such in eastbourne so that we can well tackle knife crime there 
 obviously police force have to make their own operational decision but we do believe that town centre need to be a particular focus of neighbourhood policing and when it come to prevent youth crime include knife crime sussex police be get additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer under the neighbourhood policing guarantee this year but we be also focus on hotspot policing target the area with the high knife crime 
 what step her department be take to tackle illegal working 
 clamp down on illegal working be a crucial element of our strategy to tackle immigration crime since come to office this government have increase raid arrest and civil penalty to their high level in year our border security asylum and immigration bill will introduce tough provision in this area particularly to bolster our enforcement action against illegal working in the gig economy 
 good employer in my constituency of paisley and renfrewshire south those who conduct employment check and employ people on decent term and condition be be undercut by unscrupulous firm that use exploitative practice and prey on the vulnerability of people seek a well life here in the uk what step be be take to protect people from exploitation and employer who do the right thing 
 enforcement of the law be the good way to deal with this issue which be why there have be a increase in visit to check whether illegal working be go on and a increase in arrest since this government come to office 
 i call the father of the house 
 could i be counterintuitive for a moment and make a new labour point the cause of a lot of illegal migration be the fact that it be easy to work here illegally than anywhere else in europe and that be because we do not have national identity card the gordon brown government quite wisely be go to bring they in and the coalition government wrongly stop that idea why should we not have national consensus now on bring in national identity card give that we all carry mobile phone it would dramatically reduce illegal working 
 i be reel at the new labour point that the father of the house have make e visa basically give we the capacity to do a similar thing and they be easily check which be why in the border security bill we be extend those check to the gig and hour economy 
 around our asylum hotel on blackpool seafront we see increase illegal working in our takeaway bar and restaurant will the minister outline to my constituent how this government be tackle that illegal working to ensure that we have safe space for people in the job in our vital tourism industry 
 we be tackle illegal working by significantly increase enforcement that be why we have have a increase in visit and a increase in the number of arrest for illegal working there be fine of £ per illegal worker discover and those who be discover work illegally can be arrest and put on the route to deportation 
 surely the good way to tackle illegal working be to make more legal opportunity the island of stranger immigration policy will cause huge issue for the workforce in scotland the care service say that it could threaten the whole sector   asylum seeker wait for their case to be process be in effect an unused resource why not shorten the time that asylum seeker have to wait before be allow to work to bring some relief to such sector 
 we be shorten the time that it take to process asylum claim by get the system that we inherit from the conservatives work again that be why there have be a increase in the number of initial claim process that follow a fall in the period before the last election 
 if she will establish a national statutory inquiry into rape gang 
 child sexual exploitation and abuse be the most horrific crime and the government be take decisive action to ensure that victim and survivor of groom gang get the justice that they deserve we be deliver on the key recommendation of the year independent inquiry into child sexual abuse include the recommendation on mandatory reporting we have ask all police force in england and wales to review historical case in which no further action be take and to reopen investigation and we have commission baroness louise casey to conduct a national audit of the nature and scale of groom gang and this offending in this country we will leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of truth and justice 
 senior figure in the catholic church and the church of england be find to have conspire to cover up child abuse by priest senior figure in the labour party be now oppose local inquiry in place such as bradford london and wales and ministers here oppose a national rape inquiry we have also hear from a former labour member of parliament simon danczuk that he be tell not to raise the issue of the ethnicity of some of the perpetrator when will labour put aside its electoral interest and stand on the side of the abused 
 the idea that i or the prime minister have ever put anything other than the interest of the victim of groom gang at the heart of everything that we have ever work for be frankly for the bird we have increase the number of arrest of the perpetrator that the right hon gentleman talk about we will continue to pursue these violent abusive vicious abuser through the court through justice and i will continue to take my counsel not from he but from the victim in this country 
 whether her proposal to increase the standard qualifying period for settlement to year would apply retrospectively 
 settlement in the uk be a prerequisite for become a british citizen and   it be also an important step in integrate and contribute to local community and the country the white paper propose an expansion of the point base system to increase the standard qualifying period for settlement to year individual will have the opportunity to reduce the qualifying period base on their contribution to the uk economy and society we will consult on the earn settlement scheme later this year after that we will provide detail of how the scheme will work include in respect of any transitional arrangement for those already in the uk 
 kamala move to the uk in as a skilled worker in my oxfordshire constituency they work to discover novel drug for disease with no current treatment they be an additional rate taxpayer and have make many professional and personal tie here the sudden increase to the qualifying period from to year have plunge hard work people like kamala into uncertainty about their future will the minister meet i to understand the impact of the policy not just on worker like kamala but on the government ’s wide science and research objective 
 the change be indeed important we recognise how important they be to people and will listen to what people tell we in the consultation after that we will provide detail of how the scheme will work include in respect of any transitional arrangement for those already in the uk 
 my constituent emily ask i to raise this issue in the house only yesterday so i be take the opportunity to do so emily be a carer and have care for a number of people across the harlow community will the consultation on the earn settlement scheme take into account the hugely important role that carer sometimes from overseas do to support the most vulnerable in our community 
 indeed carer include those who have come from overseas do important work to support we our family and our community my hon friend will recognise that as i have say it be important for we to ensure that people ’s voice can be hear in the consultation we recognise that settlement be an important step in integrate and contribute to local community and family under the current system people primarily qualify for settlement on the basis of their length of time in the uk but we also believe that people should be contribute to the economy and society before they gain settle status in our country 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 another group for whom the immigration white paper be create uncertainty be refugee family family reunion be a vital route by which refugee can safely reach the uk free from the grasp of criminal trafficking gang the government should be look for more way to facilitate refugee family reunion not hinder it it be unclear how the white paper ’s reform on english language requirement will apply to refugee family reunion will the minister acknowledge the need of this unique and vulnerable group be she able to provide clarity on the level of   english language proficiency that people who apply for refugee family reunion will be expect to have once the reform be implement 
 i thank the hon member for her question she will know that in the immigration white paper we have reference that we will be look at reform of the family rule and we will be consult on that 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 may i pay tribute to the responder the police ambulance fire service and other who deal with the horrific incident at the liverpool parade some of whom i meet last week i know that the thought of the whole house will be with those who be injure and affect 
 the house will also have see the disgraceful and unacceptable small boat crossing on saturday no should be make those journey and criminal gang be likely to have make million of pound this weekend alone the gang be increasingly operate a model where boat be launch from far along the coast and people climb in from the water exploit french rule that have stop their police take any action in the sea that be completely unacceptable the previous government raise the issue with france for year but to no avail and i have raise it with the french government since the summer the french minister of the interior and the french cabinet have now agree that their rule need to change a french maritime review be look at what new operational tactic they will use and we be urge france to complete the review and implement the change as swiftly as possible this weekend i have again be in touch with the french minister of the interior who support strong action and further discussion be under way this week i will update the house in due course 
 on friday in my constituency i meet the leader of hillingdon council which host asylum seeker in home office accommodation the most per capita of any local authority in the country he tell i that the council face a £ per annum funding shortfall which be more that its entire budget for library and culture on support asylum seeker what plan do the home secretary have to ensure that local authority be reimburse in full for the role they play in support asylum seeker in this country 
 the hon member raise an important point and we do inherit an unacceptable asylum backlog include huge and unacceptable bill for asylum accommodation we have already bring the bill for asylum accommodation down save hundred of million of pound with hundred of million of pound more to be save over the course of this year that be a result of the action we be take to clear the backlog that the previous government leave we with and as part of that we be work with the ministry of housing communities and local government on how to co ordinate support for local council 
 crawley be home to the tinsley house and brook house immigration removal centre and their associate scandal what consideration be be give to the home affairs committee ’s inquiry into immigration detention include end the use of such centre for indefinite detention 
 immigration centre be not use for indefinite detention we can only keep anyone in detention in an immigration centre if there be a reasonable prospect of their removal if there be not they have to be release 
 i call shadow home secretary chris philp 
 i join the home secretary in pay tribute to the people and emergency service in liverpool 
 on the home secretary ’s watch this year so far have be the bad in history for illegal immigrant cross the channel the government ’s laughable claim to smash the gang lie in tatter they be not smash gang they be smash record the right hon lady mention the french the french prevention rate on land be lamentably under and even those who be stop be then release to attempt a crossing again the next day although she talk about action at sea nothing have happen whatsoever at the weekend we see picture of the french police just stand there take photograph while illegal immigrant depart do the home secretary agree that the recent year fishing deal should be suspend until the french agree to stop those small boat at sea and prevent illegal immigration 
 let i remind the shadow home secretary that when he be immigration minister he say 
 i will continue to push my french counterpart to look hard at interception at sea 
 year of conservative government later the french government have not agree to any change at all this government have reach a new agreement with france and we be now press for that to be operationalise as swiftly as possible but we will not take lesson from a former immigration minister who on his watch let legal migration treble and small boat crossing soar more than tenfold 
 immigration be at a record level on the home secretary ’s watch but as usual she do not answer the question or take responsibility let i try this instead it emerge yesterday that the attorney general lord hermer choose not to refer for a long sentence under the unduly lenient sentencing scheme as the attorney general can a man who have be give just month for rape yet lucy connolly get more prison time for a tasteless tweet why do lord hermer think rape be less serious than twitter comment this be tier justice in action do this not show that lord hermer have appal judgment and the prime minister should fire he 
 the question come from a former police minister under whose government charge rate for rape and domestic abuse plummet while charge   rate for crime drop substantially this government support much strong action on violence against woman and girl because we recognise the serious damage that those crime do shamefully the previous government leave we with a shocking legacy on crime on immigration and across the board but this government be turn that around 
 at the home affairs committee we have hear worrying evidence about unaccompanied child arrive in this country and be place in wholly unsuitable accommodation include stay in room with adult male which present safeguard risk clearly there be issue about the age assessment process at the border and the responsibility of the contractor who organise the accommodation will the minister tell the house what step the government be take to ensure child in this country be safe 
 when people arrive and claim to be child there be test at the border to check whether we think they be child if they be accept as child they be put into local authority care so they should not be in asylum accommodation at all if they be see to be adult and end up in asylum accommodation they can always make an appeal to the local authority that they be in and undergo what be know as a merton age assessment test which will decide on their age once and for all 
 on saturday illegal migrant pour into the united kingdom by small boat many give spurious reason to stay here so when will the government repeal the human rights act for immigration case and take back control of our border 
 to tackle illegal migration we must work across border in co operation with other jurisdiction be we to leave the european convention on human right we could not work with those that sign up to it 
 on saturday resident in westerhope tell i how nuisance vehicle illegal and modified e bike off road bike and speed car be make their life an absolute misery and i have have similar complaint from resident in slatyford and newbiggin the chief constable of northumbria tell i that his force have already triple the number of vehicle impound over the past few year so it be keen to enforce the law such as they be will the minister set out how her new proposal will make life well for resident in newcastle 
 i welcome what my hon friend have say this be a problem up and down the land at the moment police force be do their good but the crime and policing bill will allow they to seize vehicle that be be use in an antisocial way without have to give any warning and then to destroy they that be the way forward but i pay tribute to the work that be already ongoing with police force 
 since take office almost a year ago the home secretary have spectacularly fail to put a cap on illegal immigration or a deterrent in place and this weekend ’s record number of boat crossing demonstrate that she have clearly completely fail to take control of our border what can she say in all honesty to my constituent about her plan because clearly it be not work 
 give that the right hon member be a member of the previous government her question might be rather more plausible if she apologise for the fold increase in small boat crossing under her government ’s watch and for the quadrupling of net migration as a result of the policy that she support in government if she want to support strong action against illegal migration and the gang that be organise it why will she not support the counter terrorism power that this government be put in place to go after they 
 in the light of the ban on disposable vape which come into force this week will the minister outline the measure be take to step up the work at port include at east midlands airport to prevent counterfeit and ban vape from be import into the country 
 while border force do not routinely disclose information of a port specific nature in the calendar year of it seize approximately e cigarette and vape at the uk border border force have a robust approach to seizure base on intelligence receive from its partner i know that my hon friend have raise this issue previously and i be very happy to meet with she to discuss it 
 in my constituency we have see the park police slash from bushy park and rate of theft and knife crime soar the metropolitan police commissioner warn last week that the home secretary will not meet her laudable target on neighbourhood policing tackle knife crime and tackle violence against woman and girl without additional investment can she reassure my constituent that they will see the bobby on the beat that she have promise or will they see only the chancellor ’s iron fist 
 i can tell the hon lady that more than additional neighbourhood police officer will be on the street in london this year as a result of our neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 there be increase concern in my constituency that a number of deliveroo rider be subcontract to unregistered rider some of whom be work illegally will the minister say what be be do to crack down and ensure that all deliveroo rider be register and be not here work illegally 
 there be an amendment to the border security asylum and immigration bill that extend the requirement to check illegal working to the   gig economy the hour economy and all those area that have non traditional employer employee relationship i look forward to be able to operationalise that when the bill become law 
 regard non crime hate incident and the amount of police time take to investigate they do the minister agree that the clue be in the name they be non crime do she also agree that already stretch police should focus their effort on tackle real crime rather than be the virtue signal thought police 
 the home secretary have be very clear about the priority that police force should actually focus on as agree with the home secretary the national police chiefs council and the college of policing be conduct a review of non crime hate incident we will update parliament in due course on the finding of that review and any change that may be require to the code of practice introduce by the shadow home secretary in march 
 doncaster east ’s neighbourhood police team recently seize multiple steal offroad bike use tactic include drone and high visibility patrol its swift action have make a real difference in tackle antisocial behaviour in place such as hatfield and dunscroft i commend the team on its work and the public support it have receive through its where ’s the bike campaign in the light of that i ask the minister about the progress around the neighbourhood policing guarantee and when doncaster east and the isle of axholme can see name police officer in their town 
 order 
 i welcome the work that south yorkshire police have be do and the doncaster east neighbourhood police team go after the offroad bike which cause havoc and be a total nightmare in the community they be get additional neighbourhood police as part of the neighbourhood policing guarantee and we will give they strong power to keep the street safe 
 leicestershire police have sign a report £ contract with palantir a company that have a worrying history of racial profiling and surveillance concern in the usa it have since remove all the contract detail from the public record and the home office hold no central record of such a deal what reassurance can the home secretary give that the people of leicester be protect from intrusive and discriminatory police practice how can transparency and oversight be uphold in such partnership where no central record be keep 
 i wonder whether the hon gentleman might write to i with the detail of what he have outline if so i will look at they 
 i thank the home secretary and the prime minister for visit my constituency last week after the horrific incident follow   the liverpool football club victory parade will the home secretary join i in congratulate the emergency service on act so swiftly but also in condemn the reform uk party and the far right for try to stoke up hatred can she explain how her department will tackle this misinformation to prevent further action in future 
 i join my hon friend in say a huge thank you to all the responder those who i meet last week but also many more who be involve in a very swift response that undoubtedly save life that day it be a day of huge joy across the city of liverpool that end in a horrific incident but i know from her constituency and across liverpool that it be a city where community come together in the face of the great difficulty and show their strength as a community 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 can i draw the home secretary ’s attention to the amendment i have table to the crime and policing bill which would extend the definition of exploitation in the modern slavery act to include orphanage trafficking it be a horrific crime that affect about child across the world and it be something we need to recognise in our legislation 
 the chair of the select committee raise a very important point i know that she have a strong interest in this issue that go back many year and have take strong action herself on modern slavery we will look at the amendment she have table and be happy to discuss it with she far 
 last week my whole community be shock and appal to hear about the stabbing of a year old boy in cribbs causeway thankfully he be stable and i know we will all be think of he and his family at this time year old boy have be charge could the minister please set out what step the government be take to tackle knife crime include among young people who could have much bright future 
 i convey all thought to the family of the victim in this awful stabbing case and all of those affect across the community my hon friend be right to raise the deep concern that exist about the number of young people get draw into serious violence we be see this across the board that be why the young futures prevention programme be so important and why we need to work to prevent this by strengthen the law on child criminal exploitation 
 as i speak there be a removal van outside the illegal immigrant hotel in my constituency let we hope they be move they out not move more in can the secretary of state assure my constituent that these illegal immigrant be not be disperse in the community be house in house in multiple occupation own by private landlord and will she advise i on where they will be house 
 anyone who be in a hotel be someone who have claim asylum and whose asylum claim be pende they be not necessarily illegal immigrant at all and the hon lady should make that position clear 
 last year dr mohammed mohsen be offer a position in the acute medicine department at royal cornwall hospital in my constituency he be due to start that role last year but due to the ongoing conflict and travel restriction in gaza he have be unable to travel to the uk would the minister meet i to consider his case as he require urgent assistance 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter and i be very happy to meet she the foreign commonwealth and development office be work to ensure that those who need to leave gaza and be able and eligible to do so be support in that i be very happy to look at this matter with my hon friend 
 the home secretary be ask a question about lord hermer of chagos as he perhaps ought to be know why do she not answer it and will she do so now 
 lord hermer do not decide sentencing he have a particular role as the attorney general the right hon gentleman as a very experienced member of this house will know the way in which the system work 
 for the final question i call harpreet uppal 
 at a recent roundtable on violence against woman and girl host by the mayor of west yorkshire we hear from local organisation that do outstanding work but be hamper by short term funding as well as from a brave survivor who share her experience they specifically ask for the government to commit to strategic investment will the minister review contract with the sector so they be multi year and take a long term view of service delivery and preventive work 
 my hon friend make an important point that short term funding massively hamper the sector the vast majority of violence against woman and girl funding come from local authority and in fact other departments but i will absolutely commit to look at how the home office manage its contract to ensure sustainability 
 before we come to the next piece of business i will make a brief statement this morning the government publish the strategic defence review the prime minister make a speech and hold a press conference in glasgow in addition to other medium appearance that follow several day of medium briefing i be disappointed that once again the government appear to have breach the principle set out in paragraph of the ministerial code that 
 when parliament be in session the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the instance in parliament 
 i recognise that the timing of policy announcement be not always wholly within the government ’s control there may be a need to co ordinate announcement on international trade with trading partner for example or announcement may be delay by last minute legal intervention the announcement of the sdr however be wholly at the government ’s discretion so it be highly regrettable that minister have choose once again to hold a major medium event before come to the house that show complete disregard for the house and for hon member i note that ministers when they be in opposition be not slow to complain when previous government make major policy announcement outside parliament in fact the sdr be due at easter so i be sure that a day would not have matter 
 i be not responsible for compliance with the ministerial code which be a matter for the prime minister it be the government ’s code not the house ’s code but i regard this as a particularly blatant breach i have invite   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare   to consider whether the public administration and constitutional affairs committee might usefully inquire into the matter 
 minister be elect as member of parliament before they get their ministerial role so they should recognise the importance of the house it be amazing that in opposition member think that everything should be discuss on the floor of the house but when they be in government their memory be short on that point 
 i have be here through many sdr in fact in of the major sdr with lord robertson we do not even know the effect on everybody ’s constituency until it be read out from that dispatch box what have change i will tell you what have change the disregard for member who sit on the back benches i be here to defend those on the back benches so please i hope we have no more of this 
 all i would say be that it be the government ’s ministerial code they should be ashamed of not enforce it 
 we now come to the urgent question i call the shadow leader of the house 
 urgent question to ask the leader of the house if she will make a statement on government announcement outside the house of commons 
 i hear your statement mr speaker i respond to an urgent question on a similar matter on   may i reiterate the commitment i give then the ministerial code be clear 
 when parliament be in session the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the instance in parliament 
 that be an important principle that the government stand by and uphold 
 since that last urgent question on   may the government have make a number of important oral statement to the house on the infected blood inquiry on the cross government review of sanction implementation and enforcement on the charging of individual under the national security act and on the legal aid cyber security incident the prime minister have update the house on the trade deal that we have strike in the national interest the foreign secretary have update it on israel and the occupied palestinian territories the justice secretary have respond to the sentencing review and the defence secretary have make a statement on the future of the diego garcia military base 
 this afternoon the full conclusion of the important strategic defence review will be publish and lay before this house with a significant statement from the defence secretary to follow i be satisfied that this government be come to the house regularly to keep parliament inform interruption 
 order i be not satisfied and i think that be the key back benchers on both side should rightly hear it i do not care how many announcement have be make in the house it be those that have not be make here that we should be talk about 
 as i have say the defence secretary will make a statement this afternoon and i be satisfied 
 i recognise that there be time when we make a judgment on when an oral statement be need balance that with the rest of the day ’s business and other factor but in nearly all instance a write statement be also make and that be an appropriate mechanism for update the house as well as make oral statement during the current session we have make write statement 
 as i say before the recess the ministerial code make it clear that when parliament be in session announcement should be make to the house let i gently point out that we have only just return from the recess as of an hour ago and before the recess we be at pain to ensure that the house be update on the subject of the diego garcia military base before it adjourn 
 the government and i take our obligation to parliament very seriously mr speaker and i will continue to work with you and colleague throughout the government to make certain that important announcement be make to the house and that member from across the house have ample time to consider issue and ensure that the government be scrutinise effectively 
 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 be that really the good that the leader of the house can do an i speak your weight autocue recitation of point that she have make in her previous attempt to deal with occasion when the house have be embarrassed and disregard over the last week alone it be a hopeless miscue of a response that border on a contempt of parliament itself yet another attempt to change the subject blame other and distract attention from the late fiasco evidently the defence of the realm be not important enough to merit make its way up the list of priority in the government ’s medium handout lord robertson himself as you have say mr speaker and i be amazed that you have to intervene on the leader of the house during her own remark would be ashamed and embarrassed to think that this be be do in his name 
 just week ago the leader of the house have to be drag to the house over the government ’s briefing on the immigration white paper outside the house that come just day after they have do the same in respect of prisoner recall the uk us trade deal and of course the chagos island that follow instance involve tuition fee plan reform and even the fiscal rule on which you mr speaker have to reprove and chastise the chancellor of the exchequer now we have see the unhappy sight of the secretary of state for defence no less extensively brief the medium on the decision to deploy airborne nuclear weapon and build the next generation of submarine before come to the house perhaps as i have say they be not important enough to merit a mention beforehand 
 journalist have be able to read the strategic defence review since am while the opposition be prevent from see the document until minute ago precisely in order to avoid parliamentary scrutiny all this be manifestly in breach of the ministerial code the nolan principle and of course labour ’s own manifesto demonstrate the government ’s arrogance and complacency and their disdain for the house and for democratic accountability and this from the clue be in the title the leader of the house whose job be to protect and safeguard the house and its member unfortunately her obvious floundering just now make the point far well than i can 
 when do the leader of the house know about these announcement and what step do she take to prevent the media briefing and ensure that the announcement be make to the house of commons will she now apologise for yet another high handed government decision for which she alone be fully responsible in this instance to the house 
 it be nice to see the right hon gentleman in his place and respect parliament today that be not always the case 
 as i have say before i believe strongly that the government should be and have be make the most important announcement to the house when parliament be in session we have make more oral statement than the previous government do in their entire last session we have make statement in sitting day compare with their in sitting day and we have make many write statement and answer parliamentary question we have the statement on diego garcia on the day that the deal be sign despite difficulty with the timing we have a statement on the us economic deal on the day that it be sign and the prime minister update the house after the eu trade deal 
 as i have say the sdr have now be give to the opposition and be be lay before the house there will be time for colleague to scrutinise it and to question the defence secretary on it this afternoon the government response to the sentencing review and to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman ’s report on the woman ’s state pension age as well as many other major announcement such as the upgrade in defence spending be all make to the house 
 i be curious to know whether the shadow leader of the house raise these important issue with the previous government when he be a minister or a back bencher because i remember many many occasion when they disrespect this house and i do not remember hear his voice at the time i remember when the procedure committee i and many other want the then foreign secretary lord cameron to be accountable to the house of commons the previous government do nothing about it and i do not remember the right hon gentleman say anything about that i recall the then culture secretary announce the end of the bbc licence fee and separately the privatisation of channel on twitter with no intention of come to the house to explain those major policy change 
 the previous prime minister on the day of a very long recess announce that he be scrap the government ’s net target he do not come to the house to explain that he also announce the scrapping of high speed during a conference recess and never come to the house to account for it during covid of the conservative many prime ministers announce major change to our way of life to the medium and not to parliament such as the winter lockdown he do not come here to talk about that and the covid vaccine roll out when he close the border and then reopen they he announce it to the medium and not to parliament let we not forget that the supreme court find that parliament be illegally prorogue by the previous government do you remember when the former prime minister be find to have mislead parliament there be no great disrespect to parliament 
 rather than uphold the ministerial code the previous government ignore breach of it time and again with report sit on the prime minister ’s desk and nothing be do about they we by contrast have strengthen the ministerial code interruption   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   laugh from a sedentary position but we have give the independent adviser on the ministerial code the power to instigate his own investigation therefore we have strengthen it 
 not only do the previous government disrespect parliament they do not have enough for parliament to do they have a threadbare king ’s speech with ban pedicab the pinnacle of their ambition in their last year in government now that they be in opposition they seem to be carry on the same and hardly turn up for work they could have use any of their opposition day to raise these issue but they do not they have many other parliamentary device at their disposal and they do not use they they be a zombie government and now they be a zombie opposition the next time they bring forward an urgent question they might want to check their own record before give we lecture 
 order may i thank the leader of the house for remind i of the mistake of the previous government in not come to the floor of the house i would have hop that this government have learn from the mistake that have just be highlight to try to defend what you criticise be not a way forward 
 i be try to ensure that member on both side of the house be allow to question ministers rather than watch announcement on sky news it be interesting that the sdr have be offer to journalist but that the members here have not have the chance to see it i agree with the leader of the house and i thank she again for remind i but let we now see the government treat this house in the way that i expect 
 will you take a point of order now mr speaker 
 no i will not because we have to wait till the end as you well know sir roger as of the most senior member 
 i think my right hon friend the leader of the house be right to remind we of the many breach of this rule by her majesty ’s government when the conservative party be in power however in the middle of this mud sling let i raise a still small voice of calm the current prime minister pledge to be more transparent open and proper in government will my right hon friend go back to the cabinet and remind it that proper scrutiny in this house with untrammelled question for an hour or more at a time be more scrutiny than the government would get in a press conference and be the proper place to do this i hope she will take that message back so that statement such as the we be about to hear be give on the floor of the house 
 i thank my hon friend for that question as she will know from the many time i have say it before i do regularly remind the cabinet that this be an important aspect of be a cabinet minister or indeed a minister we be do our very good to make sure that there be regular oral statement to this house on important matter and that they be bring here in the absence of an oral statement there be a write ministerial statement of which notice be give the day before so that colleague have ample time as she say to properly scrutinise all these announcement 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be incredibly disappointing to find ourselves here to discuss this issue yet again but this time on the vital matter of national security and defence 
 there be a remarkably similar urgent question before recess and it be disappointing then as it be now to hear the leader of the house attempt to justify not bring major announcement to the floor of the house by cite the number of statement the government have already give to parliament the ministerial code be clear the government do not get to pick and choose which significant statement they do or do not make to the house whenever possible they should be do it every single time while i agree with the premise of the question from the shadow leader of the house i must say that it be a bit rich give the conservatives appalling record of do exactly the same thing when they be in government however that do not let the current government off the hook 
 will the leader of the house please confirm that the government will comply with the ministerial code or shall we expect to do this little dance every week surely this time would be well spend make a statement to the house 
 i thank the hon member for that i will make no apology for the fact that we be do lot of thing we be make lot of announcement and we be deliver the change the country vote for and that do bring with it compete demand as i say when the house be in session statement and update will be make to this house sometimes that will be via a write ministerial statement and sometimes it will be by an oral statement it depend 
 we also have to balance statement with the rest of the day ’s business i would point out to colleague that we have an important reading debate today with dozen and dozen of member down to speak we be now have urgent question before a very important statement and then other business as well we do have to balance these thing in the house ’s interest but the statement be be make to the house today the defence secretary will shortly be in his place and i be sure he will spend a long time answer question on it 
 i be sure that criticism be not aim at i for grant uqs the reason i have grant uqs be that the government do not come here with the strategic defence review if they have we would not be have the uqs and there would be no pressure on time 
 trust integrity and transparency must be the watchword of our politic but those principle be wear extremely thin under the previous government what step be the leader of the house take to redouble our commitment to trust and integrity because our constituent expect no less 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and i do find it slightly strange that conservative members seem to think that they be somehow now the upholder of parliamentary democracy and standard in parliament i be afraid that some of we have much long memory we be take step to raise standard behaviour and the culture in this house and indeed to make sure that the house be respect 
 i call the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee 
 i think the word the leader of the house be look for be sorry there be much in this place which as we know be complicated and arcane but the ministerial code be crystal clear on this point the job of the leader of the house be to represent this place and back benchers of all party around the cabinet table to make sure that this place hear thing of such vital importance as important as public transport be may i suggest that the defence of the realm be a little more important than the government ’s bus bill which will have no division this evening will the leader of the house please tell we why she think no be get this so wrong and what she be do to try to put it right 
 i be certainly sorry if member of the medium have be give sight of the sdr ahead of member of this house my understanding be that it be be publish for the time in this house today as i say early we have put on a statement that be always our intention we be always go to have a major statement today on the sdr and that be indeed what we have do even though there be other important business today mps from across the house will have ample opportunity i be sure they will take that opportunity to scrutinise the defence secretary not only today but on future occasion via select committees and elsewhere 
 i declare an interest as a member of the modernisation committee i thank you mr speaker for stand up for we back benchers and for grant so many urgent question i say that as someone who speak in most of they on behalf of the people of harlow do the leader of the house agree that part of the government ’s remit be to modernise and to bring back trust in politic will she outline what she have be do to that end and the work that the committee have be do to make this place more accessible 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work he do on the modernisation committee he will know that of the remit we have set out for the committee be to ensure more time for back benchers to scrutinise government business that be a key part of modernise parliament and it will ensure that this chamber be and will be in the future the real crucible of national debate that we want it to be i be sure we will see that today and on other day 
 know the leader of the house to be a decent person i suspect that behind the scene when event of this sort happen she probably argue quite strongly that announcement should be make to this house and to the press afterwards do she think the reason that be not happen be that the government genuinely think they will get less publicity to hold a press conference after there have be scrutiny in the house or be it that they just have no confidence that they can stop their people leak thing in advance 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his kind word at the beginning of his question he be absolutely right that part of my job which i take incredibly seriously be to uphold this house in government and to ensure that the rest of the government respect this house come to this house to be scrutinise and be open transparent and available to this house it be a message that i relay very regularly and i be sure i will relay it again later today i say gently to he that government announcement do happen outside of parliament sit and that have long be the case manage announcement over the course of a few day can often be a challenge but i reassure he that on the strategic defence review we be always go to make the statement to the house today with the publishing and the laying of the page document to the house i reiterate that there be a balance to be strike people want time to read and digest before they can question the defence secretary that be always a balance too 
 it be not just the house as a whole the defence committee also be not give advance sight of the report committee member be leave texte journalist over the weekend to find out what be go on at the beginning of this parliament the defence secretary commit to the defence committee that he would be more open and more transparent and reset the relationship with the committee do the leader of the house think that the secretary of state be live up to his commitment to be more transparent after what have happen today 
 my understanding be that we offer to brief the chair of the defence committee but i will stand correct if that be not the case i hear what the hon member say and i think that across government ministers civil servant and everybody else must take their responsibility to select committees incredibly seriously select committees be a very important part of accountability to this house i know that the secretary of state for defence someone i speak to regularly take his responsibility to the house incredibly seriously and i be sure he will look forward to come before the committee to be question and scrutinise at length about the sdr and many other matter 
 may i say to the right hon lady whom i have know for a little while that normally when a speaker upbraid the leader of the house the response of the leader of the house be to grovel and apologise that be standard because she have to take it for the party that she represent in government i simply suggest that i be a little surprised that she do not make peace in that way with mr speaker 
 notwithstanding that i say gently to the leader of the house that it be not just a case of not have bring the review to the house we know now that journalist be give scrutiny of it when i be leader of the conservative party i remember that tony blair as prime minister offer i advance sight of document that be a bit delicate or needed security clearance the leader of the opposition be give the opportunity to look at such document so that they be fully inform of development be such an opportunity offer to the leader of the opposition or the leader of the liberal party 
 i do apologise to mr speaker regularly i have to say usually in private but i be happy to extend that apology to he today if he have not hear i apologise i have the utmost respect for mr speaker who i work very closely with and i totally respect his job in uphold back benchers right to question and scrutinise ministers and government policy that be what he be there to do and he do it brilliantly 
 i do not know what privy council briefing be offer to whom but i can inquire for   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and i will make sure that he get a reply 
 on   january the leader of the house say 
 we will publish the child poverty strategy in the spring ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 the guardian break the story on   may   that the child poverty strategy will not be publish in the spring i can not find a write statement or any indication of an oral statement regard the delay can the leader of the house let we know whether the announcement will be make and whether the child poverty strategy will be publish in the spring it be now june so probably not or whether it be likely to be publish in the autumn just so the house know 
 i know this be a matter of great concern to the hon lady and something that she raise often in this house i will ensure that she and the house be update on the timing for the child poverty taskforce and that ministers come to this house regularly to update on its progress 
 as we have this knockabout what trouble i be that the house have a very important job to do we be talk about the expansion of nuclear weapon we assume because we have not actually read the review even though journalist and member of the public through the newspaper have be give briefing on this and we want to analyse the review so that we could ask sensible question we will be in here for this urgent question for the next urgent question and for the statement when do the right hon lady expect the house to get a chance to digest this page report before we ask question follow the statement everybody else in the country seem to have be able to do so 
 i be on the opposition benches for many year many more year than the right hon gentleman have be and i recognise that it be a challenge to properly scrutinise big review that be lay before the house not long before a statement be make it be the same with budgets i will ensure that today be not the only opportunity but the of many to question the government about their strategic defence review which will last for many year to come i know the secretary of state will also want to ensure that as further question emerge today next week and in month to come member of this house have ample opportunity to put those question to he 
 integrate care board have their budget cut by via a phone call from the interim head of nhs england to icb leader and that announcement be only make formal in response to a write question that i put to the   secretary of state half of nhs target be cut without a statement in the chamber and although there be a statement in the chamber on the abolition of nhs england it have be carry on at pace without so much as a white paper a bill or any opportunity for effective parliamentary scrutiny will the leader of the house give we an opportunity to look at and scrutinise this fundamental reorganisation of the nhs which be so far go under the radar 
 issue relate to decision about icb and nhs reorganisation be regularly raise with i at business question the hon lady be right to say that there be a statement in the house on nhs england and i can reveal to she this will probably not be a surprise that get rid of nhs england will require primary legislation there will be ample time to consider those issue through the passage of that legislation but i hear what she say 
 it be not just by give statement to the medium that this government disrespect the house just before we go into recess we have a farcical situation where the shadow secretary of state for education have to bring forward an urgent question ask for a write statement to be make early in the day the government very clearly decide to make a write statement later in the day and send a minister to come here not answer hon member for the whole urgent question and refuse to say what the content of the write statement be a statement that the government have already write and intend to publish later that day that be do simply to avoid scrutiny what representation do the leader of the house make on that day to ensure that information be give to the house in a timely fashion so that it could be scrutinise rather than the government hide away 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that issue i think she be talk about the pay review recommendation and the government ’s response they be issue that i take incredibly seriously as be ensure that this house have ample time for consideration so i go back and look at the usual practice regard pay review settlement the settlement go across a range of government departments and a number of sector not just school and education but the nhs ministry of justice cabinet office and a number of other departments it be usual practice it be under her government as well that such settlement be announce by write ministerial statement simultaneously in order that they be all put out at the same time 
 i be sure the sunday paper would like to thank the government for advance sight of their upcoming statement i be a member of the defence committee and i ask the leader of the house to acknowledge that this urgent question be actually waste all our time mr speaker be quite right in grant it but if procedure have be follow and we know about the statement we could have get on and debate the rest of the day ’s business do the leader of the house agree that there be few announcement to be make in this parliament that be as important as our defence strategy 
 if we be not do a statement today i would agree with the hon member but we be do a statement on the strategic defence review the review be page long and will be lay before the house in time for the statement as be usual practice there be trail of the statement ahead of time during recess on the sunday but the full document and conclusion will be lay before this house as i have say i be sorry that member of the medium be give advance sight of it as i understand it be in a closed reading room but publication of the report will be to this house this afternoon 
 to read about our nuclear defence strategy over the weekend ahead of the sdr be quite alarming just as it be to see this morning that journalist have receive all the information and the opposition still have not have sight of it the leader of the house be say that she be speak to no and cabinet member about the importance of this matter but do she raise concern over the weekend when she see the leak in the paper 
 some aspect of the sdr be trail ahead of time but not the to which the hon gentleman refer that be not something that the government be design to put into the public domain over the weekend that be normal practice these day i know we all like to speak about a time when we just do thing when the house be sit but thing be sometimes give to the medium ahead of time although not the nuclear issue that the hon gentleman be talk about we will have a far urgent question on that and we will have the full strategic defence review statement shortly at which he can ask the secretary of state for defence a question 
 the leader of the house have just tell we that the document be trail to journalist but at this morning the daily telegraph publish a long article in which its author clearly set out that they have read the entire document at the same time the shadow secretary of state for defence be refuse an advance copy of it even under privy counsellor rule why do the government appear to trust journalist with national security but not the shadow secretary of state 
 as i have say in previous answer i be sorry that member of the medium be give a reading room space to look at the sdr before it be lay before the house that should not have be the case other people have ask i about privy council briefing i know which one i have offer and i understand that they be offer to member of the opposition but i will get member the full detail of who be offer privy council briefing and who be not
