 what step he be take to improve service life for serve personnel and their family 
 over the last year service morale fall to record low with over more full time personnel leave the force than join each month we can not reverse these deep set problem overnight but this government be put people at the heart of our defence plan and today will see the reading of our legislation to establish an independent armed forces commissioner to improve service life 
 the package announce this weekend of hour of fund wraparound childcare for family deploy overseas be very welcome can the minister please assure we that this type of practical assistance will be a fundamental pillar of the government ’s support for force family 
 i can indeed support our service family be really important especially when they be far from home and this scheme will reduce the burden of childcare cost for those eligible family overseas this be a government who be deliver for defence and put our force personnel at the heart of our defence plan 
 the royal fleet auxiliary be often overlook yet it be vital to the sustainability and success of our royal navy often its pay and condition do not keep track with either the armed force or the civil service what can the secretary of state say to member of the rfa to reassure they that they be value 
 over the last decade or more we have be expect more of those member of the royal fleet auxiliary they play a critical role in our maritime operation and they be highly value as part of our service community we see an important future for that service as part of build britain ’s defence for the future and we be put force personnel and rfa personnel at the heart of our plan to ensure that we be more secure at home and strong abroad 
 we come to the shadow secretary of state 
 on the subject of improve service life for service personnel and their family thousand of family will be get the unwelcome christmas present this year of a tax on the school fee that they pay to fund an independent boarding school or otherwise will have to allow their child ’s education to be constantly destabilise give that this new tax be the responsibility of the government   will the secretary of state confirm that the continuity of education allowance will be uplifted to fund of the new tax on those fee 
 we will uprate the continuity of education allowance to reflect the increase in school fee from january we will do that so that the allowance continue to maintain the schooling of the many child of personnel that be deploy our mission as a government be to lift the morale of our service that be why we be invest in our servicemen and woman support their family and start to fix the problem of the last year that we have inherit 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of publish all board of inquiry document on the bombing of rfa sir galahad 
 follow on from our recent discussion i would like to reiterate that the service and sacrifice make by those on board sir galahad will never be forget after any incident that result in loss of life people will always ask themselves what if something different have happen however the loss on sir galahad be the result of enemy action and enemy action alone under the public records act we protect personal datum and information but we have recently review further file and i look forward to meet my hon friend this month to discuss the issue far 
 falkland veteran from the welsh guards include my constituent mike hermanis continue to campaign to uncover the truth behind the attack on the sir galahad in june i know that the minister be already work on this but with time marching on will he agree to meet not only i but colleague and crucially veteran from the campaign to discuss release the remain document from the board of inquiry so that those veteran and the family of those who die can finally get to the truth 
 i would welcome a discussion with my hon friend about engage with the veteran community from sir galahad and i look forward to our meeting later this month 
 i have many friend who serve out there and the after effect of that disaster death burn human being still bang on and resonate with they today all they want be to know why they be there at the wrong time who give the order the report be critical it be not just a case of they be damage or kill by enemy action it be about the incompetence of those who put they in the wrong place at the wrong time leave they open to that simple terrible attack 
 there be much chaos in conflict as the right hon gentleman know and the ministry of defence in no way blame the welsh guards for the event of that tragic day my official have be review further file   and extract from the board of inquiry have be review and be now within the open record at the national archives 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for newport east jessica morden   for her sustained campaign for transparency my constituent oliver richardson the mayor of deal be just when he survive the sinking i welcome the minister ’s offer of a meeting and i ask to be include please 
 absolutely 
 i emphasise how mystify it be that these document have not already be release year after the conflict it be not about identify blame or who be responsible in my view it be about make sure that lesson be transparently learn for future operation about command chain and accountability during conflict what be the reason for withhold these document will the minister show compassion for those who still live with this whether as bereaved relative or as people bear the scar and injury of this dreadful event 
 of all i have compassion for those injure or wound in combat after see many throughout my career i assure the house that the individual lesson learn from this conflict have be spread throughout the department and into the single service file comprise witness statement be closed and under the term of the public records act these witness statement will remain closed until however we will look at review some of these statement and we will provide a view in due course 
 what his department ’s plan timetable be for the strategic defence review 
 the strategic defence review be the of its kind in the uk it be externally lead and draw widely on expert within government and the military as well as those from industry academia and our ally the reviewer will report in the spring 
 with the increase threat we see around the world the government be entitle to conduct a strategic defence review but that should not be an excuse not to commit to increase defence spending give that the secretary of state refuse to provide a timetable at last week ’s urgent question will he now say yes or no to whether the government will get to of gdp on defence spending by the end of this parliament 
 everyone agree that defence spending must rise under this government it be increase by nearly £ next year and there be a cast iron commitment that we will set a clear path to spend of gdp on defence of course the last time this country spend of gdp on defence be in with a labour government 
 decide to defer or to review be just as much of a decision as to go ahead or not to go ahead because it mean that nothing be happen the typhoon factory at warton be currently idle no typhoons be be produce which be bad for export and bad for our defence can the secretary of state tell the house when we will take a decision to procure more typhoons there be job at risk as well as the country ’s defence 
 i have have the privilege of visit warton and i have see the skill the technology and the workforce ’s commitment and dedication to that job the reviewer of the strategic defence review will produce their final report and make recommendation in the spring in the meantime my hon friend rightly point to export it may interest he to know that last week i be in turkey and saudi arabia to discuss with defence ministers the future role that uk make typhoons could play in the defence of both country 
 far to the question raise by my hon friend   the member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford i welcome the £ of extra defence expenditure from next year however not only do we not have a timetable for meet of gdp which the whole house would like to hear about will the secretary of state confirm that there will be no additional funding for the in year pressure that this department alongside so many other be suffer from 
 the chancellor set out in her budget on   october   the step we be take across government to deal with the £ in year deficit that this government inherit on the commitment to of gdp the chief secretary to the treasury have make it clear that we will set that path in the spring i remind the house that the prime minister say at the nato summit in washington back in july that it be a question of the strategic defence review then the commitment and the path to 
 my constituency be home to many small and medium sized enterprise that contribute to our uk defence sector what step be the government take to ensure that submission from sme to the strategic defence review be give equal weighting and consideration compare with submission from prime contractor in order to support innovation job creation and competition within the uk defence sector 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the shadow defence secretary will recognise the role that small medium and grow company can play in our defence and security sector well than anyone else in the house that be reason why within day of get this job i do not just meet the big lead defence company i have a similar meeting and briefing on the approach this government will take with small and medium sized company include grow company in the defence sector such company will be an important focus for the strategic defence review as the reform and the long term industrial strategy require to deliver strong defence for this country be consider 
 what step he be take to improve recruitment and retention in the armed force 
 what step the government be take to improve recruitment and retention in the armed force 
 this government have already begin to modernise and refine our policy and process to attract and retain the good possible talent in our armed force we be deliver for defence with a pay increase for new recruit and of the large pay increase in the last year for exist personnel we be scrap over outdated medical policy and set an ambition to make a conditional offer of employment to candidate within day and a provisional training start date within day 
 from cadet to regular and reservist it be clear that we must urgently tackle the recruitment and retention crisis preside over by the last government will the minister join i in welcome the fact that over application be now be reconsider after the removal of unnecessary red tape block some sufferer of hay fever and acne from join 
 i be delighted to join my hon friend in welcome the announcement by the ministry of defence that more than application have be reconsider follow the removal of outdated medical policy such as those block some sufferer of hay fever eczema and acne that be a perfect example of how we be fix the foundation and deliver for defence 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment in this area since there have be only year when the regular force have grow in size and all armed force be currently below target do the minister believe there will be any year between now and when there will be a net increase in number do he have a target for the overall increase in those year or be it a bit like of gdp and we will just have to wait and see—“make i good but not yet 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s passion for recruitment the recruitment target be miss in every single year of the last conservative government it will take we time to fix the process but we have already make announcement about improve retention and recruitment we will make further such announcement in the month ahead to ensure that we be deal with the gap in our capability and improve morale and that we have force that be able to deter and defeat aggressor if necessary 
 i welcome the shadow minister to his place 
 thank you mr speaker it be nice to be back on recruitment many who join the armed force begin their military journey as cadet the previous conservative government ’s cadet expansion programme successfully establish hundred of new cadet unit in state school however this labour government have recently withdraw   a critical £ plus grant that support cadet instructor in many of the very same state school will the government as a whole urgently review that very unwelcome decision 
 i welcome my shadow to his place the government be commit to cadet it be a really valuable pastime for young people which provide skill and opportunity that will last they a lifetime the minister for veterans and people be review the cadet force to ensure that it can continue to play a really important role for young people and support the overall mission of defence 
 i welcome the minister ’s kind welcome on retention how can we persuade people to remain in our armed force if they sense that the new government do not really have their back in that context will the ministry of defence start to defend its own veteran within whitehall and argue that the perverse plan to repeal the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act should be abandon as soon as possible 
 i have such high hope for the right hon gentleman as my shadow let i be very clear the government be renew the contract between the nation and those who serve a contract that have be erode over year with black mould in military accommodation fall morale and gap in our capability we will not only support retention and recruitment but through the work that the defence secretary do in cabinet and the work of the minister for veterans and people we will support our veteran as well 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i have hear from a number of young people who have try to join the military only to be meet with long wait for their medical assessment i understand the need for applicant to be thoroughly assess but we be lose valuable recruit due to the processing time many can not afford to wait around and ultimately choose a different path how be the minister ensure that the medical assessment process run efficiently 
 it be a really important part of the application process that we ensure that the people we accept into our armed force be medically fit we have already make progress in this area by remove outdated medical process and we be work with colleague across health to ensure that access to applicant medical record be smooth and efficient reduce the delay between someone say that they want to serve in our armed force and that person get through the door of a training base there be lot of work to be do and we hope to make further announcement in due course 
 what plan he have to maintain the uk ’s role in nato 
 nato be the cornerstone of uk and euro atlantic security our commitment to the alliance be unshakable   the strategic defence review will ensure that we have a nato policy at the heart of britain ’s defence plan for the future 
 follow the election of president trump in the united states there will clearly be much more pressure from the new us administration on other country in nato to step up to the mark and put in the resource that they should be put in to safeguard the defence of europe what action will the secretary of state take to show leadership and ensure that other european country step up and keep europe safe from external threat such as russia china and beyond 
 our cast iron commitment to increase defence spending to of gdp will help to set the pace in nato i be pleased that while in only nato nation be meet the pledge level of this year nation be do so the uk commit almost all our armed force and our nuclear deterrent to nato so we play a lead role we will have a nato policy at the heart of our defence plan and will always look to be in nato as part of our leadership role 
 mindful that tomorrow mark the day anniversary of the invasion of ukraine and of the increase in russian hostility over the weekend will my right hon friend the secretary of state take this opportunity to assure the house of this government ’s continue steadfast support for both ukraine and nato 
 i will indeed in the month that this government have be in office we have step up support for ukraine and speed up delivery of the military aid promise this be a government now spend more on military aid than ever before on behalf of the uk i pay tribute to the conservative party for the fact that the uk be and remain united for ukraine 
 what progress he have make on establish an independent armed force commissioner 
 what progress he have make on establish an independent armed force commissioner 
 what progress he have make on establish an independent armed force commissioner 
 what progress he have make on establish an independent armed force commissioner 
 the armed forces commissioner bill be a landmark piece of legislation and a major step take by this government to renew the contract between the nation and those who serve reading of the bill will be later today and the commissioner will be a strong independent champion for our armed force and their   family improve parliamentary oversight and get to grip with the welfare issue face by our armed force 
 i thank the minister for all he be do to improve the life of our armed force community he will be aware of the deeply distressing account of rape and sexual assault from the defence committee ’s report on woman in the armed force will he please revisit our recommendation and those of the lyons review so that those serious case can be hear in civilian not service court 
 my hon friend be exactly right to raise this very serious issue in opposition we make a commitment that murder manslaughter and rape case would be try in civilian rather than military court i encourage she to keep ask question as we get close to the armed force bill which will be an opportunity to put that right 
 the listening out loud foundation in my constituency be run by jill and andy dolman and work with those who have recently leave the force often with complex problem such as post traumatic stress disorder they can provide an excellent insight into how we can well support current and future armed force personnel how do the minister foresee the armed forces commissioner work with small charity such as the listening out loud foundation and will he join i in visit the organisation in the near future 
 i thank my hon friend for her interest in this area and for champion the work of that organisation in her constituency as we get to the point of implement the armed forces commissioner i expect that they will have new relationship with service charity and organisation for serve member of our force and the wide armed force family i would be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that and i look forward to visit her constituency to meet that organisation in person if i can 
 will the minister consider that it be right that the armed forces commissioner be able to challenge ministers and increase parliamentary oversight of the issue that face our force and their family 
 that be a commitment we make in opposition but it be also a commitment to increase scrutiny that we be proud to make from the government dispatch box we want to make the case that to improve morale and to improve the relationship and the contract between the nation and those who serve have an independent and impartial figure to champion our armed force and their family will improve not only the live experience of those people but the operational capability of our force encourage more people to recognise that someone be genuinely listen to their concern and that minister be prepare to act on they as well there be a lot of work to be do to renew the contract but the armed forces commissioner be a key step 
 last month i visit the northern hub for veterans and military families research at northumbria university to hear about its suicide prevention work its research find that many military family bereave by suicide feel helpless and unsupported as the wellbeing of   their love one decline do the minister agree that the armed forces commissioner bill be a vital opportunity to deliver well support for family go through difficult time 
 any death by suicide be a tragedy though it remain fortunately a rare event in the armed force community it be positive to hear of the work by northumbria university in this area this month we publish a refresh edition of the armed force suicide prevention strategy and action plan to enhance the mod ’s commitment to reduce suicide and well support those affect by it a future independent commissioner will have the discretion to investigate welfare matter affect our force and will be a direct point of contact for bereaved family of our serve personnel and that would naturally be a matter worthy of their attention 
 will the armed forces commissioner ’s power of investigation extend to be allow to visit troop deploy on operation to question they and to seize document 
 the armed forces commissioner bill include power for the armed forces commissioner to visit serve personnel and for uk visit to be unannounced due to the logistic of visit troop abroad we would expect that such visit would be co ordinated with the department i expect the commissioner to visit our troop serve abroad and family deploy abroad and to hear about the particular challenge that be deploy abroad present for those in uniform and those who love they we have lot of work to do and i would be grateful if the hon gentleman would raise that issue at the bill ’s reading later today when i can respond in more detail 
 i thank the minister for his response to the question in northern ireland recruitment be at record level there have never need to be conscription because there be always volunteer ever mindful of that and of the need to ensure that the independent armed forces commissioner have the same responsibility and power in every place in northern ireland will the minister please indicate strongly if he can that every council will be involve and every person who need help in northern ireland will get it 
 the armed forces commissioner will extend to all part of the united kingdom and cover the service welfare matter of uk armed force personnel and their family include when deploy abroad we would expect recommendation to be publish directly to parliament not through the ministry of defence to ensure the impartiality and independence of the role and to allow members of parliament from all part of the house to scrutinise recommendation and issue raise by the commissioner that will include every nation within the united kingdom 
 what step he be take with his nato counterpart to increase co operation on missile defence 
 this government be get on with deliver for defence to make britain secure at home and strong abroad the uk remain a lead voice in nato on missile defence which we see as a cross government and international effort we be work to enhance our missile defence capability and modernise our approach to air and missile defence both for our own force and with our nato ally 
 at last month ’s nato ministers of defence meet the secretary of state agree to step up co operation with our nato ally on missile defence and cutting edge long range missile do the minister agree that a focus on integrate nato ’s missile defence be key to strengthen european security 
 yes i do defence against air and missile threat have play a key role in our recent thinking and with our nato approach to policy put integration with our ally at the heart of our defence plan make sense and be a vital part of ensure our security go forward 
 will the united kingdom preferably in tandem with our european colleague but if necessary bilaterally with the united states align with the united states in permit ukraine to use the missile defence system that we have supply as it see fit in its own defence 
 absolutely we intend to align with our ally in make sure that ukraine can make use of the capability that have be offer by those who have commit support to that country in its fight 
 what step he be take to support veteran in newcastle under lyme constituency 
 this be a government of service who will always stand up for those who serve our country and i be steadfast in my commitment to deliver improved service for veteran nationwide include in newcastle under lyme i be work to ensure a dedicated structure and support mechanism for veteran that be more institutionally resilient through work across government and with devolved administration 
 our veteran be on the frontline as they defend our country and when seek meaningful support to get on with their life when they get home will the minister join i in pay tribute to the tri services and veterans support centre in newcastle under lyme lead by chairman geoff harriman for all the work it do will he come to visit the centre meet our veteran and show they the support that they deserve 
 i would be delighted to accept my hon friend ’s offer to visit newcastle under lyme and reopen the tri service centre i look forward to meet veteran in the constituency and learn more about the fantastic work they be do 
 i recently meet got your in wincanton which provide crucial therapeutic support for veteran and serve personnel veteran tell i that its support have be invaluable at a point in his life when he could not see a future will the minister join i in congratulate got your and will the government support such group to expand their crucial work 
 i congratulate got your and all the charitable sector on the amazing voluntary work that go on across the country i too have see the amazing work that get your do and would like to meet its representative in due course if they come down to westminster 
 what step he have take to increase support for ukraine 
 what step he have take to increase support for ukraine 
 with tomorrow mark day since the start of president putin ’s brutal illegal invasion of ukraine our commitment to stand with the ukrainian people be absolute we have step up with more military support we have speed up delivery and we be now spend more on military aid as a country than ever before 
 tomorrow will be day since putin invade ukraine my constituent in kilmarnock and loudoun have concern about the ongoing welfare of ukrainian civilian so can the secretary of state please assure my constituent that the government will continue to offer support and aid to those in need will he underline our absolute support for ukraine force to end putin ’s aggression 
 my hon friend be absolutely right what she really say be that the ukrainians have be fight with huge courage military and civilian alike and the good way we can help the ukrainians to defend their own civilian be to step up our support for ukraine that be why we have increase military support and aid to its high level ever we have sign a new industrial treaty with ukraine worth £ to increase military hardware we have hit the £ milestone for the uk lead international fund for ukraine we will stand with ukraine for as long as it take this be a government deliver for defence and for ukraine 
 i thank the secretary of state for his previous answer will he outline some of the detail of the support that have be offer to ukraine and how that support be evolve as the conflict continue 
 at each stage we have try to respond to the requirement that the ukrainians say that they have to match the state of their battle to defend their country we have announce package of artillery of ammunition and of air defence which be of their most critical need at present include recently a new contract to supply short range air defence missile the   lightweight multi role missile those will be in ukrainian hand at the turn of the year we expect to step up that production and delivery during the course of next year 
 do the secretary of state share my concern at the recent medium interview give by a lead candidate to be labour ’s next ambassador to washington dc this supposedly clever negotiator declare that ukraine should not expect to get its territory back and should not expect to be put on the path to join nato but could perhaps secure some security guarantee from western country do the secretary of state agree that whoever be send to washington should be somebody who support ukraine in defend itself and do not reward russian aggression with pre emptive capitulation 
 of the privilege i have in this new role be to represent the country at the nato washington summit that be the point at which the nato nation collectively agree to step up support for ukraine and to develop the security guarantee that ukraine will need in the long term the task for we and ally that support ukraine be to help ukrainians and support they in their fight now at the point at which they judge the talking should start our role then be to give they equally steadfast support and we will 
 i be sure the whole house stand solidly with ukraine on its day counter russian aggression and do so for we all but its ability to do so be weaken by north korea send armament and manpower the iranians send drone and oil contract still be sign will the minister assure we that in the light of the american decision to allow strike inside russia we will also give permission for our missile to be use to break up concentration of arm and material inside russia 
 i will not be draw on detail about long range missile today it risk operational security and the only person who benefit from public debate be president putin as the right hon member rightly say north korean troop be on the frontline in russia at the weekend russia launch its big aerial attack into ukraine since august against infrastructure i speak yesterday to the us defence secretary about this escalation i will speak to the ukrainian defence minister about it later today i want the house to be in no doubt the prime minister have be clear that we must double down and give ukraine the support it need for as long as it need we will continue to work in close co ordination with the us in our support for ukraine 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i ask the secretary of state last month whether there be an update on the usage of storm shadow missile by ukraine as have be widely report yesterday president biden lift restriction on the use of long range us missile give the continuous bombing of ukrainian community by russia and give that thousand of north korean troop be fight against our ally in our continent will ukraine now be allow to use those storm shadow missile obviously within the confine   of international law or do we expect ukraine to continue fight and defend itself with hand tie behind its back while keep those storm shadows in safe storage 
 i say again that i will not compromise operational security and comment on the detail of long range system today the prime minister have be clear as i be be to the house that we must double down on the support to ukraine give it the support it need and do so for as long as it take in do so we will continue our close co operation with the us and ally in provide that support to ukraine 
 i join the chair of the defence committee   the hon member for slough mr dhesi in strongly welcome the decision by the united states to permit ukraine to use long range missile in kursk i know the secretary of state do not want to go into operational detail i understand that but i assure he of our support if he follow through in relation to storm shadow as we believe he should there will be those who talk about escalation but do he agree that the only escalation that matter here be north korean troop on the ground support russia in its illegal war 
 the shadow secretary of state be right that the person responsible for escalation in this conflict be president putin and the side that have be escalate in recent month be russia in recognise that he have escalate his illegal war against ukraine by intensify the use of glide bomb destroy ukraine ’s energy infrastructure and deploy thousand of north korean troop into combat position in kursk i be discuss this very serious development with the us defence secretary and will be discuss it with the ukrainian defence secretary this evening 
 do the prime minister raise ukraine during his meeting with president xi give china ’s undoubted influence over russia and north korea 
 i regard the prime minister ’s meeting with president xi as an important step forward he be the prime minister of the uk to meet the leader of china in nearly year after year of damage conservative inconsistency on china this government will bring a long term approach to manage our relation with china we will co operate where we can compete where we should and challenge where we must 
 what step his department be take to support the cadet force 
 i have visit various cadet unit and i be constantly in awe of their work not only to increase social mobility but to improve the health and wellbeing of various young people across the country they produce an annual return on investment in the region of £ we be commit to sustain cadet force across the uk and we continue to invest in cadet expansion in school so that even more young people particularly in the state sector can benefit from be in the cadet 
 i agree wholeheartedly with the minister about the benefit of the cadet so why have the government cut support to cadet even as they be launch a national youth strategy his colleague say early that the government would have a review the question be can that gap in support be plug and the school staff instructor grant be restore so that more child hopefully many more child in state school can benefit from join the cadet 
 i be conduct a review into cadet and reserve the cadet expansion programme will still receive £ in government funding through the ministry of defence and i can reassure the right hon member that we be fully commit to support the cadet expansion programme i will speak to he about our review in due course once it be complete 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on potential risk arise from the use of nuclear weapon 
 we recognise the serious risk pose by the use of nuclear weapon it be a labour prime minister who sign the non proliferation treaty in the uk remain fully committed to the multilateral non proliferation aim of a world without nuclear weapon we also have a triple lock commitment on our nuclear deterrent which be a vital part of uk defence and deterrence 
 accord to the nuclear information service there have be historical incident involve uk nuclear weapon there have be well record near miss between the united states and russia and formerly the soviet union in that context will the minister explain why on   november when the united national general assembly be invite to vote on establish a panel for a scientific study on the effect of nuclear weapon britain russia and france be the only country to vote against its establishment fortunately the committee be establish will the minister assure the house that britain will fully co operate in examine the devastating effect of nuclear weapon be they ever to be use 
 the uk have always recognise the possible humanitarian consequence of the use of nuclear weapon the propose panel do not establish a clear mandate to address maintain long hold knowledge of the devastating consequence of nuclear war use scientific research and the resolution will not advance progress towards nuclear disarmament that be why we vote against it 
 the secretary of state ’s commitment to nuclear testing veteran be well know but he may be concern by a report in the daily mirror today claim that incorrect testimony and incomplete documentation be provide by civil servant and give to judge in the court case bring by the nuclear veteran over decade will the secretary of state investigate those claim urgently and report to the house 
 i can assure the hon lady that my hon friend the minister for veterans and people have meet nuclear test veteran to establish a new relationship to ensure that we have consistent and productive dialogue i know that he be committed to explore the concern raise about access to medical record and i be sure that progress will be make in that context 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this government be deliver for defence last month the uk and germany sign the landmark trinity house agreement mark a new era of co operation between our armed force and our defence industry with threat increase we must strengthen european security tomorrow mark the bloody milestone of day since putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine begin the uk continue to be unite for ukraine and the government continue to step up support for ukraine as part of that i can confirm today that ukrainian troop have now be train through operation interflex the uk lead multinational training programme which i have now extend to run throughout 
 i welcome that announcement by the secretary of state it should shame every politician in this house that today veteran who have serve our country be still sleep rough on our street can the secretary of state set out the step he will take to ensure that home will be there for hero 
 our step be to ensure that veteran who face homelessness have a more advantaged place in social housing provision that be announce by the prime minister in his labour party conference speech and will be follow up by the deputy prime minister in change to the arrangement for local authority guidance on the eve of remembrance weekend we also make a pledge of £ to help homeless veteran 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in relation to the cost of rent back our own military base on the chagos island last week the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office   the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty say that the reason the government refuse to tell we what the cost will be be that 
 it be not normal practice for the uk to reveal the value of payment for military basis anywhere across the globe”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 be that correct 
 that be correct but it be also true to say that the treaty be in the legal and national security interest of the uk and us that be why the us defence secretary welcome the agreement which he say would 
 safeguard the strategic security interest of the united kingdom and the united states into the next century 
 the secretary of state say it be true that it be not normal practice for the uk to reveal the value of payment for military basis but there have actually be several write answer under this government and previous one give the cost of overseas basis for example in november the then minister for the armed forces penny mordaunt no less reveal in a write answer the cost of overseas basis include diego garcia and the cost of lease the reason for withhold the cost do not stack up what do the secretary of state have to hide from parliament 
 absolutely nothing nor will we it be a matter of course to confirm run cost for basis what we be talk about here be an agreement lead to a treaty that will be put before this house i have say to the house and to the shadow secretary of state that we will set out the cost and the detail of that treaty in due course when the house come to consider it

 many veteran who i have speak to recently be deeply concerned about the government ’s decision to remove the role of veterans minister from cabinet will the secretary of state explain how he will ensure veteran get the attention from government that they rightly deserve

 the secretary of state speak to a uk commitment to nato and that be great but we have just see the election of a us president who be put america and the defence of europe in the hand of european state which make the prevarication over all the more difficult will he accept that a commitment without a date be watery and that only a date will provide a commitment will it be in this parliament yes or no

 in the uk we have some very special skill when it come to develop future defence equipment to lose those skill would be a desperate business do the secretary of state agree that co operate and work with our friend in europe be way to preserve they 
 the hon gentleman be correct there be increase example of industry work across our european nation both in the eu with our improve relationship on defence and in nato that be way in which we can ensure that the skill be available to make the equipment that we need

 as an individual who sign up in just the past week to be a reserve this matter be close to my heart we be do a review into reservist over the next couple of week which will be link to the strategic defence review to find out how we can simplify the process and make it easy for people to join and serve the armed force in a way that be befit to they

 between and in what be an illegal act woman be dismiss and discharge from the armed force on family ground for fall pregnant while in service this be not a question of compensation they want their beret and cap badge return to they will the minister please work with i to right an injustice do to all those woman who just want to keep serve their country and now want that service recognise 
 that be a really important question we have the utmost respect for all those who have serve i would be delighted to work with the hon lady to move that forward 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement about the government ’s plan for child ’s social care 
 i know all member here today will agree that care for vulnerable child be among the most vital responsibility of any government this government treat no issue with more importance than the urgent challenge of improve child ’s social care this be a new era of child centre government of put child that be how we achieve our opportunity mission how we break the unfair link between background and success and how we support family to achieve and thrive 
 our mission apply to all child especially the most vulnerable those for whom childhood be a storm of instability neglect and even violence deny the foundation of love that be the right of any child child ’s social care alone can not right all those wrong we need a join up approach across government and beyond that be why mission lead government be so important but do well child ’s social care empower family to support their child put they back on the path to happy healthy life 
 it be with great concern that i come here today to tell members what they must already know the system that the government have inherit from opposition members be break and fail far too many child it be keep alive by the effort of our amazing workforce i want to thank all those work so hard to keep child safe but child ’s social care be struggle under an impossible weight 
 we have more child in care in this country than ever before with more and more money follow child into the most expensive part of the system resource be suck out of preventive service push yet more young people into care and so the vicious cycle continue high cost but poor outcome my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   rightly identify that cycle in his review over year ago a broken market for care vulnerable to the shameful profiteering of too many private company local government spending on child ’s social care have rise by £ over the last decade what do we have to show for it a system too busy treat symptom to tackle cause a system that cost more for taxpayer but deliver less for family and a system that be fail our child and which be cry out for change 
 today the labour government begin that change ambitious wide range reform to lift the life chance of our most vulnerable child i be pleased to announce the publication of a policy statement that put child ’s social care back in the service of child and family break the cycle of crisis intervention this be the big reform of child ’s social care in a generation it start with the acknowledgement that wherever possible child should remain with their family that be where child belong it be on that foundation of family love that child can live happy life that be why early intervention tackle problem before they escalate hold the key to bright future for our child we will simplify the way we fund local government next    year consolidate more than £ of child ’s social care funding within the local government finance settlement with immediate effect we will suspend the payment by result aspect of the support family fund we will renew the way we work with the sector co designing service together to meet the need of child and family in their community 
 the deputy prime minister and i be ambitious about reform how we work with child and family from when they encounter challenge right through to building solution we will set out funding plan for child ’s social care and future investment in preventive service in the upcoming local government finance settlement 
 all family face challenge at time or another i want to help they to come up with their own solution wherever possible so we will legislate to embed family group decision making as an offer all family can access early targeted support minimise more costly and disruptive intervention later so it be much well value for taxpayer but ultimately that be not the point the most important point be that it be well for child ’s life now and in the future build that bedrock of family love and support that we all need 
 we know that we must also have strong child protection measure in place so today i be set out plan to require every council to have multi agency child safeguard team consult school and teacher to stop child fall through the crack sometimes despite the good effort of all involve child can not remain at home and our priority then be to support they to live with kinship carer or in foster family connect to extend family in a stable home that be why i be not just pleased but deeply proud when the government announce the large ever national investment in kinship care at last month ’s budget an investment in the future of vulnerable child that money will trial a new kinship allowance to help family member and friend to care for vulnerable child we will also extend the virtual school head programme place it on a statutory footing and champion the education of child in kinship care 
 even with these change however there will remain instance in which child must enter the care system so it be vital that we fix the break care market we know that the quality and safety of child ’s home in england be simply not good enough year after year the previous government sit on their hand while child be let down their life chance wreck their hope dash and their dignity ignore i know that many opposition members share the disappointment i feel as ministers in that government ignore these issue and leave they to drift when they could have grip they as this government do today 
 we will act decisively help child to remain close to the people who love they whenever possible and end the reckless profiteering of some provider we will rebalance and stabilise the placement market include by establish a financial oversight scheme for the very time we will make the market more transparent and we will empower local authority to collaborate on placement include through regional care co operative we will give ofsted the power to move more quickly against unregistered care provider and tackle pattern of poor care 
 those be action to fix the care market but member should be in no doubt that if company continue to make extreme profit at the cost of vulnerable child i will go far and hard we will introduce new power allow the government to directly cap the level of profit from child ’s social care placement at their good private provider can help improve the life of vulnerable child but when the focus drift towards exploitation in the pursuit of profit be in no doubt that i will act 
 these be the reform to deliver the good placement for child but the journey do not end there we must give young people leave care the right support as they make the transition to adult life i be pleased to co chair the ministerial care leaver board alongside the deputy prime minister early this month we will drive forward action across government and we will expand the stay close programme into a national entitlement of enhance practical and emotional support for care leaver 
 it be time to fix the foundation of child ’s social care invest in the groundwork for a strong sector and that include datum we will deliver on our manifesto commitment to improve the sharing of information for the benefit of all child include those in care we will change the law in way we will introduce provision for a single unique child identifier to join up datum from different service which be a further step towards ensure that service work hard for child parent and professional secondly we will establish a new duty provide a clear legal basis for those work with child to share information for the purpose of safeguard 
 we be determined to ensure that child ’s social care be an excellent area in which to work we have publish online resource to improve the health and wellbeing of staff and we be join the national workload action group to cut unnecessary task free up staff to concentrate on child and their family while agency worker can help to manage fluctuation in demand they be no substitute for a permanent workforce child and family deserve stable professional relationship we will therefore limit the use of agency social worker by local authority act to reverse the alarming increase in their prevalence 
 every child deserve the good possible start in life to grow up in a family fill with love but not every child have that there be still far too many who lack the stability safety and love that they need to go on to happy and healthy life our opportunity mission be for they we be break down barrier for they and the announcement that i have bring to the house today be for they but we can not achieve this alone keep child safe be everyone ’s business not merely mine or the government ’s but that of each of we in this house and all of we across the country we need partnership with family the workforce carer provider health police school college and yes with member right across the house 
 today be the start of much need change change that will fix child ’s social care change that will keep family together where possible and child safe where necessary change that will give each and every child the good start in life the child of our great country deserve nothing less i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement i welcome the government ’s focus today on child ’s social care and on the profiteer issue that we identify and set up the market intervention advisory group to look at when we be in government however at the heart of the problem be a lack of high quality place for look after child that be what be cause the high cost of placement as demand be outstrip supply 
 in its report the competition and markets authority do not recommend a profit cap because 
 the central problem face the market be lack of capacity 
 the cma conclude that take measure to limit the profitability of provider would 
 risk increase the capacity shortfall 
 while i share the secretary of state ’s desire to ensure that we be get good value for the taxpayer in this sector we need to solve the capacity issue otherwise ironically she risk drive up price and exacerbate the shortage of place 
 the last government take step at the budget in april to address the capacity side with £ allocate for build and maintain placement for look after child i note that in the most recent budget despite the welcome money for kinship care there be no more money for increase the number of place for look after child that be essential otherwise the strategy on place set out today simply will not work what plan have the secretary of state make to increase the number of place for look after child how much she will need to fund that do she ask the treasury for the money at the most recent budget what be her assessment of the impact of the change announce today on the number of place available for look after child 
 the review carry out by   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister commission by the conservatives in government find that profit cap would not work as it would be 
 relatively easy for provider to reallocate income and expenditure to maintain profit level 
 do the secretary of state agree be the level of profit that she refer to this morning the maximum level of profit that she be aim for if not what will it be 
 the capacity problem rest both on the availability of place and on the demand for those place the secretary of state have indicate that she would like to take step on early intervention which be obviously vital those be not specify in her statement but i hope that she will bring they to the house at the early opportunity as they be critical to solve the issue she say that she want to scrap payment by result give that that be an early intervention programme on the basis of what evidence be she do so do she have an evaluation of what scrap payment by result will do 
 we welcome much else in the statement include the regional care co operative multi agency team and the enhanced role of ofsted in the sector on the latter be the secretary of state make any change to the failure regime for child ’s home and the regularity of inspection the children ’s commissioner have do   outstanding work on the increase use of deprivation of liberty order will the secretary of state outline what action she be take on that important issue i be pleased to see the labour government take forward our proposal for a unique child identifier when can we expect the bill create that to be introduce 
 i want the government to succeed in this area child ’s social care be a hidden issue and get it right be at the heart of solve so many problem that this country face i hope the secretary of state can reassure i and the house that she will do more to bring forward a great supply of place for look after child and that an early intervention system be forthcoming because the future of look after child rely on it 
 i can say to the right hon lady that we will absolutely do more we be do more in month than the conservatives do in year they have year yet she have the temerity to stand there and carp about the change that we be bring in for some of the most vulnerable child in our country market be leave to fail cost be leave to soar and bad of all child be fail we will ensure that there be high quality placement for our child who need that provision that be why we set out £ to expand capacity and provision for child who need it 
 we have to break this cycle of crisis intervention that be lead to spiral cost and poor outcome and bankrupt local council that be why we will have much more of a focus on kinship care foster care and early intervention to support family i know that where family be support at the early possible moment we can often prevent problem from escalate and the right hon lady will know that too i be determined that we build a system that give all our child the good possible start in life and that be why i can confirm that we will give ofsted the power that it need to tackle unregistered and illegal provision and to ensure that it be look at pattern across provider we will introduce legislation on everything we have set out today as soon as parliamentary time allow but i can say to she that this be urgent and we will act as swiftly as we can 
 on the right hon lady ’s question about the children ’s commissioner i welcome the work of the commissioner in this important area as on many other issue she have cast a light on an important area of policy where we have not act swiftly and her party fail to act i would gently point out to she that the children ’s commissioner carry out that work on behalf of the department for education the conservatives have year to tackle these issue i note that the right hon lady welcome some of the measure that we have set out today but when we set out legislation before this house to tackle the shameful failure that we have inherit i hope that conservative members will back we and more importantly back the vulnerable child in our country 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 i welcome the action that the government have announce today to improve child ’s social care the secretary of state will know that family from the poor neighbourhood be time more likely to be refer to child ’s social care than those from the rich area   and that there be a grow body of evidence link child poverty to the rise in child enter the care system how will she ensure that the upcoming child poverty strategy deliver more stability and safety for child and ensure that few family enter the kind of crisis that result in their child be remove from their care 
 my hon friend have long champion this cause and bring considerable expertise to the role that she now undertake as chair of the select committee i look forward to discuss these issue with she and her committee in due course she be right to identify that child poverty be a significant issue in this area that be why we get the work of the child poverty taskforce under way in august we know that that work be crucial what she have set out today be something that i have hear from parent the length and breadth of the country as part of the work that we be undertake it be important that alongside tackle child poverty we ensure that all family have early support and early intervention to ensure that they can thrive and that as she say problem do not escalate in the way that they currently do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the review of child ’s social care carry out by   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   in find that without reform there could be almost child in care by cost an extra £ a year so it be essential that we recognise the scale and urgency of this crisis and move quickly unlike the previous conservative government today ’s announcement be therefore a welcome step forward 
 tackle profiteer will help not only to address the financial crisis face council but to deliver well outcome for our most vulnerable child and young people these be child for whom we in this place all bear a huge responsibility and it be simply unacceptable that they have become a cash cow for private equity company rake in profit of or more so could the secretary of state spell out when we will see these reform implement and when she anticipate the backstop take effect 
 crack down on profiteer be only side of the bargain to put provision on a stable and sustainable footing we must also ensure that council can provide these service themselves where necessary so will the government work to support local authority in run child ’s home where they want to do so and where there be need many of these private equity firm be also profiteer from special school and we be start to see they in the early year sector too be the secretary of state look at those area and will she apply some of today ’s announcement to they 
 a new focus on family care be very welcome as early support for family can keep child out of care who do not need to be there kinship carer be unsung hero who often step up at a moment ’s notice to look after family member will the secretary of state please commit to move beyond the very limited pilot that have be propose to a universal allowance for kinship carer on a par with that receive by foster carer will she also take the opportunity offer by the employment rights bill which be currently before the house to legislate for pay employment leave for kinship carer   all the evidence point to that lead to well outcome and it would achieve cost saving immediately not just in the long term 
 the hon lady have rightly champion the cause of kinship carer for many year in this house and i pay tribute to she for draw attention to this crucial area the measure we set out in the budget represent the single big investment in kinship care ever make by a government this be an important step but it be not the only action we need to take in this area i will of course work with she and with member on both side of the house to make sure that kinship carer have all the support they need 
 the hon lady be right that in this house we all bear a responsibility to represent the need of vulnerable child whose voice be often not hear in our deliberation we will seek to bring forward measure as soon as parliamentary time allow because we know that the crisis we face be urgent 
 yes we will work with council on the service they can provide either directly or by work with charity and other i have see great example across the country of that already happen council need the government to give they further backing to do this on a big scale and the plan we be set out today will provide for precisely that 
 today i be call time on excessive profiteering and if provider do not respond we will not hesitate to bring forward measure to cap their profit we be look very closely at special school too 
 i welcome this statement which those of we with care experience and those of we who have work in this area have want to see for year do my right hon friend agree that it be entirely regrettable that the work of my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   be commission by the previous government and then leave on a shelf to gather dust will she reassure everyone work in this area that under this labour government every penny will go towards help young people to thrive not merely survive rather than line the pocket of profiteer 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who have consistently share his personal experience and who have demonstrate to so many young people what can be achieve even when there be barrier to overcome he know as well as i do that far too many care experienced young people in our country lack the support and backing that they deserve and we be determined to change that he be also right to point to the excellent work of my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister i be delighted to have be able to set out many development arise from that crucial work there be so much more that we need to do together to put the right and need of vulnerable child at the heart of our policymaking 
 i call graham stuart 
 thank you mr deputy speaker interruption i do not mean to knock you down a peg mr speaker that would be very unwise 
 i regret the secretary of state ’s tone in response to the shadow secretary of state and i hope that over time she learn not to adopt that tone on issue such as this the shadow secretary of state note that there be a capacity crisis and the secretary of state have say that we need great early intervention now be the secretary of state confident that she have the resource to support local authority and other in tackle this twin challenge both part need to be tackle at the same time which be a truly serious undertaking 
 i be not quite sure how to begin to respond to the frankly extraordinary part of the right hon gentleman ’s question to take the more serious point he raise we be determined to ensure that we have the resource and support in place for the most vulnerable child in our country the reason i get so cross when i hear some of the contribution make by conservative members be that during my time as shadow secretary of state and secretary of state i have hear directly from far too many child who have be badly fail by this system it be shocking and shameful and we will change it 
 year of inaction by previous conservative governments have lead to vulnerable child feel forgotten and council be financially crippled how will my right hon friend ensure that reform truly prioritise child ’s wellbeing and tackle profiteer at their expense 
 my hon friend bring real expertise to this house from her work in education education be also a crucial area where we need to work together on safeguarding school staff teacher and other have a role to play in keep child safe and ensure that all child can thrive the step that we be set out today will make a big change to the life chance and wellbee of many child across our country and i be grateful for her support for that important work 
 for far too long child ’s service have be a cinderella department i be delighted that the secretary of state be shin a light on they and drive a positive way forward for they we need to ensure that our community be kinship and foster care friendly how will the secretary of state drive that agenda 
 i agree that there be still much more that we need to do to support kinship carer and foster family that be why the measure we set out in the budget be so important from speak to kinship carer in my constituency on friday i know that there be still too many barrier in place include difference between local authority issue around access to mental health support and the need to do more to support kinship carer in balance work and care responsibility i look forward to work with the hon gentleman on those important area 
 the almost kinship carer in portsmouth north welcome this government ’s prioritisation of kinship care it be vital to keep kid with their family however not all child can live with their family so some live in the care system   because of the past year of conservative government life have be too tough so will the secretary of state tell we a little more about what this government will do to support those care leaver 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the fact that sadly a move to a different kind of placement outside family care be a necessary step for some child for their safety and wellbeing and in the interest of their long term future we be roll out the stay close programme nationally to ensure that all care leaver get the support they deserve we be also set out plan around corporate parenting to ensure that all of we fulfil our responsibility to the child for whom we be responsible i be delighted to chair with the deputy prime minister the care leaver ministerial board because there be more that all of we across government need to do to ensure that care experienced young people have their voice hear and to ensure that we take action to address their concern 
 year ago bath and north east somerset council ’s budget for child ’s service be £ this year it be predict to be £ transport cost particularly be spiral out of control as private provider seem to deliberately place young people out of area what my council need apart from potential price control be capital investment so that it can rebuild its in house service will the minister commit to that 
 i agree that cost be spiral out of control more action be necessary to support council in invest in service and ensure provision for child much close to home too many child be be send far away from family support network that present local council with additional cost pressure and push many to the point of bankruptcy as well as deny child the life chance they deserve 
 the secretary of state will be aware that local authority have a legal duty to house unintentionally homeless people include those in priority need such as to year old care leaver and people with dependent child at the housing communities and local government committee we hear that shockingly over child be in temporary accommodation in england do the secretary of state agree that without urgent action on the housing crisis we will not see improvement for care leave child 
 i agree and the deputy prime minister be determined to drive forward change in this area not just with more home be build across our country include social home but by take action in the area that my hon friend describe when child be leave the care system i assure she that the government will act in those area 
 i warmly welcome today ’s statement the secretary of state be right that it be long overdue and that early intervention be key too many child in this country be in care because they and their family do not get the support and help that they need when they need it   she reference the report lead by   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister which state that we need a revolution in family help and specifically a £ temporary injection of financial support to make the shift to prevention can she make that commitment 
 i be sure that my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington will speak for himself on his report the government recognise the need to rebalance the system away from crisis intervention and to break the cycle of spend ever more pot of money on what amount to a failure within our system we will refocus our work on early support for family and ensure that there be more support for kinship and foster family that be important not just give the cost of the increase number of intervention most crucially it be how we will deliver well life chance for the most vulnerable child in our country 
 have grow up in a kinship care setting with my grandparent i heartily welcome the content of the command paper have its provision be available to my grandparent i would have have a very different experience grow up so i greatly welcome what the secretary of state be do however for those young people who have to enter the care system it can not be a way process age out can not be the only exit will she set out a little more on what the paper will do to help with reunification so that young people who go into care can go back to their parent i encourage she to look at the work of pause a national charity that be do so much work with the birth parent of child who get take into care so that they get the help and support that they need after what can be a very traumatic experience 
 i thank my hon friend for speak about his experience he will know that until quite recently this area be perhaps little understood it be so important that people like he be able to speak openly it demonstrate bravery and will encourage other to do the same i will happily look at the report and the work that he mention and ensure that route back into family care for those child for whom that be possible be consider in our ongoing work 
 in the london borough of sutton we start to in house some child ’s care home provision back in and we now care for child with complex need what assessment have the department make of the potential scale of local authority take on service directly if give the right support by the government 
 like the hon gentleman i have see good example of council across the country that have start to take such action but they have do so by go against the grain of government policy this time council will have the backing of the government in make those change we will also ensure that they can take action on a regional basis work together and collaborate so that they can manage placement more effectively that way we will not just bring down cost to the taxpayer which be spiral out of control but ensure that child can stay close to family support network which be crucial to their long term future 
 have spend year watch child ’s service struggle in the way the secretary of state outline with serious case review often be the moment of intervention i heartily welcome the emphasis on early intervention and what she say about the responsibility that we all have she will know that there have be much discussion about the concept of corporate parenting what be her think on that and what role do she see for we as members of parliament at the moment relationship across the country be clearly too inconsistent that be to the detriment of safeguarding and indeed of our young people 
 my hon friend be right that there be many long stand challenge in this area on corporate parenting today ’s command paper set out the step that we intend to take to bring forward further plan in this area i look forward to work with she on the shape and scale of those plan because it be essential that we all take our responsibility incredibly seriously as i know she do 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s broad commitment to reduce the number of child who need to go into care build on the comment of   the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell i want to emphasise the work that pause do with west sussex county council and other authority pause have a vision of ensure that no go through have a child take into care more than once however more than half of area have no support available for parent after a child be remove from their care which lead to many be trap in a cycle of pregnancy care proceeding and repeat removal what assurance can the secretary of state give that this valuable work will be more widely roll out across the country and will she meet i and pause to discuss how that work can be take forward 
 i be grateful to the hon lady and i be sure that the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for lewisham east janet daby   would be happy to meet she to discuss the issue far she be right to identify the need for ongoing support for family when a child or child have be remove before come to this house i work with many family who be in that situation i see directly not just how much of a difference could be make to the life of those child and family but how when mother be go through subsequent pregnancy that intervention and support could often be crucial in make sure that the child be able to stay with the mother that be sadly not always possible but much more can be achieve with the right level of support i certainly see some amazing example where it be possible to break what have sadly feel like a cycle 
 i thank all those work so hard to support vulnerable child in our country and i thank the secretary of state for her statement today and some excellent step forward may i ask she for a little more clarity on the important point she make about the need for great co production with charity and other agency 
 as we take forward further proposal both for legislation and for wide change and reform across the sector we look forward to work not only   with family right organisation charity and other to make sure that they be involve in the design of service but with our brilliant and often unsung workforce as my hon friend identifie who often do their work behind the scene and without the recognition they deserve our social work workforce and other play a crucial role and we be determined to do more to support they in their vital endeavour 
 i warmly welcome today ’s statement from the secretary of state as a county councillor in oxfordshire the number of child in our care who be live in unregistered child ’s home be of grave concern to i those home be often overpriced and always suboptimal for vulnerable child as well as be strictly illegal i hear what the secretary of state have to say about the local authority settlement next month will she undertake to work with the deputy prime minister and the chancellor to allocate some of the capital investment announce in the budget so that local authority can open new register child ’s home and provide safe and more affordable accommodation close to home for vulnerable young people 
 i agree and i will be work very closely with the chancellor and the deputy prime minister in this area the hon gentleman be right to highlight the increase in unsafe unregistered placement that be why we be give ofsted further power to act and why i set out in the command paper that we will make sure that council and other have the power they need to deliver more placement for child i encourage he to look closely at that work i think he will find much that he can welcome in it 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s considerate focus child in care have die in unregulated accommodation but that do not stop the last conservative government introduce cruel legislation to make it permissible for council to place child in care age and above into such accommodation tent caravan bed and breakfast and house in multiple occupation surround by adult stranger and with no continue care at all please will she overturn that legislation
