 i begin by pay tribute to my immediate predecessor both of whom be still member of this house i thank   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew   for be gracious and friendly and for his commitment to our community especially guiseley and i thank my hon friend   the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel   and his fantastic team for their commitment to our community and to tackle climate change i also pay tribute to those who come before greg mulholland paul truswell and the late harold best who all have a continued presence in the constituency those esteemed gentleman have all fight for our community and i be honour to stand on their shoulder but i say gentleman for good reason i be proud to be the woman ever to represent leeds north west the place where i be bear and raise as be my parent before i see more woman elect to parliament than ever before matter it matter to the woman and girl across our community to alice in otley navdeeb in adel and chloe in horsforth we have not have enough female mps in my home city but we be make up for lose time leed now boast the female chancellor ever so there be progress friend progress 
 leeds north west have an incredible history the stunning norman church in adel date back to the century it be where my parent be marry where i be christen and where my grandfather lie at rest further west be otley chevin member may not yet have have the chance to visit otley chevin but we would not be here without it the stone from the chevin provide the foundation for this very parliament when it be rebuild in the 1840 it should not be a surprise that it be yorkshire that keep this house ground 
 in leeds north west our foot be always plant firmly on that bedrock but our eye remain on the horizon ready to embrace the future our constituency   be a vibrant hub of entrepreneurship and creativity a legacy that continue to thrive today abraham moon in guiseley a fabric company establish in still supply international fashion house today while emis which begin in the 1980 in horsforth now flourish in beautiful rawdon as the lead provider of datum support to the nhs we be home to west yorkshire ’s only airport leeds bradford and i be pleased to meet with jet2 ’s chief executive officer steve just this week to discuss how the aviation sector can innovate to decarbonise should member wish to stop for a bite to eat they should look no far than the thrive bar and restaurant of vibrant horsforth it be a constituency burst with joyful community fair and fete from guiseley festival to yeadon carnival and from rawdon summer gala to the arthington and bramhope show that last come complete with a human fruit machine 
 there be no strong pride than yorkshire pride and our community spirit be a great source of strength however as in many place people be feel overwhelmed and concerned about their future and that of their child and grandchild many of the people i have meet on the doorstep also feel let down let down by politician and by the institution they have put their trust in over decade the infected blood scandal be the most extreme and harrowing example of such systematic failure people place their trust in doctor and the government to protect they and that trust be betray i be proud that this government and this prime minister will introduce a duty of candour law to prevent future cover up like the infected blood and post office scandal 
 i also share deep concern about the other great challenge face our community mental health figure be horrify the global mind project have reveal that the uk have the high rate of mental distress in the world and rank worst in overall mental health people be work hard yet get unhealthier and unhappy and of course the climate and nature crisis loom 
 we need thing to change the country vote for change and it be change that propel i into politic my journey begin with the climate crisis we know that if we get it wrong we face disaster particularly for the most vulnerable among we but if we get it right we unlock enormous opportunity for our society in i join the local leeds branch of friends of the earth and launch a campaign for the uk ’s climate change bill everyone tell i that it be impossible that it be too ambitious and too radical there be no way that the treasury would ever allow a carbon budget but friend they do we turn that campaign into the most support campaign in parliament ’s history with cross party backing from member across the house the last labour government turn that bill into an act in under my right hon friend   the member for doncaster north ed miliband whom i be honour to be work with again under this act britain decarbonise fast than any other rich country this act have now become a global benchmark adopt by other nation and that i say to my hon friend be what global leadership look like 
 why be i share this it be because politic must be about real change or it be about nothing i want to serve our community and improve our school healthcare    and public service when i think about change i think about my grandmother marjorie simms she challenge the status quo she live in horsforth in the1950s there be not that many woman drive then but marjorie do there be not that many woman wear trouser but marjorie do majorie develop breast cancer and most parent in the 1950 avoid talk to their child but marjorie show they her mastectomy so they could understand she die at the age i enter parliament majorie do thing differently and her spirit live on in i we have see too much promise and too little delivery in recent year endless debate about challenge but a lack of energy for real solution politic should be about action not just word 
 the seed of change can be see within our community as a government our role be to water they and create the condition for they to flourish leed north west be willing to play its role in full we have the leader we have the idea and we have the get stuff do attitude that personify yorkshire like the student i meet recently at ralph thoresby and green meadows or the cadet in my constituency who be ambitious about the difference we can make like the horsforth shed set up a couple of year ago by ex teacher base on the national man ’s shed model and support male mental health but expand to include many other vulnerable member of the community like those from otley who decide they want to be a beacon of hope and create a live laboratory in the town to create climate friendly and sustainable solution where people and nature thrive and like brian who after a death in morrison car park in guiseley set up defibrillator all over the community so that lifesave equipment be on hand and there be a network of community activist service they let we not forget the gold medal olympians in our community the brownlee brother and the cyclist tom pidcock who inspire we all with their dedication and achievement we be indeed a hotbed of world class talent 
 people in leeds north west do not wait for change to come to they they make it happen they be the doer and the problem solver and i will play my role in that same way i will champion the green agenda by focus on practical solution that carve a british path towards a successful green transition we will leverage our strength whether it be world lead research support our good business mind or unlock the public and private investment need to turbocharge a green economy i will support the health of our community mental health physical health community health and i want to support our entrepreneur and creativity to grow our region i promise to be a ferocious champion for my community my beloved yorkshire and our country and i will do it with joy it may recently have become more fashionable across the pond but i have be measure with joy for year and there be always space for a little more joy 
 finally i promise to listen learn and reflect no have all the answer but all of we have some of they i commit to work constructively and collectively i will endeavour to arrive with curiosity and non judgment because if we want to change the way we do thing we must start in this moment in this place and with these action 
 i be really sorry to   hear the plight of shropshire farmer we inherit the flood defence programme in disrepair and thank to   year of mismanagement and failure community be unprotected and family and business be   force to pay the price we launch a flood defence taskforce to turbocharge the delivery and co ordination of flood defence and we be invest £   this year to scale up flood national resilience i   will ensure that the hon lady get a meeting with   the minister 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether he have have discussion with the northern ireland executive on recent trend in energy cost in northern ireland 
 although energy cost have come down they remain too high our priority be to ensure access to energy be affordable and secure for consumer that be why this government have establish great british energy which will operate across the whole uk include northern ireland the department for energy security and net and the northern ireland department for the economy be work together positively on the gb energy bill 
 it be a pleasure to see the minister in her place and i wish she well we have be friend for some time she will be aware of northern ireland ’s unique energy profile we be more heavily dependent and reliant on oil than other nation in the united kingdom with some of people in northern ireland use oil be that take into consideration when the government determine to cut the winter fuel allowance what discussion be have with the northern ireland executive in relation to do so 
 i be aware that third of northern ireland ’s home use oil the decision to mean test winter fuel payment be not a decision the government wish to make but a result of the conservative ’s £ black hole in northern ireland the executive have decide that winter fuel payment will continue to be pay to household where someone receive pension credit i have check the figure in northern ireland it be estimate that over people could be eligible for pension credit and the winter fuel payment but be not receive they i encourage anyone who be eligible or know someone who could be to check and apply if they can 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help promote business in northern ireland 
 what step his department be take to help grow the northern ireland economy 
 northern ireland be a great place to live work and invest that be something the secretary of state and i have promote in our over visit and meeting growth be a key mission of this government which be why we be support uk business through secure further investment and through our industrial strategy the chancellor will set out the step this government be take to support growth across the uk on   october 
 business in northern ireland be struggle to operate in a constantly shift regulatory environment that be deter investment and decrease business confidence it be no wonder that a of uk business want the government to reduce brexit relate barrier such as custom procedure accord to a recent survey by santander a starting point would be agricultural trade will the minister update the house on progress in negotiate a new veterinary and plant health agreement with the european union 
 many business have secure excellent deal in northern ireland include ey which be bring over job wrightbus at its bus factory in ballymena and hannon pharma link we be work at pace on a veterinary agreement we want to reduce check and the need for check do all that we can to protect the uk ’s internal market this government have bring in economic stability in place of the economic chaos we see up until now and northern ireland business will benefit from that 
 it be all very well talk about an industrial strategy but economist agree that increase national insurance contribution for employer reduce profit reduce pay and lead to few job do the minister agree that if the government decide to raise taxis perhaps to fund union pay rise then employer national insurance contribution would be the last tax to choose if they want to support northern ireland ’s economy 
 it be hard to take lecture from the conservative party on investment and growth we have have a change election we will be invest in growth the hon member have only a week to wait to listen to what will be happen in the budget in the meantime we be go at pace the international investment summit bring in considerable investment for company base in northern ireland we be move on with our industrial strategy invest we be invest in skill and get people into work and transform our health service that be essential so that people will want to come to northern ireland because of good   health service and so that they will be well enough to work all of that be a package for investment in northern ireland 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 at last week ’s international investment summit the prime minister and the chancellor announce a total of £ of private investment into the uk economy what step be the secretary of state and the minister take to ensure northern ireland be at the forefront of this government ’s effort to stimulate the investment that   be need 
 the secretary of state go to the international summit with the and deputy ministers and they be all work together on this the ballymena bus manufacturer wrightbus recently sign a deal worth £ to supply more than bus to go ahead.[official report   october vol c. 6wc.](correction that show real business confidence in northern ireland we be also focus on the skill gap i have meet wonderful skill provider across northern ireland to talk about how we can get people into well pay job and to achieve fast growth 
 it be good to hear from the minister about the work be do to close the skill gap can she provide further example of that work and lie out her intention for the future 
 my hon friend be right to raise the issue of the skill gap and economic inactivity in northern ireland i have meet wonderful skill provider across northern ireland such as the rural women ’s network bolster community the superstars club disability action northern ireland ulster university and the king ’s trust a wealth of work be be do on good skill support and we in the uk government want to work with the northern ireland executive to continue to provide support in that area a reliable bespoke skill offer be essential to futureproof northern ireland ’s key growth sector 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister talk about growth but the mid south west region growth deal which be pause by this government now lie inactive with no direction and there be report that much need private sector business involvement be now withdraw will the minister accept that this government ’s handling and pausing of these growth deal be haphazard will she apologise to the people affect and enter urgent direct talk with business to get this deal back off the ground 
 the secretary of state and i be in constant talk about such deal and with the deal provider i know the value of these deal not just to the region affect but across northern ireland however the government face a £ black hole and it be right that the treasury consider all option on the table to address that we will find out more in the budget next week the mid south west and the causeway coast and glens growth deal be be consider as part of   the spending review and the government will continue to work closely with the deal partner and the executive the secretary of state and i will continue to underline the importance of these deal to my ministerial colleague in the treasury 
 i call the leader of the democratic unionist party 
 we look forward to a positive conclusion to those discussion next week as the minister know both representative from the mid south west region growth deal and the causeway coast and glens growth deal be in westminster today will the minister acknowledge that in work with business and in try to encourage great trade within our own country the appointment of a chair of intertrade uk be an important step but work need to start the term of reference need to be set and business need to be able to engage with that body establish to support trade within our country 
 i agree with the right hon member that intertrade uk need to get go with its work to encourage investment between all of the region and nation of the uk it be very important to set the term of reference and we be work with the organisation as fast as we can now that the chair be in their place 
 i thank the minister for her reply she will know from discussion with her cabinet colleague that decision have be take to delay the agreement on parcel to delay the agreement on custom and to avoid take the decision on uk wide labelling myriad other decision be also make and support by this house include labour members that be require to be implement from the safeguard the union document she will know about the interface between trade and constitutional politic so i urge she to engage with the secretary of state the paymaster general and other within the cabinet to get on and deliver what business and the people of northern ireland need 
 we be not the only ministers who come into office month ago to have face all sort of decision that should have be take by the previous government we have take up those decision on parcel and on every aspect that the right hon member mention he be right to raise they because we do need to work on they to ensure that we protect the uk internal market and that we create the good possible regime for business 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the windsor framework non commercial movement of pet animals regulations on people travel with pet from great britain to northern ireland 
 the statutory instrument for the northern ireland pet travel scheme have now be lay the scheme significantly reduce the requirement associate with    the original northern ireland protocol and provide a stable and long term arrangement for those travel with their pet within the uk 
 when the grip of eu law control even the movement of our pet within the united kingdom be it not clear that we have go far too far in regard northern ireland as eu territory for that be the reason for this absurd regulation which at the behest of the eu impose pet passport if a person want to bring their pet from gb to northern ireland there be no point the secretary of state say that it could have be bad they should not exist at all when will this government get the eu off our back and liberate   the people of northern ireland and our pet from   eu diktat 
 as i hope the hon gentleman be aware northern ireland pet owner will not face any check and will not be require to hold a pet travel document in discuss this matter there be an obligation on he and all of we to ensure that we present the fact so that people be not unnecessarily trouble 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the executive ’s draft programme for government acknowledge that police number in northern ireland be at an all time low a situation that chief constable boutcher have describe as dangerous the draft programme commit to increase number in line with new decade new approach be the secretary of state convince that the budget sustainability plan be sufficient to achieve that aim 
 order i be not sure that fit with the question 
 i be intend to ask a supplementary to question 
 well i think we will wait then let we move on i call dr lauren sullivan 
 question mr speaker laughter 
 whether he have have discussion with the northern ireland executive on the budget sustainability plan 
 whether he have have discussion with the northern ireland executive on the budget sustainability plan 
 whether he have have discussion with the northern ireland executive on the budget sustainability plan 
 where be we mr speaker 
 i welcome the publication of the northern ireland executive ’s budget sustainability plan a positive and necessary step towards sustainable public finance and the chief secretary to the treasury have agree with the northern ireland finance minister that discussion over a long term fiscal framework for northern ireland can now begin 
 do the secretary of state agree that to ensure sustainable finance the northern ireland executive need to take step to reform the nhs and public service 
 i share my hon friend ’s view as the house will be aware people in northern ireland face the long waiting list in the whole united kingdom and all government include the northern ireland executive have to balance the money come in and the fund that they can raise and take decision about public service reform i be very encouraged by the recent event organise by the northern ireland health minister which dr bengoa who produce a report on reform in northern ireland return to northern ireland to attend because there be now a commitment to take forward that process 
 what impact do the secretary of state think that the uk leave the european convention on human right would have on the sustainability of northern ireland ’s finance and devolve government 
 give that the european convention on human right be of the foundation of the good friday agreement i be frankly astonish that anyone who aspire to lead his majesty ’s opposition should suggest that our country should leave the echr it would be utterly irresponsible 
 i commend all those who work to re establish devolved government early this year at stormont it be now vital that the northern ireland executive ensure that they have sustainable finance do the secretary of state agree that revenue raising by the northern ireland executive have an important part to play in deliver financial sustainability and stability to northern ireland 
 i do indeed raise £ be part of the deal that the last government put in place as part of the £ package that lead to the restoration well that follow the restoration of the executive that include deliver a balanced budget in the current year and i be very encouraged by the statement of the northern ireland finance minister in that regard 
 the budget sustainability plan be commendable but do the secretary of state agree that our public service be in crisis our road be crumble we have the long health waiting list in the whole of the uk and our school need investment northern ireland need to be in receipt of a fair long term funding allocation base on treasury need will he confirm to the house that he be make the case for that to the treasury for the people of northern ireland 
 northern ireland ’s great spending need be recognise the northern ireland fiscal council be establish to answer the question of what that additional funding should be and it come to the conclusion that the figure should be which will be meet this year in respect of the budget the interim fiscal framework also say that if further credible source come along suggest that the figure should be different the government would undertake to look at that but nothing take away from the executive ’s responsibility to manage the budget that they have and to take decision include on reform 
 do the secretary of state agree that the budget resource for the northern ireland justice minister be extremely short and that we be not able to recruit enough police service of northern ireland officer and have he have any discussion with the justice minister about resolve that problem 
 as the hon member will be aware decision about the allocation of the northern ireland budget rest with the northern ireland executive fund go to the justice minister who then decide principally how much to pass on to the police board for police cost and how much to deal with the justice system and the prison which be also under pressure i recognise the pressure that psni officer face not least because i meet a number of those who be injure in the recent disorder 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it be very generous of you to call i again mr speaker the executive ’s draft programme for government acknowledge that police number in northern ireland be at an all time low a situation that the chief constable have describe as dangerous the draft programme commit to increase number in line with new decade new approach be the secretary of state convince that the budget sustainability plan be sufficient to achieve that aim 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point as we discuss just a moment ago i recognise the pressure on the psni but it fall to the executive to decide how much to allocate from the fund available to they to police and other public service in northern ireland if they wish to allocate more they be in a position to do so but it involve make a choice 
 the secretary of state be of course right that police in northern ireland be a devolved matter but national security be not if we look at police number right now which be at an all time low we be remind that his party ’s manifesto make explicit commitment to improve public service in northern ireland will the government commit to ensure that police in northern ireland be sufficient to keep the people of northern ireland safe and maintain national security and to protect the additional security funding of £ a year that come direct from his majesty ’s treasury 
 on the latter point the hon gentleman just have to wait a week to see what the budget produce i simply say to he that the psni the security service    and other do an outstanding job in protect the people of northern ireland from terrorist threat and we should all support they in that endeavour 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the budget sustainability plan highlight that northern ireland have be systemically underfunde with the fiscal council estimate an annual shortfall of between £ and £ since meanwhile the northern ireland executive report a £ overspend between and what measure be the government take to address northern ireland ’s immediate budgetary pressure ensure long term financial stability and equitable funding and crucially guarantee sustainable public service 
 in addition to the £ package that follow the restoration of the executive the executive gain £ in july when the main estimate be publish in order to avoid have to repay the debt that the hon member refer to they have to put their finance on a sustainable path deliver a balanced budget and raise the additional £ revenue to which they commit when the deal be do the fiscal council ’s view be that be the right funding 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to remove barrier to trade between northern ireland and great britain 
 the government be commit to implement the windsor framework in good faith and to protect northern ireland ’s place in the uk internal market we continue to take forward policy set out in safeguard the union include most recently the establishment of the independent monitoring panel and the publication of guidance under section of the united kingdom internal market act 
 there be some concern regard the supply of medicine to northern ireland the british generic manufacturers association say that there be an absurd situation in which there will be shortage due to the bureaucracy of the uk only labelling require for medicine go into northern ireland the government say that they be relaxed that the deadline will be meet be the secretary of state relax about the continue supply of medicine come into northern ireland 
 it be really important that the medicine that be require continue to be supply the industry have have quite a period in which to make arrangement to ensure that the labelling rule be meet i hope that in the time available those company that have not do so will do so 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on implement the windsor framework labelling   requirement set out in his department ’s command paper entitle safeguard the union publish on january 
 have carefully consider the result of the consultation with industry the government decide not to proceed with the introduction of mandatory not for eu labelling in great britian from   october instead we will take the power necessary to apply not for eu labelling in the future if that be require to secure supply in northern ireland 
 the result of the northern ireland protocol sign by the previous government have be to create an economic border between northern ireland and great britain and the imposition of eu law which have create a problem for the supply of good to northern ireland when in opposition labour support the idea of food labelling as a way of avoid an interruption in the supply of food good from gb to northern ireland so why have the government renege on that promise and what will be the trigger for its imposition if need 
 the consultation on uk wide labelling lead the industry to say that such labelling would impose huge cost on industry and therefore on consumer through raise good price the aim be to ensure that good be not delist in northern ireland that be why we be take a power to ensure that if there be any evidence of that happen the labelling requirement set out in safeguard the union can be apply include on individual product on a sectoral basis 
 i do not come back to josh newbury after question so he will ask his supplementary question now 
 business in my constituency tell i that they face increase red tape and cost when import from or export to northern ireland can the secretary of state confirm that he be committed to unfettered access for good move from northern ireland to great britian 
 i certainly can confirm that and it be set out in the united kingdom internal market act 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on violence against woman and girl in northern ireland 
 i congratulate my hon friend on her new role as leader of the social democratic and labour party and i thank she for raise this important issue woman and girl have be kill violently in northern ireland this year alone that be devastating i have discuss the importance of action on violence against woman and girl with the minister and the deputy minister and i welcome the northern ireland executive make it a priority in their programme for government as well as the new strategic framework 
 mary ward in my constituency become the woman to be murder in just week in northern ireland it remain of the most dangerous place in europe to be a woman with a femicide rate twice that of britain we need to think deeply about the type of society that we have create and that be manifest in this way the recent publication of the northern ireland strategy on violence against woman be overdue and very welcome do the minister agree that the funding and human resource attach to that strategy must be proportionate to the urgency and the deep root of the issue will she support the executive as they review the sentencing and judicial process that be contribute to these very preventable death 
 my thought be with the family and friend and all those affect by the murder of mary ward every woman deserve to feel safe there be what have be call an epidemic of violence against woman and girl in northern ireland i join my hon friend in welcome the new strategy we need strong action by the justice system and more support for frontline service in order to tackle harassment wherever it be in home school workplace and on our street we need to challenge and change misogynistic attitude and behaviour that will need urgent action and we work together and this government stand ready to do that 
 whether he have have discussion with the police service of northern ireland on its use of surveillance power 
 i meet regularly with the chief constable and his team to discuss a range of issue while the chief constable have operational independence the investigatory powers commissioner ’s office provide oversight of those power to ensure that their use be necessary proportionate and in accordance with the law 
 at a recent hearing of the investigatory powers tribunal it become apparent that the northern ireland police force have be catch surveille journalist telephone on the basis that they have receive secret document from whistleblower the reason for the secrecy of those document be to cover up the embarrassment of the royal ulster constabulary about its handling of the loughinisland massacre will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the future use of surveillance power by the northern ireland police 
 i be indeed aware of the background to this case the original search warrant be quash and the police investigation be discontinue as the right hon gentleman know the investigatory powers tribunal be currently look at this case and it would not be appropriate for i to comment while that be ongoing the chief constable have set up the mccullough review to look at the wide issue and the right hon gentleman may well wish to make representation to that review 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 i have be ask to reply as my right hon and learn friend the prime minister be in samoa to discuss share opportunity in the commonwealth include how we work together to deliver economic growth with increase threat face britain it be vital that we also strengthen defence security and co operation with our ally that be why today this government sign a landmark defence agreement with germany that will help keep we safe and create hundred of job 
 i know the whole house will join i in send our good wish to sir chris hoy and his wife sarra he be a true sporting legend and the courage and positivity they have show will inspire many other i also send our condolence to those affect by the train crash in powys 
 this morning i have have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 for year my constituent in newcastle under lyme have to suffer flatline wage in work poverty and a bust economy that serve nobody can i urge the deputy prime minister to use the employment rights bill to turn the page on the last year give our business the support they need and finally restore dignity prosperity and opportunity to the good people of newcastle under lyme 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and welcome he to his place when this government take office we promise the big upgrade to worker right in a generation a new deal for work people we say that we would introduce a bill within the day and we have keep that promise this be a labour government lead by work people for work people 
 i call the deputy leader of the opposition 
 i join the deputy prime minister in pay tribute to the bravery of sir chris hoy he truly be an inspiration to we all i also echo her comment about the train crash in powys 
 what be the deputy prime minister ’s definition of work people 
 let i start by welcome the right hon gentleman to his new place today be our exchange since he push for a july general election and if his own side have not offer he a peerage i certainly would have 
 the definition of work people be the people who the tory party have fail for the past year 
 the deputy prime minister stand on a manifesto promise not to raise taxis on work people it now appear that she can not even define who work people be so i will give she another go there be small business owner in this country be they work people 
 i do not know how the shadow deputy prime minister can stand there with a straight face when it be the small business the work people of this country that pay the price of the conservatives crash the economy send interest rate soar i think he need to learn his own lesson in opposition 
 i think the whole house will have hear the deputy prime minister disregard hard work small business owner these be the publican the shopkeeper the family run a local café none of those count as work people to she 
 labour give a clear commitment not to raise national insurance the independent institute for fiscal studies have give its view on this it say that raise employer national insurance be 
 a tax on work people 
 even the chancellor say that raise employer national insurance be a job tax that will 
 make each new recruit more expensive and increase the cost to business 
 so do the deputy prime minister agree with the ifs and her own chancellor 
 i remember what the conservatives say to business what be it eff business whereas this party hold an international investment summit last week which put about £ into our economy we be pro business pro worker and get on with fix the mess that they leave behind 
 i think we can take it from that answer that the deputy prime minister do not agree with the ifs and i suppose it should not come as a surprise that she do not agree with her chancellor but do she agree with this 
 work people will pay when employer pass on the hike in national insurance 
 those be her word so do she at least agree with herself 
 what i be incredibly proud of be that this week this government bring in a new employment bill that will raise the living standard of worker would the shadow deputy prime minister like to apologise for the hike in taxis they be at a year high that he put on work people the crashing of the economy and the disaster that he leave behind 
 the deputy prime minister mention her policy let we be clear it be a £ hit to the british economy and that be her own assessment follow these answer there will be million of work people even more worried about the tax rise come their way in next week ’s budget 
 however as this be our last exchange across the dispatch box i would like to turn to somebody i hope we can all agree be a hard work person his majesty the king will the deputy prime minister join i in send he well wish ahead of the commonwealth summit in samoa in particular will she confirm that this government recognise the unique role play by the commonwealth and will she commit to deepen that relationship so that under his majesty ’s leadership we build upon possibly the great legacy of the late queen 
 i will miss our exchange the battle of the ginger the late night vote and in that spirit i will agree with my right hon friend the king do a tremendous job and so do the late queen the commonwealth be very important and that be why the king and the prime minister be work together at the moment 
 i thank the right hon lady for that answer our commonwealth family be bring together by historical and cultural tie indeed much like the pair of we interruption i will resist the temptation to replicate that as we look to the commonwealth ’s future we have the opportunity to deepen our economic relationship will she assure the house that the prime minister will use the summit to continue the work begin by the last government of build deep economic tie with our commonwealth friend and ally 
 we talk about economic the architect of the tory general election campaign be do his victory lap before retire with the hereditary peer that he fight so hard to protect he leave behind a tory party in utter denial head in the sand refuse to accept their rejection by the british public their plan for britain include scrap the minimum wage cut maternity pay and tax break for the big oil company this labour government be elected—[interruption 
 order dr evans you have get a sore neck i wish a little that it be your throat 
 tory members do not like to hear it but this labour government be elect to end the tory chaos and that be exactly what we be do with £ more in the pocket of insecure worker new dad give paternity leave and work people well off while their so call leadership candidate argue about what go wrong this labour government be get on with rebuild britain 
 i like many mp have hear many heart rend story of constituent who have have poor end of life support have palliative care be available alongside an end of life plan their experience could have be so different will the deputy prime minister agree to set up a commission for palliative and end of life care so that everyone can access the very good support when terminally ill and have a peaceful and dignified death and will she meet to discuss that

 with permission mr speaker i would like to update the house on the action that this government be take to fundamentally transform our water industry and clean up our waterway for good 
 year of conservative failure have leave our water sector in disrepair the river lake and sea that we all love have record level of pollution severe drought be set to leave part of the country face significant water shortage by particularly in the south east and water company forecast that england will need to find an extra litre of water a day to fill the gap between supply and demand by that same year a rise population and the increase impact of climate change be put strain on the water system firmer action should have be take by the previous government to ensure that money be invest to fix the water and sewerage system instead they allow that money to be siphon off for bonus while our water infrastructure crumble 
 a secure water supply be essential for every home and business throughout the country it be the foundation of our economy our community and our global security it be essential to life itself we use water to cool power station and it be vital to our electricity supply we use water to grow the crop that provide the food on our plate and we use it to supply our leisure industry without a resilient water supply we can not build the new home and critical infrastructure that we need to grow the economy 
 concern about pollution water shortage bill increase and the sector ’s financial resilience all point to the need for profound change the water sector need a complete reset with a reform water sector work in partnership with government to bring in the investment we need we need a clear long term plan to ensure that the sector put customer and the environment and can attract investment to upgrade our infrastructure we need a water system fit for the future we can not clean up our river lake and sea overnight but we have a plan and the work of change have start 
 on   july i make a statement to the house on the agreement that i reach with water company and ofwat to ringfence money earmark for investment in water infrastructure so that it can no long be divert for shareholder payout and undeserved bonus payment on   september we introduce the water special measures bill which set out new measure include measure strengthen regulation to ensure that water boss face personal criminal liability for serious and repeat lawbreaking give the water regulator new power to ban the payment of bonus if environmental standard be not meet and boost accountability for water executive through a new code of conduct today i be pleased to announce the stage of our plan 
 together with the welsh government we be launch an independent commission that will lead the big review of the water industry since privatisation year ago the commission will ensure that we have the robust regulatory framework that we need to attract the significant investment that be require to clean up our waterway   build new infrastructure to address water scarcity and restore public confidence in the sector i be delighted that it will be lead by the former deputy governor of the bank of england sir jon cunliffe who have decade of economic and regulatory experience sir jon will be support by an advisory group of expert cover area such as the environment public health engineering customer investor and economic he will seek advice from wide group of stakeholder include environmental campaigner consumer champion water company regulator and the public at large 
 the commission will conduct a root and branch review of the water sector ’s regulatory system it will cover the water industry in england and wales and the strategic planning framework under the water framework directive and river basin management plan to ensure that strategic water planning across sector be effective at catchment regional and national scale where housing planning agriculture and drainage interlink with strategic planning across the water system they be also in scope 
 the commission will set a new framework for the future it will not make recommendation that affect the current price review process in order to ensure that there be a stable climate for investment as that process conclude it will be pragmatic and will focus on reform that improve the privatised regulatory model nationalisation of the water sector will not be in scope because of the high cost of buy out the current owner lack of evidence that it would lead to improvement and the long delay that it would cause in the process of clean up polluted water and serve customer well 
 the commission will make recommendation in the half of report to i as environment secretary and to the deputy minister and cabinet secretary for climate change and rural affairs in wales once it have make its recommendation the uk and welsh governments will respond and consult on proposal include subsequent legislation further detail of the commission ’s scope delivery approach and timeline be set out in its term of reference which will be available on gov.uk today 
 this government will deliver an ambitious long term and collaborative approach to reform the water sector create a strong new partnership between government water company customer investor and all those who work to protect our precious environment the commission will set the groundwork for the reform water sector that we want to see i thank sir jon for lead this important work 
 this be our opportunity to ensure that our child and their child have the chance to create memory that will last a lifetime to splash about at the seaside row on our river or enjoy a picnic on the lake shore this be our opportunity to inject billion of pound into the economy and to power uk growth by attract global investment into a transformed water sector this be our opportunity to clean up our water once and   for all 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the secretary of state for prior sight of his statement 
 year in opposition and this be what the labour party have to offer labour members have have more than a decade to craft a clear package of policy listen to campaigner and prepare to govern yet what they have bring to the house today illustrate no sign of any ambition this be a sign of hesitation it be a way to delay the difficult decision and buy themselves more time it be part of a grow trend that unfortunately we be see consistently from this new labour government across all departments announce a review a taskforce and yet another commission and hope the public do not notice that really they never have much of a plan at all 
 that approach be simply not go to wash with the bill payer before the election the secretary of state tour the country with campaigner like feargal sharkey promise radical change to the sector he be now in power and what have he actually achieve so far he spend the entire election campaign tell voter that he want to put water company boss in the dock but we can see from the government ’s announcement on the water special measures bill that it will achieve no such thing as campaigner and industry expert have already point out nor will the bill provide any reassurance whatever for investor rather marvellously the secretary of state have manage not only to frustrate campaigner but to disenfranchise investor from any long term aspiration to invest in the sector 
 the secretary of state say that he have announce a ban on water company bonus hang on that be a policy that we bring forward in our time in government and that the secretary of state be now attempt to reannounce and pass off as his own it be the conservatives who announce a ban on water company boss bonus link shareholder dividend to environmental performance quadruple water company inspection fast track investment to cut spill and launch a whistleblowing portal for water company worker to report breach 
 it be surprising to hear the secretary of state claim that his government be truly serious about this issue when their proposal be less firm than the measure deliver by the previous government he could take real action right now by progress the last conservative administration ’s plan for an automatic ban on water company boss bonus when offence take place rehash announcement already set in motion by the conservative government put forward policy that will not actually put more pressure on water company boss and then simply press pause on a year long review will not result in the widespread change that labour promise its voter 
 the secretary of state acknowledge that the announced review will make no recommendation that affect the current price review process mean that there will be no chance of the government consider make any significant change until at the early will he provide an outline of the timeframe associate with actual recommendation from the review be implement and put in place when be any real benefit from this further review taskforce or commission likely to be experience not only for the water industry in term of infrastructure improvement but for the bill payer and the environment it seem to i that the secretary of   state be just kick the can down the road with another review another taskforce and another commission and remove himself from any of the tough decision 
 the secretary of state say that the review would have no impact on the price review process will he outline exactly when the positive impact will come by my calculation it will not be until at the early will he also outline the impact of the review on the measure propose in the water special measures bill what will be do if the recommendation do not sit comfortably with the current proposal 
 can not help conclude that the secretary of state be out of depth on this issue can not deliver on the tough language that he promise in the run up to the general election and be now do nothing more than attempt to kick the tough decision down the road and into the long grass this secretary of state seem to be all bark and no bite 
 well that be all a little bit embarrassing be n’t it the previous government have year in power our river lake and sea be awash with record level of pollution and that be all the conservatives have to say i take action day after the general election i bring the water chief exec into my office and we agree that money earmark for investment will be ringfence so that it can not be divert to pay multimillion pound bonus to water chief exec who oversee failure in the water sector as happen on the shadow minister ’s watch the commission will reset the sector that the conservatives break and clean up the water that they pollute it will report to the government in june and inform subsequent legislation 
 at the weekend i go swim in the north sea probably for the last time this year have check on the surfers against sewage website that there have not be any legal or illegal spill it be disgraceful that the last conservative government leave our sea and waterway in such as state and it be notable that water uk continuously blame the regulator for not allow it to raise price in order to invest far in our system will the secretary of state make sure that we assess the value extract by the water company they have take billion of pound in profit and hundred of million in bonus we need to make sure that future investment add value and do not take it away 
 i thank my hon friend for her comment unfortunately customer have be leave to pay the price of year of conservative failure to secure investment in our water infrastructure so it have collapse to such an extent that ofwat now recommend eye water bill increase every penny of that be down to the failure of the conservative party our reset will ensure that that kind of catastrophic failure can never happen again 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement to a large degree i welcome it or at least the intention behind it but water company dump more sewage into our lake river and coastal area in than in the previous year that amount to spill include many in the lake and river   of westmorland my constituency be the most beautiful part of england and also the wet so water be deeply personal to we 
 do the secretary of state understand my worry that we might have go from have a conservative government who would not face up to this outrage or tackle it to have a new labour administration who have acknowledge this outrage and decisively resolve to have a jolly good think about it while thames water crumble as we speak and water company seek bill increase of despite such poor performance across the country do he really think that have a commission be necessary give the urgent need for action we have a fragmented under resource and under power regulatory system which allow powerful water company to play regulator off against each other while our constituent pay the price be the solution not obvious as the liberal democrats propose we should create a new unified and far more powerful clean water authority 
 do the secretary of state share my deep concern that the current regulator have to give year notice in order to strip a water company of its licence for environmental failure will he ensure that this ludicrous protection for fail company should be replace by a month period of notice instead we be already more than of the way through this parliament and this issue be of our constituent most press concern do we have to drag our heel like this 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment he be absolutely right to point out that last year we see the high level of sewage ever record in our river lake and sea no wonder the public be so angry include in his constituency tragically lake windermere an iconic and beautiful site have be pollute with sewage and agricultural run off because of the failure of the previous government 
 i have take action already we have a reset moment just day after the general election when we carry out within a week thing that the conservatives fail to do in year in power the water special measures bill be go through the houses of parliament right now to ban the payment of unfair bonus to water boss the commission lead by sir jon cunliffe will look at the entire sector root and branch include governance and regulation which the hon gentleman point to it will look specifically at the point that he have raise so that we end up with a system of regulation that be fit to clean up our waterway and then to protect they for the decade to come 
 i thank the secretary of state for his statement and his announcement of this important review to have sir jon cunliffe a long term public servant run it be very welcome indeed will my right hon friend say a bit more about how the close work between the welsh government and the uk government will work because that will be important in determine how this announcement affect my constituent 
 my hon friend allude to an important point river and water catchment be no respecter of boundary and it be important that we have a model that work within catchment include where they cross boundary as they do in some case between   england and wales the review have be jointly commission by the uk and welsh governments and it will jointly report to both government it will seek a well model for structuring and support our water sector so that we can ensure that we clean up all our river all our lake and all our sea so that the public can get back to enjoy they and so that we can bring in the investment to support the infrastructure which will be deliver at pace to drive economic growth in every single part of the united kingdom 
 we come to the chair of the select committee 
 the secretary of state be quite right to point to the role of the payment of bonus and dividend in bring we to this point but he must surely acknowledge that that be far from be the whole story there be a number of business and accounting practice in company such as thames water that have bring we to the stage we be at today if he be serious about have a water system that be fit for the future he have to understand properly what have go on before will he therefore confirm that the commission will be properly resource with the necessary forensic accounting resource so that those who have be responsible for the most egregious practice in the past and who now seem to be appear in other water company around the country will not be allow to do the same thing there 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for the point that he make of course he be right the water special measures bill with its ban on bonus will not be sufficient to reset the sector although it be an ask that the public be rightly make because of the unfairness of people who be oversee failure be richly reward for that failure that should not have be allow to go on under the previous government and it will not go on under this new government 
 the reason we have set up the commission be to address the very point the right hon gentleman make about financial and environmental sustainability and viability i look forward to work with he and his committee as the commission carry out its work as we review its finding in the summer of next year and as we then shape what will be significant new legislation to reset the sector a reform sector in a new partnership with government to bring in the investment that will finally clean up our waterway 
 i declare an interest as a customer of southern water who lose my water supply for day early this year as do of my constituent as the secretary of state know well from his visit to hastings and to rye we have major issue from flood to sewage to water outage i welcome the water commission how can my constituent particularly volunteer group such as the clean water action group have their voice hear particularly their concern about ensure that the regulator have the power and resource to clean up our sea 
 my hon friend be a powerful campaigner for clean water in fact it be hard to think of anybody who have campaign hard on the issue the commission will seek to engage the public at large as well as a wide   group of stakeholder who will be represent on an advisory group which will include a customer voice once the commission have report the government will consult on those finding and that will inform the subsequent legislation that will reset this sector once and for all 
 order i say gently to the secretary of state that i be here and he should be speak through the chair not to the member as he have do for the last question we can work together to get everybody look the right way i call sir gavin williamson to set a good example 
 in my constituency we have beautiful river include the great and mighty river trent and the river penk over the last few year as more transparent datum have become available we have be able to see the number of sewage discharge go into those river will the secretary of state promise the house that look at how we can reduce sewage discharge into the trent and the penk will be at the heart of what the commission do 
 it be always a pleasure of course to gaze at you mr speaker rather than elsewhere in the chamber 
 the right hon gentleman make an important point the point of the commission be to identify way in which we can strengthen regulation and operation so that we can bring in the investment clean up our water sector once and for all and reduce and remove the pollution that be destroy so many beautiful river include those in his constituency 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on the commission that have be set up today it be absolutely fantastic gower be the area of outstanding natural beauty in the whole of the united kingdom and the bathing water there be to none but some of they be less so i would like to highlight a campaign i have set up to test the bathing water in the winter season with my constituent local business and the gower society because datum be key it be what will drive the improvement of our bathing water will he congratulate surfers against sewage which have be really supportive and everybody in my constituency who be take part and take control 
 my hon friend represent an incredibly beautiful part of the country in the gower and her constituent and the many people who visit those beauty spot will want to know that their child can enjoy the water without risk of contamination from polluted water of course i congratulate surfers against sewage and the many campaigner who have push for reform they will be invite to participate in the work of the commission they have huge expertise i hope that before long her constituent who be test the quality of the water will start to see improvement until it be pure and crystal clear as it should always have be 
 the secretary of state highlight the scandal of sewage in our sea and river indeed raw sewage be dump into our   river and sea for hour last year since privatisation £ have be pay to shareholder in dividend while his department highlight that it would cost £ to carry out the necessary investment so privatisation have fail as a model for get the investment in place will he therefore confirm that the commission will look at what ownership model for water will be effective in address this scandal include the option of bring water back into public hand 
 the reason i have rule out nationalisation be that it would not resolve the problem we face we see in the olympics in france that the river seine be not able to be use for swimming because of pollution that be a state own water system we see the problem in scotland that be a state own water system as well the problem be those of governance and regulation nationalisation would cost towards £ of public money money that do not exist and the time it would take to unpick the current model of ownership during which time investment would be choke off would see our river lake and sea fill with even more sewage and pollution rather than less i be more interested in the purity of our water than the purity of our ideology i will do what work well as quickly as possible the commission will give we guidance on how we should change the system to make sure it work for everybody 
 for the last few week i have be conduct independent test with colleague from bournemouth university for nitrate and bacteria in the lovely poole harbour and the surround water i have notice from talk to colleague that the frequency of official testing and the number of site at which those test be carry out have be reduce significantly by the environment agency over the year will the commission look at those issue will test and the frequency of testing be include in its work 
 i recognise what my hon friend say about poole harbour it be indeed an incredibly beautiful part of the country i have visit it several time and sadly i have also see the extent and impact of the pollution we be make sure that all sewage outlet be monitor through compulsory mean which be not the case currently the commission will look at how we can improve the testing and monitoring of water quality as part of the strengthening of regulation which will form a key part of its work 
 the secretary of state mention the importance of drainage in reduce incident of pollution cause by flooding will he therefore commit today while we await the outcome of the commission to distribute the £ allocate by the previous government to internal drainage board so that farmer in my constituency and other in the river hull catchment do not have to spend another winter under water 
 unfortunately the hon gentleman be refer to commitment to spend money that do not exist we be wait for the chancellor to announce her budget from this dispatch box in almost exactly week ’s time and we will find out much more then 
 last year sewage be dump time along the precious coastline of my constituency the equivalent of hour of sewage spillage our constituent be rightly disgust by this state of affair the conservatives cover up this scandal for year will my right hon friend tell i what this new labour government will do to hold company to account 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i have the pleasure of visit bournemouth west with she and i see for myself the impact on business and tourism in that part of the world parent be frightened to let their kid go in the sea at certain time of day when the water contamination have reach unacceptable level the commission will look at how we can strengthen regulation and governance to ensure that the practice that water company have get away with over recent year can no long happen it will also look at how we can bring in the investment need to repair our broken water infrastructure so that we can drive economic growth in every part of the country include of course in bournemouth west 
 the use of storm overflow in place such as skegby in ashfield be absolutely disgusting and it pollute my river so will the secretary of state commit to give the water company a deadline for end their use 
 it will be for the commission to look at what we need to do to improve infrastructure and fix the broken system that we have at the moment we be make sure that every overflow have monitor on it so that we know exactly what be come out of it we can therefore take action against the water company that might be responsible 
 in my constituency this week as well as have sewage in our bathing water we have have sewage on the street in penryn the conservative party cut funding to the regulator in will the secretary of state please confirm that the review will completely reset the role of the regulator 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i have the pleasure of visit truro and falmouth during the election and i see for myself the problem there it be disgusting to see sewage bubble up into the street and even into some people ’s back garden because the sewage infrastructure be so broken after the previous government fail for year to bring in the investment necessary to upgrade it the commission will look at how we secure funding and get that infrastructure rebuild at pace so that we can improve the situation we be hear about it will also look at regulation and the role of the regulator and make proposal as to how we can improve those so that we have regulation that be fit for purpose 
 in kingsbridge in my constituency the resident be literally wad through sewage which seep out of the drain in heavy rain due to a mixture of increase sewage from new house and ancient culvert that can not cope i do not think that those resident will be encourage by a review and a commission which will not solve the problem they will face this winter will the minister   therefore meet i to discuss the particularly difficult and chronic problem in kingsbridge we need to find a solution because we have not have for a long time and we desperately need to sort this out 
 i have of course already take action myself i have the water chief executive into my office just day after the general election and we agree a programme of initial reform include ringfence customer money that be earmark for investment so that it can not be divert and spend on undeserved multimillion pound bonus or dividend payment we also have the water special measures bill go through the house of lords right now which will ban the payment of those undeserved bonus it be important that we understand exactly what have go wrong in the sector that have lead to a situation where regulation do not meet the requirement of the public business the economy or the environment key proposal will be come out of the commission on those issue and i hope the hon lady will welcome they when they come forward 
 today a report find that river in the east and in london have the bad water quality in the uk with an alarming amount of chemical find citizen science have play a key role up to now in monitor the quality of our water so will the secretary of state join i in pay tribute to citizen scientist and volunteer and assure we that their voice will be hear in this important work 
 my hon friend make an important point the many campaign group and citizen scientist have have a huge impact on raise the profile of the sewage scandal affect our country and in point to some of the way in which we can start to fix thing sir jon ’s commission will have an advisory group with representation from campaign group and consumer there will also be wide engagement with the public both through the work of the commission itself and subsequently as we work towards the reform legislation that will reset the sector once and for all 
 in the absence of a plan it be always a good idea to do a review my constituent be be fail by our local sewage infrastructure thames water be a total and utter disgrace however i really welcome the secretary of state ’s statement because i think i have find an unlikely ally the labour government will force through building on the green belt in my constituency with a whole host of new house a situation exacerbate by the failure of the liberal democrat administration in elmbridge to deliver a local plan give the time it will take the commission to report back and give that these new house will require more sewerage do the secretary of state agree that we should pause and think again about the house building target until the review have be complete 
 i think the hon gentleman be stand up to apologise for the fact that the conservative government do absolutely nothing for year other than watch the torrent of effluent go into our river lake and sea increase and pollute they my hon friend the water minister would be more than happy to meet he to discuss the issue that he raise in his constituency 
 i welcome the commission announce by my right hon friend last week beach in my constituency be affect by raw sewage dumping with of they joss bay and stone bay experience a bad effect on their bathing water quality but the verdict be that they be still within environment agency permit limit will my right hon friend confirm that the commission will investigate regulatory standard so that when raw sewage be dump there be actually a fine and a punishment for the water company i must also make a declaration as a customer of southern water and a sea water swimmer
