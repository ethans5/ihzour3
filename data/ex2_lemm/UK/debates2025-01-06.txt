 of all may i wish everybody a happy new year let ’s hope for a peaceful 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to increase military support for ukraine 
 this be day of russia ’s brutal illegal full scale invasion of ukraine and will be the critical year in the conflict my job as defence secretary be to put ukrainians in the strong possible position on the battlefield and at any negotiating table so throughout we will develop uk training strengthen defence industrial co operation increase pressure with ally on russia and step up and speed up military aid to ukraine 
 i welcome the recent announcement of £ in new military assistance to ukraine alongside that we must continue to step up our effort to pressure russia follow the report damage to a major undersea cable in the baltic over christmas which finnish authority suggest may be link to a shadow fleet vessel what further action be the uk take alongside european ally to undermine the russian shadow fleet 
 my hon friend be right in general term russian aggression be not simply confine to ukraine and we all see what happen on christmas day we be deeply concerned about the damage and sabotage to undersea cable i can confirm to the house that for the time the joint expeditionary force the jef have activate an advanced uk lead reaction system to track potential threat to undersea infrastructure and to monitor the movement of the russian shadow fleet that will be run out of the stand joint force headquarters at northwood 
 the secretary of state say that his aim be to ensure that ukraine be in the strong possible position but for what do he intend to support ukraine in command she internationally recognise border or to ensure that the de facto border which exclude donbas and crimea become a more permanent feature 
 quite simply our job as the uk be to support ukraine in its fight and if and when it decide to talk to support it in any negotiation it be the ukrainians who be fight it be the ukrainians who decide when to start talk and it be for the ukrainians to decide on what term they may start talk 
 what step he be take to ensure that sme be able to participate in aukus procurement 
 the aukus partnership will create new contract opportunity for hundred of small and medium sized firm it will create new job both in uk shipyard and across the uk supply chain 
 as the secretary of state know under the defence equipment plan about half of mod expenditure be on equipment with around of that go overseas what impact do the secretary of state think that the government ’s abolition of business property relief and the massive increase in national insurance will have on uk sme ability to compete in the defence sector with our aukus ally follow the previous government ’s signing of that agreement 
 it be certainly the case as the right hon gentleman rightly recognise that in government the conservatives be too often largely blind to where british firm be base and to where the contract that they be ready to award go this government have come into power commit not just to strengthen uk security but to boost the uk economy that mean design make and buy more in britain 
 what his target date be for increase defence spending to of gdp 
 the government be deliver for defence by increase defence spending there be already £ extra for next year and a commitment to set a path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring 
 it be all very well spend of gdp on defence but we have to spend it on the right kit over the weekend i note a story about our nato ally be frustrate with britain for not invest in appropriate missile defence system as the secretary of state meet his commitment will he commit to invest in surface to air missile precision and hypersonic missile system dragonfire laser system and counter drone block technology to ensure that the british army be the most advanced and able in the western world 
 the uk have for many year be of the high spender on defence in nato we continue to hold that proud record increase spending this year will mean that britain continue to be of the high spender in nato i remind the hon gentleman that the last time this country spend on defence be in under the previous labour government a level of defence spending that be not match once during the year in which his party be in government 
 we come to the chair of the defence committee 
 on defence spending i be glad that uk base defence firm will be prioritise for government investment under the defence industrial strategy which should boost british job in constituency such as slough and help to strengthen national security but major defence programme be currently in disarray with only out of on time and on budget what action be the government take to fix the waste and mismanagement in the system 
 my hon friend be right everyone agree that more need to be spend on defence to meet the increase threat he ask why only out of of the major defence project be on time and on budget that question may well be direct at the shadow defence secretary   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge who be responsible for exactly that up until the election month ago there be of course a question about how much we spend but there be also a challenge in how well we spend it the shadow armed forces minister   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois be of the strong critic of the previous government and of what he describe as the broken procurement system we be get a grip of mod budget drive deep reform in defence and ensure that we reduce the waste and delay in procurement contract 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i congratulate the minister for veterans and people   the hon and gallant member for birmingham selly oak al carns on receive a distinguished service order we be all proud of he 
 the government have tie the announcement of their timetable for to the publication of the strategic defence review so we need it to be publish as soon as possible will the secretary of state clarify why he have push back the sdr ’s publication in parliament from the spring to the summer 
 i have not do that the work of the reviewer lead the strategic defence review be thorough and flat out the review have be widely contribute to and be the of its kind in this country allow fresh thinking in defence planning on the commitment as we say in the plan for change we will set out a path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring the government be deliver on defence and defence reform we will deliver on defence funding too 
 the secretary of state say that publication have not be push back but i remind the house that at the previous defence question on   november   last year the secretary of state be ask specifically about sdr timing and say 
 the reviewer will report in the spring ”—[official report   november vol c. 
 however in a write answer to i on   december just before the house rise a defence minister say 
 the reviewers will make their final report to the prime minister chancellor of the exchequer and defence secretary in the half of the secretary of state for defence will subsequently report the strategic defence review to parliament 
 if the part be in the month of the year even i can see that the part which be subsequent to that will happen in the half of the year that be not the spring be it 
 we be dance on the head of a pin here the spring be in the half of the year i think the hon gentleman should take my word to this house and to he which have be consistent that the strategic defence review will report in the spring it will report directly to the prime minister to the chancellor and to i and i will update the house directly we will also set out our clear path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring

 as a former councillor i know that many veteran can find themselves at a disadvantage when try to access service include social housing veteran face housing challenge not only in bathgate and linlithgow but across the country with many scottish council and indeed the scottish government have declare a housing emergency will the minister advise the house what engagement he have have with the scottish government to ensure that the housing need of veteran be prioritise

 operation prosper be launch in april to support veteran into work after they leave the armed force do the minister expect to continue the funding for operation prosper after the conclusion of the spending review 
 as we move forward we will be involve in the sdr and look at support veteran into transition and employment in due course a large proportion of   veteran who leave service go into employment we want to continue that and increase the percentage over time

 the charity have my full congratulation on the work it be do have pet such as a dog provide psychological comfort and friend especially for people heal from some of the psychological impact of service or indeed combat and i fully support it if the hon member would like to discuss at a later date how we could push that forward she should please reach out to i 
 just before christmas we have the welcome announcement of a new veteran commissioner in northern ireland mr david johnstone although i be sure the minister will join i in wish he well in his new post it be a part time post it have only seconded staff and it be not on a statutory basis like elsewhere will the government put that post on a statutory basis so that the many veteran in northern ireland can have the service they deserve 
 i thank the hon and learn member for his important question we must get the armed force covenant into law which should cover a large proportion of the veteran support mechanism i congratulate david johnstone on take up his post i phone he just before the christmas recess i be excited and look forward to work with he and ensure that the unique attribute of veteran in northern ireland be account for and represent in the correct manner 
 maggie haynes be the founder of tuppenny barn a horticultural therapy charity in my constituency and she be a veteran herself she establish a female veteran course after observe that the challenge face by woman leave the armed force combine with poor communication from the mod be leave they unaware of the service available to they what be the minister do to improve support for female veteran 
 we be work on our armed force strategy part of which will be a specific section for female veteran we understand the nuance and difficulty of female veteran leave service and try to find employment or link employment with family life and so forth so we be push that forward really hard again i would be very pleased to discuss that with the hon member in due course 
 i thank the veteran minister for his answer in previous question in this chamber i have suggest to the minister that he might wish to visit beyond the battlefield a charity in my   constituency that give the only care for soldier whenever they have fall on bad time will the minister make time available to come and see what we do with that charity in portavogie and strangford as an example for everyone else

 what progress he have make on appoint an independent armed force commissioner 
 this labour government be deliver for defence and the landmark armed forces commissioner bill be the step in renew the nation ’s contract with those who serve the commissioner will be appoint follow the passage of the primary legislation establish the role the bill pass committee stage in the commons in december and i look forward to report stage in due course 
 i thank the minister for his response as an ex rifleman i have see at hand the negative impact of shoddy care and equipment on service personnel ’s mental and physical health what will instal an armed force commissioner do to make their standard of live well 
 i thank my hon friend for his service it be absolutely vital that the voice of armed force personnel and their family be listen to more that be why we be establish in the commissioner an independent champion for armed force and their family the commissioner will have an independent role be able to scrutinise the action of the armed force and report to parliament rather than to ministers and will not be beholden to the whim of either any government of the day or the chain of command that independence will allow the commissioner to scrutinise general service welfare matter shin a spotlight on the issue that really matter to those who serve in uniform and their family 
 the government have say that part of their inspiration for the armed forces commissioner be such a role in germany yet germany have a parliamentary armed force commissioner why be there that difference and why in line with what the minister say in an early answer can we trust the independence of this new appointment 
 the right hon gentleman be right that the german armed force commissioner be part of the inspiration for the role dr eva högl be a superb example of how we can scrutinise and champion the armed force and provide solution and a voice to those who serve she sit effectively as a member of parliament in the german parliament which we do not feel be appropriate for the uk armed forces commissioner but the independence and the way she have pioneer much of that work in recent year be a real inspiration to   we we hope that such a workable example from a key nato ally people can raise issue with she and shine a spotlight on those issue to improve service welfare matter and as a result improve morale and the operational effectiveness of the armed force will give strength to the independence of the role 
 i call the shadow minister 
 during debate on the bill in committee i raise the worrying issue that under the treasury ’s propose inheritance tax change service personnel who be unmarried but in a long term relationship could have their partner ’s service benefit tax should they die while in service the forces pension society have rightly highlight that that would be totally contrary to the spirit of the armed force covenant have the minister yet raise this with the treasury as we strongly suggest last month he should and if so what progress have be make 
 as the right hon gentleman will recall from the bill committee which in parliamentary sitting day be only a few day ago we be raise issue around a number of thing include the he raise it be subject to a consultation as he know so a decision have not be make it be a responsibility for the treasury rather than the ministry of defence but i undertake to write to he and i will do so 
 what step he be take to improve housing for military personnel and their family 
 what progress he have make on improve military accommodation 
 what step he be take to improve housing for military personnel and their family 
 i thank my hon friend for raise an exceptionally important matter the deal to sell off most of our service family accommodation in then rent it back and upgrade it be probably of the bad deal i can think of the recent annington home deal support by those on both side of the house be deliver at speed by this government and it save this country and the taxpayer £ a day or £ a year it put we back in the drive seat of own all our family accommodation it allow we to renovate or rebuild as require over the next to year and long into the future in the medium to long term we have a once in a generation lifetime opportunity to rebuild all our accommodation 
 may i wish a happy new year to you mr speaker to member and to constituent in north somerset 
 morale in our military hit record low under the last government and i be proud that this government have already deliver the large pay rise for the force   in more than year do the minister agree that this housing deal be the next practical step in the action that this government be deliver to improve service life for dedicated personnel 
 my hon friend make an important point i have live in some of the accommodation and i have see how bad it be and this deal will allow we to change that over time we will have a chance save £ a year to give the people who serve this country the deal they deserve when it come to housing 
 during my service in the late 80 through the 90 and into the early 2000 i have the pleasure of have to live in military accommodation its poor condition be discuss almost weekly roll forward year and we be still have the same discussion can minister please assure i that they will now seriously get a grip of that and through the strategic defence review give some clear programme delivery date for when we will deliver for our force 
 absolutely as part of the sdr we will set out our new defence housing strategy we will look at how we take annington build on it and improve the housing available for those who serve in our armed force 
 as a member of a force family i welcome the government ’s landmark decision to renationalise service housing for too long military family have be live in substandard accommodation how will the minister ensure that this investment lead to tangible improvement in what timescale can our servicemen and servicewoman expect to see those improvement start 
 we be buy back we be break it down and we will build back up that will be part of a comprehensive plan across the country and across home over time it will look to deliver housing that be fit for those who serve and the family member who be often leave behind when those individual deploy i have absolute confidence that we will deliver that in conjunction with independent body as well as those in defence 
 the minister have already refer to his successful £ deal to repurchase the mod housing estate from annington it will give member of our armed force the opportunity to have their home refurbish which they have long for for a very long time have he manage to persuade the treasury that he will need to provide further fund to pump prime these improvement if so how will he strengthen the hitherto very poor management of our military housing estate 
 as part of our new defence housing strategy we will look at how we will manage that estate as a whole and whether we will do it completely differently as part of the sdr we will look at how we will pump prime some of that to get build back across the whole defence estate bear in mind that there be house and some of they have be in situ for about year and will need to be knock down and rebuild 
 under the previous arrangement between the ministry of defence and annington £ be release for accommodation upgrade in the year of that arrangement what due diligence be carry out ahead of the sale what additional investment will be make in the married quarter that the government have bring back into the mod ’s ownership 
 this be of the good deal that defence have do in a long time it have buy back home save the taxpayer £ a day or £ over a year we be in discussion with the treasury now about where that money go and how it will be use in the future but i assure the hon member that the rebuild plan will be within the defence housing strategy as part of the sdr 
 since october more than afghans eligible for support via the afghan relocation and assistance policy have be move into ministry of defence service family accommodation both transitional and then settle service family accommodation under operation lazurite how many sfa house in the defence estate be currently be use to house afghan family what be the plan for their onward movement once their year eligibility for settle service family accommodation have elapse 
 i thank the hon member for that really important question we have a duty of care to those from afghanistan who be now live in the uk and we be absolutely committed to deliver on that i will write to he in due course on the specific of his question 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in there be over report of damp and mould in service accommodation member of the armed force be willing to put their life on the line to support the freedom that we take for grant so it be inconceivable that they and their family be force to live in home fill with damp and mould now that the mod have agree to buy back thousand of these family home will the government commit to ensure that all service family accommodation meet the minimum standard for social housing as set out in the decent home standard 
 we already do that the reality be that a large proportion of these house be build to year ago so the thick insulation and double skinned wall that we would see as commonplace just do not exist the annington deal be therefore such a good as it allow we to refurbish or rebuild as require 
 what recent discussion he have have with his us counterpart on military support for ukraine 
 the labour government be deliver for defence by step up and speed up support for ukraine in december we announce an additional package of artillery air defence and drone the defence secretary hold regular discussion with his us counterpart on how good to support ukraine most recently on   november 
 i thank the minister for his reply last year bath and north east somerset council enter into a formal agreement with the city of oleksandriia provide medical support as well as strengthen cultural and community tie in talk with the incoming us government will the minister ensure that they be aware of the endure and deep solidarity that the british people feel towards the people of ukraine in their effort to defeat a brutal aggressor 
 i thank the hon member my fellow south west mp for her advocacy of that as well as the people of bath who have open their home to so many ukrainian family as have family right across the country it be vital that we continue to support not only ukraine to stay in the fight to protect its sovereignty and freedom but those ukrainians in the united kingdom and in ukraine to ensure that they can go about normal life as much as possible the government support that work and will continue support ukraine for as long as it take 
 the secretary of state and the minister have put britain ’s military production capability at the heart of the government ’s support for ukraine i wonder what opportunitie the minister spy for transatlantic co operation in that regard may i make a special plea that the whole defence team discuss plan for develop our industrial capacity with regional mayor so that job and factory can be set up and develop around the country include in region like my own 
 it be vital that we continue to support ukraine and build our industrial capacity in the united kingdom and across the nato alliance to ensure that ukraine can fight not only tonight but tomorrow part of that be about increase the industrial supply of not just uk manufacturer but indigenous manufacturer within ukraine itself build that great industrial capacity be something that the government take seriously that be why the secretary of state and the minister for defence procurement and industry have publish the outline of the defence industrial strategy we will continue to work with partner at both national and international level and additionally at a regional and local level to ensure that we have the industrial capacity and skill require to restock our own supply and continue to support ukraine 
 what step he plan to take through the defence industrial strategy to increase support for defence sector sme 
 we be deliver for defence boost spending by £ in real term this come financial year i hope that more of our procurement spend can go to sme the defence industrial strategy will set the condition to unlock the full potential of sme to seize future opportunity and ensure the growth and resilience of our defence manufacturing base provide more good job in every nation and region 
 the north east technology park in sedgefield be home to many innovative defence business produce satellite technology and biological and radiation detection equipment that be use by our ally across the world those business proudly contract directly with the defence advanced research projects agency nasa the american defense department and other allied government but too often they struggle with mod procurement rule which exclude sme will the minister meet i and netpark business to discuss how to remove the red tape that hit small business in my constituency and across the country that be design and produce innovative defence supply 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend and his north east technology park business as soon as possible the government recognise that sme face particular challenge which i want to address through the defence industrial strategy we will reduce barrier to entry and foster a more diverse community of supplier include non traditional sme and those that be develop future technology we will also send a clear market signal about our preference to grow onshore production capability 
 as part of the defence industrial strategy do the minister of state recognise the link between successful defence vehicle manufacturing such as rheinmetall bae systems land manufacture the challenger tank in my constituency and the onshoring of barrel technology and defence engineering do she recognise the link between that skill cluster and the importance of company such as rbsl have a future in manufacturing not just vehicle but barrel i look forward to her visit to my constituency in the come day 
 i do not disagree at all i look forward to visit the right hon gentleman ’s constituency and to see the potential of firm he be completely correct that cluster of excellence and skill be the way forward i look forward to visit his constituency shortly 
 the defence sector support in of our job in this country more than well pay job that be central to this government ’s growth mission and to our nation ’s security however the majority of those job be outside london and the south east therefore growth and crucially engagement with defence and security be inhibit for young people in constituency such as mine will the minister confirm that the key ambition of our defence industrial strategy will be to broaden access to the defence sector in every region include constituency such as mine 
 i be happy to accept that point and i agree plenty of job and skill will be need around the country in every nation and region so that we improve matter everywhere 
 christmas come early for the uk defence industry when spain place an order for eurofighters on   december and italy follow suit on the but there be still nothing from the uk government on the typhoon jet that be need for the raf will the minister spread some   festive cheer into the new year and give we an update on where the government be with place that order for typhoon fighter jet a delay christmas present for the uk defence industry and the raf 
 i recognise the hon gentleman ’s point it be certainly true that export be important in addition to production for our own use we be work very hard on the export campaign i can not say any more than that at present but i can assure he that we be work very hard the rest of our spend on such matter be part of the sdr once that be complete there will be conclusion it might not be a christmas present i do not know when his birthday be but a present some time later 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on defence industrial strategy the new amphibious multi role support ship be several year away a point the armed forces minister obviously appreciate when in opposition last january he write to his local paper to say that scrap hms albion and bulwark would be bad for our national security for the royal navy and for devonport when the defence committee look at this issue a few year ago it firmly conclude that the decision would be militarily illiterate yet today the ministry of defence be all for it even if the minister for defence procurement and industry do not agree with the defence committee do she at least agree with the armed forces minister that these vital ship should be retain 
 neither of the ship have be at sea for year since and the other since and neither be due to go back out to sea before their out of service date the question of who might be say to have scrap they be moot the ship have not be scrap but we take the tough decision in november to retire age capability so that we can save the money for deal with the threat that we will face in future 
 what step his department be take to ensure that veteran have access to appropriate housing 
 the prime minister have make it clear that ensure that veteran and their family can access support include for housing be a priority he mention that in his speech at party conference he have also announce that veteran will be exempt from the local connection test for social housing in england and commit an additional £ to continue the reduce veteran homelessness programme include op fortitude 
 the transition from military to civilian life be a critical moment for many veteran but too often those with complex mental health issue fall through the crack especially when it come to access housing the armed force covenant be an excellent positive step forward but its voluntary nature mean that not all veteran will benefit equally will the minister   commit to review the transition process and particularly mental health service provision to ensure that all veteran receive more comprehensive and tailored support 
 the career transition pathway that have just be set up be a great example of how we be help those leave the service to transition into civilian life op courage in particular have have more than referral it be for anybody with mental health issue cause by their service i recommend go on to gov.uk and look at the service available as they be pretty ample 
 the defence sector provide well pay job across my city and constituency and across the country with adult in the constituency on the minimum wage will the minister help i to work with the department for education to ensure that kid in my city get opportunity to work in this brilliant sector 
 i thank my hon friend for a very important question i would like to talk far about this we have be work with the department for education 
 be the minister happy to answer the question i do not quite see how it link to the subject but if he be happy 
 i can take this discussion offline and we can talk about this in due course 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 on this day after the recess i thank all armed force personnel who work over christmas include the nearly personnel deploy overseas and the crew of hms somerset who be recall on christmas day to shadow russian vessel around our shore i also congratulate the many exceptional servicemen and woman and veteran recognise in the new year ’s honours list for their outstanding contribution include the minister for veterans and people my new year ’s message to everyone work across defence be that this government will continue deliver for defence throughout make the uk secure at home and strong abroad step up support for ukraine boost the uk defence industry strengthen tie with ally and improve service life for armed force personnel and their family 
 we have long stand cross party support in plymouth and devon for ensure the future of the royal marines include commando in my constituency give the amphibious assault capability gap that we have as a result of scrapping or should i say retire devonport ship hms albion and hms bulwark what commitment can the secretary of state give that the green light will be give to build multi role support ship and can he give a firm indication of when he hop they will be in service 
 hms bulwark and hms albion be not genuine capability the minister for defence procurement and industry make that clear neither ship be set to put to sea again before their out of service date this decision allow we to focus resource on where they need to be on the capability that we need to support our marines and deal with our adversary 
 a recent bbc documentary detail the year campaign of nuclear test veteran who be fight for the disclosure of medical record and damage relate to radiation exposure there have be a marked increase in rate of cancer and genetic damage i know the minister be look at the issue carefully will he please work closely with veteran to ensure that they get the justice that they deserve 
 we owe a debt to our nuclear test veteran who deliver their service in a courageous and honourable way i have already commit to look into the record issue in detail and to continuous engagement with all the charity and nuclear test veteran group 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 at every turn ministers have refuse point blank to tell we how much their chagos deal will cost british taxpayer now we know why the mauritians want £ a year whatever the figure be will the secretary of state tell we what percentage of the cost of lease back a base that we currently own will come from the ministry of defence budget 
 i regret the conservative carping over the diego garcia deal the negotiation be start by conservative ministers who conduct round of negotiation the agreement safeguard the effective operation of the joint uk us base for at least year it be support by us agency and be welcome by india the african union and the un security council almost everyone it seem except the conservatives.[official report   january vol c. 6wc correction 
 correct because it be a terrible deal 
 what if i say i call james cartlidge 
 my apology i be like you be mr speaker very passionate on this subject we see this as a terrible deal that be why we would have never sign it the incoming us president oppose the deal the mauritians be seek to renegotiate it and by any measure it be terrible value for money for the over tax british public do the secretary of state really think that it be in our national interest to spend hundred of million of pound lease back a military base that we currently own instead of spend every penny of that money on our armed force in the uk 
 the agreement mean that the base will be undisputed and legally secure for the time in year the us defence secretary describe it as an historic agreement and say 
 it will safeguard the strategic security interest of our nation and our partner in the indo pacific region 
 for   year many military family have endure substandard housing with issue like damp and mould they deserve well do the minister agree that quality service housing be essential in recognise the commitment of our military personnel and that bring military home back into public ownership mark the beginning of repair our nation ’s contract with they 
 i absolutely agree this be a once in a lifetime opportunity to change housing for our service family it will save taxpayer £ a day and £ over the year it give we an opportunity to build back over the medium to long term and to deliver the deal that those family deserve

 it be important that the strategic defence review be able to report its recommendation it be certainly true that we inherit armed force with capability gap fall morale and a recruitment and personnel crisis which be why the sdr be so important in set out a clear direction for the future this government back defence and will continue to do so ensure that those capability gap be fill 
 what step be the minister take to ensure that the historic contribution of woman in wartime be recognise i be think particularly of those who work in munition factory include the linlithgow munitionette 
 the essential role play by woman throughout both major war in deliver an industrial powerhouse to support our armed force be not lose on the government i be happy to take this matter offline and discuss it in due course 
 i be astonish to be tell by the department for business and trade before christmas that neither tata steel nor british steel be a critical supplier of the ministry of defence will the secretary of state give a commitment that unlike the previous conservative government this labour government will buy british include british steel 
 the hon gentleman have put his finger on a long stand deep run weakness namely a procurement policy under the last government that do not recognise the uk steel industry as a strategic industry and be content for the amount of uk steel source for some new ship to be in the single figure interruption   under previous procurement minister the proportion be we will change that the sdr will set out a plan to not just boost uk security but strengthen the uk economy 
 bae systems in my constituency recently announce an extra £ in avionic investment to support the f-35 programme which will secure extra job in the warren wood area will the minister commit to review our investment in our defence industry to ensure that more job be secure by well train young people throughout the country will he also commit to visit the site to witness that expansion and celebrate that success with our resident and community 
 yes she will make a commitment to visit the site i agree with my hon friend our defence industrial strategy will enhance the incentive for long term investment in the uk defence sector it will encourage investment by private firm alongside public money align the imperative of national security and ensure that we have the necessary skill 
 the defence secretary say in october that despite conflict return to europe the number of army personnel would drop to below next year the low level since the problem be not just recruitment but retention more people be leave than be join in people leave the armed force while only join will he commit to address the recruitment retention balance in this year ’s strategic defence review 
 it be certainly true that this government inherit a recruitment and retention crisis from the conservatives morale be fall that be why we be renew the nation ’s contract with those who serve there will be more announcement about that in due course 
 i be encourage by what the secretary of state say about strengthen tie with ally can the minister elaborate on the step that he and the department be take to far strengthen collaboration with our european ally during 
 as the prime minister have make clear britain be back on the world stage and we be deepen our defence relationship with our european ally that mean continue to implement the trinity house agreement between the uk and germany there be also the new uk estonia road map and there be more to come we will refresh the lancaster house agreement with our friend in france as well 
 give that president elect trump have be at well ambivalent towards maintain current level of us military aid to ukraine we must redouble european effort to support ukraine what further discussion do the minister plan with european ally to collectively   strengthen the provision of arm and resource to ukraine include through the potential use of seized russian central bank asset 
 we have lay out clearly that this government will stand with ukraine for as long as it take that mean commit £ a year as we have do to make sure that the ukrainians have the equipment and ammunition they need to stay in the fight as well as deepen our defence relationship with they we be take that across the nato alliance to all nato member and we will continue to stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 may i commend the government on their recent decision to bring a large amount of military housing back in house after the disastrous tory decision to privatise it it be massively welcome in north west cambridgeshire where home be be repurchase but a lot of the housing be in a shocking state what step will the government take to address that to make sure that our military personnel can live in the decent home that they more than deserve 
 i completely agree with my hon friend the defence housing strategy will be a medium to long term strategy and will be publish in line with the sdr in the spring 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests give the secretary of state for defence ’s previous remark can he set out for the house exactly what discussion there have be between ministers and the incoming trump administration on the future of the diego garcia base 
 as the right hon gentleman know very well the system in the us be very different from our the administration who be in place at present be in place until inauguration day on   january that will be the point at which we in the uk government will start to pick up direct discussion with the incoming administration the us be our close security ally and we will work with they to ensure that that continue 
 since putin ’s unprovoked invasion of ukraine our european union ally have contribute € in funding to the ukrainian military of those integral ally be poland which have just assume the presidency of the eu council have start on   january will the minister set out in a little more detail how we be work in lockstep with crucial ally like poland at this dangerous time for the continent 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to suggest that it be vital to deepen our relation with our european friend poland be a key european ally for we not only in defence export but in operational deployment i have visit poland twice recently include to see the amazing work of the british army in operation stifftail which use our sky sabre system to help to defend polish airspace there will be further such joint deployment of our armed force in due course 
 it sound like the government be not very keen to talk about diego garcia with president trump but when people as diverse as president trump and lord neil kinnock agree that nato country should be spend between and on defence would it not be sensible to take they seriously 
 on diego garcia members will have the chance to scrutinise the detail of any treaty once it come before the house just as the previous government do we make sure throughout the negotiation that the us administration be fully inform fully brief and fully content with the step that we be take 
 the procurement of ajax waste hundred of million of pound money desperately need in my north east derbyshire constituency can the minister update i on the progress make in learn the lesson of that failure and implement the finding of the sheldon report

 yes

 yes and i trust that the hon gentleman do too

 i thank my hon friend for the visit to bournemouth to see that exemplar of how to house veteran the prime minister have just announce £ of funding towards veteran housing and there will be more to come in due course 
 there be report over the weekend of nato worry that the uk be not contribute enough to the european defensive shield that leave we vulnerable to a missile attack i hear what the minister have say about the strategic defence review but what assurance can he provide that he will look at our defence spending commitment with sufficient speed to provide good enough defence for our country 
 the hon lady be right to raise the capability gap that this government inherit from the government she serve in the strategic defence review be look at those capability gap and at what be need to protect ourselves and our ally in the future when that be set out later in the spring she will be able to see how we plan to address those gap ensure that we support british industry while also address the security challenge that we and our ally face 
 as a great supporter of the british american alliance i be disappointed to have to ask this question but give some of the recent tweet from people associate with the incoming us administration what assessment have the secretary of state make of the uk ’s exposure of our defence capability give that there may be some change in the white house 
 the us be the close ally of this country and this country be the close security ally of the us that have be for case the decade it have withstand the up and down of the political cycle on both side of the atlantic and we as a government will work closely with the incoming us administration 
 defence spend with northern ireland small and medium sized enterprise last year account for only £ what will the secretary of state and the minister do to proactively increase that spend with northern ireland sme 
 the hon gentleman make an important point i hope that our defence industrial strategy in enable sme to access contract and work for the mod more easily will increase that number substantially 
 will the minister agree to meet i to discuss the figure for the incidence of blood cancer and sarcoma in veteran and current service personnel who have crew particular military helicopter 
 give the concern around exposure to exhaust fume and the importance that we place on safety the mod be this month initiate the testing of the exhaust emission of in service helicopter to ensure that we be meet our duty of care for personnel nevertheless i would also like to meet my hon friend to discuss the issue far 
 follow the christmas day attack on finnish sea cable what assessment have the defence secretary make of the threat to british interconnector which individual minister be ultimately responsible for their security 
 the finnish investigation into what cause the damage to the estlink cable be continue but many analyst conclude that it be likely that the eagle s be the cause that reinforce the case for operation nordic warden which i confirm to the house in response to an early question it be be run from the northwood stand joint force headquarters and will cover a number of area of interest include area where we have british undersea cable 
 i recently visit hms swiftsure at rosyth in my constituency a former royal navy submarine now be safely and securely dismantle and recycle by babcock as a pilot project of the submarine dismantle programme will the minister provide an update on the programme which could secure hundred of job in dunfermline and dollar by deal with similar submarine at rosyth over the come decade 
 my hon friend will be aware that despite the fact we have have nuclear submarine since we have never dismantle so there be a lot of work to be do what be happen with swiftsure be very encouraging and will hopefully provide many job in dismantle nuclear submarine i hope my hon friend will be happy with that reply 
 we now come to the statement i be sure there must be something leave to say 
 a happy new year to you mr speaker and to everyone across the house with your permission i will give an update on health and adult social care reform 
 i start by pay tribute to the nhs and social care staff who work throughout the christmas break include by staff our hospital ambulance service care home and call centre on christmas day and throughout the new year from visit hospital and residential care home in the south west of england essex london south yorkshire and the north west over the past week i know the extent of the pressure they be deal with they be go above and beyond to keep the nhs standing to provide people with the social care they need and to give patient and care user the good care they possibly can against the most challenging backdrop 
 we have see more than time as many patient hospitalise with flu this winter compare with last year in a service with no slack leave to give since come into office the government have be do everything we can to prepare the nhs for winter include by end the resident doctor strike this be the winter in year when staff be on the frontline not the picket line the chancellor make an additional £ available in year to fill the black hole leave by the previous government and we introduce the new respiratory syncytial virus vaccine to protect more than people against the virus 
 but i be not go to pretend for a that the experience of patient this winter be acceptable the government have be honest about the state of the nhs since the election and we will continue to be the nhs be break but not beat it will take time to fix but it can be do that be why the chancellor make an additional £ available in year to fill the black hole leave by the previous government and to enable we to deliver on our step to cut nhs waiting time that be why we be undertake fundamental reform and it be why we be act on social care 
 these be the honest fact the social care system in this country be fail leave hundred of thousand of disabled and elderly people without the care they need the failure of social care be pile enormous pressure on the nhs in november more than hospital patient a day be well enough to leave but have to stay overnight because they be not able to be discharge we have an age society by there will be more people age and over in england if we do nothing social care cost be expect to double over decade 
 of course there be plenty of blame to go around in when andy burnham establish cross party talk on social care the conservatives pull out and leak detail of the talk to attack labour in it be labour who torpedo theresa may ’s proposal and in   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak   as chancellor delay boris johnson ’s   cap on care cost and then defunde they as prime minister there have not be a shortage of good idea in the past year but a lack of good politic it be time all of we across the house do thing differently 
 i have write to my opposite number and the leader of all uk wide party represent in the house to invite they to help break out of the cycle of political failure i hope all of we across the house will put aside our ideological and partisan difference and work together on this to finally find a way through to a long term plan that can build the broad consensus we need 
 we do not need to agree on everything but in april we will launch an independent commission on build a national care service i be delighted that it will be head by of our country ’s lead social reformer and whitehall ’s great doer baroness louise casey baroness casey have serve labour conservative and liberal democrat government she be a trust independent figure who will take view from all party and crucially the public as she seek to build a cross party and national consensus on the future of social care she will get thing do her report will be publish next year make a series of recommendation that can be implement straight away throughout this parliament and her final report will come later in this parliament 
 in the meantime we be stabilise the social care system today we have legislate for the ever fair pay agreement for social care to tackle the workforce crisis the vacancy we see today in the budget the chancellor provide the big increase in carer ’s allowance since the 1970 worth £ a year to family carer and an extra £ for local authority 
 on friday i visit the home of keith and elaine in carlisle i see at hand how extended doorway and the installation of accessible kitchen and bathroom facility have change their life thank to the disabled facility grant allow they to live with renew dignity independence and happiness that be why i announce last week the immediate release of £ through the disabled facility grant to provide an extra home adaptation before april change the life of thousand more disabled people for the well just as keith and elaine have experience 
 we be not hang around on reform either we be introduce new standard to help people who use care their family and provider to choose the most effective new technology as it come on the market we be join up care and medical record so nhs and care staff have the full picture they need to provide the good possible care and we be train care worker to perform more health intervention to help people stay well and at home a lot do a huge amount more to do and if this house get this right the good be yet to come 
 turn to the elective reform plan the prime minister have launch today the government inherit nhs waiting list at the nhs standard that patient should wait no long than week for treatment have not be meet for a decade million of patient be force to put their life on hold while they wait in his investigation lord darzi list the cause of this crisis the undoing of new labour ’s reform the disastrous top down reorganisation and slash gps and community health service all of which have lead to a dramatic drop in hospital productivity lord darzi have diagnose the condition now this labour government be prescribe the cure 
 in november the prime minister set out the government ’s plan for change a plan to dig this country out of the hole it be leave in and an act of resistance against the status quo of manage decline it commit to cut maximum waiting time from month today to week by the end of this parliament today we be set out how we will hit that ambitious target so that once again the nhs be there for we when we need it this will demand fast improvement than even the last labour government achieve that mean do thing differently it have to be a plan for investment and reform investment and reform be what labour promise before the election investment and reform be what we be deliver our elective reform plan will cut waste and inefficiency ramp up the number of appointment scan and operation that the nhs perform and give nhs patient great choice control and convenience 
 any patient use the nhs can see the waste and inefficiency in the service when they use it staff feel it hold they back every day when the government announce significant investment in the budget i say that it would come with reform so that every pound be well spend and here it be resource will be divert from hospital to gps to get hundred of thousand more patient care for fast in the community patient will have the choice of whether they want or need follow up appointment save a pointless appointment a year gps will be able to directly refer patient for test and scan cut out the middle man and speed up diagnosis for patient across a wide range of condition for year restaurant have be texte customer reminder of their booking give they the chance to cancel or rearrange to cut down on no show the nhs will learn from the hospitality sector do the same for patient and cut around a miss appointment every year as a result 
 in opposition we say that investment in new and more productive way of working would make a significant dent in waiting time today we be announce new and expand surgical hub to run like formula pitstop and bust through the backlog community diagnostic centre will open at evening and weekend so that patient do not have to take a time off work for their appointment and can get diagnose fast we be reward trust that cut waiting time fast with extra capital investment as an incentive and we be publish a new agreement with the independent sector the of its kind for year to cut waiting time 
 over the past year a tier healthcare system emerge in this country people who can afford it be increasingly go private to skip the queue while those who can not are leave behind work people be go into debt and other be run fundraiser to pay to get an operation those story belong in pre war britain they should shame the conservative party i be determined to end tier healthcare in this country so that whether you be the rich or poor person in britain you get timely quality treatment free at the point of use this new agreement will see more nhs patient able to choose to be treat in a private hospital where there be capacity pay for by the state more capacity will be available for people in working class area of the country and for woman stick on gynaecology waiting list where we can treat work people fast we will and we make no apology for do so 
 working class patient in this country deserve the same choice control and convenience as the wealthy expect indeed as we all expect from other app and service that we use every day but not the nhs that be why we be also modernise the nhs app to put patient in the drive seat for their own care if customer can choose when their deliveroo meal will arrive and be keep inform until it be drop off why should patient not be afford the same service by the nhs with this plan they will be patient will be able to manage their appointment book test and scan view result as soon as they be ready and choose where they will be treat we will cut down on letter that arrive in the post after an appointment and give power back to the patient 
 in the past month we have end the resident doctor strike and invest billion more in our health service with the big investment in hospice and end of life care for a generation we be deliver investment and reform in general practice to fix the front door to the nhs and bring back the family doctor and we have start to get nhs waiting list fall this plan for investment and reform will press down hard on the accelerator and will change our nhs and the experience of million of patient it will put the nhs on the road to recovery and i commend this statement to the house 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his typical courtesy in early sight of his statement as well for his call last week indeed it be early sight than i be use to because i be able to read most of it in the medium before come here which be not unhelpful 
 i echo the secretary of state ’s comment in thank and pay tribute to nhs and social care staff up and down the country include those in my university hospital of leicester nhs trust gps and indeed all those in chorley hospital mr speaker for all they have do over the festive period they work full on day in day out every day of the year but they particularly feel the pressure over the festive period when they be not able to spend it with their family so it be important that we across the chamber share our recognition of that 
 the secretary of state set out clearly the challenge face the system we all know that clinical care the nhs and social care must work well and as a whole for our health and care system to function so it be right that his statement address both those issue he also highlight the challenge we face as an age society we be all live long which be a good thing but that bring challenge of care and more complex need of course that come on top of the ongoing challenge of the legacy of the pandemic which be still with we in many way 
 in his comment the secretary of state refer to previous reform he opt not to reflect another point in lord darzi ’s report his positive remark about our reform which the secretary of state know i take through this house and which lay the foundation on which he be now able to build give the serious and cross party work we have do certainly on social care i highlight that the challenge be real and we must address both challenge swiftly 
 before turn to the long term i turn to the immediate and ask the secretary of state a few question about winter and the challenge the nhs be face we hear from the minister before christmas about the work be do for extra co ordination and new datum but what extra capacity in bed specifically for the winter period have the secretary of state put in place to help ease pressure what additional capacity have he put into a&e we always recognise that winter be challenge and we always put in extra resource support and capacity so i would be grateful for an update 
 i would be grateful for an update from the secretary of state on the pressure be feel in respect of the quad demic of various challenge face by the sector also how many critical incident have trust declare since   december i would be grateful if he could update we on the pressure be feel and the response to they in the light of the winter weather in my melton and syston constituency in leicestershire and in many constituency across the country we have see extensive flooding which have have an impact on our ambulance service in particular 
 turn to reform and elective recovery i want to support the secretary of state where he be do the right thing and it be important that he be keen to pursue a bold and innovative agenda it be in all our interest that he be bold but i call for he to be more ambitious those be not word often speak about he and i suspect certainly not in no but i call for he to be bold and to go far that be because as with so much from the prime minister with multiple relaunche of previous announcement what we see here be yet another relaunch of a previous announcement the difference be the former secretary of state sir sajid javid ’s announcement from have be reheat and re serve up today we deliver community diagnostic centre with additional appointment and we deliver surgical hub how will the secretary of state ’s plan go beyond that we work with the independent sector to allow it to be use to help tackle backlog we improve technology and the kit available with £ of investment the nhs app create during the pandemic be design and redesign by my right hon friend   the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay   and his team to allow for regular update again it be right that the secretary of state be update the app but how be he radically change what be already in place i certainly already receive text update as i suspect do other on treatment and appointment so my challenge to the secretary of state be this what be he do that be fundamentally different 
 the key underpinning point in the former secretary of state ’s plan be on workforce because none of this can be deliver without the staff to deliver and interpret test he set out his plan to grow the workforce and we have record number of doctor and nurse and increase medical school place what be this secretary of state ’s plan to grow the workforce and deliver on his ambition 
 turn to social care the secretary of state will know because i have say it publicly that i will work constructively with he and the commission he be right to highlight the challenge that government of all complexion have face include a royal commission green papers and a comprehensive spending review   that do not deliver under tony blair and gordon brown similarly theresa may ’s reform do not deliver we propose reform that be due to come in this year but the chancellor scrap they i think it be important that we look to the future and at how we can work constructively on social care 
 i say to the secretary of state that we will enter into discussion with he and the commission in that spirit but i challenge he on the pace of his ambition the sector be already under pressure and that have be add to by the national insurance increase which it do not yet know how it will pay the real challenge for he be why the sector be cry out for a fast pace be bold be more ambitious and we will work with he to deliver it it take a year plus to deliver a diagnosis we know the challenge he have have year in opposition he should have a plan now 
 we will call out the secretary of state when he get it wrong or simply re announce what be already happen but he be right in his approach to social care and find a way forward and we will work constructively for the good of patient and all our constituent many of they already feel let down by promise break by the labour party over just the past month so i ask he not to break this promise and to work with we across the house to deliver the change that our constituent deserve and expect we to work on together to deliver 
 it seem to be the conservative line across the board now to say you ’ve have year in opposition so why have not you sort it all out in month i say gently that the conservatives have year in government and it will take long than month to clean up their mess honestly their contribution to discussion in this house might have more credibility and a strong landing zone if they at least acknowledge their part in the deep mess and malaise that they have create over the past year 
 none the less on social care i very sincerely and warmly welcome the conservative party ’s support for the independent commission it be important as a matter of principle to try to establish in broad term the level of consensus about what social care should look like and how it should be deliver to meet the need of old and disabled people in the century with change demography change challenge change pressure and a change pace of technology and about the balance of provision between the individual the family and the state and the balance of financial contribution for social care between the individual the family and the state 
 of course those issue will inevitably be contest across the party political divide from election to the next but just as we have have broad consensus on the national health service since just as we have have broad consensus on state education since rab butler ’s reform and just as we have mostly have broad consensus for much of the past century on how public service should be deliver so too should we try to establish the same consensus on social care that be not to say that we should agree on everything but we should agree on as much as possible because whether it be gordon brown and andy burnham in or theresa may in we can see the extent to which party political wrangling rancour and sometimes opportunism have sink well mean attempt to grasp the nettle of reform 
 on the question of pace i reassure people that in our month we have already legislate for fair pay agreement deliver the big expansion of carer ’s allowance since the 1970s and immediately inject £ into the disabled facility grant with another £ to follow from april—£711 in total over the next year as well as the increase spending power for local government in the budget and £ for social care specifically with respect to the people who be say go fast i urge they to bear in mind that we have already do quite a lot in month we do not pretend that we have solve all the problem we have not nearly solve all the problem but that be not a bad start for a government who be determined to show that we understand the pressure in social care today and be willing to deliver 
 the dilnot proposal be very good technical response to a question that andrew dilnot be set by david cameron but we should reflect on why it be that every single prime minister since lord cameron include lord cameron himself do not implement those reform there have always be something else in health and social care that have be more pressing and urgent i be sure that baroness casey will consider the dilnot proposal alongside all the other challenge and potential solution to the wide issue in social care but we be determined to respond at pace that be why the phase of the casey commission will report next year set out an action plan throughout this parliament i hope that we can achieve broad consensus on those action too 
 turn to the winter situation the right hon gentleman have ask what capacity there be accord to the late figure there be more acute bed this year than last year of course those figure flex up and down depend on pressure but the pressure be enormous the number of bed occupy by flu patient be much high than this time last year somewhere between and time high the number of adult bed close due to noroviru have reduce in the late figure but it be still above last year when bed be close the late figure be on ambulance response we have see many more call out this year there have be a increase in emergency admission compare with the same period last year with the high november on record for a&e attendance ambulance response time be nowhere near where we would want they to be because of the enormity of the pressure which be why i have be out on the frontline include over the christmas period we be not just look at what we can do to mitigate challenge this year we be already begin to plan for next year because i want to see year on year continuous improvement in urgent and emergency care 
 i now turn to the challenge on the reform plan we have propose and set out today start with the workforce of the reason we have emphasise the importance of not just investment but reform be the need to free up the staff capacity that we already have in the nhs to good effect that mean deal with the number of non attendance by send reminder to patient and give they ease and convenience in rebooke it be why we be get rid of unnecessary low clinical value out patient appointment with the consent of patient in every case it be why we be ask general practitioner to do more to manage case in the community with   more advice and guidance and fund they to do so work with colleague in secondary care to ease pressure on hospital 
 today ’s reform plan answer the challenge we have hear from people across the nhs how do we tackle the elective backlog without do so at the expense of general practice urgent and emergency care community care or social care the truth be that this be a systemic challenge and we will only be able to deal with the challenge in the elective backlog by also act on urgent and emergency care general practice community care and delay discharge in social care we be take a system wide approach to meet this essential target 
 a number of thing be different from under the previous government for example on the deal with those in the independent sector give they the stability and certainty of work with this government give they the confidence to open and invest in new capital estate and new kit particularly in part of the country that be relatively underserved by the independent sector we have insist they do that with their own staff and resource and that they put their money where their mouth be in relation to train new staff to deal with some of those pressure that be how we will ensure that we will not be take peter from the nhs hospital to treat paul up the road at the independent hospital 
 finally i be happy to take more question on the detail of the plan the shadow secretary of state ask what be different from in fact i think he ask i to commend my predecessor sir sajid javid for his work in in the bipartisan spirit of the new year let i commend the work that he and sir sajid javid do in try to undo lord lansley ’s disastrous top down reorganisation and that be a very good thing to do there will be a very big difference between this government and our conservative predecessor real delivery shorter waiting time and an nhs fit for the future 
 do the secretary of state agree that his plan to transform adult social care service have already start with labour ’s employment rights bill ensure that social care worker will get fair national pay and condition and increase access to training and progression do he far agree that we will never have a quality social care service in this country if we do not value the people deliver it properly as this labour government intend to do 
 my hon friend be absolutely rightly the employment rights bill introduce in our day contain provision for a new fair pay agreement for care worker and who well to be lead the charge on that than the care worker turn deputy prime minister my right hon friend   the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson 
 i add my thank to those of the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state to all those who work in our health and care service over christmas and the new year 
 our health and social care system be in crisis so the liberal democrats be broadly supportive of the measure that the government have announce today however   we do have some concern not least that action on social care may arrive too late and that the focus on elective care may come at the expense of emergency care the liberal democrats have long call for cross party talk on social care so we be glad that the government have listen and we look forward to work constructively with the secretary of state and other uk wide party as the review develop however carer care provider and council be on the brink of bankruptcy and they need solution right now not in year time there have be many such review and what be need now be action on the recommendation they have make 
 it be absolutely crucial that wait time for elective care be cut radically so the action announce today to speed up scan and treatment be very positive a waiting list of more than people be of the bad legacy leave by the conservatives but those legacy include overcrowded a&es and unacceptable ambulance delay which can mean the difference between life and death as people in north shropshire know only too well emergency care be under immense pressure at the moment visit to shrewsbury hospital demonstrate that and we need bold action if we be to ensure that this be the last ever winter crisis 
 as the mp for a rural area i hear every week from constituent suffer because of the crisis so they will be follow today ’s development closely many of my constituent be elderly far more than average and they be the people most likely to need the nhs and the most likely to be digitally exclude accord to age uk around of people age and over do not use the internet and around a do not have a smartphone they deserve as much choice and control as everybody else so can the secretary of state outline how those without access to the nhs app will be able to benefit from the same option and information as those who do have access 
 will the secretary of state consider fast track the social care review so that the sector can get the urgent attention it need will he commit to rescue our emergency service by support liberal democrat call to make the nhs winter proof with a new winter taskforce that build resilience in hospital ward a&e department and patient discharging finally will he define what a work class area be because the health and care crisis be acute in rural britain and we can not afford to be leave behind 
 i thank the liberal democrats for their support for the commission and for the way in which their party have put the issue of social care much higher up the political agenda particularly during the general election campaign that have be very helpful to i in the last month and to the government and we look forward to work with the liberal democrats to build as broad a consensus as we can on the solution to the social care crisis 
 as i have mention we have hit the ground run in a number of respect include the big expansion of carer ’s allowance since the 1970 on investment in health and social care i just point out that the £ the chancellor allocate to the department of health and social care alone at the budget dwarf what the liberal democrats promise in their manifesto i know   that not all the funding decision the chancellor and the government have make in the last month for the desperately need investment in our public service have be popular but i respectfully say to people who disagree with the decision the chancellor have make that they need to spell out which service they would cut or which other taxis they would increase because those be the choice we have make our choice we stand by they what people can not do be welcome the investment but not say how they would fund it if they oppose what we have do the prime minister the chancellor and the entire government have be willing to make unpopular choice in the last month because we believe they be the right choice to get britain out of the hole it be leave in by our predecessor people will not thank we for resort to the short termist stick plaster government by gimmick politic that plague this house during the last parliament 
 i turn to some of the other issue that the hon lady mention we will make further proposal on urgent and emergency care reform i want to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs whether it be hear and treat over the phone triage a more appropriate community response that be often fast than ambulance response time or get ambulance and ambulance handover speed up at all our hospital with the release to respond approach we have see that work successfully in some part of the country but it need to be consistently roll out 
 the hon lady talk about patient choice for those who be digitally disconnected or do not want to organise their life around their smartphone that be why i believe very strongly in choice different course for different horse those of we who do not book appointment over the phone free up the line so that those who prefer do their business and book appointment by phone can get through 
 the hon lady ask we to fast track the social care work the phase of louise casey ’s commission will report next year but we be of course willing to talk to party across the house about how we move forward 
 the hon lady urge we to set up an urgent and emergency care taskforce let i reassure she that the minister of state for health my hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth   and i have every week and often more frequently convene health and care leader virtually and in the department to keep a grip on what be go on to provide as much central support as possible and to respond to crisis as they emerge if only that be just about set up a taskforce we already have what we need be sustained improvement from year to the next and that be what we be determined to deliver 
 rise 
 may i suggest that we help each other by ask short question with short punchy answer i be sure ben coleman will set a good example 
 mr speaker i take that personally in a positive way 
 this be a very encouraging statement it be great to start the new year with some good news and to be so clear that we be keep our promise as a government it be also very good that we be take the necessary   time to create this cross party consensus on social care while keep the show so firmly on the road carer will be support to carry out more health task as they do already in my constituency with wound dressing and medicine management the problem be they do not have any possibility of career progression interruption i be sorry mr speaker i forget your initial encouragement i will bring this to a close 
 do the secretary of state agree that as carer be encourage to do more health task they need proper opportunity for career progression even within the nhs in collaboration with local authority 
 brevity be not my hon friend ’s new year ’s resolution but at your encouraging mr speaker it be mine we will provide more training to care professional to deliver a wide range of task in the home make well use of their skill and the career progression that my hon friend describe crucially that career progression must be in status and in pay that be what we will work with the staff to deliver 
 i call the father of the house 
 i welcome the consensual part of the secretary of state ’s statement but i wonder whether we have be entirely honest with the public about the sheer unaffordability of the cap propose by dilnot i do not absolve my own government from this maybe we should start tell the truth to the public do the secretary of state think we need a new social compact on bring in social insurance so that people can plan for their entire life they would know that they will have to pay more in taxis during their life for their old age but at least they would have certain right
