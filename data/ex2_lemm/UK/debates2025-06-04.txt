i thank my hon friend for her campaign i know that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs will have hear her representation we have commission the expert animal welfare committee to produce a full report on the responsible sourcing of fur to inform the next step that need to be take and we be commit to publish an animal welfare strategy later this week 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of not issue new north sea oil and gas licence on level of economic growth in scotland 
 this be the opportunity i have have to apologise to the house for use an inaccurate figure on previous occasion i have tell the house that the scottish government have receive a record settlement of £ this year but treasury figure show that the block grant for this year be actually £ that be the high ever settlement in the history of devolution with bell on that £ be more money for school hospital policing and housing it be an end to austerity that be the barnett formula in action the formula that both the snp and reform have announce this week that they want to scrap 
 oil and gas will remain a crucial component of our energy mix for decade to come our workforce be the most talented in the world and we be commit to ensure its future   we have consult on support for the energy transition in the north sea include on these issue and the secretary of state for energy security and net will respond to that consultation shortly economic growth in the uk in the quarter of the year beat all forecast reach 0.7%—the high in the g7 growth in scotland be more sluggish than in the rest of the uk if scotland ’s economy have grow at even the low rate at which it grow under the tories it would be £ large that make it even more astonishing that the opposition party oppose the eu us and india trade deal 
 minister across various departments have repeatedly say that oil and gas be here to stay for many year issue new north sea oil and gas licence would support ten of thousand of job return million in tax revenue to the treasury and help to grow the scottish economy why be the government refuse to issue any new licence 
 a consultation on rosebank and jackdaw be conclude and the secretary of state for energy security and net will report on it in due course there be also the north sea transition consultation   which have conclude as i mention early and which will take into account all those issue it will be publish in due course 
 labour ’s windfall tax on north sea energy profit be design to make we less reliant on people like vladimir putin when i be campaign in hamilton last week voter ask i why the snp the tories and reform be so against our windfall tax i could not explain can the secretary of state 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the question what astonish i more than anything be that the shadow secretary of state for scotland be the energy minister when the energy profit levy be bring in 
 indicate dissent 
 the hon gentleman shake his head but he be the energy minister indeed as my hon friend   the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   may remember the leader of the snp in westminster   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn do not support the levy then do then do not and then put in the snp ’s manifesto that it would be extend to every single scottish industry i be at a loss as be my hon friend 
 we come to the shadow secretary of state 
 i start by congratulate the famous aberdeen football club the only team in red i like to see win and the manager jimmy thelin the player and all the coach staff for win their scottish cup a week and a half ago qualify for the europa league in the process the pride and jubilation on the street of aberdeen last sunday show just how much the club mean to the north east of scotland even more important to the north east than aberdeen football club be the oil and gas industry what do the secretary of state make of the report publish by robert gordon university this week that warn of job loss every week in the north sea 
 i join the shadow secretary of state in congratulate through gritted tooth aberdeen on win the scottish cup speak as a big hearts fan it be always nice to see the small club do well in national competition interruption i do not know whether i have lose or win the house there mr speaker 
 we have this discussion across the dispatch box a lot during question we be aim for clean energy by and set up gb energy in aberdeen something that the shadow secretary of state vote against of course to ensure a transition we have a decline and mature base and we need to create the job of the future and the future industry in scotland he should support that rather than vote against it the epl be bring in by his government 
 to be absolutely clear there be no transition under way it be not the conservative party say that it be the robert gordon university energy transition institute these mythical job in renewable energy simply do not exist yet there be a slowdown in   offshore wind deployment and a steep decline in offshore oil and gas activity as a direct result of labour ’s ideological policies—400 job loss every week a steep decline in skilled role nowhere for supply chain job to go but overseas and a decline in the workforce of why because of massive investor uncertainty due to negative sentiment around oil and gas as a result of the ban on licence and the epl extension when will the secretary of state and the scottish labour party grow a backbone stand up to the secretary of state for energy security and net and stand up for scotland and scottish worker 
 i do not know whether the hon member agree with net anymore certainly his party leader do not seem to believe in it but that be where the job be for the future there be a decline base in the north sea company be make that transition already and we need to ensure pace that be the big issue we need regulatory change and investment and gb energy be there to ensure that the national wealth fund be make investment as well we have see £ invest in scottish power ’s infrastructure thing be start to happen but we need cross party support on this 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on priority for the national wealth fund ’s strategic partnership with the glasgow city region 
 the national wealth fund have make its scottish investment in the glasgow city region which be of area across the uk select for a strategic partnership with the fund to unlock private investment opportunity the secretary of state meet the deputy minister regularly to discuss economic growth which be this government ’s no.1 priority 
 do the minister agree that in recent year we have witness the benefit of further devolving power to city and city region which have create tailored policy to well serve community in holyrood however devolution appear to have stall and there be little appetite to pass power down to our city town and community do she agree that the recent glasgow city region devolution proposal make a compelling case for further devolution to that city region 
 it do but i be afraid that the snp seem determined to hoard power and funding rather than pass they to community there be no well example of that than the labour run council in south lanarkshire propose £ for hamilton town centre only for the snp to vote against that that be why tomorrow voter in hamilton larkhall and stonehouse should back a real local champion labour ’s davy russell 
 what step he be take with the scottish government to support veteran in scotland 
 what step he be take with the scottish government to support veteran in scotland 
 i wish to thank veteran for their service and their family for the sacrifice that enable it as it be volunteers week may i place on record my thank and those of the whole house to the volunteer who do so much for our military charity i welcome the announcement of the new programme valour which be give veteran across the uk easy access to essential care and support   the minister for veterans and people be lead work across the uk government to ensure that veteran and their family have sufficient access to health service housing employment and other form of support 
 i regularly speak to veteran in bishop auckland and although they mostly reflect positively on their military service they often mention the need to improve home for force family will the minister welcome this week ’s announcement that labour will improve force family home in scotland as part of a £ investment and do the minister agree that all those who serve our force in this united kingdom should have a home fit for a hero 
 i be pleased to join my hon friend in welcome the strategic defence review which be launch by the prime minister in scotland on monday and include more than £ of investment in military accommodation in scotland i be sure that like i my hon friend will be appal that the minister snub a confidential briefing on that strategic defence review to go campaigning during a by election campaign at a charity whose funding he have slash 
 a local charity in my area support woman veteran recently it be support a woman who be rehome in general purpose support accommodation for veteran in scotland the accommodation be entirely unsuitable for she as a survivor of sexual violence and it lead to she be subject to a further sexual assault by a man who be also house there can the minister assure i that her work with the ministry of defence will ensure appropriate support for woman veteran 
 i be truly sorry to hear about the experience of my hon friend ’s constituent support service and accommodation across the uk must reflect the need of all our veteran include woman that include the provision of safe suitable and appropriate housing if she write to i i shall ask the minister for veterans and people to get in touch with she 
 the previous conservative government have a dedicated minister of state for veteran sit at the cabinet table but that job be take away by the new administration how be the interest of veteran in scotland be raise in cabinet under the new government 
 the minister for veterans and people be do sterling work his advocacy have help to ensure that labour will improve force family home we be make a £ investment across the whole uk i be sure that when the strategic defence review be launch in scotland and then in this   chamber the hon member be full of admiration for what the minister be do for veteran and those who currently serve we with such distinction 
 scotland bear veteran betty gallagher join the army when she be but month later she be dishonourably discharge for what be refer to as lesbian tendency today betty run the thriving bourneout lgbt hub in eastbourne and found eastbourne pride will the minister thank betty for her service to our country and advise on how she and other veteran can seek justice for the discrimination that they be subject to 
 i be delighted to join the hon gentleman in thank betty for all her effort he will know that in the review work have be undertake on justice for lgbt people in our armed force and we be pleased to commend that to the house 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i associate myself with the remark of   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   about the success of aberdeen football club the strategic defence review make it clear that housing must be a priority and that the money from the sale of housing must be reinveste but veteran continually come to i who have be discharge into homelessness can the minister reassure we that we will ensure that house that be sell or redevelop be available to veteran family 
 i be very pleased to offer the hon lady that reassurance 
 i join colleague in congratulate aberdeen fc despite the impact of their victory on my beloved dundee united i also congratulate arbroath fc on secure the scottish league championship title the scottish government have reinstate the winter fuel payment for up to pension age veteran in scotland but the prime minister have say that it be right to slash the winter fuel payment be the prime minister right to slash it 
 the hon member will be perfectly aware as indeed everyone in the house will be that question about the winter fuel payment in scotland be devolve to the scottish government decision make in scotland be the responsibility of the scottish government but i be pleased to reiterate to the house what the prime minister and the chancellor have say this be a difficult decision and now that we have a little more breathing space we be very pleased to make change to help more pensioner 
 i see that we be not go to get a straight answer out of the minister just as the people in hamilton do not get a straight answer out of labour ’s candidate that will be why labour be sink without a trace let i put it this way do the minister think that the prime minister be right to slash the winter fuel payment for up to veteran across the uk 
 when this government take office we inherit a £ black hole which require emergency action we say at the time that our decision on the winter fuel payment be a difficult that we do not want to make and we be very pleased to be in a position to reconsider it 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on support for the high education sector in scotland 
 scotland ’s university be of course world class but i be very concerned about the financial difficulty face by several of they   as the hon lady will know high education be a devolved matter and scotland ’s university their staff and their student all need a scottish government with a proper plan to turn this crisis around 
 international student be hugely valuable not just when it come to share culture and knowledge but to our university and local economy in north east fife in that value be estimate at £ what discussion have the minister have with the scottish government about the economic impact of the reform relate to international student in the immigration white paper can she update the house on whether an economic impact assessment have take place 
 we be in ongoing discussion with the scottish government and scottish university but i want to be absolutely definitive about this because there have be some confusion in the press education policy be devolve and the international student levy will not apply in scotland unless the scottish government decide to introduce it i meet universities scotland just this week and make that very clear and i be pleased to do so again today 
 the university sector be important for grow the scottish economy but so be tourism can the minister enlighten i about the jet safari trip from clacton to scotland that have take place allow former banker to patronise the local miss the big picture and be back in england for a pint of warm beer by lunchtime 
 i think i do hear something about   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   get lose in hamilton this weekend and sculke behind the bin before he be send pack by the good people of south lanarkshire of course the only local candidate in that by election be labour ’s davy russell who will stand up for his community against the division peddle by both the snp and reform 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on school standard 
 the right hon gentleman will have hear i remind the house on a number of occasion that john swinney say that education be the defining mission of his snp government but early this year we get the news that standard of attainment in scotland ’s school be decline across the board and shamefully outcome for young working class kid be get bad the attainment gap be widen the scottish government have fail a generation they can not be allow a decade in power to continue that damage scotland ’s teacher parent and pupil all deserve well standard in our school 
 what have cause the system which be once the benchmark for all other to become such a disappointment 
 there be a simple answer to that question the snp scottish government 
 when my right hon friend discuss with snp ministers through announcement make this week the huge employment opportunity that this government have create for young people in scotland will he impress on they the urgent need to finally tackle the persistent and in some area widen attainment gap face by pupil from poor background not only in fife but in south lanarkshire these concern be often raise by resident of hamilton larkhall and stonehouse 
 the house may not know that last year pupil leave high school in scotland without a single qualification to their name and in scot be not in education employment or training that be the legacy of the snp scottish government what have they do about job and growth they be against the defence industry and against the trade deal with the eu india and the us they be against young scot in scotland 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for northern ireland on improve economic co operation between scotland and northern ireland 
 our recent trade deal with the united states india and the eu will improve access to vital market for business in both scotland and northern ireland these be deal with the most populous country in the world the rich country in the world and our most important trading partner i recognise the importance of economic co operation between northern ireland and scotland indeed early this week i meet   the hon member for south antrim robin swann   and a local business to discuss exactly this issue 
 will the minister set up a meeting with the secretary of state for northern ireland to consider create a trade fair focus on trade between northern ireland business and scottish business that would create network would possibly create job and would be great for the economy in both northern ireland and scotland it would certainly go down well with business in north down and right across the uk 
 i would be delighted to see more trade between scotland and northern ireland i will happily meet colleague in the northern ireland office to explore that 
 scotland and northern ireland be set to benefit from the government ’s trio of trade deal do the minister agree that it be astonishing that the snp stand with the tories and reform against an eu trade deal that be good for scotland and that after almost year in government the snp have no plan for scotland in scot be on an nhs waiting list ayrshire ferry be late and be cost £ in scot be not in education employment or training and the snp have no plan for the defence of our union 
 i agree with my hon friend that it be astonishing that we see range on the opposition benches numerous people who have talk down the potential of scotland ’s exporter and who have say that there be no benefit to be have from these deal for a scottish business sector that be desperate to grow and export and be delighted with the trade deal which will make such a difference to they 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 for year there have be under investment in scotland ’s road the a9 a96 a77 and a75 be all in dire need of upgrading or dualling work on all of they have be delay or even cancel by the snp in the spirit of improve economic co operation between the nation of the uk and specifically between scotland and northern ireland and give how vital the a77 and a75 be to individual business and haulier will the minister seek the ringfencing of the barnett consequential that will arise as a result of this morning ’s announcement by the chancellor so that the snp must spend that money on improve road in scotland 
 we be in conversation with all the relevant party but yes we would like an increase in trade and in the transport infrastructure that support it 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to regenerate town centre in scotland 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to regenerate town centre in scotland 
 as a former publican i know that these be hard time for business on the high street we be invest £ in our plan for neighbourhood in scotland with £ worth of funding for town include irvine greenock kilmarnock coatbridge clydebank elgin dumfries arbroath peterhead and kirkwall of course it would help if the scottish government extend business rate relief to retail and leisure business as have happen south of the border many business in scotland be ask where that money go 
 do the secretary of state agree that it be astonishing that the snp vote against the £ to regenerate hamilton town centre and that only labour ’s davy russell will stand up for local people job and service 
 i have bring glass to see if i can find an ounce of credibility in the snp ’s candidate in hamilton for vote against that £ the snp candidate be a councillor from cambuslang who stand for election twice in rutherglen seek selection in shettleston and then vote against £ for the hamilton town centre before seek selection there in scotland we be allow to elect councillor with a single transferable vote she appear to be the snp ’s single transferable councillor 
 a proud industrial heritage a strong community spirit and an overwhelming feeling of be let down and under invest in by the previous conservative government unite town in my constituency with those across scotland include those in hamilton larkhall and stonehouse in wales labour ’s transform town programme have invest in holywell in my constituency will the secretary of state join i in call on the snp to u turn and finally back labour ’s plan to invest in hamilton town centre 
 what a wonderful representative my hon friend be for her constituency i could not agree more the snp candidate be yet to explain to voter in hamilton larkhall and stonehouse why she vote against the much need £ investment in hamilton town centre i hope she will explain before tomorrow ’s vote if she do not everyone should back labour ’s davy russell 
 i will tell the secretary of state what be bad for town centre and that be job loss on this government ’s watch robert gordon university have be force to publish a report that outline that there could be job loss in the north sea every week that be a grangemouth type shutdown every week how many job have to be lose in my constituency for his government to act 
 the leader of the snp in this house vote against the setting up of great british energy in his constituency which be create job in scotland he be against the eu trade deal he be against the us trade deal he be against the india trade deal he be bad for job and should go 
 town and village across north east scotland such as aberdeen and inverurie kintore and ellon in my constituency will all need regenerate in future if the secretary of state ’s government keep decimate the oil and gas sector the good thing his government can do for the north east of scotland be allow new licence and cut the increase to the energy profit levy will he commit to that otherwise more and more money will need to be put into north east scotland to regenerate our town in future 
 this government be put money into scottish town to regenerate they as we keep say from this dispatch box oil and gas will be with we for decade to come the industry itself be make   the transition and we have to make sure that it happen and happen for the benefit of worker in the north east and all over scotland i be not even sure however that it be a transition that the hon lady and the conservative party now back 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the impact of the barnett formula on level of funding for the nhs in scotland 
 follow the spring statement it be confirm that the block grant for scotland this year be a record £ that be no thank to the snp and reform which both vote against that massive funding boost for scotland and want to scrap the barnett formula that deliver it despite that record funding   the snp still have no plan to get waiting list down when in   scot be stick on an nhs waiting list and the educational attainment gap be grow by the day 
 despite the record funding provide by the labour government the snp plan to downgrade the neonatal intensive care unit at university hospital wishaw which could force the family of sick baby to travel as far as aberdeen for treatment and support do the secretary of state agree that the snp cut should be reverse 
 as the father of an week old daughter i be absolutely horrify by those proposal and i know that they will be cause anxiety for family across lanarkshire that be why it be so disappointing to see the snp candidate in the hamilton by election back the plan to downgrade the wishaw neonatal unit the way to send a message to the snp that that be unacceptable be to vote for davy russell tomorrow in the hamilton larkhall and stonehouse by election 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the impact of the barnett formula on level of funding for local authority 
 the chancellor ’s autumn budget deliver the big settlement in the history of devolution for the scottish government—£50   i want to see that cash reach the frontline service that have suffer year of cut under the snp that record settlement be possible only because of the barnett formula something oppose not only by the scottish nationalist but by   the hon member for clacton nigel farage whose reform circus be send pack from hamilton this week 
 the large ever devolution settlement—£50 be great news for scotland and its local authority but under the snp there be case on nhs waiting list this affect people in my constituency in north northumberland many of whom use cross border healthcare and dental service so do the minister   agree that the snp need to sort itself out and start deliver change to the nhs as labour be do in england 
 i could not agree more in england waiting list have fall since labour come to office less than a year ago while in scotland they continue to rise and we now see nearly in scot wait for treatment john swinney have in total desperation announce that the snp government ’s nhs recovery plan in less than year but the reality be that patient staff and we all know that scotland desperately need a new direction 
 before we start prime minister ’s question i would like to welcome to the gallery the speaker of bahrain and his delegation a big welcome to you 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday june 
 today we be invest £ in the transport infrastructure of the north and of the midland we be decisively turn the page on a fail economic model of low investment and we be back the talent and prospect of the whole country over the come week we will set out plan for further investment and renewal 
 our strategic defence review show that this government will never gamble with our national security through the big sustained funding increase since the cold war we will transform our defence strengthen our nation and invest in job and industry across the united kingdom 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 we all remember the glorious summer of when the world ’s great athlete come to london to compete in the olympics and the paralympics it showcase britain at its good not just in track and field but as a country that can host major cultural and sporting event my right hon and learn friend have be write to by over of our top athlete some of they be member of cambridge harriers who meet in my constituency and they be call for the government to support the bid for the world athletic championship to take place in london if successful it will lift the whole nation—[interruption if successful it will lift the whole nation inspire a generation of new athlete showcase britain on the world stage and put £ into our economy what ’s not to like 
 i think the race have finish go on prime minister 
 of the great achievement of the last labour government be the olympics in london and we all remember it—[interruption    give that response can i pay tribute to the extraordinary contribution of tessa jowell to those game i agree that there have be huge economic benefit from host major sporting event as well as an important legacy 
 we come to the leader of the opposition 
 week ago the winter fuel policy be set in stone week ago the prime minister u turn today the chancellor be rush her plan because she just realise when winter be so on the behalf of the pensioner who want to know can the prime minister be clear with we here and now how many of the people who lose their winter fuel payment will get it back 
 well i be glad to see the right hon lady be catch up with what happen week ago at the budget we take the right decision to stabilise the economy because of the £ black hole that the conservatives leave we take the right decision and the growth figure be up interest rate have be cut and we have free trade deal so we will look again as i say week ago at the eligibility for winter fuel and of course we will set out how we pay for it but because we have stabilise the economy we on this side be commit to the triple lock and that increase pension by over £ this april the conservatives say the triple lock be unsustainable i think her position be that she want to mean test it 
 the prime minister clearly have selective amnesia i ask he question about the winter fuel payment week ago and he be flounder the fact be he have not answer the question i ask he he can not tell we who will get the payment all we see be u turn after u turn his head must be spin will he apologise now include to his own back benchers for take the payment away in the place can he tell we how he will pay for this 
 we take the right decision at the budget because we need to stabilise the economy the right hon lady need to apologise for the fact that the conservatives leave the economy in a terrible state with a mini budget that blow up the economy and we be leave with a £ black hole when she get up perhaps she should apologise for that 
 the office for budget responsibility have say there be no such black hole the prime minister have just give away £ for the chagos island that be his black hole he have not stabilise the economy borrowing price be high now than at any time in the last parliament he have not stabilise the economy he have no clear answer on what he be do it be just chaos chaos chaos he keep make announcement with no detail 
 let ’s move to another area of confusion can we get a simple answer will the government keep the child benefit cap 
 i be absolutely determined that we will drive down child poverty that be of the proud thing of the last labour government that be why we have a taskforce and that be why we have a   strategy and we will set out that strategy in due course but we drive child poverty down under the conservatives poverty always go up 
 i do not ask the prime minister about a taskforce i ask he if he will keep the child benefit cap and he do not know it be just chaos and uncertainty he have no detail he be brief something and cause a lot of confusion to the people out there on that child benefit cap i tell he this i believe in family but i also believe in fairness on the conservative side of the house we believe that people on benefit should have to make the same choice on have child as everyone else what do the prime minister believe 
 i believe profoundly in drive down poverty and child poverty that be why we will put a strategy in place but the right hon lady talk about head spin there be only leader who be praise this week by the russian embassy if she carry on echo kremlin talk point like this reform will be send she an application form for membership 
 i ask the prime minister what he believe in he have to look in his folder to find the answer his mps behind he know what they believe in he do not know he have be in government for nearly a year it will only get hard and hard the can forced laughter the plant question all that will disappear because at every single point thing be get bad he have to ask morgan mcsweeney what it be that he believe in but the fact be that chaos be be feel in the economy the chancellor say she would not be come back with new tax rise but she will have to pay for all these u turn she be announce out there will n’t she 
 i be go to look in my folder because here i have the quote that the right hon lady say on sky news—[interruption i will read it thank you laughter it be what the leader of the opposition say it be worth listen to she say 
 israel be fight a proxy war on behalf of the uk just like ukraine be on behalf of western europe against russia 
 well that be certainly notice in the russian embassy because they put out a statement say that the leader of the opposition have 
 finally call a spade a spade 
 it say 
 ukraine be indeed fight a proxy war against russia on behalf of western interest 
 it go on to say 
 the illegitimate kyiv regime create finance and arm by the west have be at it since 
 so they endorsed—[interruption they want the detail i have give the quote that be what russia say in response she ask i what i believe in i believe in stand by ukraine and call out russia as the aggressor 
 it be our government that stand behind ukraine and lead the way in europe everything the prime minister have say this afternoon be total nonsense obfuscation and avoid the question he do not have any answer it be disgraceful 
 i ask the prime minister about the child benefit cap he be talk about the kremlin he be say everything he can to distract from the mess he be make of our economy the oecd have downgrade growth for the next year he can not rule out tax rise police chief be say that they do not have the money they need to keep the public safe just as he be release more criminal on to the street his cabinet be squabble with each other and they say that they have lose control of the border but he still manage to find £ to give away the chagos island this be total and utter chaos week ago he be crow about his historic trade deal and how he get per cent tariff on steel now the steel industry will face tariff unless he do exactly what president trump tell he to it be chaos chaos chaos and be n’t the root of the chaos that it be about this prime minister his decision and his judgment 
 the only advice—[interruption she get up on a wednesday morning scroll through social medium and never do any of the detail we be the only country in the world that be not pay the tax on steel and we be work on the rest that will be come down she—[interruption we be work to bring it down to that be go to happen interruption 
 order please let we listen to the answer even if you do not believe you be get it be how the prime minister wish to do it 
 she oppose the us deal she oppose the india deal she oppose what we be do with the eu and she oppose diego garcia that be a vital intelligence and strategic capability and it be absolutely clear that legal uncertainty would compromise that capability in a very short time no responsible prime minister would ever let that happen we have secure the long term basis for the base that have be welcome by the us nato australia new zealand and india they be our ally it have be oppose by our adversary russia china and iran and into that column we have reform presumably follow putin and the tories follow reform 
 anyone who see the year old girl flee the flame shelter where her family be kill by an israeli air strike will carry those horrific image with they forever these be very dark day gaza be a stain on the soul of humanity and it be a further shame that there be more moral clarity come from ms rachel on youtube than from many world leader who be complicit in silence the prime minister say this week that britain must be ready for war i ask after ten of thousand of death after a generation of gazans stunt by hunger and trauma when will it be ready for peace when will it help to stop this genocide when will it hold the israeli government to account and when will it recognise the state of palestine 
 i be grateful to the hon member for raise this she be absolutely right to describe these as dark day israel ’s recent action be appalling and in my view counterproductive and intolerable we have strongly oppose the expansion of military operation and settler violence and the blocking of humanitarian   aid the house will have see that we have suspend the free trade agreement talk and sanction extremist support violence in the west bank we will keep look at further action along with our ally include sanction but let i be absolutely clear we need to get back to a ceasefire we need the hostage who have be hold for a very long time to be release and we desperately need more aid at speed and at volume into gaza because it be an appalling and intolerable situation 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i start by welcome report that the chancellor will give winter fuel payment to more pensioner this winter although because we still await the detail we will reserve our full judgment 
 i recognise the effort of the prime minister to pull out all the stop to avoid president trump ’s damage tariff a letter from the king offer to water down online safety law and even try to send the open to of trump ’s golf course the prime minister think he have secure tariff for british steel but now trump be threaten we with unless we comply with his new week deadline this be classic trump change the term of a deal he have already agree do the prime minister share my fear that nothing will stop trump mess the uk around short of bung a few pound into his trumpcoin 
 we have a deal and we be implement it within a very short time i be very confident that we will get those tariff down in accordance with the deal i will come back to the right hon gentleman and update the house in due course and i think the house will be very pleased at the outcome—[interruption from a sedentary position   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   say no this be tariff on steel interruption let we come back to this in a couple of week when we have implement it but the conservative obviously do not want it labour have back steel the conservatives laugh at attempt to do so that be a big part of the problem 
 i have hop the prime minister would now be begin to see the sort of man trump be and start get tough on he so we will come back to this issue 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s remark about gaza because i be sure that all of we be appal by the late scene starve people desperate for food water and medicine meet with chaos and violence the us israeli programme be clearly fail and nothing short of lift the full blockade on aid will do give that the netanyahu government refuse to do that will the prime minister take more decisive action today will he push at the united nations security council for humanitarian corridor to get the desperately need aid urgently into gaza

 if we be to increase the productivity of our large city region outside london just to match the national average it would grow the economy by £ so i be pleased to say that this government be make the big investment in intra city transport connectivity that this country have ever see the spending review will allocate funding for ambitious local transport programme across england include the new transport for city region fund launch by the government today this will give city region mayor a share of £ in long term transport for city region settlement run until the benefit and opportunity will be feel in the city and town across these combine authority and by those who commute to work from outside those city region 
 the previous government say that they would do some of this but as be always the case they never put the money aside to pay for it as a result of our reform to the fiscal rule and decision to increase investment in the autumn budget this labour government be deliver 
 the funding announce today will mean that the mayor of west yorkshire can now fully commit to deliver the west yorkshire mass transit system which   will be fully integrate with cycling walking bus and rail make journey quick more accessible and more reliable across the region the mayor of the west midlands can extend the metro from birmingham city centre to the new sport quarter unlock more than £ of private investment and bring benefit and opportunity to those live in the constituency of my right hon friend   the member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood   and all who travel there

 this funding be substantial mark a time real term increase in spending on city region connectivity fund the priority that matter to hard work people across the country these announcement be only make possible today because at the autumn budget the chancellor take the necessary action to reform the fiscal rule to improve stability after year of chaos from the conservative party and to unlock investment this mean the government can now provide great investment in britain ’s economic revival as for the time the treasury take account of the value of financial asset and not just the cost of investment that have enable we to increase investment by over £ more than the previous conservative government while keep debt on a sustainable path only make possible by the credibility of our fiscal rule which require day to day spending to be fund with revenue 
 it be more important than ever to have a robust fiscal framework i be pleased to note that the office for budget responsibility confirm at the spring statement that the government will meet their stability and investment rule year ahead of schedule in addition to her announcement today regard transport for city region settlement the chancellor will set out further detail on this allocation of additional funding at next week ’s spending review 
 in january the chancellor announce a review of the green book the government guidance on appraising option for investment since then we have consult extensively with stakeholder from across the country consider potential problem with the green book guidance itself and how the guidance be be apply in practice i thank and pay tribute to many hon member across the house for engage on this important issue 
 we will publish the full conclusion of the review next week it will mark a new approach to government decision making that put an end to siloe whitehall thinking and take account of the reinforcing economic effect of infrastructure housing skill and job to ensure that investment take place in every part of the country 
 these announcement reflect just a fraction of our plan to supercharge growth across the united kingdom we be focus on invest across all part of the country to boost prosperity and deliver the change the british people vote for at last year ’s election and there be more to come the spending review which we will publish next week will set out in further detail how an active government will continue to deliver growth empower all region and nation of the uk to reach their full potential and make work people across the country well off no matter where they choose to live and work 
 unlike the conservatives who will tell we that they would have deliver on their false promise after year of fail to do so this labour government in our year in office be deliver a country that people will see be be set up for success that they can take part in that be the change we promise and that be the change this labour government be deliver i commend this statement to the house 
 i think you miss a couple of railway station out of your statement minister but not to worry i call the shadow chief secretary to the treasury 
 i thank the chief secretary to the treasury for his statement and for early sight of it i will start with an area of agreement it be a shared ambition to enable all part of this country to participate in our growth and our future potential in the united kingdom be everywhere and it be right that the government seek to unlock it with every mean they have indeed that be of the guide principle of the conservative administration ’s levelling up policy 
 they always say that imitation be the sincere form of flattery now we know that this chancellor have a reputation for copying so i think i would have a look at the statement make in on network north allocation which i be sure the chief secretary have see i think i would compare those allocation with the government ’s announcement today i have the conservative announcement in hand and the labour announcement in the other interruption labour member can shout all they want 
 here we go in the conservatives promise the west midland £ billion—[interruption i say to labour members that the chief secretary be also only make a promise in we promise £ for the west midland and the government have announce £ for the west midland today we promise £ for west yorkshire today the government have announce £ we promise £ for greater manchester they have announce £ today we promise £ for south yorkshire they have announce £ today we promise £ for liverpool they have announce £ today we promise £ for the north east they have announce £ today we promise £ for the west of england they have announce £ today we promise £ for tees valley in and labour have announce £ today 
 i know the chief secretary be occasionally good with number but do he not agree that what he be announce today be essentially nothing more than a rounding error on the conservatives plan from the only difference between the and announcement be that we would have spell rotherham correctly in our announcement 
 the truth be the chancellor will go around the country rewrite history as frequently as she write her cv but nobody believe in her £ black hole what people do believe be that this chancellor be open to change she be go to roll back the issue on the winter fuel allowance her botched welfare reform and change to the child policy look at those on the treasury bench they have not get a spine if labour back benchers have an issue in their constituency and want to stand up for their constituent they should make a bid to this chief secretary because he will back down and give they the money that be what we know from labour 
 we also know that in the government ’s analysis of the green book they be look to change the assessment of the cost benefit analysis my question to the chief secretary therefore is—[interruption i do have a number of question will he publish the cost benefit ratio for each of the project he have announce today will he state whether they have be evaluate   on the exist green book rule or on new rule will he give an indication today of what those rule might be 
 secondly as the labour government try to decide whether their commitment on defence be for or of gdp with both those number and today ’s investment stretch into the next period of government whoever be in government can the chief secretary confirm that it be this government ’s intention that the investment make today will be secure whatever the change make on defence expenditure 
 the chief secretary say that he be able to make this announcement because the government change the rule which have enable £ more of investment but that be not quite right be it the government can afford the additional investment only if people be prepared to fund it and there be source for funding taxpayer or the bond market can the chief secretary therefore advise whether he be go to look for additional funding from taxis or additional borrowing if there be a shortfall 
 the truth be despite what the back benchers say this labour treasury team be out of their depth they be addict to tax increase and to more borrowing the chief secretary can republish as many press release as he like but we know that because of their reckless mismanagement of the economy come the autumn this labour government will be back for more 
 i be pleased to see the shadow chief secretary to the treasury back in his place today i always enjoy our exchange i welcome the fact that he support our plan and see the good value in they i will respond to particular question and then answer the rest in the round all the green book detail will be publish next week at the spending review so we will be able to share they with he and the house at that time 
 the shadow chief secretary say that we be imitate the conservative party ’s promise to level up the country but i think the british people vote and give their verdict on the conservative success in deliver that at the last election whereas their version of level up be a set of false promise this labour government be deliver real change 
 the shadow chief secretary rightly give his role ask how we will fund the announcement we have make today as i explain in my statement to the house it be because of the chancellor ’s decision to amend the fiscal rule and invest in britain instead of continue with decline that we have be able to do so 
 the shadow chief secretary and the conservative party have not say what they would do differently they be against the change in the fiscal rule against our increase of taxis on the wealthy people at the budget and against every single measure we have take to be able to pay for today ’s announcement whether it be the conservatives reform or any other party they need to recognise that the conservative false promise lead to their decline and their unfunded promise be disrespectful to the british people and that this labour government promise change at the election and we be deliver it these be fully fund promise unlike   the unfunded promise of the conservatives which pose a risk to the economy and a risk to family finance the soon the conservatives learn from their lesson apologise to the british people and come forward with some serious proposal the well for the debate in this house 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i warmly welcome this investment in britain and i hope that the treasury will be fully evaluate the impact of this vital transport infrastructure on growth in region which we know have always lag except for in london and the south east although these figure be fully fund now with all the global shock we be see it be important that we be aware that there could be additional cost on some of the raw material be use and any delay obviously add cost too will the chief secretary tell the house the government ’s plan if cost do go higher will the figure be fully fund regardless or will they have to go back to the drawing board if there be challenge 
 my hon friend the chair of the treasury committee rightly allude to the fact that the chancellor ’s speech today make the case for this government invest in every part of the country and ensure that growth be feel widely my hon friend ask i about the supply chain and cost for build infrastructure the house will know that britain have unfortunately become a country where most of our infrastructure project go over time and over budget as a failure of poor industrial and infrastructure policy and erratic decision make over many many year alongside the spending review we will be publish the infrastructure strategy at a slightly later stage and that will answer many of my hon friend ’s question on government policy recognise the problem she have raise and the solution that will be set out to support the supply chain to be able to deliver for britain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we liberal democrats believe that when the economy be grow every nation every region and every person should feel and see the benefit so we be pleased to see investment in public transport and public infrastructure but i must ask the minister where be the plan and the money for rural area he will remember that at the budget we liberal democrats support and welcome the government ’s change to the fiscal rule that allow for borrow and more productive investment and we be delighted to see that of the beneficiary of today ’s announcement be the metrolink to stockport which be a testimony to the hard work of the liberal democrats who have be campaign on this for far long than the mayor and the combine authority have even exist from shropshire to the south west from cumbria to cornwall and from norfolk to newton abbot rural area once again feel as if they have be forget will the government therefore bring forward a rural growth strategy 
 may i also ask the minister about wales we know that hs2 and the oxford cambridge line have be designate england wales line as oppose to england only line can he explain to the people of wales why that have happen and why they be set to lose out on barnett consequential 
 there be big piece miss from the puzzle many of we rightminde people want to see investment in infrastructure but if we want to build stuff we need skilled people to build it will the government now fix the apprenticeship levy so that it can be spend on skill and training when will the government produce their skill strategy why have skills england be set up as an executive agency of the department for education rather than have employer at its heart as be promise and why be the government scrap the level apprenticeship when we know that it support social mobility include into engineering we welcome this investment into transport infrastructure but that transport infrastructure will not build itself we need the people skilled to do it 
 i be pleased that the liberal democrats welcome today ’s announcement which be specifically about investment in city region the house will know that at the autumn budget the chancellor say that this labour government be choose investment over decline which be why we be increase investment in every part of the country announcement outside of city region will come next week at the spending review to some of the hon lady ’s broad question on policy i can tell she that we will debate the infrastructure strategy the week after that she will have to bear with i but she should know that there be good news come because labour be deliver 
 i very much welcome the commitment to city region nationally our city region have underperformed on growth compare with continental city on south yorkshire i welcome the £ to restore and renew our tram network and to improve our bus service but i understand from the mayor that discussion be still under way about a tram train project to link stocksbridge in the north to beighton and woodhouse in my constituency in the south that project will unlock site for housing and employment growth will my right hon friend agree to give further consideration to discussion with the mayor to unlock that extra funding for those growth project 
 as my hon friend have mention the mayor of south yorkshire have be give £ which be in line with our commitment to devolution and to city region mayor it be for the mayor to decide how that money be spend as my hon friend suggest the mayor have announce that some of this money will be allocate to the tram network but it will be for the mayor and the combine authority to decide how to use the balance of this funding for other project in the region as always i be very happy to meet he and the mayor to consider what option be available 
 i recognise the importance of assist the city region to boost the economy but my brigg and immingham constituency cover the south bank of the humber which be home to a cluster of energy business that be of particular importance to the renewable sector can the chief secretary to the treasury outline what resource will be make available for that area to support improvement both in rail connection and also to the a180 which provide access to the major port of immingham 
 the government recognise the strategic importance of the hon member ’s region to the uk economy this will be reflect in the industrial strategy when it be publish in the come week alongside our other plan on his specific question announcement for funding outside of the transport for city regions funding will be make at the spending review next wednesday
