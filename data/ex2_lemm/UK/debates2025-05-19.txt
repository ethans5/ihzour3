month ago in my maiden speech to parliament i say that fiona laskaris would succeed in change the law that prevent she from save her autistic son christopher from murder i be here today to honour that commitment we be on the cusp of change the law we have get this far thank to the national autistic society mps from across the chamber work together to overcome injustice include   the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion   the right hon member for leeds south hilary benn   and my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey steadfast support from my party the liberal democrats and support from the prime minister and the government in a way that represent parliament at its good and elisa menendez and romilly weeks from itv who run the story above all we get this far because of the courage and determination of fiona laskaris to save other from the fate that befell her son christopher fiona and cara christopher ’s sister be in the gallery 
 christopher be not unlike many autistic child he be a sensitive intelligent loving and compassionate boy who once ask his mum to stop on the way to school to rescue a lamb that be stick in a fence i meet fiona when i be i stay in my bedroom and ignore she perhaps because i be angry that she be buy my home off my dad my mum have die when i be a few month old and i be a sensitive boy well they move in christopher grow up in my old bedroom and he love the house as much as i do but as a young man live alone in leeds he struggle despite fiona plead for help for year she be never able to attain for he the mental capacity assessment that he need to determine his support requirement horrifically he be exploit and murder by a man who have just be release from jail christopher be we be work with the government on an amendment to the bill to ensure that the view of family member be consider when determine an adult ’s requirement for a mental capacity assessment 
 christopher ’s story be not unique king ’s college london find that in alone there be preventable death of people with autism and learn disability in case in which the mental capacity act have not be correctly follow it can be hard to grasp the scale of the special educational need and disability crisis in this country but ten of thousand of send child be out of school include in surrey alone we be lose autistic child include my constituent jennifer chalkley to avoidable suicide and at worst we be abandon autistic people in their 20 to murderer we be fail a generation how we answer their call for justice will serve as a measure of who we be and i believe the answer be less a matter of money than of leadership we know from nobel laureate james heckman that early intervention be exponentially more effective and economical in today ’s brutalise system which have cost the life of christopher jennifer and too many other 
 although this amendment be only a small part of the answer it can save life if grieve mother can change the law perhaps we can change the other thing too if we succeed it will be above all because of the voice of broken but unbeaten parent like fiona demand change although christopher have a difficult life he have the most precious thing that any man can have a love and devoted mum it be up to we to ensure that fiona be a witness that in our country it be possible for the vulnerable to be hear for injustice to be overcome and to find beyond grief hope

 the house will note that this afternoon we be without the minister for veterans and people my hon friend   the member for birmingham selly oak al carns he be halfway up everest with a group of soldier raise fund for armed force charity and raise the profile of veteran and i be sure that the whole house wish he well most of we also think rather he than i 
 this government have confirm the big increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war which will boost national security and make defence the engine for growth in every part of the united kingdom for too long small business have feel leave out of defence but no more we be set new target to ensure that small firm benefit from that increase in defence spending we be set up a new support centre to guide small business on access to defence and for the time we be make british base business a priority for british taxpayer defence investment 
 i too wish the veterans minister the good of luck as he climb everest and i be sure we all agree rather he than we 
 in today ’s world warfare be change dramatically drone cost $ can destroy tank worth $ but the innovation cycle for those drone be rapid they be design to become obsolete within month we need a dynamic sme sector to produce those drone but defence sme be struggle to get the finance they need with a lack of long term contract and a lack of guarantee a multilateral defence bank could help to ensure that those firm get the finance they need will the secretary of state please set out the discussion he be have to help to found that multilateral defence bank 
 my hon friend be quite right about the fact that capability be now change in week not month or even year he be also right about finance that be why i go to the london stock exchange last week and close the market i think it be the time a defence secretary have ever do that i want to signal that this government want a new partnership with not just industry and innovator but investor and that mean change the way in which defence do its work 
 i have meet outstanding uk sme such as supacat 4gd and many other which contribute to the sovereign industrial base that our security depend on however under the last government the percentage of ministry of defence direct expenditure go to sme fall from to will my right hon friend confirm when this government expect to surpass that record and therefore back the innovation we need to equip our force and support our ally 
 i congratulate and thank my hon friend as well as my hon friend   the member for aldershot alex baker for the work that they be do on innovative finance which will help sme in future i look forward to the publication of their royal united services institute report shortly i can confirm that sme involvement in the defence supply chain will be boost by new spending target that i will set in june to produce exactly the sort of result that my hon friend   the member for york outer mr charters   be look for 
 when i speak at the make uk defence summit in derby i meet with lot of small and medium sized business in the sector the issue that they raise with i be echo during my visit last week to a local composite manufacturer pentaxia include access finance to grow and complicated defence procurement process what be the defence secretary do to engage with small and medium sized company to ensure that they can get a fair crack at government defence contract 
 my hon friend know well than most the challenge for small firm enter into the supply chain in defence and she do more than most to champion their case we want defence to do business differently and make it easy for small firm and new entrant to start do their business with defence a big part of that that be why we have announce a new sme support centre a new front door for small firm that can then become part of the defence supply chain unlock new job and put more money in the pocket of worker 
 early this year i have the pleasure of host a roundtable and listen to business in derby small and medium sized business in engineering and manufacturing include the vital defence sector with nearly of government defence spending direct towards business outside of london and the south east we know how every pound spend with uk defence business have the power to create job and employment for local people will the secretary of state therefore outline how the department will ensure that as many sme as possible be aware of government procurement opportunity so that they can deliver job in area such as derby 
 my hon friend make an important point the access of sme to defence be very often through prime and subcontracting rather than directly with the ministry of defence itself it be the certainty of long term relationship and long term contract for the prime that allow they to pass those benefit on to small firm that be why it be significant that when my hon friend join i at the derby rolls royce factory when i announce the year £ unity contract for rolls royce small firm be part of that submarine supply chain 
 i do not wish to end the defence secretary ’s glitter career here on the floor of the house but may i praise he as my new favourite minister alongside the defence procurement minister for today announce the new £ investment in my shropshire constituency for rheinmetall to build a new gun barrel factory i thank he and his defence procurement minister for work with i across party and in the national interest to ensure that the uk have the very late and most technologically advanced challenger tank the good in nato 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that question we will always work across party in the national interest and in the interest of defence i hope he be wrong that do so may ruin my career nevertheless i be grateful to he for notice the £ investment in its telford factory that rheinmetall be announce today that be a direct response to the uk german defence agreement that i sign in october and it be confirmation that this be a government who be deliver for defence 
 somerset ’s defence relate sme help to make the south west the big region for defence after the south east will the secretary of state take a particular look at how sme be support somerset armed forces day they be a backbone of that operation will he also look at the fact that armed forces day be run by veteran and volunteer who sometimes do not receive funding until month after they have hold the event and will he agree to support the big armed forces day in the country which be somerset armed forces day 
 there may be a competition for the title of the big armed forces day event in the country i refer the hon gentleman to my hon friend   the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn i be not sure whether his question be about sme or armed forces day event but i welcome the support that his small firm be give to armed forces day   from the centre we be make sure that we can support local armed forces day event where council and local charity be willing to organise they we be do so right around the country and i know the whole house will back those event locally and nationally 
 somerset be home to many grow defence sector sme such as needles and pins aerospace in somerton which will shortly be open a new factory in the town it have be a supplier of bespoke support equipment to leonardo helicopter for many year what support be the minister provide to sme such as needles and pins to ensure that they can compete for defence procurement contract 
 if the hon lady alert her local small firm to the commitment i have make that next month we will set a target for direct defence investment in sme she will then get confirmation of our commitment to boost this important area of our economy she will also recognise that every more of defence spending we put into sme be worth £ more for those small firm 
 give that at the moment only of defence procurement go to the sme sector i very much welcome what the secretary of state be say about open up that scope do he recognise though that part of the problem with sme get defence contract be not just the amount of money although that be vital but that the procurement portal and process need to be accessible for small business with less of a back room operation than the huge corporation what can he say about that particularly give that i represent a constituency in which the entire economy be sme 
 the new sme support centre which we have announce and will set up shortly will help with exactly those sort of challenge secondly the hon member be right to point to that low level of direct defence spending into sme that be the level under the last government and it go down for every of the year before the last election 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on behalf of the official opposition we send our good wish to the minister for veterans and people   the hon member for birmingham selly oak al carns on his ascent of everest 
 on defence procurement we will all have enjoy the red arrows fly past as part of our ve day celebration but the fact be that the hawk jet need replace give that of the publicly state role of the red arrows be support british industry will the secretary of state guarantee that the next jet for the red arrows will be design and manufacture in the united kingdom 
 as a former procurement minister the shadow secretary of state will know that the replacement of our jet trainer be long overdue he will have hear i say early that for the time this be a government who will look to direct british taxpayer defence investment to british base firm british base job british base technology and british base innovation 
 if he will make it his policy to negotiate a defence and security agreement with the eu

 i welcome the news that the uk be deepen defence tie with the european union include participation in the € security action for europe or safe defence fund however give that france have previously say that it want the uk ’s access to be limit to will the secretary of state confirm what level of access have be agree 
 this be a big step today a broad and bespoke agreement between the european union and the uk on security and defence but it be a step settle the detail and the term of access for european programme include the safe funding programme be exactly the task beyond today 
 before be elect i be proud to serve alongside our european ally include french dutch and estonian force in afghanistan and elsewhere in the face of russian aggression in ukraine it be more important than ever that we build on those alliance to strengthen european security can the secretary of state tell we how we can do more to strengthen european mechanism for security such as the joint expeditionary force to build our collective security 
 my hon friend be right about the joint expeditionary force and he be right to emphasise the importance of the step today while nato be the cornerstone of our european security and recognise as such by the european union in its white paper the   step today will mean that we will be able to upgrade our co operation with the european union on the mobility of military matériel and personnel on maritime and space security on irregular migration and on protect our critical infrastructure it open the door to close defence industrial collaboration include potential participation in the eu ’s € safe arrangement 
 will the minister join i in congratulate the crew of hms dragon which succeed in obliterate a supersonic missile with a sea viper missile off the coast of the hebrides the royal navy hit their target thank to the work of the mod hebrides range will he also congratulate they on their continue work 
 i will indeed we congratulate the crew of hms dragon on their professionalism and skill and they will welcome my hon friend ’s championing of that skill in the house this afternoon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i have previously raise during defence question my deep concern about the possibility that the government would give away our fishing right in order to gain access to the european union rearmament fund but in fact it be far bad than that be not the truth that we have surrender our fishing ground for at least year and will become a passive rule taker and that all we have in exchange be a glorify talking shop with not a penny of guarantee defence funding 
 the hon gentleman be quite right interruption he be quite right in that during the last defence question time he talk about our not be exclude from the security action for europe defence fund that would include eu state i would have think that he would welcome this afternoon ’s agreement because this be the open door to those arrangement let i ask he this do he therefore agree with his party leader who declare before even see the agreement that will be sign today include the security and defence partnership agreement that she would tear they up 
 what step he be take to improve support for veteran 
 early this month the nation celebrate year since victory in europe day and the government announce the operation valour programme a new uk wide veteran support system to ensure that veteran have improve access to essential care and support it be back by a new £ investment start this year 
 the right of the charity ptsd resolution which provide vital healthcare service in our stretched nhs to deliver service that imprison veteran desperately need have be take away in england will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how the mod and other signatory to the armed force covenant can support the case of veteran prisoner and to explain why precious support from a charity have be take away 
 we make an election commitment to put the armed force covenant fully into law and we will do that the minister for veterans and people be work across government to ensure that veteran receive the support they need from all service include op nova which provide for ex force people who become catch up in the criminal justice system i know that i can speak for my hon friend the minister while he be on everest in say that he would welcome a meeting with my hon friend and i will ensure that it take place 
 i take it that the meeting will not be on everest 
 the secretary of state know as well as i do that of the most distressing experience for our veteran today be the fear of be drag into court in the face of politically motivated prosecution after the clonoe and coagh inquiry which open a month ago some action will obviously have to be take to protect they be the mod currently research the legal judicial and legislative requirement that be necessary to protect our veteran from this appalling treatment 
 the right hon gentleman be right we owe the operation banner veteran a huge debt of gratitude their professionalism and in many case sacrifice of their life save civilian life and help to bring about the peace that northern ireland now enjoy in respect of clonoe the right hon gentleman know that the mod be seek a judicial review of the coroner ’s finding and he will also know that i be work closely with the northern ireland secretary to ensure that the welfare and legal support that we have provide for veteran who be catch up in any investigation be reinforce far so that we can protect this special group of veteran from the impact of such investigation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 a group of army veteran who feel totally let down by this government have start a parliamentary petition entitle protect northern ireland veterans from prosecution which have so far amass nearly signature in just over a week assume that they successfully obtain the further that be require may i ask whether we can then debate in parliament the question of why labour want via its propose remedial order to make it easy for gerry adams to sue the british government while legally abandon our brave veteran and throw they to the wolf 
 i hesitate to turn this into a party political debate but the right hon gentleman have just do that he must accept that the previous government ’s woeful legacy act do nothing to help veteran it be find unlawful over and over again and any incoming government last summer would have have to deal with that legacy which be what we be do i be work with the secretary of state for northern ireland i be look to ensure that we minimise the impact of any investigation on this special and unique group of veteran who serve with great distinction in most case to keep the peace secure long term peace and protect civilian 
 labour could have appeal those judgment to the supreme court but choose not to labour mp and peer have already vote for this barmy process in the joint committee on human rights on   february labour will now be expect all its mps to vote for it again this autumn give that many of the young soldier who serve on operation banner in northern ireland be recruit from red wall seat from barnsley to blackpool and from bolton to burnley how on earth do this government expect any labour mp to do gerry adams a favour at the expense of the veteran who oppose he and then to go back to their own seat and look their constituent include veteran and their family in the eye 
 the previous government ’s legacy act have be find to be unlawful time and again we have to deal with that problem and any government would my concern be for the uk service personnel who serve in northern ireland over a period of year who be there to protect the peace protect civilian life and prevent civil war we support anyone who be now catch up in investigation or litigation with welfare and legal support and i be determined that we will protect they far i be work with the northern ireland secretary as part of the plan for replace the legacy act arrangement and we will ensure that we discharge our duty to the veteran who have serve our country so well

 i do agree with my hon friend because under the previous government the average time to contract be year and only out of the major project they oversee be on time and on budget our procurement reform will speed up and improve delivery to the frontline and thus boost our defence and security 
 to encourage more people to pursue a career in our armed force we need to ensure that the whole offer be strong include accommodation concern have be raise with i about poor performance by manage agent involve in maintain ministry of defence property in my constituency often with complex subcontracting arrangement that make it very difficult to hold anyone accountable i know of case where people be deal with a rodent infestation for week due to inaction after it be report to the   manage agent can the minister assure i that we be work to ensure that manage agent be hold accountable by the mod

 that be of borderline relevance but i be sure the minister can respond

 mr speaker i be wait to hear whether the hon lady have get the wrong question but she fit it in and it be in order so i congratulate she on that we be co operate across different european arrangement and our own to ensure we can supply ukraine we in the uk have step up spend £ this year we co ordinate a lot of the uk and european wide effort to ensure that ukraine can stand up to the aggression it still face from russia no matter what president putin or anybody else have to say about it

 the uk and the eu will use this opportunity to explore close collaboration across defence industrial initiative in a way that will support economic growth and job on both side and help to prevent fragmentation across our share industrial base we can now go on to discuss a bilateral agreement to facilitate participation in eu scheme such as rearm and safe security action for europe 
 what financial commitment will the uk have to make to participate in the fund 
 any financial commitment that have to be make will be subject to the further discussion that i have just set out today ’s agreement enable we to discuss bilaterally what arrangement we can make to have access to those programme 
 what step he be take to improve support for lgbt veteran 
 i be sure the whole house will join i on the death of lord etherton in pass on our condolence and sympathy to his friend and family his legacy will   continue to shape an inclusive and fair future for our armed force community the lgbt financial recognition scheme have a budget of £ which be high than that set by the previous government the ministry of defence have make £ available for grant to charity include royal british legion and fight with pride to support lgbt veteran in complete their application 
 of my constituent be out and then dismiss from the raf when he be just an experience that affect his whole life so i be very pleased to hear that last week his application for compensation under the lgbt financial recognition scheme be accept and that he be due to receive his payment shortly it be great to hear that the labour government be get on with the job for these veteran who be so badly deal with by the state but can the minister give an update on the progress of the scheme 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the issue and that case it be vital that no matter who you fall in love with there be a place for you in our armed force i be pleased to announce that since the lgbt financial recognition scheme be launch on   december we have now make a total of £ in payment to the dismiss or discharge to people who be terminally ill or the over-80s who be dismiss or discharge due to their sexuality some application for non financial restorative measure have be receive and be be process the recruitment of the independent panel and appeal board be complete so payment for the lgbt frs impact payment can begin shortly 
 what recent discussion he have have with nato ally on european security 
 what recent discussion he have have with nato ally on european security 
 the secretary of state and i be in regular and close contact with our nato ally on strengthen euro atlantic security last week the secretary of state and i be both in germany discuss close co operation and how to far enhance bilateral defence co operation the secretary of state attend a meeting of the e5 defence ministers drive european leadership in ukraine and next month will meet ally in preparation for the hague summit in june 
 nato have never be more vital for britain ’s defence and security than in this era of global instability and volatility i be therefore alarmed that certain green party politician have suggest that the uk leave nato abandon our commitment to our ally include other european nation and the defence of ukraine and of our share democratic value will the minister reassure this house that this labour government will recommit to work even more closely with our ally for our collective defence and will he confirm that unlike certain other party labour will always put the security of our citizen 
 let i be absolutely clear with the house nato be the cornerstone of our security and this government ’s commitment to the alliance be unshakeable the greens if that be the case would be out of step with the british people who recognise the importance of nato membership we should also be clear that the only person who would benefit from take apart the nato alliance sit in the kremlin president putin that be a victory we will not give he 
 the ukrainian military ’s response to putin ’s invasion have be formidable of the way it have be so impressive be through its innovation in drone technology with ukraine now a world leader in strategic and tactical drone do the minister agree that it be important that the uk along with our nato ally continue to invest in the ukrainian military so that it can continue its fight for freedom and so that we can benefit from the advance in technology that the ukrainian military have bring forward 
 i absolutely agree the uk be co lead the drone capability coalition with latvia and we be improve and learn from the experience of our friend in ukraine drone technology in ukraine iterate every to week so it be absolutely vital not only that we create the environment for new investment in drone technology but that the uk military look at those lesson learn i would expect a large part of the strategic defence review to be look at the lesson that we can learn from ukraine and apply they to our own military 
 unlike certain other institution nato be an alliance of separate sovereign country i thank the minister for his strong support of nato but do he agree that we should follow the example of the frontline nato state like estonia and poland which recognise that the difference between deter a hostile russia and actually have to fight a war be the difference between spend or of gdp on defence as we do in the 1980s and or if god forbid we ever have to engage in open hostility 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that question this government be deliver for defence with increase defence spending by april we will be spend of our gdp on defence which include an extra £ for defence in this financial year that will rise to in the next parliament when economic condition allow what we spend that money on be just as important and that be what the strategic defence review when it be publish will set out 
 at the end of march the us secretary of state tell the foreign ministers of the baltic state that the us want to continue participate in eu defence procurement initiative what have the uk discuss with the eu about any exclusion of us company link to the security and defence pact 
 it be certainly true that right across europe there be european and american firm provide the capability we need to keep our people safe it be right that we continue those discussion with our european   friend to look at how uk firm can participate because uk firm be already present around europe provide resource as indeed be our american friend we all need to spend more on defence and we all need to renew our capability we be work together to ensure that we have the framework and structure to enable that renewal of our force to take place 
 what step he be take to improve armed force housing for military family 
 we be deliver for defence by put people at the heart of our defence plan we have secure a deal to buy back military home to improve housing for force family and save taxpayer £ a day in rent our new consumer charter mean that family will have a name housing officer improve repair and a clear short complaint process our forthcoming defence housing strategy will set out plan to undertake a generational review of our property 
 in december the defence committee find that third of service family home 
 need extensive refurbishment or rebuilding 
 to meet modern standard we know that poor quality housing impact child ’s ability to learn and to attend school as well as their physical health what step be the government take to ensure that the child from service family who attend school in north yorkshire live in adequate accommodation 
 i agree with my hon friend ’s analysis of the impact of poor housing we have regain control of of the service family accommodation unit in yorkshire and humber previously own by annington after a landmark deal early this year as well as save taxpayer rent that can be recycle into improvement that enable we to plan a once in a generation improvement of service family home the detailed plan will be set out in the defence housing strategy later this year 
 what step he be take to support veteran of operation banner 
 the government recognise the important service and sacrifice of those force veteran who serve in northern ireland more be kill during the trouble there than in afghanistan i be acutely aware of the anguish cause to those veteran and their family by historical investigation while the ministry of defence continue to provide welfare support and legal support to those affect i be determined that we will do more 
 operation banner defeat the ira militarily and pave the way for the good friday agreement so why be this labour government now push tier justice to the obvious detriment of our brave northern   ireland veteran and to the advantage of gerry adams and his sinn féin fellow traveller where be the justice in that 
 this government be deal with the woeful shortcoming of the last government ’s northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act as we do so we will give priority to strengthen the protection that preserve dignity and respect for our veteran who serve in northern ireland 
 what step he be take to improve recruitment and retention in the armed force 
 we inherit a recruitment and retention crisis from the last government but since july we have take decisive measure slash the time it take to access medical record from week to hour and restructure the army ’s recruitment organisation and it be work year on year inflow be up and outflow be down the navy ’s yearly recruiting target have be exceed royal air force application be up compare with early and the army be see a year high in application 
 it may or may not come as a surprise to the house that i be once a royal navy cadet i believe that the cadet force be hugely important to retention and recruitment the trouble be get people to step forward to help run cadet force i wonder whether the government will consider some form of inducement scheme to encourage veteran we know that every community have they to step forward and help organise the cadet 
 the hon gentleman be a role model for what someone can do by serve in the cadet force they be a fantastic way of grow in confidence learn new skill and for many young people find a career in the armed force support those people who work with our cadet and help train they be vital we know that there be a huge opportunity in expand the cadet and invest more and that be what the government intend to do

 in my work in the charity sector in harlow i see that post traumatic stress disorder be a huge barrier to not only get veteran into employment but support they once they be in it what will the minister do to support veteran into and in work 
 it be absolutely vital that we support veteran who encounter difficulty in transition from military service to civilian life the vast majority transition successfully but support scheme be available nationwide for people who have serve in our armed force especially through operation valour which be announce by the minister for veterans and people last week there be   more to do in this space i would be happy to arrange a conversation between my hon friend   the member for harlow chris vince   and that minister very soon when he be down from operation mountain goat on everest 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 well as there be no question from jim shannon 
 i do apologise to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon i be glad that the secretary of state be here as we have hear today a very successful parliamentary petition be put up by a member of the public just over a week ago and be support by a large number of regimental association in the middle of last week an email be send from the directorate of infantry to regimental headquarter it say 
 with immediate effect 
 that bit be highlight in red 
 please ensure that all of your communication channel include twitter x etc remove any feed relate to the northern ireland troubles act announcement and any associated petition 
 regimental association be there to defend and look after the interest of and to support veteran it be not for the mod hierarchy to dictate what they can or can not promote particularly through legitimate parliamentary engagement veteran voice must not be silence by bureaucratic interference be it appropriate mr speaker to pressurise regimental association to remove content that support democratic participation 
 perhaps someone on the front bench would like to answer 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise his point of order i be not aware that he be go to raise it and i have to say that it be news to i most regimental association that i know can not be pressure by anyone from outside however i be grateful to he for raise the issue in the house anything that interfere with the parliamentary process be of concern to all member of the house and i will certainly look into it and get back to he 
 may i say thank you to the secretary of state for answer that point of order it save i from get involve but we recognise how important organisation be nobody should be stifle 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement regard the volunteer and care service 
 i thank the hon member for give i the opportunity to speak about this topic and highlight the important role that volunteer play in our health and social care system the nhs have always benefit from the generous contribution make by volunteer who play a vital role in support our patient staff and service we be grateful to the thousand of volunteer who donate their time to support the nhs in a wide variety of role from help patient to leave hospital fast and settle in at home to support emergency cardiac incident and provide companionship to patient during end of life care 
 the national nhs and care volunteer responder programme be establish as part of the covid response and then adapt to respond to other organisational pressure however a model that work well in that national crisis be no long the most cost effective way of facilitate the important contribution of our much value volunteer so nhs england have recently take the decision to close the current programme instead a new central recruitment portal for nhs volunteer will be fully launch this year provide opportunity for the current pool of volunteer responder to continue to play their part volunteer will have have that information email to they recently 
 nhs england will also work with nhs provider that draw on the support of the volunteer responder programme to ensure that they be help in develop other volunteering intervention that meet their service need 
 the role of additional volunteer who be recruit and support by nhs trust directly will be unaffected by the closure of this programme that be in addition to many more thousand of volunteer who support the nhs either directly or indirectly via other local and national voluntary sector organisation 
 successive volunteering programme in the nhs be primarily run locally by individual trust and integrate care system identify the good opportunity for volunteer intervention that meet their specific service need that mean local nhs action to build relationship with voluntary sector organisation and co develop volunteering programme and pathway that support patient staff and nhs service there will continue to be opportunity to strengthen and encourage innovation in nhs volunteering at national level the government recognise the need for sufficient and agile volunteering capacity and capability of support in particular scenario such as pandemic and flu season when the health and care sector be particularly stretch 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question at the start of the covid pandemic nhs volunteer responder be set up to support vulnerable people follow its success the previous government   expand the scheme into adult social care form a joint nhs and care volunteer programme that service have mobilise more than ordinary citizen who have complete more than task and shift include more than telephone support call community response task and almost steward shift i see at hand as a volunteer and doctor during the pandemic that nhs and social care team benefit from volunteer support and i put on record my thank to all those who give up their time to support those around they 
 out of nowhere the labour government have decide to cancel this service at the end of the month no task allocate after   may   will be complete seemingly leave patient in the lurch have the minister think about the real world implication of the additional pressure place on nhs local authority the loss of institutional knowledge and the impact on vulnerable patient what alternative measure be be put in place to support the people who be support by volunteer the minister say that something would be put in place later this year but when why leave a gap the telephone helpline be open only until   may so what happen if people need support after that 
 will the minister explain why the decision be take so suddenly and which minister sign it off the volunteer website say that the decision be take due to financial pressure so can the minister tell we how much the scheme cost what be that cost as a proportion of the total nhs budget 
 the public accounts committee report publish last week on the reorganisation of nhs england be damn the secretary of state say he would 
 devolve more resource and responsibility to the frontline to deliver a well service for patient ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 however cancel the volunteer programme take service away from the frontline this seem to be yet another example of labour rush into decision without think they through properly and yet another promise break by this government at the expense of the most vulnerable people 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the tremendous effort that go into establish the programme very quickly at a time of great crisis and to thank the hundred of thousand of volunteer across the country who take part and step up it be a huge effort to get the scheme run and we be all very grateful for it everyone learn a great deal from that as i outline in my initial response we will be take forward those lesson as we look at the role of volunteer in the future 
 the hon lady say that the change have come out of nowhere they have not we be look critically across the piece as we fix the foundation of our nhs and ensure that it be fit for the future we be look at the most cost effective mean of deliver the same outcome which be why we will be move to a centralised portal for part of this work we have email people about that some people may not have scroll to the bottom of that email where there be an option to push a button to register their detail so that they will be update as new system come online and we can make sure that we do not lose that great volunteering spirit that be about digital technique for the future use the most cost effective mean and develop clear outcome 
 do the minister agree with i that as we rebuild our nhs volunteer at nhs trust will not be use to plug gap in service and staff will be allow to focus on clinical matter 
 i be happy to give my hon friend an absolute assurance volunteer support and complement the exist workforce they do not replace it include volunteer signal a recognition of the important role they play in support staff service and patient many hon member be volunteer and we have all see how those volunteer can support the wide system however it be important that we keep our staff and respect their important role 
 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrats 
 i be a volunteer vaccination steward during the pandemic and the liberal democrats be hugely grateful to the thousand of volunteer who have make a difference to the life of patient and vulnerable people in their community since the pandemic end their compassion and commitment have be inspire 
 we be concerned that the end of the programme have be announce at extremely short notice there will be no further shift in just day time will the minister reassure the house that those currently receive help from the volunteer scheme such as collect prescription or fetch shopping will not be leave high and dry after next saturday have the department conduct an impact assessment if so will it publish it as with so many major decision such as drop cross party talk on social care or cut funding for integrate care board by it be concern that the government do not come to the house to answer question from hon member will the minister reassure the house that these decision will improve patient care and that they be not just a cost cut exercise dictate by the treasury 
 i thank the hon lady for her work volunteering and support the scheme during covid the announcement be about nhs england the organisation will continue to work with the nhs and voluntary organisation to ensure that where people be volunteer that will continue and that volunteer continue to be recruit ahead of a full launch of the recruitment portal later this year on her wide point this government be not drop talk with other party about social care which be be take forward by the independent commission under louise casey 
 i pay tribute to all the volunteer across calder valley and the rest of the country who help with the fantastic vaccine roll out will the minister confirm that despite scaremongere from the conservatives people will of course still be able to volunteer for the nhs and support other 
 this be a good opportunity which i very much welcome to highlight again how important volunteering be to the nhs and the care system it will remain an important part of our plan go forward that people may have have an email and think that something be stop and that there be not more to do but they should ensure that they press that button and   register for upcoming opportunity and be in contact with their local nhs system as i say volunteering be do locally and it be important that we support those local system and encourage more and more people to come forward to undertake this important work 
 i pay tribute to some of the volunteer across my constituency who make such a difference to people ’s life the minister will have notice that polling by more in common today find that more and more people feel disconnected from society that be compound by the fact that so many of our community space be struggle to make end meet as a result of a combination of business rate change national insurance rise and energy price rise those health and care volunteer make such a difference by chat with those who be lonely and vulnerable in my constituency have the minister consider the impact of this decision particularly in the interim period on community such as mine what cost will not have this voluntary service to support people in their time of need drive into our health service 
 i agree with the hon lady about the role that people play particularly by have conversation and connect with people who feel disconnected to be very clear this decision be about particular arrangement it do not mean that thing be stop across our country or with local health system ensure that volunteer be still available we want to ensure that we use that knowledge in building system for the future i be very pleased to host a roundtable with organisation as part of our year plan process there be some fantastic idea and opportunity out there to use the knowledge we have learn particularly during covid to use technology to link with people and to recognise where people be not link by technology and ensure that they remain connected all of that will form part of our future plan 
 before i ask my question i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be an unpaid trustee of helpforce a charity that support volunteering in health and care and work with more than nhs partner to embed volunteering in trust 
 as we have hear volunteer make a huge contribution every day across the country give their time and skill to free up doctor and nurse to focus on their clinical task helpforce run a scheme call volunteer to career which enable people to try out through volunteering before make the transition into a frontline healthcare career do the minister agree that scheme such as helpforce ’s volunteer to career programme could play a huge role in fill some of the vacancy in nhs role and that volunteer will play a central role in deliver the year nhs plan 
 i thank my hon friend for her work expertise and knowledge she be absolutely right she almost pre empte my answer that embed knowledge where it be need in the frontline in our community be exactly what we need to look to do and we need to recognise where we can use volunteer well we have micro volunteer these day which can help people to link in where it suit they so that we can take advantage of people i do not mean take advantage that sound bad we can utilise people ’s opportunity perhaps   they be work different or irregular shift so that they can give more because we know that there be a great appetite out there to support the system more 
 this appear to be another rather muddle decision from the government the minister have acknowledge that these volunteer provide a vital service but if they want to continue they now have the inconvenience of go to the new portal register and so on would it not have be well at least to maintain the current arrangement until a new alternative be in place by the time we have provide extra support to medical professional and so on during the interim will it have save any money at all 
 i be afraid that i have to disagree with the hon gentleman it be not muddle the analysis undertake by nhs england indicate that the current system be not provide good value for money and we be make sure that we produce something well for the future this government will continue to act in the good interest of volunteer patient and taxpayer in set up the nhs of the future 
 i congratulate all the volunteer in my constituency who do a great job do the minister agree that the huge increase in volunteer over the past few year be because the conservatives run down the nhs now they be in opposition they can no long run down the nhs so they talk it down instead 
 well we could—[interruption sorry   the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford   be chuntere from a sedentary position i partly agree with my hon friend yes the conservatives do run down the nhs and we inherit a broken system but volunteering have always be a really important part of the nhs and the care system so i pay tribute to those people who come forward it be both good for the system and the people they help and for many individual we talk early about people feel disconnected perhaps as receiver of volunteering but we know how valuable it be for individual themselves to be give and volunteering and we want to see more of that 
 this closure follow today ’s no notice closure of the special care baby unit and maternity unit at yeovil district hospital and come amidst a crisis in our health service i take the opportunity to thank the hundred of nhs volunteer in glastonbury and somerton who give million of volunteer hour to the nhs but with nhs trust implement staffing freeze to keep afloat there do not seem to be any consideration of the impact that this closure might have how will the government ensure that patient do not lose access to vital support and suffer as a result of these change 
 the hon lady make an important point it be important to make sure that people do not suffer from change and that the impact be minimise as i say the programme be not deliver effective value for money and we think the future system will we encourage more people to come forward to increase the sustainability of volunteering in local system 
 it be no exaggeration to say that during the pandemic thousand of constituent be help out in volunteering role with the nhs and across their community in suffolk coastal will the minister reassure my constituent that those who want to play a part in volunteering can continue to do so perhaps she would outline the step they can take to register their interest 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we want to make sure that people in her constituency and all our constituency who have volunteer or who want to those who perhaps could not at the time but want to in the future can do so those who be already on the system and have receive an email can register via that portal and we will make sure it be easy for people to do so in future 
 i have be remind by a note that people who volunteer in the very early week of the pandemic might have be on a slightly different system from those who volunteer later on so i think there will be a slightly different process for they we do not want to lose they those who have receive an email can register through that portal but we will make sure that more opportunity be available when that be launch and i will be happy to update the house when that happen 
 i take this opportunity to say a massive thank you to all the nhs volunteer across the country but especially those in westmorland it be a privilege to join with they alongside my child actually to deliver prescription during that period but the work of the volunteer in the nhs be not over in community such as mine we particularly depend on volunteer driver to help people in rural community who live hour away from hospital or from doctor appointment as such will the minister take this opportunity to direct integrate care board and trust in cumbria to support those volunteer driver so that volunteer be value and patient be not isolate 
 the hon gentleman make an excellent point on behalf of his community as well as rural community more widely about the role of volunteer driver we need volunteer driver across a range of area in fact my husband be out volunteering as i speak drive for another charity we need more of these people there be plenty of opportunity for people who have time and nhs england will continue to work with icb to make sure we take forward the good of what we already have into the rest of the nhs 
 i thank the minister for her answer so far prior to my election i spend year run a volunteer programme in the nhs include during covid and the covid response we should thank not only all the volunteer who have be involve but those who run the volunteer programme locally local infrastructure be important it be all well and good have a national system but where the infrastructure work well the system work well where the system do not work well it be due to lack of local infrastructure what step be the minister put in place to ensure that local infrastructure can support volunteering and make thing well for all those who contribute 
 i thank my hon friend for that contribution and her service in that role she be absolutely right to highlight not just the people who come forward but the people who run that local infrastructure as i say in my opening remark much of this work be do at a local level the learning we must take from what the national scheme do be how we bring that together in a crisis we want to make sure that the learning be spread across the country and that we can use digital technology and a portal where that suit the many people come forward she be absolutely right about local infrastructure and people to make sure thing happen they be well place to know where the service gap be and where the people be who can support they they provide an important link we will make sure that that be part of our year plan 
 i thank the minister for her answer the importance of the work of the voluntary sector in the nhs can not ever be overstate whether it be those who volunteer to help people find their way around the hospital maze those who provide vital phone support and work within community or the volunteer in hospital radio it be a huge loss and the question be clear who will replace these volunteer and the support they have give which have make such a difference to so many at a time of vulnerability when they need it most 
 the hon member be absolutely right we should be clear that the nhs and the care system need people he be right about many hospital be a maze and the importance of that friendly face to greet someone when they go into hospital they be knowledgeable and know that most people go into hospital not for a good reason so they recognise the anxiety people have when they enter those place we know the cheer that be bring by hospital radio and so on 
 i just gently correct the hon member we be not lose the volunteer this be a change to a contractual arrangement so the volunteer be still there we still want to make sure that they come forward as we have discuss volunteering be more generally handle by local situation and this be about the good way we can get the national system to spread into a local system we need the local infrastructure and we need to keep encourage people to come forward i hope that as a result of this urgent question this afternoon we be highlight the role of volunteer and that more people will come forward 
 i echo the comment make today about the huge contribution that volunteer make up and down the country help and support nhs staff day in day out i declare a bit of an interest as someone who similarly start their volunteer journey with the responder programme and continue now as a community responder with my local ambulance service can the minister reassure i that those who wish to continue to   play their part and to carry on volunteering in other way with the nhs can do so will she join i in take the opportunity to encourage those who be interested in volunteer to check for opportunity with their local trust 
 we be learn so much about each other this afternoon be we not i be pleased to hear that that be how my hon friend start her journey and i be so impressed that she be continue to do that i be out with the ambulance service last week talk to staff who highly praise those community responder the work that she and other be do be valuable and i know she will continue to use that knowledge to feed into the work we want to do in the future 
 i thank the minister for answer the urgent question 
 may i pay tribute to the many volunteer in harlow both those who support people during the pandemic and in particular the butterfly volunteers who support people receive end of life care at princess alexandra hospital i feel emotional just think about that they do we find that it be good to seek volunteer locally in harlow both through rainbow services and through the volunteer co ordinator della nash who be wonderful but who sadly be make redundant by the last government how can local charity and other organisation feed into the government portal once it be up and run 
 i thank my hon friend for what he have say and i thank the butterfly volunteers support people at that really important end of life stage be hard and critical work and i commend they for it the local link be also critical we need to ensure that people can be direct from the national system to local system through nhs england and perhaps if it be appropriate mr speaker through the house it be in the interest of local members of parliament for we to ensure that what we have learn from the national scheme be continue into the local scheme and as my hon friend say we need the local co ordination and infrastructure about which we have hear this afternoon 
 on a point of order mr speaker notwithstanding the response to the urgent question that you be kind enough to grant we still have no idea how long the gap in the service will last or what will happen to the most vulnerable people who be use it what other parliamentary mechanism could i use to secure the answer to these question 
 i think that in fairness i can not allow the debate to continue which be what i think the hon lady be try to tempt i towards what i would say however be that i be sure that the good office around she will give some very strong advice i be sure that the table office and other will be able to advise she on how she can pursue this matter and i be sure that those on the front bench have hear her point of order 
 before i call the home secretary to make her statement i must remind the house that the resolution of the house relate to matter that be sub judice prohibit any reference to case in which an individual have be charge man have be charge with offence under the national security act and the matter be therefore sub judice however since this case concern matter of national importance and it be in the public interest for the house to hear from the home secretary i be grant a limited waiver for the purpose of this statement only to allow discussion of the wide security issue member should exercise a high degree of caution in their remark and take every care to avoid say anything that could potentially prejudice the criminal trial 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement about the charging of individual under the national security act that take place on   may and the further action that the government be take to counter national security threat i want to thank the police and the security and intelligence agency not just for their work on the vital operation and investigation that be currently under way but for the dedication that they show each day to defend our national security and keep our community safe their tireless work often in the shadow often in secret and often in great personal danger be indispensable and i hope that the whole house will join i in pay tribute to their service
