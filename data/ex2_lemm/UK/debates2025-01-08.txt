i pay tribute to my hon friend as sara ’s mp for raise the horror that have take place of course i agree that datum sharing between public authority be vital to ensure that such a case do not happen again but it be not enough and alone it will not prevent the catastrophic and systematic negligence of surrey county council this be the same department that have the high number of statutory breach relate to child report to the local government and social care ombudsman for over year the department cover information up from its own county council and scrutiny committee for more than month and only disclose it when my liberal democrat surrey mp colleague and i publicly call it out 
 surrey county council objectively contribute to the death of jennifer chalkley oscar nash and sara sharif by ignore exist legislation 
 childhood be a precious thing it can shape we or break we too many childhood have be steal by poverty abuser and the inaction of the previous government in britain today child be grow up in absolute poverty more be be place in unregistered child ’s home and it be estimate by the education policy institute that child be miss from the education system although government member seem to have wake up to the evil of child abuse and exploitation they can not deny that their lack of care and urgency on these issue have make our child more vulnerable their failure to act have create an environment in which it be estimate that almost half a child experience some sort of sexual abuse in this country every year and their failure to implement a single recommendation from the jay report have make it easy for groomer in every corner of our country to continue to rob our child of their childhood their future and their dignity that be the cost of the previous government ’s do nothing approach to child abuse and they should be ashamed 
 the previous government ’s failure have also see council struggle to cover the spiral cost of placement in croydon where i be privileged to be an mp the council have have to cough up almost £ to cover the cost of child service with of child there grow up in the shadow of poverty croydon ’s young people have be fail by the inaction of the previous   government it be time to end the previous government ’s addiction to fail our child and support the bill the bill cut the cost of send child to school by introduce free breakfast club and tackle the cost of school uniform it also prevent vulnerable child from fall through the crack by bring in a register of child who be educate from home and introduce a unique identifier so that child be visible across the system 
 the bill be the single big piece of child protection legislation in a generation a vote against it be a vote against child ’s safety their childhood and their future it be shameful that even in opposition conservative members continue to drag their foot on child protection continue to fail our child and continue to put the interest of their party before the good interest of our country unlike the opposition we will not turn our back on our child we will not accept failure and we will finally put the wellbeing of our child 
 child grow up in bournemouth deserve the good start in life nothing less whoever you be and wherever you come from you should be able to go as far as your talent take you and those talent should be rigorously systematically and compassionately nourish for everyone i would not be here but for the teacher of my childhood i thank alan garner and christine moore it feel really weird to name they in full i thank mr garner and mrs moore who do so much to enable i to get here they stay late in the classroom so that i could have a safe warm place to do my homework they inspire i to do well when circumstance tell i that i could not so thank you to they 
 the reality be that for many child opportunity be too often limited and their background can have a decisive impact on the life that they can build i welcome the bill because it will help every child to achieve and thrive at a school with excellent teaching and high standard it will focus on disadvantaged child and those with special educational need and disability in bournemouth we have a particularly significant send crisis the bill will get child ready for the school day by provide free breakfast club in primary school i want to give a shout out to pokesdown community primary school chef russ and ali bayliss be fantastic leader provide nutritious breakfast for young child the bill will ease the financial burden on parent by limit the number of brand uniform item i be particularly pleased about that because only this week i be contact by a constituent richard merghani base in southbourne who raise concern about the cost of school uniform i welcome the government ’s proposal estimate show that it could save parent over £ per child on the back to school shop 
 i want to bring the voice of constituent and local educational expert into this debate i be think of david nayler who have be the headteacher at stourfield junior school for year lyn gaudreau who have be a senior principal adviser to dorset local authority education authority simon adorian a former headteacher patrick connolly a former educational professional and caroline ellis a nursery manager they have inform everything that i would have say if i have long than minute and everything that i will contribute as   the bill develop and pass through the commons i thank they for their expertise and for what they contribute we should really be listen to they not conservative members who have disgrace themselves in this debate and in recent day 
 i thank the government front benchers for bring forward the bill and prioritise child so early in the life of this labour government it feel like unfinished business the last labour government do so much to improve the lot of child and young people we be just pick up where they leave off i look forward to see the bill progress and to the future of all our child be so much brighter 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if he will make it his policy to establish an academy for mathematical science 
 the government be commit to increase the research and development allocation to a record £ in lord vallance continue to meet mathematical science representative to determine how good to support the sector the government be support the mathematical science sector in way that good deliver for the taxpayer without the time and expense require to set up a new organisation 
 in the last financial year the department underspent by nearly £ the propose national maths academy be due to cost just £ million—1 of that total people be disappoint by this cancellation can the secretary of state explain whether he cancel the academy because he do not value the role of our national academy or because he do not think mathematical science be important 
 i have just explain all of the way we be help assist support and drive mathematical science the hon member have just list all of the way his party have fail that sector by underspend in many part of government and fail to commit the spending to the project that he be now call on this government to support 
 do the secretary of state agree that the recent announcement of new funding for research and development in the budget give the sector really good clarity about investment across the come year and about the way forward that this government wish to take 
 i be grateful for my hon friend ’s question he be quite right to highlight that finally science and technology in this country have a government on its side and put their money where their mouth be 
 what step his department be take to protect the copyright of people work in the creative industry in the context of artificial intelligence 
 we be absolutely determined to make sure that copyright and intellectual property be protect as they always have be in this country our consultation be design to do specific thing to make sure there be legal certainty for ai developer and creative industry alike and to make sure there be more licensing of copyright material by ai developer 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer however visual artist earn far below the minimum wage and rely on copyright royalty to finance their work and continue to contribute to our world lead creative industry in thanet and across the country what reassurance can the minister give that the plan for a copyright exception for ai learning will not far contribute to that financial instability and weaken the lifeblood of our creative economy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right she could big up her own constituency a little more because margate be probably of the great centre of artist in this country it be where turner be train and go to school and where we have turner contemporary it be also where tracey emin be do so much work and many other artist as well it be a brilliant hub 
 we want to make sure as we do in the last labour government when we introduce the artist ’s resale right that artist can earn a living from their art that be what we be determined to do just as last year new zealand and australia enter into the same agreement for an artist ’s resale right we want to make sure that there be a future revenue stream for every single artist in this country 
 do the minister agree that transparency be crucial if creator be to understand where their work be be use by ai developer can he therefore assure i that the government will legislate on transparency whatever the outcome of the consultation on copyright reform 
 the right hon gentleman make a good point about transparency which be a key element of our consultation we have present a package because we want to ensure there be a win win here we want ai developer to have the legal certainty that they need to develop their product in the uk as uk producer and for creative industry to know when their work be be use so that if they want to say no they can say no and if they want to say yes they will be properly remunerate for it 
 what progress his department have make on support technological innovation to accelerate nhs diagnostic process 
 my department be work incredibly closely with the department of health and social care and the secretary of state for health and social care and i be join at the hip on these issue that include unprecedented investment in research and development to understand how well to diagnose disease there be co investment in initiative such as health innovation network which have enable patient to access proven innovation and the digital centre of government which we have create be partner closely with the nhs to improve the deployment and innovation of technology 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response my constituency of cannock chase have wide health inequality and particularly high level of respiratory illness and bladder and brain cancer in some part of the country nhs trust be rapidly speed up diagnostic waiting time by use highly accurate ai model with the result check by human clinician will the secretary of state confirm that the government be support such safe tech innovation to help fulfil our mission to build an nhs fit for the future 
 i can indeed commit to that the government see the embrace of prove technology and innovation as fundamental to the future survival of the nhs i be incredibly happy to see that last autumn the royal wolverhampton nhs trust begin enrol patient in a global trial of completely personalise cancer vaccine as part of a £ investment negotiate by my department that show the way forward and how co operation between departments will deliver for patient and public service user across the country 
 early diagnosis save life randox in my constituency run a number of nhs health check from the isle of wight through to lanarkshire will the secretary of state encourage great use of those check and will he visit randox with i to see how we can far advance that technology 
 i confirm that i have be work with the health secretary indeed we recently visit st tommy ’s across the road from here to see how new technology be be use in diagnostic it be increase the number of scan and improve the quality of those scan to diagnose disease early and prevent it from have the bad outcome that be be roll out across the country and i be work closely with the health secretary to ensure that such innovation be put to good use for the country 
 i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 last month the select committee bring festive cheer by hear how british science be advance the eradication of disease such as cervical cancer hiv aids and malaria through innovative and exciting new treatment and diagnostic we also hear about the challenge of drive innovation through the nhs newcastle company amlo biosciences say that adoption be much quick in the us and other criticise bureaucratic procurement process and a culture of inertia successive government have struggle with this challenge so   what specific step be the secretary of state take with the health secretary to ensure that british patient benefit from innovation 
 i be grateful for that question and for the work that my hon friend ’s committee be do to highlight the incredibly important challenge that we face as a government and a country for the time the health secretary have adopt the spreading of innovation through the nhs as a personal mission as part of the role of the secretary of state and we co chair the office for life sciences together our departments be not only seek to harness the power of technology but work together under the leadership of the health secretary to drive that innovation such innovation can not be lock up in innovative health trust it must be put to use across the nhs for every patient from every part of the united kingdom 
 what progress have be make on use ai algorithm to analyse medical image of thing such as tumour fracture or other medical condition that be a pithy question i think mr speaker 
 i be grateful for the hon member ’s question i have visit huddersfield hospital which be of the hospital to fully integrate ai in its radiotherapy and scan work have stand there and see its power for early diagnosis through its ability to detect pattern at an incredibly early stage i be leave in no doubt that have my mother be scan at that hospital she would still be alive today she be scan time but the progress of her lung cancer be miss and she die several week after collapse with it not have be detect this be the power of technology ai be a human power that will transform life and we be determined to ensure 
 order secretary of state please i be sure you want i to get to the other question i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 many of the company i have speak to who be support technological innovation in the nhs and beyond talk about their frustration at the comparative difficulty of get funding in the uk and say that the british business bank could do much more to de risk investment and unlock innovation what be the government do to reform funding and provide an oasis in what have become know as the funding valley of death 
 the thing that we have do be increase to record level overall the government ’s investment in r&d. pioneering work be also go on through innovate uk the advanced research and invention agency and the different funding body that be available to take different level of risk when it come to support create and upscale innovation the work that the chancellor be do to reform our pension system will unlock capital because fundamentally we must get more domestic capital into the venture capital community so that we can get domestic innovation support by domestic capital to upscale and solve the challenge that the hon member talk about 
 if he will take step to help tackle barrier to the roll out of gigabit broadband to rural area 
 only this week we announce a £ contract that will deliver gigabit capable broadband to difficult to reach premise across england and wales we be determined to make sure that in every part of the country include in the hon member ’s constituency we reach all those place 
 i be grateful to the minister for his answer in some village in my constituency such as cannington and nether stowey few than of household have access to gigabit broadband and download speed be among the slow in the country will he advise how his department will ensure that under the new contract openreach fulfil its obligation and my constituent get that fast broadband 
 i commend the hon member because this be the time that he have ask a question of i broadly in this territory in the word of browning 
 hark the dominant ’s persistence till it must be answer to 
 he be quite right there be village in his constituency where there be no proper gigabit capable internet available i be determined to deal with that and i be happy to meet he because in the word of the musical oklahoma i be 
 a girl who cain’t say no 
 i be very happy to meet he 
 i can say no laughter come on 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in employer national insurance contribution on the science and technology sector 
 the government have increase investment in r&d to record level we have also repair the public finance include the black hole leave by the previous administration we have do so by protect the small business through the impact of double the employment allowance to £ mean that employer will pay nothing in additional tax 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response however university which be at the heart of the uk ’s research ecosystem face an additional £ in annual cost due to the rise in employer national insurance that threaten their ability to fund cutting edge research recruit top talent and support early career researcher do he recognise the detrimental impact that will have on research in this country will he explore measure to ensure that our global competitiveness in science and innovation be not undermine 
 we have find way to get new investment into university which we be put on a solid financial footing this be just the start we always know that we could not fix all the problem that we inherit from that last administration in month but we be find way to take that great start forward to get new investment into university i reassure the house that the war on university by that administration have end 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker 
 company like our will be less incentivise to grow 
 that be the conclusion of paul taylor founder of british tech unicorn thought machine which employ more than people britain be now miss out on new job and investment as a direct result of labour ’s national insurance job tax when the chancellor start punish our tech sector the secretary of state fail to stand up to she why 
 we have put the public finance on a solid footing our economy be now stable in a way that have not be the case for year the conservatives want all the benefit of the last budget without say how they will pay for any of it until they do they will not be take seriously by anyone include the business that the hon gentleman reference 
 the truth be that the labour government be fail our tech worker because they do not care about our tech sector last september paul say that he be very keen to list thought machine in london instead of new york and of his precondition before list be be able to grow the business as much as possible why do the secretary of state allow the chancellor to make growth hard for britain ’s tech sector at the budget 
 i think the hon gentleman miss the investment summit that the government hold just before christmas at which a record £ be invest into this country £ of which be ai relate that be almost as much go directly into ai as be commit in total at the previous government ’s investment summit this government be unlock investment the previous administration wreck our economy and public service and fail to secure faith in our economy for foreign company to invest in this country 
 what step his department be take to increase level of innovation in staffordshire 
 in case the house have not hear this government be drive innovation with a record £ of research and development investment for power an innovation lead economy across the uk in staffordshire uk research and innovation be back more than £ for cutting edge research and innovation project a stand out example be innovate uk ’s support for the staffordshire net skill for growth project which be equip the country to seize opportunity in the net transition 
 town such as those in my constituency be key to the economy but can face unique challenge in access innovation opportunity please could the minister tell i how she plan to ensure that town such as stafford and eccleshall be able to access new job skill investment and growth opportunity

 dsit be lead the charge by establish the digital centre of government to harness technology and transform our public service we be committed to improve digital inclusion and accessibility to ensure high quality online service that be available to everyone in the come month the department will outline its plan and priority for a digital centre and to advance digital inclusion 
 sunderland be recently name the uk ’s smart city by the times it be a pleasure to welcome the secretary of state when he visit recently more than home in our city now have assistive technology instal support the independence of old and disabled people and improve their access to care how do the government plan to build on the example of sunderland to improve access to public service across the uk

 what step be her department take to help old people who do not feel comfortable utilise technology to access public service

 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister ’s approach to improve access through technology however the majority of the concern that colleague and i receive be from those who can not use technology rather than improve access for some technology can act as a barrier what be her assessment of the impact of digital exclusion in the uk will the digital inclusion strategy that she have announce include digital exclusion at all level of government 
 digital inclusion be a priority for this government we have set up the digital inclusion and skill unit to ensure that everyone have the access skill support and confidence to participate in modern digital society whatever their circumstance work be ongoing to develop our approach to digital inclusion and co ordinate across departments and we hope to announce more on that soon we will work closely with the sector the industry devolve governments and local authority to ensure that future intervention be target and base on individual need 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we have see fear and lie spread about life in britain with those who have do little or nothing to combat child sexual abuse stretch every sinew to jump on the bandwagon this government be commit to justice for the victim and punishment for the perpetrator of abuse wherever it happen and whoever commit it and i pay tribute to the work of the prime minister and in particular the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips in that regard the illegal content code that ofcom set out last month be the single big change to online safety for a generation 
 in the lords communications and digital committee find that household be without internet will the secretary of state outline how the government be work to ensure that no be leave behind by the forthcoming switchover to internet protocol television 
 the hon lady ask an important question broadcast tv be legally protect until this government be commit to ensure audience can access television in a way that suit they too many people be exclude from digital activity because they lack the basic skill in the not too distant future i will be launch the digital inclusion plan i know that the hon lady take cross party work very seriously so i hope she will meet i so i can brief she on that work and involve her idea as we develop it

 what step be the government take to support pioneer british company such as cranfield aerospace solutions in mid bedfordshire in their pursuit of hydrogen power flight how will the industrial strategy ensure that the uk remain a global leader in sustainable aviation technology 
 the hon gentleman raise a very important point that the government be commit to that be why we increase research and development spending to the high of any government in this country it will have a direct impact on the issue he raise 
 before we begin pmq i be delighted to welcome to the gallery the speaker of the lok sabha of india 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 i wish all member of this house a happy new year our thought be with those affect by the recent flooding we thank the responder who be work hard to keep community safe 
 this week we publish our elective reform plan to rebuild our nhs and end the tory backlog we will deliver where the previous government fail empower patient boost productivity more care in the community and incentivising reform 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 on behalf of everyone in southwark and i hope the whole house i offer the prime minister condolence on the loss of his brother over christmas and i wish everyone a happy new year 
 last july the public overwhelmingly back labour ’s manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl can the prime minister set out how today ’s vote on the child ’s wellbee bill be a crucial step to deliver that promise and protect child without the delay of an unnecessary further lengthy inquiry 
 i thank my hon friend and other colleague for their remark about my brother 
 my hon friend raise a very important issue violence against woman and girl abuse and child sexual exploitation be sicken and many victim have be let down for a very long time by warped idea about community relation and the protection of institution he raise the question of inquiry there have be a number of inquiry both national and local include cover oldham reasonable people can agree or disagree on whether a further inquiry be necessary this morning i meet some of the victim and survivor of this scandal they be clear with i that they want action now not the delay of a further inquiry the jay inquiry the last national inquiry be year a further inquiry would take we to action be what be require 
 but whatever anyone ’s view on whether a further inquiry be need what i find shocking be that anyone in this house would vote down the child ’s wellbee bill this afternoon with vital protection for the most vulnerable in our society i urge the leader of the opposition to withdraw her wrecking amendment 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 the whole house have hear that the prime minister lose his brother during the christmas period so can i offer he on behalf of my party our sincere condolence 
 the new year have start with a focus on the decade long rape gang scandal across the country thousand of girl be torture and sexually abuse at the hand of man who treat they as thing to be use and dispose of destroy many life forever the prime minister mention previous inquiry he be right there have be an inquiry into child sexual abuse but it be not about the rape gang scandal in its page it mention rotherham just once be the prime minister confident that we know the full extent of rape gang activity 
 i thank the right hon lady for her condolence and i thank she for reach out over the christmas period when i lose my brother i really do appreciate that and i appreciate it today 
 on the question of a further inquiry there have be a number of inquiry some of they localise include the mayor of manchester ’s recent inquiry the national inquiry professor jay carry out take year it have recommendation none of which be actually implement by the conservative party when it be in government this be a really serious issue and we must focus obviously on the victim and survivor there be no fixed view on the victim and survivor about a further national inquiry there be mixed view but there be a view and i share this view that what be need now be action on what we already know we already know myself from personal knowledge when i be chief prosecutor that warp idea myth and stereotype about victim be at the heart of this we have know   that for a decade the jay report call for mandatory reporting i call for it year ago what we need now be action 
 what can not be tolerate be the idea that this afternoon opposition members will vote down a bill that protect children—[interruption let i just say this of the provision in that bill be to protect vulnerable child today who be out of school to prevent abuser from ever take those child out of school i implore opposition member to defy the mislead leadership of the leader of the opposition and vote for a really important bill 
 i be shocked that the prime minister would say that action be not take he know full well that we accept of the recommendation from the jay inquiry and go far launch a gang taskforce which find more perpetrator that show that there be still work to be do in rotherham alone there have be more than victim across oldham bradford bristol rochdale and dozen more town there have be thousand more victim but no have join the dot no have the total picture and it be almost certainly still go on 
 victim from telford i know the prime minister say that victim have different view we have different view across this house say that she want a national inquiry because 
 it will hold people accountable in a way that previous inquiry have n’t 
 it be very possible to have action take on more and still have a national inquiry why will the prime minister not listen to victim and launch a national inquiry which would have the power to summon witness and make they give evidence under oath 
 the right hon lady say that the last government accept the recommendation but they do not act on they of the central recommendation be for mandatory reporting and it still have not be enact i call for it year ago opposition members have be tweet and talk we have be act 
 the leader of the opposition have be a member of parliament for i think year and her party be in government for and a half of those year she be the children ’s minister she be the women and equalities minister i can not recall she once raise this issue in the house or once call for a national inquiry it be only in recent day that she have jump on the bandwagon in fairness if i be wrong about that and she have raise it i invite she to say so now and i will happily withdraw the remark that she have not raise it in the house in the year she have be here until today 
 the prime minister be be very specific i have raise this issue i have raise it in speech and i have raise it publicly the prime minister know that as a minister i would not have be speak on this specific issue because i be not a home office minister but let i remind he about other victim who come to i whom i do help the victim of the tavistock scandal come to i as a minister and i do not send they away like his safeguarding minister    i make sure as his labour party be call i transphobic that we launch the cass review which even his health secretary have accept we do right by victim 
 the reason why a national inquiry be important be that this issue be systemic it involve local and national official the police prosecutor and politician the prime minister talk about some of the local inquiry but these interlinked issue can not be cover by local inquiry alone in fact the leader of the manchester inquiry resign because they could not get evidence they could not summon witness and not a single person in a position of authority have be hold to account the prime minister call for inquiry during the last parliament do he not see that resist this mean that people will start to worry about a cover up 
 this be an important issue and we have to focus on the victim and survivor the lie misinformation and slinging of mud do not help they bit the right hon lady raise a victim ’s question and quite rightly too i accept that victim and survivor be in different place on this those i have speak to be worried about the delay of a further inquiry the last inquiry take year which would take we to 
 among the issue that have be raise with i the right hon lady have be speak to victim and they will have raise this with she be that it be very hard for victim and survivor to come forward to explain what have happen to they they do not want to be rush through this process which be why the last take year it be not sensible to suggest that it can be do in a hurry on the cheap and comprehensively that would take we to let we say or the victim i have speak to want action today i agree with they on that but what i genuinely do not understand be why anybody would vote against the child ’s wellbee bill which will protect child who be vulnerable today it will kill the bill it will stop the provision for child at risk today i implore the opposition to vote for the bill do not wreck it in this misguided way 
 it be very possible to have short inquiry especially if they cover area that have not be look at yet we do not need to repeat the work that have already be do let we look at new area former labour mp ann cryer say that there be councillor and mps all over the country who know what be go on but be terrify of be label racist 
 a national inquiry would ask if there be a racial or cultural motivation behind some of these crime where white girl be see as jack straw say as easy meat   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion   be sack from labour ’s front bench for speak out about rape gang do the prime minister now recognise that sack people for tell the truth create a chilling effect that mean victim be not listen to 
 i be very happy to call out anybody who have not act properly in these case i have do it many many time before and it do not matter to i which political party they be in i will call they out and i will condemn they 
 when i be chief prosecutor i take measure to confront this issue head on the of the mass prosecution for an asian gang be in rochdale my team come to see i and they put a number of asian man in the dock they want the green light for the of these case to take place i give that green light but on condition because it come to my attention that of the man who be go into the dock have previously be arrest but not charge i say you can bring the of these mass prosecution but only if you look back at the file”—where we do not charge—“and tell i what go wrong in a report so that i can start to put it right that be what start the reform i bring about 
 that be the approach i take in practice while other be tweet and talk it be the approach i would take now in any case where there be wrongdoing here but what we have get to do now professor jay have say this we have have a number of strong finding there be on the table from professor jay we have get to get on with action do not block it this afternoon 
 we need to focus on what this be really about this be not about the prime minister ’s work in the cps and i would say very respectfully to the prime minister that it be not about you it be about the victim be a leader not a lawyer we know that people be scared to tell the truth because they think they would be call racist if we want to stop this from ever happen again we can not be afraid 
 the labour party have adopt the appg definition of islamophobia the same appg report say that talk about sex groomer be an example of islamophobia this be exactly why people be scared to tell the truth and the lack of clarity mean that innocent british muslims be smear by association that be not fair and only a national inquiry can solve this will the prime minister look again at the labour party ’s adoption of the definition of islamophobia and its chilling effect and rule out introduce it in government 
 i will call out any aspect that have prevent anybody from come forward or any case from go forward when it come to violence against woman and girl child abuse or child sexual exploitation as i have be do for the good part of year 
 yes some people will say there should be a further inquiry i accept that but that mean all the victim and survivor who give evidence need to be in a position to do so and not all of they be i have be speak to they some think they be but it will take time all of the institution will have to give evidence that will take time this will delay thing until 
 we already know what the major flaw be my argument be that we should get on with that action that be why we be bring forward the bill this afternoon 
 the prime minister have effectively tell we that he be not able to do thing at the same time—[interruption this issue of a delay be a weak excuse i would say to he that by refuse this inquiry he be enable those people who wish to smear all british muslims base on the action of a small minority he be talk about distraction tactic let we have the truth 
 the prime minister can not tell the house the full scale of the scandal he do not want question ask of labour politician who may be complicit he will not listen—[interruption he will not listen to the victim who be call for a national inquiry he be make this all about this afternoon ’s bill later today he will tell labour mps include those represent telford rochdale bristol derby aylesbury oldham bradford peterborough coventry middlesbrough newcastle and ramsgate to vote against a national inquiry into the gang that have systematically gang rap child in their constituency this be of the bad scandal in british history—[interruption 
 order this be a very very important issue that matter to the country it matter to all of our constituent and i want to make sure they can hear what be be say by the leader of the opposition and the prime minister 
 this be of the bad scandal in recent british history how will labour members explain to their constituent that obey the prime minister ’s whip be more important than do the right thing 
 the right hon lady be right to say it be of the bad scandal it be terrible that be why i act on it she recently acquire view be that it be a scandal have spend a lot of time on social medium over christmas not once in year do she stand here and say what she have just say not once in year the previous government do not act on the recommendation they want a national inquiry we have a national inquiry the jay inquiry the report make recommendation not a single implement she talk about do thing at once the conservatives can not kill the bill this afternoon wreck the bill and protect child

 if the government do not bring in long term social care reform this year their nhs reform in this parliament will fail so i hope the prime minister will revisit the timetable 
 move on while   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   may miss out on his big allowance from elon musk the spectre of the rich man in the world try to buy a british political party should give we all pause for thought after year of the conservatives take million of pound of russian money will the prime minister now work with we to bring in long overdue reform to party funding so that power in this country lie with the voter not wealthy overseas oligarch 
 i think we all have a smile on sunday when   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   say how cool it be to have the support of musk only for musk to say he should be remove just a few hour later that be the rough and tough of politic of course we be look at the question of fund more generally 
 i welcome the effort this labour government have make to reset our relationship with the european union and to seek   to remove unnecessary trade barrier the trading link between the uk and mainland europe be of particular importance to my constituency so will the prime minister support my effort and those of other kent colleague to restore an international train service to ashford international station to help economic growth in my constituency kent and the wide south east

 i will begin by do something unusual which be to commend the prime minister on his early answer to the leader of the opposition i also pass on my party ’s condolence to he on the loss of his brother 
 outside this place temperature continue to plummet energy bill continue to rise and the winter fuel allowance have be unacceptably take away from so many vulnerable pensioner the prime minister intimate prior to christmas that he have no regret about any of the decision that he have take in office do he understand that the public do 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his condolence 
 we take some tough decision they lead to a budget that deliver the large settlement to scotland since devolution begin if he think we should now reverse that he should say so the money have be give so now the snp have the money the power and no more excuse for the non delivery that we see in scotland if the right hon gentleman want i to reverse that he should say so 
 feel safe in our community be among the most basic of human need but after year of tory cut to durham ’s frontline police after break the criminal justice system too many of my constituent be victim of violence theft and antisocial behaviour and those crime too often go unpunished i know the prime minister have have a lifelong commitment to protect victim what assurance can he give my constituent that our new government will be tough on crime and on the cause of crime 
 my hon friend be right to raise that important issue i have to say when he say that there be cut to police and somebody opposite say boring that tell we everything we need to know about the last year my hon friend be right we need to crack down on those commit vile act in our   community that be why our plan for change put extra police and police community support officer into neighbourhood policing and include a real term increase and tough new respect order where they lose control we will take back control and deliver safe and secure community 
 my constituent dipak open the door to his pharmacy in and he have be serve the chelmsford community ever since greet many of his patient by name however dipak ’s business be struggle his nhs contract no long cover the cost of the drug he have to dispense for example he have sometimes be force to pay over time more than his contract provide for a particular mental health drug dipak be dip into his life saving to keep his pharmacy afloat and i be sure that many other pharmacist across the country be do the same do the prime minister agree that no pharmacist should be force to use their own money to keep their pharmacy viable 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that important and challenging case community pharmacist like dipak play a vital role in our health service as she know the department of health and social care set drug tariff price and regularly assess what pharmacy be reimburse to ensure that overall they be pay fairly if the hon lady be prepared to share the detail far with i i will have a review carry out by the team of the case she have raise

 i thank my hon friend for raise that antisemitism be completely abhorrent and have no place whatsoever in our society i recently meet jewish community leader in downing street to discuss what far we can do to combat antisemitism and that include allocate £ for the community security trust to continue its vital work commit to build a new holocaust memorial and learn centre and provide at least £ to continue the funding for lessons from auschwitz i look forward to work with other on those important proposal 
 business such as hicks in harpenden charity such as the hospice of st francis in berkhamsted and health and social care provider such as the elms medical practice in harpenden be among those up and down this country that be warn the government about the negative impact of the propose change to national insurance contribution when will the prime minister hee those   warning and at the very least look at exemption for health and social care provider as have be do for the nhs 
 we have to deliver a budget to wipe the slate clean to deliver a stable basis for our economy and at the same time to repair our public service that be why we invest £ over year in the nhs include additional funding for gps and hospice we be take measure to ensure that funding be there to support our vital service 
 every week i visit constituent live in the most appalling overcrowded social housing some with triple bunk bed in the bedroom and the parent on a sofa bed in the living room the near available property to buy would be £ and that be out of reach for these hard work family i really welcome our government ’s commitment to new home will the prime minister agree that we need clear target for the number of social housing unit so that family in hackney can live in dignity 
 my hon friend describe an appalling housing situation and that will be familiar to a number of mps on both side of the house that be why we will deliver the home that we desperately need across the country the budget announce £ for the affordable home programme that be hugely important—£100 of which will go the greater london authority we will also reform the right to buy to deliver a fairer well value and more sustainable scheme where long stand tenant can buy their own home 
 over the past year more than £ have be hand to holiday home owner in cornwall through various tax loophole while local family be be evict from their home to make way for yet more holiday home as the housing crisis worsen the cornwall mp be determined to reverse this situation and address the issue before the end of this parliament will the prime minister agree to meet we so that we get the full backing of government and deliver rather than home for the good of cornwall and the isles of scilly 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter we be commit to build those home which include new home every year in cornwall i do recognise the point that the hon member make which be that excessive concentration of short term let and home in place such as cornwall can impact the availability and affordability of home that be why we will enable council to charge a premium on the council tax bill of home abolish the furnish home letting regime and introduce a registration scheme for short term let i be happy to make sure that he and his cornish colleague get the meeting that they want with the housing minister to discuss that far 
 this government be commit to use the criminal justice system to tackle violence against woman and girl but when an abuser can use a child custody battle to continue their abuse as have happen in the case of   of my constituent it be clear that we need to raise the issue in the civil court too will the prime minister please look at end the absurd assumption that a domestic abuser ’s involvement in a child ’s live be advantageous to their welfare 
 yes absolutely my hon friend be right family court must never be a tool that domestic abuser can use to continue their appalling abuse that be why we be expand the number of new pathfinder court to provide dedicated support to survivor and protect the welfare of child we be review the presumption of parental involvement and will set out our position in due course i will make sure that he meet the relevant minister to discuss this far 
 may i associate myself with the remark of the liberal democrat leader and other today i wish a happy new year to everyone but be already prove a challenge for many of my constituent pensioner family small business the hospitality industry gps and social care provider as other have say they know that the snp have fail to deliver for scotland they hear the prime minister when he say that the conservatives leave the economy in a mess and they know that government have to make difficult decision but what they be ask i be when will this government do something positive for they to overcome the negative impact that they be face from the budget 
 i thank the hon lady for her question may i express to her something that i should have express to the leader of the liberal democrats which be our condolence about jenny randerson i apologise i overlook that early 
 the hon lady raise the failure of the snp and the legacy of the tories i be proud that this labour government deliver the large budget settlement for scotland since devolution that mean in answer to her question that worker in scotland benefit from the increase to the national minimum and living wage each year an estimate people in scotland will benefit from the extension of the 5p cut in fuel duty which of course come on top of the £ to set up great british energy in aberdeen it reinforce the point that the snp have the power but have a terrible record and the tories leave a terrible legacy we be get on with deliver for scotland 
 last year this labour government deliver justice for member of the mineworker pension scheme and member of the similar british coal staff superannuation scheme be keen to see their £ investment reserve return to they which could boost coalfield community such as mine in cannock chase will the prime minister meet retire miner trustee and coalfield mps to discuss what can be do for bcsss member up and down the country 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue i be pleased that the increase payment to mineworker pension scheme member be make at the end of november i understand the strong feeling on the british coal staff superannuation   scheme which be why the minister for industry meet the trustee last year we will work with the coal staff trustee to consider their proposal once the new mineworker pension scheme arrangement have be agree 
 we have a chancellor who embellish her cv then we have a transport secretary with a fraud conviction and now we have an anti corruption minister who be be investigate for corruption i know that the prime minister like live in free accommodation but do he really think that it be appropriate that his minister be be give free housing by the political ally of some very dubious foreign regime 
 the city minister have act appropriately by refer herself to the independent adviser we bring in our new ministerial code to allow ministers to ask to establish the fact and i be not go to give a running commentary on that important exercise 
 thank you mr speaker for the help that you have give i over the last couple of day i write to the england and wales cricket board regard the upcoming game against afghanistan on   february and the championship trophy i have meet with the ecb and we be call for the game to be boycott i thank everybody for the support that i have have across this house and in the other place i also thank the prime minister very much for his intervention with the international cricket council yesterday but will he please agree to meet his counterpart in south africa and australia and ask they to boycott the game as well 
 there have be an appalling erosion of the right of woman and girl in afghanistan we should all condemn that suppression of freedom in the strong term that be why we have provide additional aid at least of which will go to woman and girl the department for culture media and sport be in touch with our international counterpart on this issue i welcome the england and wales cricket board make strong representation to the international cricket council on afghanistan ’s woman ’s cricket team 
 set aside the matter of groom gang the opposition amendment on today ’s order paper set out very clearly why the bill that we will be debate be so deeply flawed if it be to become an act of parliament it will have to be completely rewrite in committee the prime minister have make much from the dispatch box of his service as the public prosecutor so could he tell the house why during his time in that capacity he decline to instigate a prosecution for rape and sexual abuse against mohamed fayed 
 that case never cross my desk 
 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 on a point of order mr speaker during an answer about police number the prime minister say that someone on the conservative benches shout boring may i correct the record follow a request from hansard i actually   say bingo because of the repetitive and overused clichés that the prime minister be use 
 you have correct the record i would not have own up in the way you do but there we be 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to prohibit quantitative easing to prohibit the government from indemnify any loss that may result from quantitative easing and for connected purpose 
 the purpose of this draft legislation be to ensure that the state be as economically accountable to the people as the people be to the state that mean terminate the state ’s ability to debase the value of money through practice such as quantitative easing which be not an option for the individual clipping sweating plug and cutting be form of coin debasement either by government or individual the most famous modern uk example be the great debasement between and when henry viii reduce the gold and silver content of coinage by the use of base metal such as copper in order to fund his bacchanalian overspending and war with france it have be a common feature of government behaviour over the year of gold trading history and it continue today in the form of quantitative easing 
 with no gold standard to constrain unproductive investment and direct capital to sound and profitable investment venture policymaker today have become obsess with short term stimulus centre on the performance of stock and bond market central bank have become uncontrolle unconstrained and reckless in their pursuit of deliver non stop unsustainable global growth drive by credit 
 qe be what world dictator use to indulge in shortly before their currency descend into chaos but it have now become a mainstream tool to avoid the darwinian reality of capitalism history be litter with example of government dictator and king abuse their hard work citizen coinage during rome ’s ascendant year be bold large and widely accept but it reduce in size weight and content as her empire wan there be john law ’s mississippi scheme in france in to when he and the duke of orléans who be regent for louis xv preside over an establishment back scheme on the premise that paper money be preferrable to gold or a metal back currency and that share be a superior form of money as they pay dividend it be in essence the national central bank it end in chaotic collapse and it badly damage france and her economy national debt be support by print money in the same way as today through qe via central bank globally i fear that the ending will be the same in due course 
 in weimar germany after the world war the reichsbank have become accustomed to print money to fund the wartime economy increase mark in circulation from to between and state debt rise by time from mark to mark that continue with the value of the mark go into freefall in early and the issuance of note of up to mark before sense return it be a time of moral decline short termism and prostitution that benefit the opportunist not   the long term wealth creator with currency devaluation come a decline in all that have previously be cherish include loyalty faith moral innocence and honour 
 over recent time capitalism in the uk and globally have be undermine as state have grow in size and central bank have distort logic systemic risk management via the clearing bank in the 70 be gradually replace by more overt intervention include by alan greenspan in and in when long term capital management an offshore company be bail out by the us government the year be a watershed moment when gordon brown bail out financial institution at an estimate cost to taxpayer of £ follow by quantitative easing between march and august that be dwarf by the action of hank paulson and ben bernanke in the us in they use $ of intervention to prop up the financial system generally particularly aig 
 during the covid crisis of and when many bad decision be take by an already bloated state between £ and £ equivalent to between £ and £ per person in the uk be spend in a number of questionable centrally plan intervention in rather the same way as early weimar germany britain find itself heavily indebted and continue to run multiple deficit make matter progressively bad our moral decline be clearly evident as true capitalism have be undermine by regular intervention increase state regulation and a grow bloated and inefficient state it be interesting that weimar germany ’s revival start with the dismissal of many civil servant and social welfare spending be massively cut 
 the french government ’s recent funding crisis make it look even more like a national ponzi scheme than in the uk both wing of french politic refuse to sanction debt reduction despite the budget deficit be expect to rise to over of gdp by this year market concern be push the euro low and france ’s borrowing cost high with bond yield briefly surpass spain ’s for the time since 
 javier milei argentina ’s president since have bring significant economic reform with his radical libertarian agenda earn both praise and criticism milei ’s focus have be on cut public sector spending reduce inflation and implement drastic fiscal adjustment which have lead to improvement in argentina ’s economy inflation have fall from nearly to around public sector job have be reduce by and the country have achieve a primary fiscal surplus argentina ’s economy have also exit recession with a growth rate of and borrowing cost have drop signal reduce debt default risk 
 elon musk have be appoint to lead donald trump ’s new department of government efficiency which he will co run with trump ally and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy musk say that the department ’s creation would address government waste and inefficiency trump describe doge as a transformative initiative aim at slash bureaucracy cut regulation and restructure federal agency and liken it to the manhattan project money be the foundation of all human exchange of enterprise and replace barter in the early community it allow for the transfer of skill through a transferable medium such as a coin a note or indeed a transfer by a continuous process of inflation no matter how it be   perpetrate government can confiscate secretly and unobserve an important part of the wealth of their citizen as they do so the size of the state inevitably grow and it become a self serve greedy master of the people it should be serve common sense logic and human relationship among work people be inevitably undermine and there be a general moral decline in society taxis should be transparent justifiable and simple the cost of government should be cover by taxis alone limit the growth of excessive statism gold have historically be the standard store of value and protection against currency debasement for over year it be interesting that profligate government always denigrate gold holding and hold it be often ban by government in crisis who have deceive their electorate 
 the word of president woodrow wilson after he sign the federal reserve act should serve as a warning to all of we i be a most unhappy man i have unwittingly ruin my country a great industrial nation be control by its system of credit our system of credit be concentrate the growth of the nation therefore and all our activity be in the hand of a few man we have come to be of the worst rule of the most completely control and dominate government in the civilised world no long a government by free option no long a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant man 
 friedrich von hayek an eminent austrian school economist say 
 i do not think it be an exaggeration to say history be largely a history of inflation usually inflation engineer by government for the gain of government 
 give the historical track record of state abuse their citizen by various form of currency debasement include qe the default position should be to make it illegal unless this democratically elect house have an inform vote support debasement this bill seek to achieve that position and i commend it to the house

 reading 
 relevant document report of the education committee of session persistent absence and support for disadvantaged pupil hc and the government response session hc oral evidence take before the education committee on   december on children ’s social care hc 
 the reasoned amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition have be select 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 in the week in which we return to this house and our child return to school i be proud to be the secretary of state for education in a truly child centre government the action i take and the decision i make be always in pursuit of what be good for the child of this country and that start with keep they safe after little more than month in power we be deliver the change that be many year overdue no more lesson learn no more paper pushing and no more foot drag it be time for government to act and this government will act with the urgency that our child deserve and our country demand 
 this bill put forward bold new measure to keep child safe these include a new legal obligation for safeguard partner to work hand in hand with education because it be often teacher who see the sign of abuse and neglect a new duty to establish multi agency child protection team because keep child safe be everyone ’s business a new power to put in place a unique identifier for child share information so that no child fall through the crack a new compulsory register of child not in school in every area of england because if child be not in school we need to know where they be and a new requirement for local authority consent for parent to home educate their child if they be on a child protection plan or subject to child protection inquiry i respect parent right to make choice about their child ’s education but child ’s safety must always come and under this government their safety will always come 
 let we be crystal clear a vote against this bill today be a vote against the safety of our child against their childhood and against their future today conservative mp have a choice they can choose to back measure to protect child or they can choose to chase headline they can choose to transform the life of the most vulnerable young people in this country or they can choose to sacrifice their safety for political gain they can choose to show the public that they have finally learn the lesson of their resounding election defeat or they can show voter that they be still unfit to govern i want to be very clear that the conduct of politician be they on the conservative benches or anywhere else who put the pursuit of headline today above the safety of child tomorrow be sicken and shameful a previous generation of conservative politician would not have have the slight hesitation in say that the conduct of today ’s opposition in seek to block this bill be quite simply beneath contempt 
 the secretary of state have mention previous generation of politician and all of we in this house must recognise that we follow in the footstep of giant tony blair lord adonis and other create the academy system that be build on under the last conservative government and bring about a transformation of english education why do the secretary of state want to dismantle decade of work by member across this house and bring about a gross socialist uniformity that will destroy the progress that have be make 
 that be simply a mischaracterisation and the right hon gentleman know it i will come on to the wide school measure in this bill later in my speech but i note that he have nothing to say in his intervention about the safety of child and the measure we be discuss today the wreck amendment that the leader of the opposition have table would block the very important very serious measure that the conservatives have be tell we for day they want to see put in place if they want those measure they need to support they 
 the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart   mention uniformity but the only uniform measure i can see in the bill be about save parent money on uniform bill which i think we can all welcome do the secretary of state agree that the fragmentation of the school system create by the last government lead to many young people fall through the gap which be a huge issue 
 i will come on to the wide point of collaboration later in my speech collaboration across the school system be crucial but my hon friend be right to draw attention to the really important measure in the bill that will put more money back in parent pocket by cut the cost of school uniform and bring in breakfast club in primary school across our country 
 this be child centre legislation through and through legislation that back parent to do the good for their child this government be on a mission to break down the barrier to opportunity drive forward by the plan for change unveil by the prime minister in december the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill be a huge step forward in that journey of reform start with child safety and building from there it be an agenda for excellence for safe and secure childhood because healthy and happy future be build on nothing less it be an agenda for excellence for high and rise standard because we will accept nothing less it be an agenda for excellence for a top quality core offer in all of our school because parent demand nothing less it be an agenda for excellence because every child in this country deserve nothing less that be what mission lead government be all about child centre action across departments between profession and through partnership 
 what matter about family be not the shape that they have but the love they give that be why back in october we announce the expansion of our work on foster and on the trialling of a new kinship care allowance it be why in november i come to this house to set out the big reform of child ’s social care in   a generation it be why this government then back those change with almost £ of investment include the big ever investment in kinship care it be why today i return to this house to cement our reform in legislation and to build a child ’s social care system that be forward look excellence drive and child centre 
 our priority be to keep child with their family wherever it be safe to do so so the bill mandate all local authority to offer family group decision making with the guidance of skilled professional family with child at risk of fall into care will be support to build a plan that work for they we be strengthen support for kinship care so that vulnerable child can live with the people they know and trust wherever that be possible 
 however despite the good effort of all involve some child will inevitably need to enter care so we must reform the system so that it work for they i know that member right across this house share my outrage at the excessive and exploitative profit making that we have see from some private provider it be shameful it be unacceptable and it will end 
 i know that my right hon friend have a good head for number will she be do some evaluation of the cost and benefit of invest in kinship care so that we can reduce not just the cost to the child but the cost to the taxpayer of expensive child social care 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in my time with she on the public accounts committee i learn all too well the importance of those principle the previous government have work under way on understanding not just the benefit for child of stay close to those who can care for they good but the spiral cost and the need to take action however what we do not see from that government be action and that be why we be today make sure that we deliver well for our child 
 this bill give the government through the secretary of state the power to introduce a profit cap provider should take note we will not hesitate to use this power to protect our most vulnerable child child must always have somewhere to live if private provider unexpectedly collapse that be why this bill introduce a new financial oversight scheme to increase transparency and strengthen forward planning child need support when they leave care too so the bill will require all local authority to offer care leaver emotional and practical support through the staying close programme support in find a great place to live support in access the right service at the right time and support in go on to live a healthy happy life 
 the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill provide the safe and secure foundation that all child need and it build on that foundation with urgent reform to all our school so that every child can achieve and thrive that mean school be at the beat heart of their community that be why this bill legislate for free breakfast club in every state fund primary school so that child get a welcoming soft start to the day it mean school where child come together to eat learn and grow it be good for attendance good for attainment and good for behaviour 
 before my election i spend nearly year as a secondary school teacher see at hand the devastating effect of food poverty on child ’s health concentration and academic performance i welcome the introduction of free breakfast club in primary school which will improve child health and learn outcome in england as see in wales however i urge further action to ensure that all child can thrive will the government consider extend free breakfast to secondary school student and will consideration be give to access to free school lunch as well 
 we will of course always keep further action under review through the child poverty taskforce which i co chair the work and pensions secretary we be consider what further action be require to make sure that family have more money in their pocket and can increase their income and will take action the grow number of child we have see in poverty in our country be a source of national shame and conservative members be responsible for that record 
 school uniform be important for build a sense of community but too many family tell we that the cost remain a heavy burden so our bill limit the number of brand item that school can require pupil to have put money back in parent pocket 
 i want child in school and ready to learn and that be why the government ’s plan for change set a milestone for record number of year old reach a good level of development that be vital for give every child the good start in life but that be just the beginning because i want high and rise standard for every child in every school that be of the sure way that we can break the link between background and success for million of child that matter for every child not just a lucky few life should not come down to luck when government forget that it be not the child of conservative members who lose out it be working class kid across our country i know that well than most and i will take no lecture from the conservative party on what it take to deliver well life chance for working class kid 
 report figure for and show an increase in the proportion of child live in low income family and no change in the proportion of child live in absolute low income family do the secretary of state agree that the bill will improve the household finance of family and the life chance of child in my constituency of wolverhampton west 
 absolutely the bill will put hundred of pound back into family finance and back into parent pocket by cut the cost of school uniform and by introduce breakfast club in every state fund primary school however we recognise that there be so much more we need to do because child poverty scar the life chance of far too many in our country 
 could the secretary of state comment on the fall roll in some part of this country particularly london most local authority unfortunately take the option of closing school which be very damaging to child and to local community clause appear to give she some power   of intervention so we could perhaps instead downsize such school which would mean we keep the sense of they be community school that be so important particularly in the poor part of many london borough can she give we some hope that there will be intervention so that we keep community school 
 a number of provision in the bill deal precisely with that challenge we recognise that in london but shortly this will be the case right across our country there be challenge that come with fall roll and make sure that we manage that properly that will require school to work with local council and to collaborate on manage admission and place planning it will also require decision on how we make good use of the school estate that be why we have start encourage primary school to bid to open primary base nursery the recent pilot programme for that have close and we be delighted to see so many application there be also an opportunity to think about use the space that will open up as a result of fall roll to create additional provision for child with special educational need and disability so that they can go to a school much close to home and can go to school with their friend in their local community 
 there have be welcome consensus that a high quality state education should be the right of all child that consensus have help to ensure that innovation from ofsted to the national curriculum and academy have stand the test of time as government of all party have drive reform academy introduce by the last labour government and expand by the conservative party have be instrumental in raise standard in our school system they have deliver brilliant result particularly for the most disadvantaged child and they will continue their record of excellence under this labour government however this consensus must not stifle progress while the conservative party do make some progress over the past year it must reckon with its many failure for example in child leave primary school without meet the expect standard in reading writing and math ten of thousand of child do not secure good math or english gcse in child be regularly absent from school they be unable to learn if they be not there and hold back their classmate when they return there be also hundred of thousand of child in school that perform poorly year after year 
 protect the foundation should not mean that we do not build on they after a decade of stagnation i say a decade because conservative members will remember a time when they have an education secretary who be determined to deliver reform now be the time to press on and once again deliver for our child member will see in the bill a respect for the fundamental twin with the drive to go far and deliver high and rise standard for each and every child we inherit a system that be too fragmented and that too often incentivise harmful competition over helpful collaboration 
 the secretary of state give a lot of important statistic about how our child be develop but their mental   health and wellbeing be also important will she consider a national wellbeing measurement so we can look at improve the wellbeing of our child 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s interest in this area because i share her concern about the grow number of child in our country who be deeply unhappy and the grow challenge of mental ill health and ensure wellbee far too many child do not receive access to timely support and we be look carefully at the issue that she identify 
 on child ’s welfare and make sure that child start the school day in the good position to learn i thank my right hon friend for bring forward plan for breakfast club so that child be ready to learn not only because they have have a good meal but because they be ease into the school day do she agree that that will help young child and particularly kid with special educational need to learn 
 i agree with my hon friend we have be lead by the evidence on this which be clear this measure provide real support to parent at the start of the school day but also deliver benefit for child ’s learning development academic outcome and behaviour i be delighted that in april we will start roll out the pilot across school include school serve child with special educational need and disability demonstrate the difference that this labour government will make to child ’s life chance 
 i be sure that all member of the house share the right hon lady ’s objective of ensure that child get the good education and have the good educational outcome possible but why be she dismantle the infrastructure that have deliver improvement we have specialist school school able to attract the good teacher and school able to tailor their curriculum to their pupil why do she want to dismantle that if she want to improve educational standard 
 that be just not the case i invite he to read the bill and i will come on to further measure that we be propose 
 if we believe that every child deserve the good that every classroom deserve a top teacher and that every state school must be a great school we can not have excellence for some child and just fine or okay for the rest we need all school work together to deliver a national high quality core offer for all child and to have the flexibility to innovate beyond that so that parent know that wherever they live and whatever their local school this government be their child ’s great champion the good school and trust do incredible work day in day out and i pay tribute to they they be engine of innovation and civic leader and collaboration and improvement be central to their success they prove that excellence already exist in the system and it be time to spread it to all school 
 that do not mean no competition competition can be healthy and a spur to excellence but competition that encourage school to hoard good practice or to export problem to other must be replace by collaboration   and by school work together to solve problem and put child i do not just mean collaboration within trust true collaboration also look outward so that there be school drive by a share purpose embed in community our vision twin that deep collaboration with healthy competition so that every child in every school can benefit from good practice 
 the bill bring reform it demand high and rise standard across the board we will restore the principle establish by the noble lord baker which be that every child will benefit from the same core national curriculum follow the curriculum and assessment review the national curriculum be a conservative achievement i benefit from it and this labour government will bring that legacy back for every child give every parent the confidence in standard that they deserve every child will be teach by an excellent qualified teacher who have undertake statutory induction that will be support by give every school the flexibility to create attractive pay and condition offer to recruit and retain excellent teacher and by back those school already do that to keep it go 
 i agree as would all member that we want excellent standard for all school idea that the conservative government have be that if a school be fail new management would go in to increase standard yet the secretary of state want to dismantle that i would call that vandalism of our education system 
 no i invite the right hon lady to look carefully at the measure in the bill we will not hesitate to intervene in fail school indeed we will intervene a lot soon than the conservatives do in school that be coast those school that fall short of the statutory level of intervention will see regional improvement team in their school drive up standard 
 where there be failure in the system or where school be not deliver the standard that every child deserve we will act that action will always be guide by what be good for the child in those school that may well be academisation or it may be target intervention to drive change in practice and drive up standard rather than to change the structure the bill will convert the duty to issue academy order into the power to well deliver high and rise standard for all child strengthen the range of way through which failure can be tackle there can be no excuse for fixate on structure and not on standard because what matter be what work
