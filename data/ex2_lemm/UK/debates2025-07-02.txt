whenever my right hon friend and other member of the conservative shadow defence team bring up the question of reopen this lawfare against our veteran government ministers say we will be sure to give veteran maximum support to i that imply not protect they from the lawfare but support they as they go through the process but the process be the punishment everybody know that people involve in fatal accident would serve only a limited prison term if heaven forbid they be convict but the probability be that they will not be convict the punishment lie in what they have to go through before they be acquit 
 year ago a human right barrister stand in court and defend an activist who break into raf fairford try to disable a bomber to prevent war crime in iraq that become a landmark case in lawful non violent direct action against an illegal war that barrister be now our prime minister sir keir starmer kc he argue that it be not terrorism but conscience 
 fast forward to   june palestine action activist enter raf brize norton and spray red paint red paint not fire on aircraft link to surveillance flight over gaza instead of prosecute they for criminal damage which be what normally be do the home secretary be use the terrorism act to proscribe palestine action as a terrorist group this be an unprecedented and dangerous overreach of the state never before in britain have it be a crime to simply support a group 
 this order lump a non violent network of student nurse teacher firefighter and peace campaigner ordinary people my constituent and your with neo nazi militia and mass casualty cult palestine action ’s real   crime be we have to be clear shut down elbit systems site that arm the israeli military its true offence be be audacious enough to expose the blood soak tie between this government and the genocidal israeli apartheid state and its war machine 
 let we be clear to equate a spray can of paint with a suicide bomb be not just absurd it be grotesque it be a deliberate distortion of the law to chill dissent criminalise solidarity and suppress the truth amnesty international liberty over senior lawyer and un special rapporteur have all oppose these draconian measure even at this late stage the order should be withdraw 
 under this order anyone express moral support for a proscribe group could face year in prison that include wear a badge wear a t shirt share a post or call for de proscription and journalist have no exemption either there be no legal protection for report favourably even factually about palestine action by this weekend million of people include many of our constituent could be place under these sweeping restriction 
 let we not forget what be happen in gaza where the real crime be be ignore hospital bomb child starve and ten of thousand of people kill palestinian child now suffer more amputation per capita than child anywhere else on earth israel be on trial for genocide at the international court of justice and the israeli prime minister face an international criminal court arrest warrant yet the government ’s response be to criminalise solidarity and to continue export lethal f-35 jet that be decimate gaza 
 we also have to understand the history of this country and what build our democracy the tradition of civil disobedience that include the suffragette without whom i would not have the vote let alone the privilege of be here as an mp 
 even those who oppose palestine action ’s tactic must recognise the vast gulf between criminal damage and terrorism if this order pass what and who be next climate protester strike worker feminist in the street already we have see a wide crackdown on our civil liberty musician censor journalist arrest and demonstrator include mp sit here harass and now this government want to use anti terror law to make peaceful protest itself a crime if our democratic institution function as they should none of this would be necessary 
 to conclude if this proscription pass as it will we have to understand that no campaign will be safe tomorrow we have to recognise that this will go down as a dark day in our country ’s history and that will be remember people will ask which side be you on and i stand with the million of people who oppose genocide because i be of they i oppose the blood soak hand of this government try to silence we so i say this loudly and proudly on   wednesday july we be 
 order 
 we be all palestine 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the adequacy of the a75 and a77 road lead to cairnryan ferry port on the northern ireland economy 
 the union connectivity review recognise the importance of the a75 and a77 road for passenger and freight between northern ireland and great britain the government have therefore allocate up to £ to support a feasibility study into bypass option for the a75 and have also encourage the scottish government to improve the a77 
 there can not be a person in northern ireland who have not either be along the a75 or the a77 or have something deliver to they that have be drive through the ferry port at cairnryan we in dumfries and galloway and people across scotland know that these be the highway from hell this morning even as we speak the a75 have be close by another overturn lorry we be cry out for improvement can i count on the support of the might of the northern ireland office to get the department for transport here to engage as well as the scottish government 
 i echo the hon gentleman ’s point have drive along the road myself my note helpfully say that average speed on the a75 and a77 be low than on several other scottish trunk road you can say that again i think that the secretary of state for scotland have write to he and offer a meeting to discuss the issue we all want to see the road improve 
 to the a75 and the a77 add the a9 which be the link from the highlands to scotland for year we have be wait for it to be dualle the snp have fail to do that the scottish government can not make the ferry work and they can not make the road work can the secretary of state push they into action 
 i have many and varied responsibility but i be not aware that the a9 be of they i hope that the scottish government will have hear my hon friend ’s strong plea 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland 
 the government ’s new strategic partnership with the eu will deliver a broad range of economic benefit for northern ireland   in particular a new agreement on agrifood and plant will far smooth trade flow across the irish sea   protect the uk ’s internal market reduce cost for business and improve consumer choice in northern ireland 
 i be pleased that the agreement secure with our large trading partner the european union will make it easy for food and drink to be import and export will the secretary of state assure i and my constituent that all future conversation with trading partner will continue to prioritise high welfare standard and food standard on both side of the irish sea 
 i can happily give my hon friend that assurance he will have notice how in another context the trade agreement reach with the united states of america we say that we would uphold our food standard in that agreement and that be exactly what we have do 
 which of the sanitary and phytosanitary and agrifood requirement do the secretary of state expect to be remove on good move from great britain to northern ireland as a result of the sps agreement with the eu 
 once we have negotiate the legal text and put our rulebook in line with current european arrangement there will be no need for sps paperwork no mandatory identity check or physical check on good move no need for northern ireland plant health label an end to the ban on chill frozen meat move an end to the ban on movement of product of animal origin import to gb and then move to northern ireland and no onward paperwork or check on agrifood move for onward processing that be why the sps agreement in outline have be so widely welcome in northern ireland 
 i be pleased to say that the propose sps agreement have be welcome by the welsh farming community include those in my constituency of clwyd east that be alongside the ulster farmers union the federation of small businesses the cbi the horticultural trades association supermarket include asda m&s and iceland and many other do the secretary of   state agree with i and with they that an sps agreement would bring huge benefit for wales northern ireland and the rest of the uk 
 it certainly would it be a rare agreement that invite so much praise certainly across the range of opinion in northern ireland we all want to see it progress as quickly as possible so we have get to turn it into a legal text and sort out our own legal rulebook the benefit will then flow for business right across the united kingdom 
 the windsor framework be cause untold damage to business in northern ireland it cost of my local business £ to bring a box of simple tie from gb to northern ireland because of the parcel border and use farm machinery be now subject to eu import procedure with some have be turn back from the port to scotland in recent day the late fsb report confirm that small business be be hard hit with red tape cost and uncertainty will the secretary of state accept that the reset be not help the here and now will he commit to meet these industry and help to sort out practical solution 
 on the agricultural machinery point that the hon member raise if the machinery be come into and stay in northern ireland it can be bring in subject to cleaning with a plant health label that be relatively straightforward only if it might move into ireland would it need to go through the red lane i will make this general point in northern ireland purchase of good from the rest of the united kingdom rise by and northern ireland be the fast grow region in the uk 
 with regard to agricultural machinery i be sure that the secretary of state be aware of a northern ireland farmer who take agricultural machinery from northern ireland to participate in a scottish agricultural show on bring it back it be reject in northern ireland and send back to scotland because there may have be soil on the underside of a piece of agricultural equipment do the secretary of state really think that that make common sense 
 it be the requirement of the windsor framework which the last government negotiate to address the basic problem of have different system and an open border everybody know that agricultural machinery need to be properly clean if that be the case and the appropriate label which be straightforward be apply there be nothing to stop the machinery move back to northern ireland 
 if the reset deal be suppose to bring an end to the sps check when will the custom post which be there for the purpose of carry out those check be demolish instead the secretary of state willingly preside over the ever tighten eu noose on our economy with agricultural machinery be the late that have to kowtow to eu diktat meanwhile trade diversion be rampant and the secretary of state look the other way when will he stop act as the secretary of state for the eu and start act as the secretary of state for northern ireland 
 i do not accept the hon gentleman ’s characterisation at some point he have to acknowledge that follow our departure from the european union this be the issue that the previous government have to address the united kingdom have set of rule the eu have another and there be an open border how do we deal with that i be afraid that on mutual enforcement the only idea i have ever hear he put forward be not a practical proposition he need to take some responsibility for the consequence of his own argument 
 the eu uk deal be warmly and broadly welcome across northern ireland to begin to unpick and undo some of the damage and friction create by brexit which be champion by some of those on the opposition benches however an fsb report out this week highlight continue problem particularly for small business will the secretary of state reassure business that there will be co design and full consultation as the text and the outworking of that very positive deal be bring through 
 we will continue to consult as widely as possible in take forward the agreement that have be reach and outline with the european union there be help available for small business it be important that it be as effective and easy to understand for those who seek to trade i will look carefully at the report that the fsb have produce 
 regard the eu trade agreement what barrier be the secretary of state aware of that currently hinder free and unfettered trade from northern ireland within the uk what be the timescale for their removal 
 good flow freely from northern ireland to the rest of the united kingdom far of the great advantage of the trade agreement that have be negotiate with india the united states of america and the european union be in the case of india a significant reduction of tariff on whisky which will benefit producer in northern ireland and be able to sell lamb into india the deal with the united states of america will allow northern ireland farmer to sell their beef 
 i call the shadow minister 
 contrary to what the secretary of state have just tell the house week ago the federation of small businesses in northern ireland publish a report suggest that a of small business that move good between great britain and northern ireland have cease supply customer or partner either in great britain or in northern ireland under the northern ireland protocol if the uk experience diversion of trade we be entitle to take unilateral action to safeguard our internal market will the secretary of state tell the house whether he think that a of small business cease trade in that way amount to a diversion of trade if not perhaps he could tell we what would 
 there be other small business that be able to trade perfectly—[interruption the point that the hon gentleman need to recognise be that if some small business manage to move their good   from gb to northern ireland other can do so in the end it be a decision for an individual business where it choose to sell its good it be the windsor framework that apply now not the northern ireland protocol and i think he will accept that the windsor framework represent a significant improvement on what be there before 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the federation of small businesses have warn that small and medium sized enterprise in northern ireland continue to face disruption under the windsor framework and more importantly and sadly that the government have fail to effectively communicate the suppose benefit of dual market access so far if dual market access be indeed a competitive advantage as so many people across this house think it can and should be can the secretary of state specifically identify what concrete benefit it be provide to northern ireland business right now how do he respond to the grow criticism from firm across the uk who be burden with red tape and the fog of uncertainty 
 i be interested by that observation in the fsb report because as the house will testify i spend a lot of my time extoll the virtue of the dual market access that northern ireland have as a result of the windsor framework i meet company as i travel around northern ireland who tell i about the benefit of it that they be feel i think we all have a responsibility to extol the virtue of dual market access because in my experience if business can see an opportunity that allow they to sell more product they will seize it with both hand 
 what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland 
 i take every opportunity to promote investment into northern ireland and our tech company in particular i recently speak at the big data conference in new york and at london tech week to highlight our cutting edge company in northern ireland   i hold a roundtable with tech business leader and visit catagen in belfast just last week to talk about the industrial strategy and the way that we can boost investment and growth 
 i wonder if the minister might outline the many good reason for technology company to invest in northern ireland and tell we what she have do to promote that great opportunity 
 i welcome the opportunity to promote northern ireland ’s tech company here in the chamber today more than international company have set up operation in northern ireland they tell i that this be due to the government support the strong working between the government and the executive the dual market access the unique concentration of tech company the academic support from ulster university and queen ’s university and above all the people northern ireland have a workforce with industry ready skill and innovation in their dna 
 do the minister agree that the strength of northern ireland ’s tech sector mean that it can play a huge part in become an ai superpower support by this government however as we have hear in the northern ireland committee chair by my hon friend   the member for gower tonia antoniazzi there be a huge link between online safety and the rate of domestic abuse that we be see in northern ireland can the minister comment on how we can support and develop the sector while keep woman and girl safe 
 we know that violence against woman and girl be an epidemic and online safety be an important part of that couple with northern ireland be an ai superpower as my hon friend rightly say there be opportunity for ai company many of which i have meet to work on the tech to ensure that perpetrator be catch that justice be do and that we ensure that online safety be take extremely seriously the work that will be do in the industrial strategy to promote ai work with the new ai growth zone for example can ensure that we lock that in 
 tech business be huge in my central london constituency and i recognise that for the uk to do well we need london to continue thrive and for northern ireland and the rest of the country to succeed too can the minister assure i that the full benefit of the new industrial strategy will support company in northern ireland and that this government be generate business opportunity in every corner of the united kingdom 
 the industrial strategy be good news for northern ireland it be a bold long term plan to give business and investor the certainty they need to thrive the sector of the strategy map well with northern ireland ’s world class strength include advanced manufacturing cyber defence the creative industry life science and financial service for each of those there be increase uk wide funding opportunity and in northern ireland specific fund on cyber security advanced manufacturing and the £ of that all important r&d investment for innovation 
 i thank the minister for her response so far northern ireland be indeed open for business and i be delighted that company be invest in my hometown do she agree that the dublin to belfast economic corridor which include my constituency of lagan valley will play a key part and that it be a huge opportunity for investment 
 belfast be already at the heart of the uk ’s industrial strategy on cyber and tech and be lead the world the government have a bold vision to be by of the top place in the world to invest create and scale up a tech business belfast and the growth and city deal which be at the heart of that be an important part i have meet business across belfast and northern ireland that be lead on this and it be exciting to see 
 do the minister accept though that poor road access from the north of the united kingdom be impediment to investment in northern ireland and therefore another reason why we should see the a75 upgrading 
 the secretary of state have already answer the question on the road it be important that we look at and address all part of the infrastructure that be hold northern ireland back in any way 
 tech business in northern ireland could take advantage of a heathrow logistic hub ballykelly in my constituency have a large available land base a seaport close by an airport next door to it and a railway line that run through it do the minister think that be an excellent location for such a hub and tech business 
 the hon member be an excellent representative for his constituency and the opportunity there i be sure his plea and bid have be hear 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 as chair of the select committee and the itv all party parliamentary group last night we host an event in parliament with itv and utv there what conversation be the minister have with public sector broadcaster like itv about future investment in northern ireland 
 many different type of business not only public sector broadcaster but tech company fintech cyber security and advanced manufacturing such as catagen which i meet last week be all part of the strong ecosystem in northern ireland the fact that broadcaster can talk to advanced manufacturer which can talk to other make northern ireland such a fantastic place to invest in and i be glad that that be be highlight in the house of commons today 
 britain lead the world in the gene editing of crop this technology enable our farmer to produce disease and drought resistant crop reduce cost and increase food production the uk eu trade agreement mean britain have to follow eu rule on sanitary and phytosanitary law will the minister give the house an assurance that the agreement will not slow that technology in britain 
 that be why the secretary of state have be extoll and make clear how important the sps agreement be we be not take our foot off the pedal in any way towards that it be not only agri science but life science that be lead the way for northern   ireland and the uk and across the world we want to ensure that we continue to support they in every way we can 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the adequacy of the level of funding for northern ireland in the spending review 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the adequacy of the level of funding for northern ireland in the spending review 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the adequacy of the level of funding for northern ireland in the spending review 
 i regularly meet the northern ireland finance minister to discuss funding the government will provide northern ireland with a record settlement of £ per year on average the large in the history of devolution and the executive will also continue to receive over more per person in line with their independently assess level of need 
 do the secretary of state agree that record funding for northern ireland through the spending review reflect this government ’s broad commitment to fair funding across the uk include in area like cornwall where rurality seasonal pressure and historical underfunding be finally be recognise and that many in cornwall would welcome the opportunity to far shape our own future through a level of devolution close to that enjoy in northern ireland 
 the spending review settlement do indeed reflect the government ’s commitment to provide resource right across the united kingdom a year ago people be say there be go to be a fiscal cliff edge but the money be make available for northern ireland mean that no be say that now 
 thank you for call i mr speaker—[interruption 
 order there be no need to run through the chamber mr morgan that be in very bad taste 
 i apologise mr speaker 
 local growth funding have provide vital investment for many community across northern ireland in recent year will the secretary of state confirm that the new local growth fund will give sector across northern ireland the long await security they need 
 my hon friend will have notice the funding make available for local growth as part of the spending review discussion on the fiscal framework will be take forward by the chief secretary to the treasury and the department of finance to talk about thing like the holtham review and capital borrowing by the northern ireland housing executive 
 whether it be stoke on trent in the west midland or the proud community in northern ireland the spending review anticipate help to create good job and industrial improvement will the secretary of state set out how the spending review will help to improve the industrial base in northern ireland 
 the spending review give the northern ireland executive more fund to disperse as they see fit it come alongside the publication of the industrial strategy the fund that the government be make available and the £ that will come to northern ireland through uk research and innovation there be fund available and there be great wealth talent and potential in northern ireland to make the good use of it 
 what assessment have the minister make of the impact of barnett fund on health in northern ireland give that the northern ireland department of health ’s financial bid fall below request and require level each year it be important that we have fund for health so will the secretary of state outline what that will be 
 the government make funding available to the northern ireland executive through the block grant as the hon gentleman will know it be for the northern ireland executive to decide how they distribute the money between all the need in northern ireland include health where of course there be significant pressure the public service transformation fund that the last government make available be now begin to be use to reform some of the way in which the health service work 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the spending review settlement for the northern ireland office explicitly cover the finucane inquiry but so far the government have refuse to say how much money have be set aside for that inquiry will the secretary of state please tell the house how much do the government expect the inquiry to cost 
 the finucane inquiry be begin its work it will publish as be normal statement of the expenditure that it engage in it depend how long the inquiry last and how much evidence be take but the hon gentleman can rest assure that he will receive an answer in due course as that process unfold 
 the government have just have a spending review so they must know how much they intend to spend there will be a line in the treasury account set aside for the finucane inquiry i do not understand why the secretary of state find it so hard to tell the house how much we expect to spend 
 similarly the government must know how much compensation they expect to pay gerry adams follow their inexplicable decision to drop the appeal that we lodge in that case we have repeatedly press the government to legislate to prevent that compensation from be pay and the government have drag their heel this morning policy exchange have publish an excellent new report legislate about gerry adams   and carltona which set out a clear legal solution the government have nowhere far to hide so will they finally do the right thing 
 the hon gentleman need to keep up i answer a parliamentary question yesterday in which i make it clear that we will deal with this issue which arise because of the application of the carltona principle in the supreme court judgment of which the last government could not sort out in and a half year we will deal with it in our forthcoming legislation and i will keep the house update 
 i commend the secretary of state for at least answer a question yesterday despite it be a day when the labour government be prepared to take money out of the pocket of the most vulnerable they at least have the courage to stand forward and say that gerry adams would get none so i thank the secretary of state for that i also advise he not to ignore the warning of the federation of small businesses which in its report be explicit that the windsor framework be fracture the united kingdom ’s internal market that be a cause for concern when we be talk of the spending review week ago he be ask whether the financial transaction capital be make available to casement park be additional he know that the blue book have a flat line for the next year so what be the answer 
 the answer to the right hon gentleman be that it be additional 
 the secretary of state know that the blue book have a flat line for the next year talk of economic growth let i say he also know that there be a commitment to an enhanced investment zone in northern ireland when do he believe the business of northern ireland will benefit from that 
 if the right hon gentleman just bear with we i hope we can see progress on that in the not too distant future

 let i start by say that free school meal matter on this side of the house in relation to welfare what we deliver last night be a bill that end mandatory reassessment of those with severe disability that be the right thing to do it rebalance universal credit that be long overdue and it set out a pathway to reform of the personal independence payment it be consistent with the principle i set out   throughout if you can work you should work if you need help into work the state should provide that help the system that the conservatives break do not do so and if you can not work—[interruption 
 order there be or member who i can spot immediately the usual voice the same name please it be too early to leave the chamber 
 if you can not work you must be support and protect the reform welfare system that we be put in place will be well for individual well for the taxpayer and well for the economy 
 i do not think the prime minister actually watch what happen in the house yesterday his bill be completely gutte there be a u turn in the middle of the debate remove clause where on earth be he he can not answer the question because he know his bill do not save any money it be go to cost million this be the prime minister in history to propose a bill to save money who end up with a bill that cost money if the bill do not cut welfare spending can the prime minister tell the house how many people it will get into work 
 i be glad that the leader of the opposition have ask that because it give i the opportunity to say that we have already start change the jobcentre and invest in support back into work the trailblazer scheme be do exactly what she ask i get people back into work last night ’s bill will help people back into work and of course the timms review be ongoing but i will tell the house what will not help people back into work and what will not help control the cost vote to keep the broken system and that be what the conservatives do last night everybody in this house accept that the current system be break it invite the question who break it the conservatives break it and last night they vote for the status quo the broken system be their policy that will not help individual it will not help the taxpayer and it certainly will not help the economy 
 i will tell the prime minister what we do on welfare interruption why be labour member laugh they do not know my party deliver the big reform of welfare in government we get record number of people into work include million of disabled people and we cut the deficit every year until covid the fact be that we be not scared of do difficult thing we get people back into work what the prime minister forget be that since the election since he become prime minister an additional people a day be sign on to incapacity benefit that be more than under we 
 astonishingly because of the mess that the government make yesterday because there be no more saving sickness benefit alone be set to rise to £ on the prime minister ’s watch he can not reduce that now—[interruption 
 order mr mckee i think we have have a run in before i certainly do not want any more seriously you be obviously not get your timing right because i can hear your voice every time 
 i will start again mr speaker interruption yes and louder for those at the back sickness benefit be set to rise to £ because of the government ’s mess they can not now reduce that because after last night ’s humiliating u turn we know that the prime minister can not control his mp they be cheer now but i can point out labour members who sign the amendment you do and you do over people sign that reason amendment until the bill be completely gutte the prime minister say that he would take the difficult decision but be the reality not that he be too weak to get anything do 
 i will tell the right hon lady what the conservatives do to the welfare system they break it it be the same with the nhs what do they do they break it it be the same with the economy what do they do they break it they break everything that they touch now she describe the broken system that we be try to fix what do she do she vote against fix the system i will spell it out they vote last night for the system that be keep young people not learn or earn that be a disgrace they vote for a system where we have people out of work on ill health they vote for that system we be fix it we be clear up the mess that they leave just like we be clear up the nhs and the economy 
 the prime minister have get some brass neck have he read the paper this morning that bill will achieve nothing it be a pointless waste of time and it be absolute proof that he do not have a plan let i tell the house what be go to happen in november the chancellor be go to put up our taxis to pay for the prime minister ’s incompetence we on the opposition benches know that you can not tax your way to growth—[interruption these be the same member who cheer when they talk about the national insurance rise the job tax why be they complain now people out there be frightened can the prime minister reassure they by rule out tax rise in the autumn budget 
 the right hon lady know that no prime minister or chancellor ever stand at the dispatch box and write future budgets that be not what the conservatives do and it be not what we be do and she know it she talk about growth but for year we have stagnation and that be what cause the problem i be really pleased to show the progress that we be make and i can update the house last week amazon put £ of investment into this country of the big investment of its type that bring inward investment to £ in the year of this labour government i can also tell the house that business confidence be the high for year that be long than the whole time that the leader of the opposition have be in parliament figure this week have also demonstrate and show that we have the fast growth in the g7 in the quarter of this year what a difference from the mess the conservatives make that be the difference that a labour government make 
 the prime minister talk about job unemployment have rise every month since labour take office have he speak to nissan by the way and look at what be happen there this man have forget   that his welfare bill be there to plug a black hole create by the chancellor instead they be create new one interruption the chancellor be point at i but she look absolutely miserable interruption they can point as much as they like but the fact be that labour mp be go on the record say that the chancellor be toast the reality be that she be a human shield for the prime minister ’s incompetence in january he say that she would be in post until the next election will she really 
 well the right hon lady certainly will n’t i have to say that i be always cheer up when she ask i question or respond to a statement because she always make a complete mess of it and show just how unserious and irrelevant the conservatives be 
 the right hon lady talk about the black hole but they leave a £ black hole in our economy and we be clear it up i be really proud that in the year of a labour government we have get free school meal breakfast club childcare and £ invest in transport in the north and the midland with planning regulation planning and infrastructure be pound forward we be build home and have the big investment in social and affordable housing we also have the trade deal remember those be the one that the conservatives could not get include the us trade deal on monday those tariff come down that secure the job at jaguar land rover that be who we care about on the government benches 
 how awful for the chancellor that the prime minister could not confirm that she would stay in place he talk about his year in office this week mark the anniversary of labour come into office interruption yeah yeah let ’s have it the whip can not get their mps in the lobby but they can get they to cheer at the right time 
 the fact be that the prime minister ’s own mp be say that this government be incoherent and shambolic”—it be   the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker   who say that i could go on and on but the fact be that it have be mistake after mistake after mistake there be no plan to get people into work there be no plan to cut the welfare budget and there be no strategy there be just a series of humiliating u turn as with winter fuel and as with groom gang 
 what be really shocking be the fact that every other party in the house vote for even more welfare spending yesterday yes those mp behind the prime minister and the liberal democrats and reform the conservative party believe that this country need to live within its mean hon member hear hear we know what we believe but this be a prime minister who have u turn on everything he have do in office include his own speech because he do not know what he believe with left wing labour mps now run the government be it not work people who will now pay the price 
 this be why the leader of the opposition always cheer i up she talk about live within our mean have leave a £ black hole she talk about our year i be really proud of our year in government we promise extra   nhs appointment and we deliver a promise make and a promise deliver we promise the big upgrade to worker right in a generation within the day a promise make and a promise deliver we promise free breakfast club a promise make and a promise deliver on ban bonus for water boss who pollute our river which be a mess the conservatives leave a promise make and a promise deliver create gb energy a promise make and a promise deliver the large increase in defence spending since the last labour government a promise make and a promise deliver put more money in the pocket of work people particularly the who be the low pay through the national minimum wage a promise make and a promise deliver we be only get start the chancellor have lead on all these issue and we be grateful to she for it 
 unlike the conservatives this government have not drag their foot in ban zombie knife and ninja style sword in their effort to tackle knife crime in croydon where youth violence have cast a devastating shadow across our community our local police be run a surrender scheme this month to take those dangerous weapon off our street will the prime minister join i in commend the tireless work of croydon ’s police officer and will he outline what his government be do to ensure that the met police have the resource they need both to protect neighbourhood policing and to deal with the unique challenge they face 
 my hon friend be right to speak of the importance of ban these despicable weapon i know how much she care about this issue the ban on zombie knife and machete come into effect last year and the ban on ninja sword will come into effect this august the crime and policing bill will increase penalty for illegal sale and will give the police new power to seize knife what do the conservatives do when we put that bill before the house to take those measure they vote against it knife crime soar on their watch and they have clearly learn absolutely nothing 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 yesterday the government be ask the house to vote for a law that would mean that someone with a condition such as parkinson ’s or multiple sclerosis would qualify for a personal independence payment today but someone diagnose with the same condition with the very same symptom in a few month time would not we all know that the cost of welfare need to come down but that be not a fair way to do it until he lose control yesterday the prime minister be argue for that approach have he change his mind on this or not 
 the stephen timms review a very important review will look into this issue but what we do do last night be end mandatory reassessment for those with severe disability i think that the right hon gentleman and his party care about thing like that it be the right thing to do and they vote against it we have rebalance universal credit which be long overdue i think he believe that but what do he do last night he vote against it we set out a pathway to   reform personal independence payment which be something he argue for every week and what do he do when he have the chance he vote against it 
 the house and labour back benchers will note that the prime minister do not answer my question moreover if he look at our proposal for welfare reform to cut down the bill he would not be in the mess that he be in 
 move on from hillsborough to grenfell from primodos to horizon and from the contaminated blood scandal to nuclear test veteran the bereaved and survivor of some of our country ’s most appalling scandal have come together to call for a legal duty of candour and for the secondary duty need to make it practical and effective for investigation and inquiry they be now frightened that the government be water down these proposal to such an extent that they would be toothless after month of delay can the prime minister reassure campaigner that his hillsborough law will include a real legal duty of candour as he promise

 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this and remember well the visit we have this be a really serious issue and it be important that we get it right i be fully committed to introduce a hillsborough law include a legal duty of candour for public servant and criminal sanction for those who refuse to comply it be important that we get it right i have be personally engage with some of the family on this because as i say i have see at hand what they have be through for over year i meet they when i be director of public prosecutions and there be consideration of the order in which certain thing would happen that be actually about a different issue it be about an issue of great concern to they but my hon friend be right to raise this we will bring this forward i just want to take the time to get it right and then put it before the house

 for the final question i call jessica morden 
 this morning in westminster hall centenary action present sash handmade by a team of wonderful woman work out of remake newport to every of our woman mps to mark today ’s anniversary of the representation of the people equal franchise act will the prime minister join i in welcome this initiative which celebrate the contribution woman make in public life although we now have a record number of woman mps do he agree that we must continue to break down barrier for woman on our way to achieve the mission of a gender equal parliament 
 i thank the woman in my hon friend ’s constituency through she for their hard work on this initiative have woman mps be really significant progress in this house i be incredibly proud that at the last election new female labour mp be elect mean that the number of female mps in the labour party be now at a record high on the anniversary of the equal franchise act it should be a source of great pride to the house that we have a record number of female member 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the ratification of the uk mauritius treaty on the future sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question on   may the diego garcia treaty be sign and lay before the house as the defence secretary tell the house on the day of the signature this treaty secure the strategically important uk us military base on the island of diego garcia the diego garcia military base be essential to the security of the uk and our key ally include the united states and be essential to keep the british people safe it be also of our most significant contribution to the transatlantic defence and security partnership 
 the base enable rapid deployment of operation and force across the middle east east africa and south asia help combat some of the most challenging threat include from terrorism and hostile state and it have a unique strategic location the treaty ensure that the uk retain complete operational control of diego garcia well into the next century it have robust security measure that prevent threat from the outer island of the archipelago include a nautical mile buffer zone where nothing can be build or place without uk consent a rigorous process to prevent activity on the wide island a strict ban on foreign security force on the outer island whether civilian or military and a binding obligation to ensure the base be never undermine these robust provision give the uk an effective veto over any activity that present a clear and direct threat to the base on diego garcia and they will categorically prevent our adversary from compromise the base 
 the treaty set out that it can be ratify once both party have complete their relevant domestic process and for the uk this of course include scrutiny of the treaty by parliament and make the necessary change to domestic law the treaty be lay before the house on the day of signature for scrutiny under the usual process set out in the constitutional reform and governance act we welcome the report into the treaty by the international agreements committee in the other place which recognise the importance of ratify the treaty to secure the base and the debate on monday in the other place in which peer reject a cynical conservative motion to block ratification 
 nevertheless before the treaty be ratify the government will also bring forward primary legislation as i have say on many occasion which will be scrutinise and debate in the usual way and secondary legislation as necessary ahead of ratification the government will also make a ministerial statement in both houses provide a factual update on chagossian eligibility for resettlement and on the modality of the chagossian trust fund that will also enable further discussion in a proper manner the treaty will then enter into force on the   day of the month follow the date on which both party have exchange letter confirm these process be complete 
 this landmark agreement secure the future of our strategically critical uk us military base on diego garcia it be as i say a crucial contribution to the defence and security partnership that we hold as the defence secretary tell this house there be no alternative but to act and in so do we have protect britons at home and overseas interruption if the opposition do not recognise that fact why do they start negotiate in the place 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question with the day crag process about to conclude it be a disgrace that labour have breach the parliamentary convention and deny the house a meaningful debate and vote on ratification the minister say that we will get a vote on the bill but have a vote on the bill be not the same as vote on a treaty under crag 
 early this week the house of lords have a debate and vote where the lib dems side with labour in back this £ surrender treaty which be subsidise tax cut in mauritius why can not we have a debate and vote in this house what be ministers afraid of be they afraid that their back benchers now worried about benefit cut and the impact of unpopular tax rise will question why so much money be be hand over for a territory that we own and will force they into another embarrassing u turn be they afraid that mps across the house will do the math even and see that the actual amount of money go to mauritius will be at least £ and not the £ accountancy valuation claim that ministers talk about be they afraid that labour ’s bareface hypocrisy and appal treatment of the chagossian community will be expose 
 the minister once say 
 the people of chagos must be at the heart of decision about their future official report   october vol c. 192wh 
 but this surrender treaty betray they he have betray they leave any decision on resettlement and support through the trust fund in the hand of mauritius 
 with a legal case ongoing will the minister extend the crag process until all legal challenge have conclude will the minister finally admit that labour make october ’s bad deal even weak by give up the unilateral right to extend the lease on the base and ditch the clause authorise the uk to exercise sovereign right the prime minister of mauritius have say that it have do that so will the minister finally admit it will the minister confirm that there be no guarantee that the current level of marine protection will continue 
 there be too much ambiguity we have not have clarity there be no guarantee on security or on safeguard unanswered question about notification requirement around the base and no guarantee that mauritius will not pursue further lawfare to stop operation at the base if it think they contravene international law include try to block nuclear weapon as the pelindaba treaty now apply to the chagos island the minister should scrap this treaty or at least have the courage to bring it here for a proper debate full scrutiny and finally a vote in this house 
 i genuinely have to say as somebody who have respect for and like the right hon lady that i be disappoint by the tone of those remark i do not know who write this stuff i do not know whether it be just performative politic or rhetoric i do not know what 
 i should point out that i have receive and answer over write parliamentary question from the right hon lady i have answer over question in total on the deal and the process we have have no few than urgent question in this house we have have statement from the government from the foreign secretary and the defence secretary i personally brief the right hon lady and answer many of her question in my office just a couple of week ago in good faith and in detail i have be subject quite rightly to robust scrutiny on these issue not only by the foreign affairs committee but by the international relations and defence committee and the international agreements committee in the other house in great detail 
 i do not know whether the right hon lady and her team be simply not read the transcript or the answer to the question but i have repeatedly answer they she might not like the answer mr speaker but i have answer these question i have set out the position on cost i have set out the position on the security arrangement i have set out the position on the veto that we have the fact be that this deal secure this base and it secure our national security and that of our ally it be absolutely right that it have have proper scrutiny and there will be a vote because there will be a vote on the legislation that we will put before the house in due course 
 on a recent visit to washington with the foreign affairs committee i be strike by the support express by the us government for the deal to secure the long term future of the military base on diego garcia alongside the us our eyes ally support the deal nato support the deal and india support the deal do the minister agree that the opposition would do well to listen to our close neighbour and ally instead of try to play party politic with our national security 
 my hon friend be absolutely right national security be the top priority of this government and work with our crucial ally include the united states be key to that he be absolutely right to point out the support that be gain for this deal through a full and detailed inter agency process in the united states at the high level of the administration as well as the support from our eyes partner and from india the fact be that this deal secure the base and secure our capability and it would not have be sign off if it do not do that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the shambolic process of secure this deal have leave many question for the house but the glaring omission at the heart of that negotiation have be the failure by successive government to properly consult the chagossian people for much of their history chagossians have be deny consultation on who govern they and their right to self determination we liberal democrats now fear that in handing over the sovereignty of the   island to mauritius without properly reflect the interest of chagossians the government be only reinforce that legacy 
 the right hon member for witham priti patel   criticise the action of liberal democrat peer in the other place yet only the liberal democrats champion the right of the chagossian people and secure a commitment from the government to make statement to both houses on their approach before ratification in the light of those shortcoming it be wrong that the government have not bring the treaty to this house for scrutiny will the minister reverse that decision today and give parliamentarian the opportunity to assess and vote on the final deal 
 i genuinely thank the hon gentleman for the generally constructive way in which he and his colleague have approach the process he be absolutely right to speak about the chagossians indeed as i have point out many time the chagossians interest in this matter have be at the heart of our discussion we have the trust fund we have the agreement to start visit again of course mauritius will be able to restart a programme of resettlement he have hear the remark make by my noble friend in the other place in response to the question that his honourable colleague raise we have be very clear about what we will do in that regard and i hold to that here today 
 i have to challenge the suggestion that the treaty have not receive scrutiny it be receive scrutiny right now it have be receive scrutiny in the foreign affairs committee it have receive scrutiny in the other place and it have receive scrutiny through parliamentary question it be receive scrutiny and it be absolutely right that it do 
 the minister have just set out the scrutiny that this matter have receive in various place but i be really take by the number of question that he say he have receive from the shadow foreign secretary on this subject can he tell i how many question he have receive on other matter of global importance 
 my hon friend ask an important question since the treaty be lay i have have write question from the right hon lady in comparison i have have on gibraltar on ukraine and on poland he be right that this matter have receive scrutiny 
 i be not be funny but it be amazing that the minister have those figure to hand 
 the hon gentleman for whom i have a huge amount of respect keep say that the government have no choice but to do this deal i do not believe that to be true my successor lord cameron do not believe that to be true either which be why neither he nor i sign off an agreement will the minister please explain to the house in detail why he believe that he have no choice include what body at what time and with what jurisdiction 
 in the interest of time i refer the right hon member to the detailed evidence that i give in the house of lords on this matter the other day include on the legal circumstance he know the risk   to the operation of the base in the medium and short term and he recognise the risk of a bind legal judgment which we believe to be inevitable his government know that which be why they start the process he may not have be able to conclude the deal i accept that mr. speaker but the previous government go through round of negotiation because they recognise the importance of do this deal they know that secure the facility be crucial to our national security we put our national security and secure this base and that have meet with the approval of the united states and other eyes ally 
 i have to admit that i be rather confused because i be sure that the shadow foreign secretary be in the cabinet when the decision be make to start these negotiation too often we focus on the military aspect of this deal but can the minister confirm that it will also end a dangerous irregular migration route into the uk 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this government take early action even before the conclusion of the deal to ensure that that route be close down by the memorandum of understanding that we reach with st helena for which i again thank st helena again mr. speaker i be rightly scrutinise by this house on that my hon friend be absolutely right on that point and that be why we have do this deal 
 can the minister tell the house why he think china support this deal 
 i have be very clear on this the united states our eyes partner and india support this deal mauritius be of the few country not to join the belt and road initiative it be very clear that the deal be in the interest of our security and that of our ally otherwise the united states would not have agree to it in the place 
 clearly language such as surrender be inflammatory and inappropriate conservative members of this house wax lyrical and make a song and dance about national security will my hon friend remind they that on their watch our armed force be hollow out with the army reach its small size since the napoleonic war and spending never once reach be it not true that labour be the party of strong defence and strong national security 
 my hon friend be right whether it be in the ambitious agenda for national security and defence set out in the strategic defence review in the unity and leadership we show at the nato summit last week or in secure our crucial national security basis include diego garcia this government be lead from the front when it come to national security quite frankly the conservative party be show some brass neck after hollow out our armed force leave this deal undo and so many other thing i simply do not understand it mr. speaker 
 i simply ask the minister the same question that i ask when he come to the house on this matter in relation to the cost consequence of this deal he know that the lion ’s share of the interest lie with the military base on diego garcia therefore what contribution be the united states make to the very significant cost of compensate the mauritian people 
 the united states make significant and crucial contribution to the operation from diego garcia they be of a quantum much great than the cost that we will pay in relation to the base under this deal the benefit to the united kingdom the united states and our ally be priceless and this government will not scrimp on our national security 
 the cost of this deal be equivalent to a quarter of of our defence budget and that be in the context of a government who have make the high sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war when the minister speak to our international friend and ally what be their message about the work that we be do to restore confidence in national security and our reputation on the global stage and what message should the opposition take from those conversation 
 i repeatedly hear a strong vote of confidence in our investment in national security and defence whether it be from our european partner or from the united states just have to look at our leadership at the nato summit and our ongoing support for ukraine which we agree on across the house my hon friend ask about the value and the cost i have set out the cost on a number of occasion but as he say it be just a fraction of of our annual defence budget it would pay to run the nhs for just hour it also compare favourably with other ally for example france pay approximately € a year for its base in djibouti diego garcia be time large and the capability be priceless 
 the minister rightly say that the base on diego garcia be vital for our national security and we all agree on that the key issue be what notification have to be give to the mauritius government for the base to be use for operational purpose 
 my hon friend the minister of state for the armed forces have reply to multiple question on this topic as have i. indeed i answer these question in the due scrutiny that i receive the other day we do not have to provide notification in advance the treaty refer to expeditiously inform after the event and that be absolutely the normal course of business i be clear that the operation and the operational autonomy of this base be secure under this deal 
 it be amazing that we be to give up an important security base without it be necessary to do so that we be to pay billion to a government that will allow they to make tax cut while we impose tax burden on our own country and that the minister stand here today at the dispatch box and say that he do not have time to   explain why it be necessary to do so surely the way to ensure that we have proper scrutiny of this deal be to have a proper debate or be he afraid that his own back benchers once they hear the real story will find it as difficult to walk through the lobby for it as they do for the welfare reform bill yesterday 
 i have respect for the right hon gentleman but i totally reject his assertion there be full support for this deal and indeed full support for it from our ally in the united states and the eyes partner on the point about allege tax cut at no point in his budget speech do prime minister ramgoolam say that he be plan to fund income tax reform with the money from this deal that be very very clear indeed the rationale for this deal which i have explain multiple time to the house be that our national security be at risk and the operation of that base could not function as they once do that be why the opposition start the negotiation and why we have conclude they 
 after yesterday ’s complete chaos my constituent be brace themselves for big tax increase in the autumn how do the minister think they feel when they see the mauritian government crowing about virtually abolish income tax in mauritius thank to the largesse that he be about to pour on they 
 i be genuinely surprised by the comment of the right hon gentleman as a former defence minister and someone who have serve he will know the importance of this base and the need to secure it and he will know the risk to our operation that be inherent under the previous government that be why his government start this process and why we have conclude it it be also why our cost under the deal be broadly comparable with what france pay for its base in djibouti even though our base time large and have immeasurably more capability as he well know 
 in the minister ’s response he quote the answer from the defence secretary to my question say that he have no choice but the reason for do this deal be the worry about be take to court so the government do have a choice and that be what my constituent and opposition members be so upset about the government could have a fight in the court and appeal the decision yet they have choose not to and they will not explain why 
 will the minister set out what the need be for immediacy and why he and his government will not go to the court for the tribunal he be so worried about to have that fight if the case be shut down opposition members would understand and if it be find that we have a legal responsibility to pay we would do so but we do not and we have not have our day in court as a country that be the travesty of the deal 
 i have to correct the hon member as we have have day in court on this issue that be of the reasons—[interruption there be the non binding judgment in the international court of justice he also forget to mention the international tribunal for the   law of the sea the vote in the united nations and all the other legal process the fact be it be our view indeed it be the view of the previous government that a legally bind judgment would inevitably follow leave such a key national security asset in that way be not responsible no the responsible thing to do be to secure the base with our ally and that be exactly what we have do 
 while china might support this terrible deal let i tell the minister that the british people do not support this appalling deal give away our strategic security asset and pay ten of billion of our taxpayer money in the process our taxpayer will be suffer tax rise for that in order that the mauritians get tax cut since the government be in the mood for u turn why do they not take the hint and u turn on this terrible chagos deal 
 i will not take any lesson from a party that fawn over vladimir putin 
 in the defence secretary ’s statement on   may he state with regard to potential legal ruling against we that 
 the most proximate and the most potentially serious be the international tribunal for the law of the sea ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 the us which operate the base be not even a signatory to unclos how would itlos have rule a bind legal judgment that we would have recognise it be notable that itlos have not be mention since that statement 
 i be confused i have mention itlos on a number of occasion include just a moment ago the long stand view of the united kingdom be that the uk would not have a realistic prospect of successfully defend its legal position on sovereignty in such litigation even if we choose to ignore bind judgment make against we we would not do so their legal effect on country and international organisation would give rise to real impact to the operation of the base and the delivery of its national security function 
 international organisation have already adopt decision base on mauritian sovereignty and other would follow suit follow such litigation that could affect the electromagnetic spectrum access to the base by air and by sea and the ability to patrol the maritime area around the base and to support the base ’s critical national security function far the uk would likely face a provisional measure order in a matter of week the position be clear and we have explain it the hon member ’s previous government know exactly the same interruption however much he shout and however much he do not like the argument they be the fact 
 will the minister confirm that year ago the most disgusting cynical injustice be do against the chagos islander and that it be their resolute campaigning over decade often alone with little friendship or support that eventually bring the whole case to international law and an opinion from the international court of justice which have bring about the situation we be now in instead   of obsess with the twilight of empire should opposition party not be think about the injustice do to the chagos islander 
 will the minister confirm that in the arrangement now be make the chagos islander wherever they be resident and whatever their opinion be do have a right of return will he give we some idea of what the attitude will be about the right of visit the right of residence and the right of return to diego garcia where the majority of the chagos islander have come from they be a people who have be badly treat by history and be now be use as pawn by people more interested in defend some strange notion of the twilight of empire than justice for the chagos islander 
 the primary purpose of the deal be of course to secure the base on diego garcia and the national security of the uk and our ally but the right hon member be right to point out the historical situation regard the chagossians we have express deep regret for how they be remove from the island in the 1960 and 70 indeed that be on the face of the treaty we recognise the importance of the island to the chagossians as well as the different view in the community which he be well acquainted with 
 we will be restart those visit include to diego garcia the programme of resettlement to island outside diego garcia will be for mauritius to determine but we have commit to member on the liberal democrat benches in the other place that we will provide further statement on how that will work in due course there be also the trust fund and the support we provide here in the uk we be listen to the different chagossian group and try to ensure that their interest be at the heart of the treaty deal as we move forward 
 the minister will be aware of a pende judicial review challenge focus on the lack of consultation with the chagossians why be there not full and adequate consultation with the chagossian people 
 i will not comment on ongoing judicial matter but as i have set out a number of time the negotiation be necessarily between the uk and mauritius however we recognise the importance of the island to chagossians which be why the measure that i just set out have be put in place 
 on a point of order mr deputy speaker in answer to   the hon member for st ives andrew george the minister seem to imply to opposition member ear anyway that the united states would be pay i think he say a large quantum of the funding for the deal i think he be refer to the operational cost of the base may i ask for confirmation that the united states be not contribute at all to the £ lease under the settlement 
 order that be not a point of order for the chair as the hon gentleman will appreciate but if the minister wish to respond i will allow he to do so 
 far to that point of order mr deputy speaker perhaps it be because of the noise and the shouting but i be clear the united states contribute to the operation on diego garcia and rightly so there be establishment of that in relation to the exchange of note between the uk and the united states it be not contribute towards the cost of the treaty deal 
 with permission mr deputy speaker i would like to make a statement on the publication of the report from the national energy system operator follow its review into the fire at the north hyde substation on   march neso ’s review be commission jointly by the energy secretary and ofgem in the immediate aftermath of the fire which disrupt power supply to over customer include of course heathrow airport which close operation on   march while power from the grid be restore quickly to customer there be significant secondary impact to the aviation sector due to the associated closure of heathrow airport 
 my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport make a statement to the house at the time where she commit that the government would update the house as soon as the relevant investigation have conclude that be why i be make this statement before the house on the day that neso ’s report have be publish 
 before i update the house on the key finding of the review i reassure hon member that the government be take action in response to the report we will urgently consider the finding of the review and have commit to publish a government response that will set out a plan on how the issue identify will be address in order to improve our energy resilience 
 have review the report i be deeply concerned i be sure hon member will agree that know risk be not address by national grid electricity transmission a key operator of our electricity system nget ’s own guidance be clear and base on the elevated moisture sample that nget take in the asset should have remain out of service until mitigating action be put in place or the asset should have be carefully monitor until it could be replace nget fail to take action appropriate to the severity of the risk at north hyde that be most likely the cause of the catastrophic fire on   march 
 i speak to nget this morning and make it clear that the finding be unacceptable and that action must be take to ensure that maintenance work on critical asset be prioritise appropriately fire suppression system must not be leave inoperable 
 i be pleased to see that the regulator be take swift action in response to the finding announce today that it be open an official enforcement investigation into nget ofgem will consider any possible licence condition breach relate to the development and maintenance of national grid electricity transmission ’s electricity system at north hyde i speak with ofgem yesterday to express my support for that investigation and the plan audit of national grid ’s critical substation asset that will be essential to understand any other potential risk on the network and ensure that those be be mitigate appropriately
