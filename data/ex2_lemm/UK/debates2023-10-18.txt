the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to help prevent crime in wales 
 the government be commit to invest in our police to drive down crime across wales that include an extra police officer for welsh force under the police uplift programme approximately £ have be allocate to welsh force through the safe street fund target neighbourhood crime violence against woman and girl and antisocial behaviour 
 antisocial behaviour have a devastating impact on community across wales and in cardiff north my constituent sarah suffer a miscarriage due to the stress of repeat antisocial behaviour she be not entitle to any support because this government consider those who suffer from antisocial behaviour to be class victim my amendment to change that in the victims and prisoners bill be reject by this government how can they claim to prevent crime while fail to support victim 
 i assure the hon lady that victim of antisocial behaviour be as much victim of crime as anyone else i absolutely stand with victim of antisocial behaviour it be a matter that we take very seriously indeed i have not see the amendment table by the hon lady but she must be aware that this government have bring in long prison sentence for the most serious crime and make it easy for the police to arrest people carry out crime matter that the labour party have vote against 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 the chief constable of dyfed powys police recently tell the welsh affairs committee that dyfed powys police force now have more police officer than at any time in its history follow the uk government ’s decision to invest in more officer and increase the local number of officer by will the secretary of state join i in congratulate dyfed powys police force on reach   that milestone and on all the hard work it do in help to make pembrokeshire of the safe part of the country 
 my right hon friend will be as pleased as i be that the government have deliver on their manifesto commitment to recruit extra police officer and i commend the work of police officer in dyfed powys police i have the privilege and honour to go to of the pass out ceremony recently and i commend the work that it do 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for wales 
 it be not just antisocial behaviour that be wreak havoc across wales shoplift in wales be also soar and in the year to march it be up by why will the secretary of state ’s government not adopt labour ’s plan to scrap the minimum £ worth of steal good rule which be introduce by his government in and allow gang of shoplifter to escape punishment and put shop worker at risk 
 i agree with the hon lady that shoplifting be a serious offence and repeat shoplifter and those who go out in organise gang must be deal with by the full force of the law that be why i welcome the fact that this government have bring in long prison sentence for people carry out the most serious offence i do not understand why the hon lady will not join the government in support long prison sentence perhaps she should talk to her colleague in the welsh government who seem to be against build any extra prison place 
 the secretary of state know that the prison estate across wales be not just full but that overcrowding be significantly above safe limit with his government have to commandeer police cell with judge be tell to jail few people and with criminal include those convict of assault be release early on the instruction of his justice secretary how can the welsh public have any faith that they will be protect 
 the prison population have increase as a direct result of policy that the government have implement to ensure that those commit the most serious offence spend more time in prison that be something that the hon lady should be supportive of she need to talk to her colleague in the welsh government who have state clearly in write that they be completely against build any prison place this government be build emergency prison place and fill up prison because people who commit serious offence deserve to go to prison the labour party in the welsh government be say clearly that it be totally oppose to build any extra prison anywhere 
 what step the government be take to improve economic link between wales and the north west 
 this government be commit to strengthen the economy of north wales and north west england we have recently announce that we will invest £ in network north include £ to electrify the north wales main line that will improve connectivity across the region bring many part of north wales within hour of manchester and liverpool by rail 
 the announcement of the electrification of the north wales main line will help to improve transport link between this region and the north west of england support economic growth tourism and job across both area do my hon friend agree that resident across wales and my constituent in blackpool will see real improvement in their local transport infrastructure as part of their share of this £ that be available 
 i completely agree with my hon friend north wales often feel overlook by the welsh government indeed the welsh government have say that the electrification of the north wales line be not their priority just as it be conservative governments who build key element of the a55 in the 1980 and 1990 we now see a conservative government invest far in the infrastructure and prospect of north wales and north west england 
 connectivity be key to underpin that economic growth and the railway line between north wales through my constituency in st helens and on to manchester should epitomise that but unfortunately it do not seem to be work at the minute it be frequently overcrowded and there be cancellation at the manchester end and at the chester end will the minister speak to his colleague in the department for transport as well as transport for wales so that we might make some progress and make sure that my constituent can get to work and this line can deliver economic growth for the north west and north wales 
 of course improve rail be not simply about the rail infrastructure it be also about the train operating company and how they operate the hon gentleman be right that transport for wales have struggle from time to time i can reassure he that i do have discussion with it in fact i be also meet the rail minister my hon friend   the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman   later today when i will reiterate those concern 
 i welcome the shadow minister to her new position 
 thank you mr speaker strong economic link be dependent on the government actually have an economic plan but the conservatives track record speak for itself they cancel the electrification of the main line to swansea they be spend half a pound but still potentially make up to steelworker redundant and their pitiful semiconductor strategy do not even give we a bit part on the world stage why should anyone believe   that their late promise make for north wales at a desperate party conference be worth the fag packet they be write on 
 i welcome the hon member to her position she share welsh lesson with i and i hope she will continue to do so i urge she to be somewhat more positive about the £ that have be announce for infrastructure development in north wales by mean of the electrification also in term of the steel industry at port talbot the half a pound have save many job and mean that decarbonisation can occur 
 hs2 be 
 go to benefit wales it ’ go to benefit people in north wales who will benefit from well access at crewe to london 
 that be the secretary of state ’s central argument for withhold billion of pound from wales by claim that hs2 benefit we now that the link at crewe be another casualty of tory chaos will wales office ministers stay true to their own logic and urge the treasury to class hs2 as english only 
 as the right hon lady know rail infrastructure be not devolve i would argue that investment in great britain ’s rail infrastructure be of value to those in north wales and the rest of wales furthermore hs2 be an important connection to the west midland from london passenger from london to north wales be likely to still use that 
 we all know that the money that have be commit be illustrative in a major boost to plaid cymru ’s campaign the national infrastructure commission for wales have propose devolve the crown estate and reinveste profit in community through a sovereign wealth fund the commission criticise the current system of wealth transfer from the poor country in britain to westminster as illogical and bizarre whose side be the minister on welsh community or a system that extract our natural wealth 
 we have have this discussion on previous occasion in various setting but i would argue that the crown estate allow this country to share risk and opportunity that it deal with it do a fantastic job and i simply do not agree 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of welsh government policy on health authority on cross border healthcare 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of welsh government policy on health authority on cross border healthcare 
 of course i work within the nhs in north east wales and west cheshire and see the stark reality of the disparity in healthcare service between the it be concern that the welsh government   have miss their target to eliminate year wait in most specialty and that more than patient have be wait over year for treatment in wales compare with circa in the whole of england the health secretary have offer to consider request from the welsh government to use alternate provider in england to reduce waiting list and the distress that they bring 
 with the welsh labour government face cut to their nhs as a decision of their own do the minister not find it extraordinary that they be look at spend £ on new politician and £ on a blanket mph speed limit that nobody vote for in wales 
 i entirely agree with my right hon friend it be scandalous that the labour welsh government be prioritise spending on more politician in cardiff bay as well as an unpopular mph default speed limit their decision mean less funding for the nhs education and other important devolved service they have the potential instead to invest in important capital project such as the royal alexandra hospital in rhyl they must re examine their agenda 
 it get bad the uk government have twice offer the welsh labour government help in reduce patient waiting list for important medical procedure but neither offer have be take up will my hon friend the minister confirm that in fact that offer still stand and that patient in wales who be stuck and suffer on waiting list have not be forget by the uk government 
 have speak with the department of health and social care i can confirm that the offer still stand my hon friend will find it of interest to know that the labour welsh government do write in response to the late offer several week after that offer be make unfortunately the minister do not confirm whether they would accept the offer in the interest of ten of thousand of patient i strongly encourage they to do so 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in wales 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on a range of issue include the cost of living the government have make certain that the state pension benefit and the minimum wage have all rise in line with inflation last winter the government ’s energy support scheme see they pay about half the average fuel bill for homeowner across the united kingdom 
 the bridgend food bank and the baobab bach food pantry be run out of food my constituent in ogmore and those across the bridgend borough   literally can not afford to pay for the weekly shop what work be the secretary of state do to tackle the significant access to food crisis that be impact constituent in the bridgend county borough and right across wales 
 as i have already mention the government have make sure that pension benefit and the minimum wage have rise in line with inflation there have be other payment as well with £ to household on benefit £ to pensioner and £ to those in household where there have be disability the government have make certain at all time to prioritise the least well off may i respectfully suggest that the hon gentleman should listen to the early question and suggest that the welsh government stop spend money on extra politician and put that back into community where it be need 
 polling of people by public health wales find that about in welsh citizen be either worried or very worried about the rise cost of living with almost half say that it will have a negative impact on their mental health similar concern have be express in scotland what consideration have the secretary of state and his cabinet colleague give to the snp ’s call for a £ energy rebate as winter approach 
 as i say in addition to the government ’s priority on support the least well off and the fact that the government pay around half of people ’s energy bill during the last winter we will continue to prioritise those who be have difficulty if the hon lady be really worried about a cost of live crisis and the impact on energy she will do well to revisit her party ’s policy of get rid of the oil and gas industry in the uk include in scotland something that would cost job and have a terrible impact on energy price for homeowner across the united kingdom 
 the wrexham flintshire investment zone bid could bring huge benefit to my region include more and well pay job an investment zone require collaboration between the welsh and uk government there be a possibility that the uk government could support zone in wales but the welsh government have yet to give i a commitment to a zone if they do will the uk government also commit 
 i can assure my hon friend that i have make a very strong case to cabinet colleague for investment zone in wales she be right that we need the co operation of the welsh labour government i suggest that she and any member who represent north wales write to the welsh labour government ’s economic development minister and suggest that welsh government prioritise investment zone for wales we would be delighted to work with they when they get around to do that 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the union 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength   of   the union 
 our united kingdom be strong than ever it be a testament to the strength of the union that the uk government have be able to support people across the country include with £ to respond to cost of live challenge 
 at the welsh affairs committee this morning the minister mark drakeford blame the uk government for not give adequate financial support to the welsh government in time of high inflation and a cost of living crisis can the secretary of state tell we how much his department be spend on promote the uk government in wales why do he think that be a well use of taxpayer money than fund service for the people of wales i be happy to receive an answer by email if he do not have that information to hand 
 i can assure the hon lady that the welsh labour government be receive a record break settlement of more than £ and more per head to spend on public service than be spend in england perhaps the minister should explain why we have long nhs waiting list in wales and why education standard be low as far as spending on public affair and promotion be concern i can assure the hon lady that a far great amount be spend by the welsh labour government than be ever spend by the wales office frankly the proof of the strength of the union be demonstrate by the fact that my hon friend   the member for east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow dr cameron   have join the conservative and unionist party and she be very welcome 
 i have raise the damaging effect of the uk ’s brexit on the port of holyhead and the north wales economy in this chamber time holyhead have be disadvantage by the lack of a green lane for export to northern ireland in august at last his majesty 's revenue and customs confirm to i that there will now be a green lane for good travel from wales to northern ireland through holyhead and the republic i emphasise as a precaution that this be not a freeport issue the secretary of state be very keen on that rather what specifically be he do to promote and enable those new procedure for holyhead 
 i do not quite hear all that but on the port in ynys môn i be sure that the hon gentleman will take some comfort from the fact that the united kingdom economy have grow more quickly outside the european union than that of many nation that have remain in it the government have show their absolute commitment to both north wales and ynys môn through their development of a freeport project for the area and the announcement of £ for electrification of the north wales railway line which will help to bring job and investment into north wales 
 barry be wales ’s large town but it have be ignore by the welsh government for decade it have significant regeneration challenge like many place i congratulate   my right hon friend on award barry town regeneration status but can he reassure i that that do not preclude barry from benefit from level up funding 
 obviously i welcome the announcement but my right hon friend be far too modest since he have be knock on the door of the wales office and the department for levelling up housing and communities for a very long time to demand extra funding for barry he make a very strong case for that and i assure he that the uk government will continue to listen to he 
 cross border transport link between wales and england be a key part of the strength of the union do my right hon friend agree that cross border project such as the pant and llanymynech bypass and the long term ambition to dual the a483 a5 pass through clwyd south and north shropshire be vital 
 the united kingdom government be absolutely determined to support infrastructure project in wales we have do so through the levelling up fund it will happen again through the share prosperity fund and it have of course be happen through the growth deal what we do need be a welsh labour government that will support infrastructure that be why i find it so disappointing that the welsh labour government have rule out build any new road ever again it worry i greatly that that be see as a blueprint for the rest of the united kingdom 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on energy cost for a household and b business in wales 
 the secretary of state and i have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on a range of issue include energy cost the government spend nearly £ protect household and business from high energy bill over last winter mean that between october and june a typical household see half of their energy bill pay for by the government 
 the government do not listen to the renewable energy sector which repeatedly warn they that the budget set for this year ’s offshore wind auction be too low to attract bidder to develop offshore wind in the celtic sea can the minister tell the house why that advice be ignore lead to not a single bid be make 
 what i can tell the hon lady be that it be an issue of discussion that the secretary of state and i be engage with we understand the importance of float offshore wind in the celtic sea and it will progress in due course 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the restricted roads mph speed limit wales order on the welsh economy 
 what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the restricted roads mph speed limit wales order on the welsh economy 
 no sensible person would oppose a mph speed limit where there be a case to be make on the basis of safety outside hospital old people ’s home or school but the blanket decision by the welsh government which have be oppose by over signatory to the large petition in the senedd ’s history be deeply unpopular deeply expensive and completely wrong 
 give that more than people in wales have sign an online petition against the labour welsh government ’s blanket mph roll out do my right hon friend agree that devolve administration across the united kingdom should listen to the people and the community they serve rather than their own narrow centralised agenda 
 i agree completely with what my hon friend say the welsh labour government need to listen to what people have say about this and they need to listen also to all those who be oppose to this ridiculous war on motorist which be not just about a mph speed limit but a block on any new road be build and extra road charge 
 mr speaker—[interruption 
 can i just say to conservative members that the hon member be in the middle of ask a question it be disrespectful to your own side you should think about what you be do people should wait just because you want to cheer somebody come in do it at the right time that be totally inappropriate 
 thank you mr speaker labour like to showcase welsh labour as its blueprint for the rest of the united kingdom do the secretary of state not agree that this be yet more evidence of its war against motorist wherever they be wales dudley north or the rest of the united kingdom 
 i completely agree with my hon friend we need to be very careful of this blueprint for britain which include a ban on new road a ban on meal deal a tourism tax road charge over £ be spend on more politician a £ minimum wage be pay to some asylum seeker and a ban on news channel in the assembly that senedd members disagree with that be not a blueprint for britain it be a recipe for disaster i hope the people of wales will take note and vote conservative in the next election 
 what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on the impact of increase in mortgage interest rate on homeowner in wales 
 the government recognise that this be a concern time for mortgage holder especially those who be due to come to the end of a fix deal in the immediate future we be support borrower who   be struggle with their mortgage payment through the new mortgage charter it set out the standard that signatory lender will adopt include new flexibility to help customer manage their mortgage payment over a short period 
 throughout scotland people be pay the price of the westminster make cost of live crisis as a result of this conservative government and the action of the tories in crash the economy last year will the government bring forward that mortgage interest relief scheme for my constituent and perhaps even for those in east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow 
 the government have of course provide support for mortgage interest loan for those receive income relate benefit and the pre action protocol help to make repossession less likely that be in addition to the action that i have already outline 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 i know that the whole house will have be shock by the scene at al ahli hospital as my right hon friend the foreign secretary have say we be work independently and with our ally to find out what have happen i be sure that member will raise further question about this during today ’s session 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 may i associate myself and the whole of my party here with what have be say about the horror and the unfold tragedy of last night ’s bombing of the hospital in gaza 
 the rafah border crossing from besiege gaza into egypt have be hit by several israeli airstrike cause absolute terror to those who urgently need the crossing to be open in order to escape nadia el nakla an elect councillor in my city of dundee and the wife of scotland ’s minister have have to take call from her parent elizabeth and maged who like all other trap in gaza have be describe the horror of death and indiscriminate killing everywhere member of nadia ’s family be hit yesterday by a rocket from a drone and her mother be say her final goodbyes this morning add 
 last night be the end for i well if my heart stop and then i will be at peace i can not take another night 
 with military action intensify and the death toll rise rapidly the prime minister ’s responsibility must be to bring british citizen home can he please give his personal assurance that every single step be be take to open the rafah crossing both for humanitarian aid and to enable uk national like nadia ’s family to flee 
 the thought of everyone in the house will of course be with the family affect by what be happen in israel and in gaza and i can give the hon gentleman that assurance we be do everything in our power to ensure the safety of british national who be catch up in all this that include my call with leader across the region particularly the conversation about open the rafah border crossing which be why i make talk to president sisi a priority last week and we continue to engage in dialogue with both the israelis and the egyptians about the crossing 
 i be proud to live in the most successful multi racial democracy in the world but it sadden i and i think it sham the whole house that british jews have be subject to such vile abuse and hatred in recent day antisemitism and all hate crime fly in the face of british value and we should not allow event abroad no matter how horrific they be to be use to sow seed of division in our own country while i welcome all the action that my right hon friend be take to fight hate crime and to bring people together may i ask he to consider urgently an immediate and specific policy of revoke the visa of any foreign national who commit an act of antisemitism or any other hate crime 
 i completely agree with my right hon friend who have himself do so much over the year to fight antisemitism the increase in the number of such incident that we have see over the past week be utterly sickening and this government will do whatever it take to keep our jewish community safe we have provide an additional £ to support the community security trust we be work with the police to ensure that hate crime and the glorification of terror be meet by the full force of the law and under our exist immigration rule we have the power to cancel a person ’s presence in the uk if it be not conducive to the public good we will not tolerate this hatred not in this country not in this century 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 can i start by warmly welcome my hon friend   the new member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks the news last night of hundred kill at the baptist hospital in gaza be incredibly distressing but it be much bad for the people of gaza their fear that there be no place of safety be profound international law must be uphold and that mean hospital and civilian life must be protect last night the foreign secretary say that the uk will work with our ally to find out what have happen i know that this only happen last night but can the prime minister please tell we when he think he might be able to update the house on progress with that work 
 i know that the whole house will have be shock by the scene at al ahli hospital any loss of innocent life be a dreadful tragedy and everyone will be think both of those who have lose their life and of the family they leave behind we should not rush to judgment before we have all the fact on this awful situation every member will know that the word we say here have an impact beyond this house 
 this morning i meet the national security adviser and the chair of the joint intelligence committee and i can tell the right hon and learn gentleman that our intelligence service have be rapidly analyse the evidence to independently establish the fact we be not in a position at this point to say more than that but i can tell he that we be work at pace and co operate and collaborate with our ally on this issue as we look to get to the bottom of the situation we will also continue all our effort to get humanitarian aid into the region 
 i thank the prime minister for his answer the terrible news last night come as we be still mourn the terrorist attack on israel last week with jews take hostage mutilate slaughter yesterday i meet the family of some of the british hostage hold by hamas every minute of every hour of every day they hope for good news but fear the bad they know that the life of their love one be in the hand of murderer it be unimaginable agony israel have a right a duty to defend itself from hamas keep its people safe and bring the hostage home but be it not clear that if hamas have a single concern for human life a single concern for the safety of the palestinian people they would never have take these hostage and that they should release they immediately 
 it be important for we consistently to remember that israel have suffer a shockingly brutal terrorist attack and it be hamas and hamas alone who be responsible for this conflict our thought be rightly with those who have be take hostage and their family the distress they be feel will be unimaginable for all those affect i will be meet some of the family and offer they all the support of the british government to get their relative home we be work around the clock with our partner and ally to secure their freedom and importantly in among my other regional call i speak specifically with the emir of qatar yesterday on this very issue which we discuss at length the qatari government be take a lead in work intensely to help release hostage use their contact in the region and we be work closely with they to ensure the safe return of the british hostage 
 yesterday i also meet charity with staff work in gaza and hear their account of the harrowing humanitarian crisis child flee their home hospital barely able to function the light be go out and the innocent civilian of gaza be terrified that they will die in the darkness out of sight international law must always be follow hamas be not the palestinian people and the palestinian people be not hamas do the prime minister agree that medicine food fuel and water must get into gaza immediately this be an urgent situation and innocent palestinians need to know that the world be not just simply watch but act to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe 
 as i say on monday an acute humanitarian crisis be unfold to which we must respond it be right that we support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too that be why we have provide a furth £ in humanitarian aid for people in the region and we be work on pre emptively move aid and relief team to egypt specifically to the   el arish airfield we be work with local partner like the egyptian red crescent and the united nations primarily and deploy navy asset to the region as well as explore how we can support logistical requirement 
 i have also raise the issue of humanitarian access as a priority in all my conversation with every leader in the region we will continue to work with they to get aid to where it be need as quickly as possible 
 as have be allude to since hamas ’s terrorist attack our country have see a disgusting rise in antisemitism jewish business attack jewish school mark with red paint and jewish family hide who they be and we have see an appalling surge in islamophobia racist graffiti mosques force to ramp up security and british muslims and palestinians speak to as if they be terrorist do the prime minister agree with i that every member of this house have a duty to work in their constituency and across the country to say no to this hate and to ensure that every british jew and every british muslim know they can live their life free from fear and free from discrimination here in their own country 
 all of we in this house can play our part in stamp out those who seek to cause division and hate in our society we will make sure that we continue fund the community security trust and the equivalent protective security grant that protect mosque and other place of worship for the islamic community in the uk that funding be increase early this year we will also remain in dialogue with the police to make sure they be aware of the full tool at their disposal to arrest those who perpetrate hate crime and who incite racial or other religious violence there be no place for that in our society and i know this house will stand united in make sure those who do this face the full force of the law 
 we do not want this conflict to harm we here at home and we do not want it to escalate in the middle east where there have be too much bloodshed too much darkness for too long a state solution a palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel feel more distant than ever but it remain the only way through do the prime minister agree that because hope be at its thin we must work our hard to ensure that the voice of division and despair be sideline and that however difficult it seem the hope of a political path to peace be maintain 
 it be precisely because it be that vision of a more hopeful peaceful future that hamas have try to destroy that we must redouble our effort to try to bring that future about in all the conversation that the foreign secretary and i have have with regional leader we have emphasise our commitment to make sure that we make progress on all the avenue that will lead towards that peaceful future that have be a feature of our dialogue and i be confident there be willingness in the region not to escalate this crisis beyond deal with hamas the terrorist organisation and to strive very hard towards a future where palestinians and israelis can co exist peacefully side by side and look forward to a future fill with dignity security and prosperity 
 this be a crisis where life hang in the balance and where the enemy of peace and democracy would like nothing more than for we to become divided and to abandon our value do the prime minister agree that during this grave crisis the house must strive to speak with voice in condemnation of terror in support of israel ’s right to self defence and for the dignity of all human life which can not be protect without humanitarian access to those suffering in gaza and the constant maintenance of the rule of international law 
 i agree we will in this house speak with voice in condemn hamas for perpetrate a shockingly brutal terrorist attack and cause untold suffering for many as the right hon and learn gentleman say we stand united in support israel ’s right to defend itself to protect its people and to act against terrorism unlike hamas the israeli president have make it very clear that israel ’s armed force will operate in accordance with international law we will continue to urge the israelis to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian while remembering importantly that it be hamas who be cruelly embed themselves in civilian population 
 may i associate myself with the word of the prime minister and commend he and the foreign secretary for the work they be do to find a peaceful settlement in the middle east 
 may i also welcome the prime minister ’s decision to provide £ worth of funding for east west high speed rail line between manchester and liverpool and his focus on great northern town as well as city in the north will he ensure that town such as warrington benefit fully from this rail upgrade and that a hub station at warrington bank quay link northern powerhouse rail to the west coast main line remain a key part of the network north 
 i thank my hon friend for his continued campaign to improve rail service in warrington he be right we will be invest £ to well connect manchester and liverpool that would allow for the delivery of northern powerhouse rail exactly as previously plan include high speed line which would provide well rail connection for the people live in northern town such as warrington i know that he will be discuss this far when he meet the rail minister 
 i call the scottish national party leader 
 we all continue to unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist attack on the jewish people and the israeli state we fully support the defeat of hamas and of course the safe return of all hostage who have be take so too i hope do we all share the same common humanity of protect civilian and condemn any act of collective punishment against the palestinian people in that regard many of the image emanate from gaza in recent day will shock we all to the core so may i ask the prime minister will he join those of we on these benches and call for an immediate ceasefire in the region 
 we believe that israel do have a right to defend itself to protect its people and to act against terrorism and ensure that the awful attack we have see from hamas can not happen again unlike hamas the israelis include the president have make it clear that their armed force will operate in accordance with international law we will continue to urge the israelis to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian 
 my ask for a ceasefire be do with all sincerity not only in order to protect civilian but to ensure that we have the safe creation of humanitarian corridor which will allow not only for food water and vital medicine to get into gaza but for innocent civilian catch up in this terrible conflict to flee in respect of those who wish to flee may i ask the prime minister what early consideration if any his government have give to the creation of a refugee resettlement scheme akin to those previously put in place for syrian national afghani national and of course ukrainian national 
 i be proud that we be already of the most significant contributor to the united nations effort to support palestinian refugee our funding support about refugee annually and on monday we announce a significant increase in our funding of aid to the region include to the un to support refugee with regard to humanitarian aid as i say before we be already work through pre emptively move aid and relief team into the region but critically the most important thing be to open up access for that aid to get into gaza which be why our conversation with the egyptians and other be so critical we continue to work closely with ally to find every way to get that aid to the people who need it as quickly as possible 
 last night section of the british medium be report as fact that it be israeli rocket that have land and attack the al ahli hospital rely on information supply by official in terrorist control gaza the headline have since be rewrite but the outpouring of jew hate on social medium overnight be vile so will the prime minister please make the point again that the way that this conflict be be report have massive implication for our jewish community and that any information come from hamas must be treat with a degree of scrutiny and cross examination that be sadly sometimes lack 
 i commend my right hon friend for his excellent intervention he be absolutely right that we should not rush to judgment before we have all the fact on the appalling situation that we see yesterday particularly give the sensitivity that he raise and the impact on community here but also across the region as i say it be incumbent on all of those in position of responsibility in this house and outside in the medium to recognise that the word we say will have an impact and we should be careful with they 
 we be work with our ally to establish the truth of what have happen we will do that robustly and independently but my right hon friend be right to point out that in the same way as we do not treat what come out of the kremlin as the gospel truth we should not do that with hamas 
 i associate my party with the comment make in relation to the deplorable loss of innocent human life in both israel and gaza

 the hon member talk about our military asset let i be crystal clear the asset that we have move into the region be not there in any combat capacity they be there for reason and foremost to provide surveillance to ensure that this   crisis do not escalate and that arm be not be send to entity like hezbollah that be what our surveillance aircraft be currently do and indeed the next set of asset arrive this week will also help but also to provide contingency support for humanitarian assistance as and when require in the come day and week 
 on sunday terrence carney a year old hartlepudlian be murder by an asylum seeker the people be afraid and angry every week my office be besiege by asylum seeker my staff be intimidate by young man the fact be that most of they be illegal migrant who should be expel my thought and sympathy be with mr carney ’s family and friend and all my constituent affect by this heinous crime however sympathy be not enough they deserve action and i be demand it will the prime minister take action will he make sure that enforcement be deliver will he ensure that people who have no right to be here be expel enough be enough i want these people out of hartlepool now

 we have all be horrify by event in israel and gaza and it be right that we condemn utterly the inhuman terrorism of hamas that should also be the case for any obscenity and war crime carry out by the israeli defence force both the un and médecins sans frontières have describe the siege of gaza and the withholding of water from its people as collective punishment a war crime under the geneva convention yet this week both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition have support israel ’s right to do so why 
 quite simply put israel suffer from a brutal terrorist attack at the hand of hamas and it be absolutely right that israel have a right to defend itself root out terrorism and ensure that such an act do not happen again as israel ’s president have say its military will operate within international law but the hon gentleman fail to acknowledge that it be hamas who embe themselves inside civilian population and put innocent civilian in harm ’s way he would do well to remember that 
 my right hon friend have be absolutely right to lead the nation in reassure the british jewish community in the wake of the utterly appalling atrocity visit upon israel and jews on   october i understand that my right hon friend will be travel to the region and he will see for himself the shock and trauma that be through the israeli nation after this   event shock and trauma that be accompany by a rage the enormous danger be that the israeli reaction lead by a prime minister who will be hold accountable for this failure of intelligence be go to amount be indeed amount to a war crime that will not only be a crime it will be a mistake i urge my right hon friend there be now no well place to urge israel to stay within the international rule of law and to exercise restraint on behalf of we all 
 as a friend we will always urge israel to take every possible practical precaution to avoid harm civilian and indeed to act within international law as israel ’s president have say its armed force will do while recognise the incredible complexity and difficulty of the situation on the ground it bear repeat that hamas be a terrorist organisation that embed itself inside a civilian population we always have to remember that israel be take every possible practical step to avoid harm civilian and we will do everything we can to provide humanitarian support to the area 
 the prime minister will be delighted to know that nuclear veteran like my constituent ’s grandad john be start to receive the medal he promise but john be still not get his full medical record his blood test from christmas island which be crucial to claim a war pension be miss and countless veteran report the same as the ministry of defence have admit that it hold at least file withhold from national archive refer to blood test and other datum will he review those document report back to the house and hold a public inquiry into why medical record omission have happen and on whose instruction 
 i start by thank all our veteran for their contribution to our safety and security i be delighted to have be able to announce the new nuclear test medal last year and that it be start to be receive by many people include the hon lady ’s constituent she will know that i can not comment on ongoing litigation in respect of request for health record but i can say that anyone can request copy of their own medical datum by submit a subject access request to the department and if they be not satisfied with the processing of that request they can make a formal complaint via the complaint process 
 we appear to be on a downward spiral in the middle east which inevitably will lead to a humanitarian crisis the role of egypt will be fantastically important what can we in the wide international community do to work with the egyptians to ensure that refugee come on to egyptian soil be legitimate refugee who pose no threat to the egyptian state and be not terrorist in disguise 
 my hon friend raise an excellent point regard the egyptians concern about that border but we have prioritise speak with president sisi and be in continue dialogue with our egyptian partner to see what we can do to provide reassurance and get humanitarian aid to the region we be work with local partner include the egyptian red crescent   and the un on the ground there will be a significant logistical challenge in stockpile aid at the border and then move it into gaza but i assure my hon friend and the whole house that the development minister be actively engage in that work as we speak so that we can play a lead role in facilitate the provision of that aid 
 this be the final question before the urgent question i call patricia gibson 
 thank you mr speaker the industrial dispute at the defence equipment and support ministry of defence site at beith in my constituency be drag on as worker engage in strike action for parity and fairness in the workplace these worker be critical to ensure that necessary supply to ukraine be uninterrupte   but all attempt by the worker to resolve this dispute have prove to be unsuccessful in the face of management intransigence will the prime minister personally and urgently use his influence to ensure that a meaningful offer be make to these worker so that the matter can be resolve further strike action can be avert and supply to ukraine can continue without disruption 
 i thank the hon member for highlight the critical role play by non craft support operative at defence munitions different rate of pay for worker with different skill and qualification be entirely normal practice in both the public and the private sector this year as part of de&s pay a generous pay award be deliver which significantly improve the base pay of worker engage in the dispute i be tell that official continue to be open to talk on a constructive basis with the gmb to resolve the situation 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the explosion at the al ahli arab hospital in gaza 
 the destruction of the al ahli arab hospital in gaza be an appalling tragedy a hospital be a place of compassion and care this devastating loss of human life be profoundly disturbing i be sure that i speak for the whole house when i offer my sincere condolence to the family of the deceased and to the injured 
 the uk be work intensively with our ally to establish the fact we will not rush to judgment the whole house will understand that point finger prematurely only fuel regional instability and upset community cohesion here in the uk we need a firm grasp of what have happen not a slew of social medium commentary we all share a duty to be thoughtful and careful in how we respond to report emerge from the conflict which can be at well incomplete or at bad example of active disinformation we be carefully analyse the evidence that have be put in the public domain and other information as soon as we have reach a definitive conclusion for ourselves we will make it public 
 some thing be not in doubt however as my right hon friend the prime minister set out hamas carry out a terrorist assault on israel that be unprecedented in that country ’s year history the whole house unite in support of israel ’s right to defend itself against terrorism in defend itself israel must act with professionalism and an unwavering commitment to international law state must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualty and ensure that humanitarian support reach those in need i welcome president herzog ’s unequivocal commitment make both directly to i and in public that israel be operate in accordance with the rule of international law 
 by embed themselves in civilian population use innocent palestinians as human shield launch thousand of rocket since saturday from of the most crowded place in the world and prevent civilian from heed israeli warning about future area of operation hamas reveal themselves and their callous indifference to human life in this tense situation uk diplomacy be relentlessly focus on our aim support our national in their moment of need push for and deliver humanitarian support and work to prevent tension spill over into the wide region or play out on the street of this country i have travel to israel and engage with g7 ally and regional partner and i will visit the region again later today because we recognise that this will require intensive effort 
 none of we know how this complex protract situation will develop the government be commit to keep the house update both here in the uk and in the region this be a time for cool head and determination to make a difference 
 thank you so much mr speaker for grant this urgent question i be grateful to the foreign secretary for his engagement with the opposition at this very difficult time 
 today we stand united in mourn the death of hundred of innocent palestinian civilian at the al ahli hospital a place of healing become a scene of destruction hospital must always be protect the death of every civilian palestinian or israeli be an equal tragedy that push back the cause of peace 
 when face an incident of this magnitude we all have a duty to act responsibly and judiciously as the fact be determine will the foreign secretary join i in urge everyone in this house and beyond to be wary of disinformation and to avoid dangerous speculation before the fact be clear will he also update the house on what he be do to deal with outside power that might be seek to drive division on our own shore 
 the prime minister and the foreign secretary have rightly say that they be work to establish the fact look at intelligence with our ally and that must be right we also note president biden ’s comment early today can the foreign secretary confirm whether the uk government share that initial assessment i also ask he to share with we what information he can either publicly or on privy council term do he agree that those responsible for the death at the al ahli hospital must be hold to account 
 since hamas ’s appal terrorist attack on israel day ago labour have be crystal clear that we support israel ’s right to defend itself rescue hostage and protect its citizen secondly international law must be follow at all time and thirdly civilian must not be target aid must be provide and innocent life must be protect gaza be in the middle of an active humanitarian emergency innocent palestinian civilian be terrify for their life can the foreign secretary today commit that the government will leave no stone unturned in their diplomatic effort to secure humanitarian access to food water fuel electricity and medicine and to ensure the establishment of humanitarian corridor and the proper protection of humanitarian worker palestinian civilian in gaza must know that the world be not simply watch but act on their behalf 
 the right hon gentleman make a number of important point which i commend to the house a number of which i will respond to and indeed amplify he be absolutely right that this be an incredibly sensitive situation and not just for the region itself our desire to prevent this tragedy from expand into a regional conflict remain an absolute priority and of course we have a duty as a government i be sure it be a passion share by the whole house to ensure that jewish and muslim community in the uk be safe and feel safe and do not experience ramification from circumstance that be far beyond these shore and beyond their control 
 for that reason everybody particularly those who have a voice in the public sphere whether formal or informal should be particularly careful about what information they disseminate they should be particularly vigilant against disinformation and speculation be never useful i appreciate that the house and indeed the country will want to understand what be go on in   real time and sometimes the pause that we impose on ourselves to ensure that the information the government provide be accurate can be frustrating but i would prefer of course to be accurate rather than just to work at pace 
 the right hon gentleman be right that there be malign influence seek to take advantage of this terrible situation and we do guard against that we take note of what president biden have say but we will come to our own judgment we will work on that quickly and ensure that our assessment be put in the public domain as soon as we be confident of the detail 
 i call the father of the house 
 as the foreign secretary say we should soon know the direct cause of this explosion i will send he and the prime minister a letter that i have receive from the worthe islamic society i think that jewish people and other in my constituency will agree with every sentence it end by ask the government to use their influence and support to 
 encourage a peaceful and sustainable resolution that prioritise the right and well being of innocent civilian 
 catch up in the onslaught 
 the father of the house make an incredibly important point as a former minister for the middle east i be acutely conscious of the implication for islamic community both in the region and here in the uk and the protection of those people be as close to our heart as the protection of jewish people here in the uk we will relentlessly pursue what be the endure uk government position which be a viable state solution with israelis and palestinians live in peace side by side of course these circumstance be a setback but nevertheless we will not be fatalistic we will continue to work with israel the palestinian people and the wide region to bring about that positive aim 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it appear that what happen last night at the al ahli hospital in gaza be a war crime it be a crime against humanity and if that be the case there can be no hiding place for those who give the order and those who carry it out independent investigator must be allow to find out exactly who be responsible for this atrocity and have they bring before the international criminal court 
 the scene of death and destruction from last night be beyond harrowing but the tragic reality of this conflict be that innocent civilian life be be view as little more than collateral damage they be not collateral damage every single human life matter and they matter equally israeli include the hostage who must be immediately release and palestinian 
 today it be report that as a direct result of the draconian collective punishment against the civilian population of gaza child be die of thirst will the government now finally tell the israeli government that the imposition of a collective punishment be a crime that it be a breach of international humanitarian law and that it must end immediately 
 i note what the hon member have say about the incident at the al ahli hospital as i say we will be make a statement only when we be comfortable about the fact we have to be realistic that the opportunity for any kind of independent investigation go into gaza be severely limited which be why we be take the time to ensure that we get this right 
 in all our conversation with the israelis we have reinforce the need for the protection of civilian they understand that and they agree president herzog have make a commitment about adherence to international law we must however be completely clear that hamas accept no such limitation on their action they have specifically target civilian and child they go out of their way to identify and murder the most vulnerable and it be completely appropriate for israel to take action to protect its civilian and prevent hamas from perpetrate further atrocity in that country 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 the situation be unbearable but while the horror of last night can not be unseen we must not look away violence be increase across the region but also in europe and the us we in this house have a duty to protect british national so what assessment have the government make of whether the joint terrorism analysis centre need to raise the threat level can i also have reassurance about what be be do to protect out diplomatic staff around the world after the heinous attack we see on israeli and american embassy overnight 
 my hon friend make an incredibly important point we constantly assess the threat picture both here in the uk and in the region i have conduct an all staff meeting with foreign commonwealth and development office staff across the whole world i be tell that over people attend that briefing i make it clear that as their employer i regard my duty of care towards they as uppermost we do of course continue to support british national overseas include in the region and our consular team be maintain as well they can contact with british national in israel and indeed in gaza it be an incredibly difficult consular situation but i can assure the house that we will remain as far as we be able to in contact with those british national seek our support and we be consistently try to reopen exit route from gaza so that british national can leave 
 the foreign secretary will be aware of the horror with which the missile strike on a hospital in gaza which cause hundred upon hundred of casualty be regard not just here in britain but in the region and internationally the house have hear his injunction not to jump to conclusion but would he support a genuinely independent inquiry into what be happen 
 of course an independent inquiry be the gold standard in the event of such a circumstance but the simple truth in relation to have any kind of independent investigation in gaza be that the current situation bear in mind that our own embassy team there be severely limited in what they be able to do   and the international community be not able to operate freely make the practicality of that incredibly difficult we be make our own assessment we will gather and analyse as much information as we can we will not be lead by any other nation it will be a uk assessment of the situation once we have come to a conclusion we will share it with the house and the country 
 i be sure that my right hon friend and the government be wise not to rush to conclusion and to have a proper investigation before they come to a conclusion about what actually happen in this utterly appalling incident i be strike by the number of email i have receive from constituent who have already rush to conclusion and all blame israel do he agree that this show the important responsibility not only that broadcaster have to ensure they do not disseminate false information but that owner of social medium platform have to try to avoid hate be spread literally around the world at time like this 
 my right hon friend will know that within government action be be take to ensure that social medium owner act with great professionalism and great consciousness of the impact they have i would make a broad point to broadcaster i have have this conversation directly with they in the past which be that i believe there be an attempt by broadcaster to try to outpace social medium platform the day of break news on traditional platform be long in the past they should focus on accuracy rather than pace because their word have impact here in the uk and around the world 
 my heart break for everyone who lose their life in the episcopal hospital disaster last night it be now quite clear that even hospital be not a safe place of refuge anywhere in gaza that hospital be strike by a missile the week before yesterday i want to understand quite clearly from the foreign secretary why as we call on the country for humanitarian access to gaza we be not also call for an immediate ceasefire to enable that to happen it seem to i bizarre that we can not call for a ceasefire to enable that humanitarian corridor to open because the scale of death that be now unfold will reach tenfold over the next few day 
 in line with that i would really like to hear from the foreign secretary assurance that he be speak to our israeli counterpart to ensure that any gazans and palestinians who do evacuate will have an absolute right of return to their land and do not end up languish as the million of other palestinian refugee currently still do in both jordan and lebanon 
 i have conversation regularly with the israeli government and with the government of country in the neighbourhood about palestinian refugee i be unable to go into the detail because they be extensive but the hon member should be aware that we have always support palestinian refugee with the £ to the united nations relief and works agency and the recent announcement of an additional £ be a direct response to the situation there 
 the simple truth be that israel do have a right to defend itself the truth be that hamas have no interest in a ceasefire they have no interest in resolution they have never attempt to engage in a state solution and they have make every attempt to collapse the oslo process they be no friend of the palestinian people they have fire literally thousand of rocket into israel since saturday israel do have the right to take action to defend itself and to recover its hostage and the uk while respect that will of course always encourage it to adhere to international law and to protect civilian 
 the foreign secretary be surely right to say that we must not rush to judgment on this incident but do he agree that fact we know right now be that the primary moral and as a result legal responsibility for the appalling civilian life loss in gaza today and in the day ahead lie with hamas for their attack on israel and secondly for the systematic practice of use civilian as human shield 
 i know that my predecessor and right hon friend be very well read on this situation and i pay tribute to the work he do when he be foreign secretary and i be his minister for the middle east and north africa he be absolutely right and we must be clear eyed about the trigger event it be the most brutal mass murder in a terrorist action in the history of the state of israel and the large loss of jewish life on a single day since the holocaust of course israel have the right to defend itself and we must never forget that hamas ’s action of embed themselves in civilian community and put palestinian life intentionally at risk to pursue their political aim be completely unjustifiable 
 whatever the outcome of the independent inquiry into what happen with the tragedy in gaza yesterday in reality gaza be such a densely populate area that no matter what effort be make the effect of bombing will be indiscriminate if the government can not go as far as call for a ceasefire will they at least call for the end of the rocket and the bomb if they can not go as far as to call for the end of the bombing can they at least call on israel to stop bomb the south where refugee from gaza city be go at the instruction of the israeli army a cease in the bombing could trigger the negotiation that enable the release of the hostage 
 i pay tribute to the work of the international community in try to secure the release of the hostage my right hon friend the prime minister emphasise the work that the qataris be do in this instance they be not the only one do that and we will continue to support their effort i hear what the right hon gentleman say about call to stop the air attack on gaza from israel but the simple truth be that the alternative be a ground assault by israel and as he say the practicality of any military operation in an area as densely populate as gaza will be deeply challenging again i remind the house that the people who murder those reveller those partygoer those child and those old people embe themselves in civilian community in hospital in school specifically to use innocent palestinians as human shield we must all understand the culpability that they hold for many   of these civilian casualty but i will of course once again speak with the israelis about make every effort that they be able to make to minimise civilian casualty 
 whoever be responsible for the hospital attack last evening it be an appalling human tragedy and we think of all those who have lose their loved one at this time i welcome the foreign secretary ’s commitment to be evidence lead in what the government say about this incident do he agree that if the uk intelligence community whether that be gchq the secret intelligence service defence intelligence and so on be have to take time and deliberate in order to come to a conclusion perhaps all of we in this place include medium organisation outside this place should also show the same caution and consideration before make statement that could prove incendiary 
 my right hon friend make an incredibly important point there be of course the completely understandable desire of medium outlet to report promptly but i believe they have a great duty to report accurately and responsibly word that emanate from the uk be take seriously we have huge standing in the world and thing that be say at the dispatch box in this house and on our medium be listen to around the world therefore we have an enhance duty to ensure that the word we say be accurate 
 i deplore the loss of all civilian life israeli and palestinian and i commend the foreign secretary for his caution over attribute blame for last night ’s attack do he think that we should also be cautious about the figure for casualty come from gaza they do not describe all as civilian casualty there be reason to believe that there be a very high volume of hamas combatant among those figure 
 the hon gentleman make an important point i be not go to minimise the pain and suffering of those palestinian family who have lose love one and have people injure but we know that just as hamas be abuse the palestinian people they also abuse the figure that they put in the public domain we must be highly sceptical of any information come out of hamas just as the prime minister say we should be we remain focused on try to reduce the pain and suffering of the palestinian people as well as support israel and its self defence while do so we should be deeply deeply sceptical of any and all information come from hamas spokesperson 
 i commend my right hon friend for his caution we should remind ourselves of the word of mark twain 
 a lie can travel half way around the world 
 before the truth have get its boot on never more certainly be that the case than here i remind hon member that hamas bear complete responsibility for everything our heart go out to all the innocent who have die and suffer of course they do but hamas be the perpetrator and they have bring this on themselves we remind ourselves that when they murder all those israeli jews in the territory they film they and commit atrocity deliberately that be to remind   the israelis of the holocaust and what be likely to come do the foreign secretary agree that broadcaster should not enter into discursive debate when as issue such as this happen they should report the fact as know and nothing far 
 my right hon friend speak with authority and clarity on this and i find myself in complete agreement with he i have jewish friend who be try to keep their child off social medium because they know that they will be assault with image of israelis who have be murder and whose body have be desecrate no in the modern era should have to endure that kind of repeat pain 
 evacuation order in the past week have include hospital but many vulnerable people be unable to move because of their disability or illness what conversation have the foreign secretary have directly with uk aid agency and non governmental organisation about that situation what more can the uk do to ensure that civilian population include medical and aid worker be protect 
 the hon lady raise an incredibly important point and my department remain in close co ordination with international aid agency and ngos we recognise the practical difficulty of that evacuation order and in a highly dense area such as gaza we completely understand those practical difficulty particularly for medical organisation as imperfect as it may be attempt to remove civilian from a future area of military operation stand in sharp contrast with the action of hamas who be actively seek to prevent people from leave an area of future conflict and intentionally put civilian in the way use innocent palestinians as human shield 
 i commend the foreign secretary and his opposition shadow for their tone but the fact be that last night an evil terrorist organisation that murder jews and oppress palestinians be instantly believe in a number of quarter whereas many refuse to acknowledge that jewish baby have be brutally murder without demand graphic proof do the foreign secretary agree that unsubstantiated report such as those we see last night might actually cost life because they inflame tension in an already highly volatile region 
 my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right everything have a cost and rush inaccurate reporting cost life everybody whether they be formally involve in the reporting process a citizen journalist or just active on social medium should be very conscious that this involve real life in the most sensitive of circumstance and that such reporting could have repercussion not just in the area or the region but in this country as well 
 we rightly unite to condemn the barbaric action of hamas against innocent israelis and the loss of palestinian life and the unfold humanitarian crisis be a profound tragedy the scene at al ahli hospital shock we all and i hope the secretary of state will do everything to ensure an independent investigation but people in gaza be trap   so what more will he do to ensure consular support not just on the ground there but to family heartbroken back here in the uk will he hear and heed the word of nadia el nakla the wife of our scottish minister whose family be trap there right now she say 
 we be not watch a natural disaster this can be stop 
 the consular department in the fcdo have get in contact with the family of those british national who be trap in gaza and we be provide ongoing consular support the hon lady will understand that the experience of the minister his wife and their family be a live example of the plight of a number of family information be incomplete our access be severely limited and sadly we have to rely on a number of interlocutor and people over whom we do not have direct control include hamas we will continue to support british national as well we can until they have be evacuate from that area 
 fact that be not in dispute be that every rocket fire from gaza into israel be aim at murder civilian in stark contrast to israeli defensive action last night there be member in this place include senior member scurry around state as fact that this incident be cause by an israeli rocket the bbc and other medium refer to statement by hamas officials”—i think they mean to say hamas terrorist and present they as fact without challenge that not only risk radicalisation of community in this country where we already know there be a problem with antisemitism but put jews at risk i urge colleague to be careful of their comment give the role that blood libel play in promote antisemitism 
 my hon friend make an incredibly important point and i restate my request of all people comment on this whether they have a formal role within the medium or be in a high profile position such as member of this house to be thoughtful of the implication of their action to be sceptical of all information come out from hamas and to take a little extra time to verify which can literally save life here and abroad 
 i know this situation be complex and the taking of life and hostage whether israeli or palestinian be abhorrent but we have to recognise that palestinians can not defend themselves they have no mean and now their place of sanctuary such as hospital be no long safe place either for that reason i urge the foreign secretary once more to call for a ceasefire so that we can see a de escalation in this horrific conflict 
 of course everybody i will rephrase that all reasonable people want this terrible situation to be resolve and resolve quickly this be not a conflict that israel ask for it be a conflict that they be force to engage in because of the mass murder in their country perpetrate by hamas terrorist who embe themselves in school hospital and in civilian community   call for ceasefire be all well and good but i have see nothing nothing that lead i to believe that hamas would respect call for a ceasefire 
 may i say to my right hon friend that whatever the investigation find out in a sense it will not matter a great deal to all those who be dead in the hospital whether the israeli explanation be correct that it be an islamic jihad missile that misfire and then land among explosive that be on the hospital site that then kill so many people or whether it be an israeli strike in the end both side have now commit war crime if they be just additional crime be add to the ledger on either side that be simply what it will be i say to my right hon friend in his relation with israel and in reinforce the position of the prime minister that the only way to get out of this mess be a ceasefire otherwise we will not see the relief of people who be starve and be dehydrate to death that be a collective punishment which be illegal under international law follow the deportation of people from northern gaza which again be illegal under international law there be specific offence that have already take place and i say to my right hon friend for all our sake he should work as he say with clear minded determination to get the good answer from our ally 
 the house need to understand that prior to hamas ’s terrorist attack ten of thousand of gazans pass through the border into israel every day in order to work israel provide often without payment water electricity and gas to the people of gaza that be interrupt as a direct result of hamas ’s brutal terrorist action thousand of rocket be fire from gaza into israel from in and among school hospital and civilian community we do of course always remind israel as we would any other nation involve in military operation of their duty under international law president herzog israel ’s head of state have reinforce that commitment we hear no such commitment from hamas 
 last night ’s absolute tragedy of the explosion at the al ahli hospital will simply intensify passion and polarise the debate even more many child and young people here in the uk will have see the image on our television and screen and on social medium platform and i think they will be influence by that while i thank the government for the money and support they be give to the organisation protect faith school mosque and synagogue can the minister tell we what he be do to provide advice and support to ordinary school and our university where there be an intensification of hatred emerge and where i be hear of both antisemitic and islamophobic view be express and attack be work on individual 
 the right hon lady make an incredibly important point while i will not go into detail of conversation in cabinet i can assure she that the protection of all community in the uk be something that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities highlight that very much go hand in hand with the commitment that the home secretary have make that we will protect all community   in the uk muslim jewish and other and we will work with institution whether educational institution or other to try to ensure that the people at those institution can go about their life free from fear intimidation and discrimination 
 i very much agree with the foreign secretary that the entity responsible for the loss of life we be see now be hamas a terrorist barbaric organisation that kill innocent jewish people the question now be about do everything we can to save life of both israeli and palestinian people who be innocent in that regard i welcome the government ’s commitment to humanitarian assistance for the ordinary people of palestine and the foreign secretary ’s differentiation like the prime minister ’s differentiation between the people of palestine and the terrorist organisation hamas 
 the foreign secretary say that move forward we will work towards a state solution the people in the region want to know what that state solution be be that base on security council resolution and the border which the united kingdom sign up to what be a clear framework for that the chairman of the foreign affairs committee my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have previously ask for the uk to appoint an envoy to the region we have brilliant contender if i may say so in william hague the foreign former secretary who get the region and alistair burt a brilliant well respect former minister we have choice and option when will the foreign secretary outline that part of the next step 
 my hon friend make some important point the truth be that we remain committed to a state solution with palestinians and israelis live side by side in peace and prosperity while at the moment and in these circumstance that might feel like an unachievable aim we refuse to be fatalistic and give up that aspiration the detail will be for negotiation but he and the house will have hear we say on a number of occasion that it will be base on the border with land swap and a share capital in jerusalem but we will not be dogmatic what we want to see be peace bring about i hear what he say about appoint a special envoy we have some of our most capable people in our post in tel aviv and jerusalem and in gaza 
 i repeat my condemnation of the hamas attack against innocent israeli citizen we see civilian in gaza forcibly move from their home with no guarantee of safety or return yet the government fail to speak out we see food water and electricity cut off in gaza yet the government fail to speak out last night we see the destruction of a hospital in gaza the government now need to speak out 
 will the foreign secretary support the international criminal court investigation into the situation in palestine give that the prosecutor have say that its mandate include the current context that so obviously and urgently must include investigation of the hospital explosion we need to ensure that no more blood be spill we need a ceasefire now 
 i must say to the hon lady that her assessment of the uk government ’s voice on this issue be fundamentally wrong we have consistently discuss with israel and publicly our commitment to humanitarian law she need to understand that a military force highlight a future potential area of conflict and encourage people to move away from that area of conflict be not force relocation interruption it be not force relocation i draw her attention to the action that hamas have take to prevent innocent palestinians from move away from place of danger the contrast could not be more stark 
 give that we do not know the fact about what happen and whether for example this be a ghastly mistake we should be here not to blame but to mourn the loss of so many doctor staff and patient at the al ahli arab hospital which i and several other hon member from the house visit more than a decade ago it be found in the late century by the episcopal church in jerusalem and be run by it to this day so it be likely that christians as well as muslims will have lose their life 
 will my right hon friend whose approach have be appropriately calm at a time when we need to reduce and not inflame tension both domestically and in the middle east do his good to stay in touch with the anglican church to see if it have more information about what have happen to those who be there to see how we can help re establish what be a valuable programme for example it provide free breast cancer treatment and mobile clinic and do all he can to think about how in the long term we can enable people in that troubled land to co exist in a way that we have for so long fail to do support the united nations relief and works agency as far as possible on its humanitarian mission
