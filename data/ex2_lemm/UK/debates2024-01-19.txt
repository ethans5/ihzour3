i entirely agree give the tragedy that they have experience it would have be possible for ceri and frances menai davis to simply collapse but they do not they decide that they be go to do something positive so they set up a charity the enthusiasm and strength of determination that that couple bring to this situation be something to be see and i certainly pay tribute to they 
 my right hon friend the member for charnwood respond to the debate by explain that we be work on achieve well long term plan for the early diagnosis of cancer include rare cancer and on try to prevent what have happen to jessica from happen again hertfordshire ’s hospital trust be work extremely hard on that the government ’s aim be for   quarter of cancer to be diagnose at stage or which would enable an additional people to survive cancer for year long than they do now as well as new hospital we need to see that improvement in diagnosis which be already take place in the rapid diagnostic centre and service that the new integrate care board have be press for there be currently live rapid diagnostic centre pathway in addition east and north hertfordshire nhs trust inform by experience such as jessica ’s but also bear in mind what have happen in the case of hugh be work on a much more co ordinated multi disciplinary approach 
 what this show be that we be at the start of a new era with well hospital service and an understanding of the need to prioritise cancer not just in the elderly but in the young and in respect of not just the well know cancer but the rare one i pay tribute to the work of the all party parliamentary group on cancer which i support 
 the aspect of the bill raise by my constituent be the financial impact on parent of have to spend month in hospital support sick young child my constituent be self employ and it cost he a lot to put his child but he be able to manage not only because of his strong personal finance but because of the support of his family in keep his business go however he fear for other who be less fortunate and find themselves in the same position he give i example of people his charity be help people who be lose their livelihood to support their child in hospital as i have say i have raise the financial issue with ministers in the department for work and pensions and the department of health and social care and i have be point to some limited help for parent such as leave entitlement often unpaid and bereavement leave as well as universal credit under which if income go down the benefit go up parent who have work for the same employer for at least a year be entitle to week of unpaid parental leave and there may be help from disability and carer benefit after a period 
 in this bill i ask for a report to be make to parliament by the secretary of state on the merit of provide financial support to the parent of child receive care in hospital for extended period i be ask for an assessment of current policy and the likely effect of some additional support on both parent and child and i be ask the government to consult parent healthcare professional charity and other offer support 
 although it ’ never you be the focus of what ceri and frances be do i have also hear from other charity such as together for short life which talk about the huge financial strain on family of have a child in hospital and young live vs cancer that charity want i to raise particular issue the nhs do offer a healthcare travel cost support scheme but apparently the operation of that scheme be not very helpful it be ponderous and do not deliver the money quickly enough perhaps that be something the report could look into 
 i hope it will also be possible for a meeting to take place between the minister and mr and mrs menai davis so that they can explain what they hope to get from the process the bill would not cost a great deal as there be so few case but it would mean that in tragic circumstance all parent could concentrate on help   their child rather than worry about money in a way the bill be also about ceri menai davis and his wife frances be able to help other parent who find themselves in the situation they find themselves in 
 the report be likely to touch on some of the other issue that family have take up with ministers and that i have raise in my remark and i hope it will inform a holistic approach to improve care for young cancer patient and their parent it would be a legacy for hugh we could call it hugh ’s report 
 mr deputy speaker sir roger gale i call the opposition front bencher 
 vicky foxcroft lewisham deptford lab i congratulate   the right hon and learn member for north east hertfordshire sir oliver heald   on put forward such articulate argument i hope he will not mistake my brevity for not be absolutely serious but i be certain that he want to hear from the minister as do the family in the gallery as such i will leave my remark there i be happy to share the note that i have prepare if the right hon and learn member would like they labour will support the bill 
 the minister for employment jo churchill i thank   the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft and thank and congratulate my right hon and learn friend   the member for north east hertfordshire sir oliver heald   for bring this important issue to the floor of the house i know as he have explain today and in previous conversation with i that when ceri and frances contact he after the tragic loss of their son hugh to a rare cancer at the tender age of he be motivate to see how he could help to ensure that parent be support at such a difficult time i know that i speak for everyone in this place when i say that our heart go out to they 
 i be move when i read my right hon and learn friend ’s speech from last september and again today i understand personally the disbelief behind the word of frances and the name she have give to their charity to help parent of very ill child who be in hospital for extended period it ’ never you the challenge be that sometimes it be the purpose behind the bill be to enable research and produce a report on both the emotional and tangible support that be available and that which be need like the support that the charity be give but look at thing in a more join up way to work well and more effectively for parent during such difficult time 
 i stand here as somebody who have have cancer more than once you do not choose it it choose you as ceri and frances know your world be turn upside down your day be drive by medical appointment and the need to have question answer juggle life ’s issue alongside want to do anything to try to protect your child and make the pain go away my right hon and learn friend have speak to i about ceri and frances ’s motivation to do something for parent who have also travel the journey of their child have an extended period in hospital and some of the financial emotional and physical worry that that bring 
 i wish to take a moment to lay out what support be available but i will do so rapidly because my right hon and learn friend go over it there be help to deal with some of the financial worry the disabled child addition be available to low income family on universal credit who be entitle to qualifying disability benefit such as the child disability living allowance a parent of a child who qualify for that support can also claim carer ’s allowance as a result of their additional responsibility if they and their partner be provide at least hour of care each week additional support be available to family on universal credit who may need further help for family sadly affect by bereavement there be fund in england and scotland to help with funeral expense 
 for people on universal credit an open discussion with their support work coach allow for health and caring responsibility to be account for and enable access to support i note that ceri have work with addenbrooke ’s hospital to share his and frances ’s experience to inform the team as they plan the new child ’s hospital i know that the hospital have be keen to ensure that family and patient feed in their experience alongside clinician that be a pioneer world model of care that look to treat the whole child both their physical and emotional need as well as provide paediatric genomic medicine 
 behind every young patient wherever they be treat right across the country be a family i recognise how difficult it be to navigate the practical and emotional challenge that be why it ’ never you and charity like it make a huge difference and play a pivotal role in support family and i thank they all for their work i reiterate the word of the my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon parent voice be so important 
 i hope that i have the house ’s support have already speak to the minister for health and secondary care my right hon friend   the member for pendle andrew stephenson   to ensure that we can work closely he have assure i that he stand ready to look at what can be do and to support we in ensure that the right conversation be hold i know that it be charity such as it ’ never you that most often help parent to access practical support and connect with other family who be go through comparable experience gain moral support and love from each other and share way to overcome issue and stop the pain of thinking that they be the only one 
 i know that nothing stop the lie awake at night watch the clock tick through the hour and hop for miracle but we want to help family who be go through such difficult time i commit from the dispatch box to work closely with my right hon and learn friend the member for north east hertfordshire on this important issue in particular we be commit to establish a stakeholder forum to consult parent whose child have receive care in hospital for an extended period and with healthcare professional charity civil society and organisation that offer related support we want to hear about people ’s experience understand their concern and listen to idea and suggestion and then develop a set of potential proposal base on the feedback 
 i suggest that a meeting with my office be arrange at the early opportunity so that ceri and frances ’s knowledge can help to drive and determine who will be key to that consultation i will personally ensure that the forum be establish in a timely manner and that it progress quick than a legislative route would allow to that end i suggest to my right hon and learn friend that he withdraw the bill that we begin discussion now and in ceri ’s word that there be purpose to the pain 
 mr deputy speaker sir roger gale with the leave of the house i call sir oliver heald to wind up 
 sir oliver heald i be delighted by the response which basically give i what i ask for in the bill of course if the bill go through all stage in this house and the lords it would take many month before we could start the process i think my hon friend the minister say that she hop to meet the month period for the report at the end on that basis i be delighted go forward with her proposal which short circuit the process i beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion

 stella creasy walthamstow lab co op the government intend to introduce a charge of £ a time to import thing from the eu into the uk from april that might come as a surprise to many business because they do not know about it and most of our constituent likely do not i think that be because the government be not even sure that they want to do it today i hope to get some answer about the border operating model on behalf of all those who will pay the price if it actually happen namely the british public 
 brexit be the gift that keep give like contract recurrent food poisoning we think we have see the bad of it only to feel that sick feeling in our stomach again pint of wine and blue passport can not make up for the inflationary impact of this late dose of extra paperwork and delay for the avoidance of doubt we have leave the european union the government can not make brexit work and it be cause problem to million of people every day i be not stand here advocate that we ask to rejoin either frankly with all the problem we be face for business and job because of it we do not have time for such treaty negotiation 
 this debate be about what this government be do now to manage our border and the very real consequence of their decision for food security and the cost and nutrition of food currently the uk import around of our food we be self sufficient for our trade with other country be the reason why we have food to eat and be not all just eat turnip and cabbage delicious though those home grow delicacy be in we import £ worth of fruit and vegetable from the eu £ worth of drink and the same amount of meat the eu account for of all the dairy beef egg and pork product come to the uk and nearly third of all food and feed not of animal origin some of that be from just country the netherlands ireland germany and france 
 it be little wonder that brexit have already hit our food price and supply research from the centre for economic performance at the london school of economics show that we all see the empty shelf and rationing and business be clear that it be brexit not ukraine and the energy crisis that be push up the price of production and cause all those problem 
 that be all before we even get to the new import control it be a combination of high transport cost supply chain design custom complexity and reduced volume whatever we do at the border will be critical to the nation ’s capacity to eat more than porridge give that oat be of the few thing for which we produce of what we consume 
 let we not pretend that other country can pick up the slack for we although the government be negotiate free trade agreement with other country and have agree these will not be able to replace the food we import from the eu and if we care about animal welfare we should want to work with the eu because it still have equivalent animal welfare standard contrary to australia and new zealand from which food can now be import tariff free without any equivalence to   our welfare standard frankly geography matter which be why add more friction to the process will lead not only to shortage and delay but to inflation and cost for everyone 
 under this tory hard brexit we leave the eu customs union the single market and the vat area and we have be threaten our own custom control ever since understandably business have be drive mad by the fact that those control have be postpone time in the meantime we have all be stick with the bill at the checkout 
 the white elephant of brexit stand empty at our expense as the government have spend more than £ on border facility and job sevington in kent cost £ include £ on the border control post infrastructure alone and £ have be spend on portsmouth £ on holyhead and £ on north weald i be sure those community would rather use the money for something else 
 in theory all of that will finally change this year in just day time if business want to import pork beef reindeer camel frog leg cream yoghurt flour beeswax but not honey or animal paw they will need a health certificate that all mean find a vet who will sign the health check 
 minister have tell i that more than half of the expect £ annual cost of the scheme to business will come from these certificate but they have also say that it be not as bad as the more onerous tracking system they previously suggest which would have cost business £ a year frankly that be like i tell my kid that they should be grateful that i have let they keep the bell on their lindt bunny because i be originally go to take that too along with all the chocolate 
 health certificate be thing but the government have also be consult on introduce a charge to cover the cost of the scheme the so call common user charge that be plan for april just day away the consultation say the charge could be £ but it might be less or more it would be helpful for british business to know whether it be come in at all in day time as well as know what the charge will be 
 the charge be intend to apply to each consignment whether it be leg of lamb or a van full of reindeer and frog leg as of lorry come into this country carry multiple consignment know as groupage it be clear how expensive this way of apply the charge will be the government have therefore choose to fund the new border by impose fee directly on business that import the pledge that brexit would be a bonfire of regulation turn into a smoulder pile of paperwork that will kill import for small business 
 it do not have to be that way a veterinary deal with europe could remove the requirement for export health certificate join the pan european mediterranean convention which be wide than the eu and include israel and north african country would also help as business could make use of the eu hub where product from outside be often consolidated 
 frankly even if business pay there be no guarantee that they will get a service the government be plan to check just of import just when i think it could not get any more complicated in day time   they want to introduce safety and security declaration for all eu import these will be require even if the pallet come in on a truck be empty it rely on the single trade window process not be a total disaster yet at present business have no idea whether the technology be work 
 of course all of this be different for business trade from northern ireland those not for eu sticker which will help to protect the border with the eu and ireland reflect the lunacy of all those people who try to argue that technology could prevent trade barrier in a situation where we be the small market it be not hard to see that when company trade in multiple nation be face with such policy they will move away from do business with we focus instead on less complicated market between and the eu account for to of uk export by that have already fall to 
 trader in belgium have already publicly say that they be not go to spend any more time try to figure out what the government be up to they say that they have be march up the hill too many time only for the scheme to be delay at the last minute they say that they be willing to risk friction rather than the paperwork 
 the institute of export and international trade point out that more than different measure on import will come into force between the end of last september and the end of this year the freight representative point out that the lorry driver need to go through the same entry and exit system and will be in the queue behind the schoolkid and the holidaymaker under- go check they will be stick behind those school coach with all the knock on effect for the picking up and transportation of import consignment the representative say they estimate that would create around mile of freight traffic turn dover into a literal lorry park little wonder that nichola mallon logistics uk ’s head of trade policy say that business have still not be give all of the detail and guidance they need to plan and prepare and that there be a high risk of delay traffic congestion high price and reduce choice for consumer 
 we all understand the need for check to stop thing such as african swine flu but give that this country have not even sign up to be part of the share biosecurity alert it be clear that there be other thing we could do to help tackle that those charge with run the service certainly have their doubt health inspector at dover have have a cut to their funding to do any of the work to try to stop infection reach our shore in the place those in dover would know about all this because they be in the frontline goodness know what be happen in the west coast port which be operate to a different timetable that will open up further loophole and complication with port such as holyhead pembroke and fishguard which be the land bridge to ireland also face confusion 
 i have a series of question for the minister and i hope that she will take intervention when she respond so that we can get to the bottom of this and foremost can the minister actually confirm whether any check will be make to lorry on our border in day time to see whether the good in they have environmental health certificate what work be her   government do to ensure that there be enough vet in europe to provide the certificate can she confirm whether they even exist 
 if there be not go to be check on lorry in day time as she have previously tell business when will the health certificate check come in what will happen to a lorry that do not have can she confirm that the opening hour for the border control post match the just in time supply chain so that we do not see lorry of rot food sit in our port wait to be check when will the common user charge be apply and what will it be if it be common it should be uniform so can she tell business here and now whether it be happen and what it will be per consignment or whether it will take account of groupage the government say in december that they would provide this information and business be still wait 
 will the minister confirm what the common user charge will cover be it in addition to all the other charge from the port health authority and the animal and plant health agency and do it cover custom fee if the check be not go to be make when will they be make what will she do about traffic management in kent currently there be inspector in the port of dover how many have her department assess be need and why be only of they be check if this be about biosecurity what will they do if a lorry go to the wrong port or try to shop around do she expect different border control port to charge the same fee for their service or will they set their own how will she stop those lorry from try to game the system 
 can the minister tell we about the status of the single trade window project and whether fujitsu be involve in its delivery at all the government have admit that this will cause inflation but they be try to claim it be go to be just over year in their response to i they say that 
 will depend greatly on how business adapt their business model and supply chain to integrate the new control regime 
 put the pressure on business to pay for the government ’s scheme 
 will the minister clarify what the variation might be if business do not do that and what have be calculate into inflation if they can not get to grip with the government ’s new system what impact be her department predict that the situation will have on food price in that year not over year but in the year why will this government not come clean on the data source they be use to make those calculation what commercial confidentiality behind calculate inflation and the impact of the policy possibly trump the public ’s right to know how expensive it will be to put food on the table 
 no doubt the minister will say that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would cost business more than this scheme but will she set out the cost of the administration of this project separately from the health check that the government have calculate can she clarify the timetable for the introduction of the west coast port charge and what the difference in the regime will be will she explain why the government have not negotiate a veterinary deal be they even look at the pan euro mediterranean convention to try to solve these problem without give business all this extra   paperwork above all what be she do to warn the public about the potential impact on their food supply and cost or be she prepared to say here and now on the record that there will be no delay in food provision no shortage and no increase in price 
 nobody want to eat meat that have be sit in the dock or beeswax that be off even if it have a health certificate when it start its journey because of what be happen the uk have already drop from in the world bank logistic performance index to joint the main challenge result from border friction which be contribute to the decline in just in time supply chain and efficient custom 
 it do not take a rocket scientist to work out that this scheme will clearly make thing hard for british business no wonder it have be delay time with so many people struggle with the cost of living crisis surely the good thing be to think again the scheme will make thing hard for british business at bad it will be a nightmare i ask the minister will she give people some relief and say that it be off again 
 the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 it be a privilege to come out at the top of the private member ’s bill ballot for this parliamentary session it be a ballot i have enter at every opportunity since i be elect in so it be great to be draw but to be draw be a huge responsibility i be on my way to get the train to my constituency in sunderland and when i get off the tube at king ’s cross my phone have dozen of message my immediate reaction be that the government must have call a general election but no that be something else we can look forward to in the year ahead i have in fact be draw at the top of the ballot 
 i be delighted to be here in the chamber to present a bill that will make important and long await amendment to the building societies act it be a bill that the sector want a bill that be true to labour and co operative value and importantly a bill that have receive government support although it will not solve all of the issue in the broken housing market it could free up and make available more money to lend in mortgage and because building society lend more in percentage term to time buyer it should enable more time buyer to get on to the housing ladder clearly there also need to be wholesale reform of the rental market in order to address the housing crisis that we have in this country today 
 i must take this opportunity to thank everyone who contact i about issue and with proposal for potential bills i would have happily take many of they forward but i could choose only bill however i feel that the bill i have choose can make a real difference to people ’s life especially young people ’s life i hope it will support time buyer and more community base banking in the interest of work people 
 the entire point of building society be to compete with bank on a truly level playing field they be found to enable work people to own their own home that be why this bill be so important as my hon friend say it will expand that ownership particularly to young people and time buyer do she agree that not only should we absolutely be do this but it should already have be do 
 i absolutely agree but the bureaucracy of government sometimes get in the way of thing happen 
 the bill will help level the playing field enable building society to compete more fairly with bank it will support they to lend more money in a safe and secure way over half of building society lending—55%—goes to time buyer crucially as the building society sector direct a great proportion of lend to time buyer than bank do there be a theme here that will benefit more people look to get on to the housing ladder 
 modernisation of build society legislation be long overdue there be some archaic requirement about the way build society fund themselves that put they at a competitive disadvantage compare with bank competition in banking be good for consumer and give that building society drive innovation particularly in support time buyer strengthen the sector be a great route to support aspiration across the uk at the same time as support a sector that work co operatively and mutually build society work for the benefit of their member up and down the country engage in a system of co operative banking for mutual benefit not for profit 
 we be lucky to have building society in my sunderland central constituency newcastle yorkshire and nationwide building society all have branch in sunderland so i see at hand the excellent support they give to member it be incredibly important to my constituent to have a branch that they can visit to talk through any financial issue and receive the support they need face to face i see the work of build society as both a strong british tradition and a strong labour tradition i be delighted to have the support of the co operative party and the building societies association which represent both tradition 
 the form of a building society be in when richard ketley bring people together in a pub in what be now the constituency of my hon friend   the member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood   to put money into a share fund collect regular subscription until there be sufficient fund to be able to provide a house for of they they draw name very much like the drawing of name for a private member ’s bill to decide which member would be the next beneficiary this continue until all member of the group have a house the arrangement require trust hope and a commitment by the community that no would be leave behind 
 at that time most building society be create as terminate society which mean that the building society terminate trade once all its member be house so many be create house their member and then disappear that practice continue until by 1825—50 year after the building society be create over terminate building society be in operation although it take until for the non termination society to be form the metropolitan equitable 
 in the legislation deal with the industry be introduce recognise build society for the time in this house through the regulation of benefit building societies act the legislation along with previous court case lead to the formal recognition of the right of build society as entity result in a boom in the sector by the number of building   society have rise to almost in the building societies act be pass an historic precursor to the building societies act which i hope to amend through my bill 
 the history of building society have play an important role in the history of work people support each other in their mutual ambition of own their own home and in financial institution serve the community they represent it be a trend that be even more prevalent today as bank shut branch at an alarming rate build society be gradually take a big share of branch in the community that remain open build society now account for of all high street branch in the uk as oppose to only year ago although this may be cause by the closure of bank branch in the main it show a commitment to keep branch open by build society on which so many of my constituent rely that face to face engagement personal support and visibility be so important to many people branch be so much more accessible to those who have specific need especially in the digital age where those with internet access often have the good opportunity and access to the good deal 
 the original purpose of building society embody the famous phrase in clause of the labour party ’s constitution that 
 by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone 
 with community come together to support each other and provide a strong and secure economic foundation for their collective future family in sunderland and across the country be struggle to find a secure home research by the resolution foundation show that of to year old would prefer to buy their own home than to rent home ownership be something many strive for to provide financial security and ultimately to turn a house into a home my bill aim to support they in do just that 
 as i have say it be quite clear that there be a housing crisis in this country for homeowner and renter we must at this point consider the damage do by the previous prime minister and her chancellor and the economic damage cause by her government to the country especially people with mortgage i believe we also need reform in the rental sector to sort this out the system be break and be not work for people the bill will go some way towards make the housing ownership landscape easy for all 
 i support the bill as i hope do members across all party it be good to see something that will hopefully strengthen the principle of mutuality do the hon lady agree that be an important principle to retain and be she confident that her bill will do that will it lead to a situation in which there be less desire among build society to become bank 
 i agree building society be certainly part of my life when i be grow up i get my mortgage with a building society a very long time ago because i be get old the principle of mutuality be really important and do set building society apart from bank they be a very different model and serve community in a much close way than bank do 
 by introduce welcome flexibility to a sector that do so much for time buyer and other the bill although it do not directly provide provision for the building of home or assure the retail customer of any extended product line do provide more room for the sector to work in give that its use of finance be different from that of bank as it lend significant amount of money to time buyer 
 the building society sector be make up of separate building society and currently have almost member it hold over £ of mortgage asset and £ of saving from individual it be not a small sector but it be a sector that can grow 
 building society face significant challenge the bill have the potential to unlock billion of pound in additional lending capacity for they it be estimate that for every £ of new lending capacity the sector could support an additional mortgage as we know over half of build society lending go to time buyer so the potential impact of the bill be huge since build society in the north east and cumbria have lend £ to time buyer in the month of last year they support nearly time buyers—4,000 people who last year start their journey of home ownership with all the financial security and benefit that bring increase lending capacity be incredibly important in support hard work people it be essential to the uk ’s future prosperity and desperately need for economic growth 
 i want briefly to run through the clause of the bill and the impact the change will have it be not a standalone bill it amend the building societies act by insert new provision clause deal with fund that can be disregard by a building society for the purpose of calculate its wholesale funding limit the act currently require they to obtain at least of funding from their member from individual member deposit the retention of this minimum requirement ensure that the member remain the primary owner of building society it be what make the sector so unique the other can come from external source this balance will not be change but there be a need to modernise the rule govern the sector in order for build society to compete with bank on a level playing field 
 the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority engage with the sector on this issue in the conclusion of the government ’s consultation recommend the exclusion of some source of funding from build society wholesale funding limit calculation as well as the modernisation element that come later in the bill the recommendation be never implement which be why the bill be need 
 clause will disregard the following from the wholesale funding limit bank of england liquidity insurance facility debt instrument raise to meet the minimum regulatory requirement for own fund and eligible liability requirement and sum receive under sale and repurchase agreement with a view to comply with prudential regulation authority rule 
 these change will not dilute the unique ownership model under which build society operate they will not increase the financial risk to the sector because these liquidity insurance facility the debt instrument and the sale and repurchase agreement sum will be effective tool at a time of national economic crisis to   ensure that building society remain comfortably solvent and active in the interest of their member these change will help to future proof build society from external factor economic shock or period of financial stress 
 the specify facility and so on will be describe in a statutory instrument lay by the government of the day which will provide additional detail to allow the funding disregard broadly describe in subsection to be activate the bill be design so that any government at any give time can react to the need of the building society sector the bank of england and the prudential regulation authority enable such change in regulation to be make by mean of secondary legislation will make the sector much more sustainable and able to react to change in circumstance 
 the change present in the bill form part of the edinburgh reform all the response to the government consultation be in support of these change prudent lending be crucial to the uk ’s economic growth make this change will make building society safe more secure and competitive in the long term without affect their status as mutual 
 clause be about modernisation it amend the act to explicitly allow the option of real time virtual member participation in build society meeting the change present in the bill align the sector with modernisation make to company law by section 360a of the companies act it will allow virtual attendance and voting as part of hybrid meeting make it clear that nothing in the act preclude this allow hybrid meeting will improve accessibility and will hopefully allow engagement from member who can not currently travel to meeting enable a broad cross section of member to participate 
 clause be another modernising clause in simple term it will enable the treasury to introduce increase flexibility for society in relation to common seal and the execution of document in line with company it reserve to the treasury the right to make provision by regulation in future upon which further consultation in the sector would be usual 
 finally clause iv define the territorial extent of the bill which cover all nation and specifie that the bill 
 come into force at the end of the period of month begin with the day on which it be pass 
 the standard period set out in legislation 
 the bill have no implication for public fund as the impact assessment show and do not contain any provision that will require a money resolution or a ways and means resolution 
 ultimately the bill do a lot of thing in a succinct way it will enable the modernisation of the building society sector and bring it up to date it will put the sector on a more level playing field with bank and it will potentially allow they more scope for support their member or future member the bill have overwhelming support from the sector include from the building societies association the representative body of the sector and its member the bsa be found in and be now the voice of the sector represent building society and credit union and serve member up and down the uk 
 the sector have help people to buy a home with mortgage total over £ that account for of total outstanding mortgage balance in the uk the building society that the bsa represent account for of cash saving in the uk and of all cash isa balance across the country the sector employ people both full time and part time work in around branch in the uk the bsa contribute greatly to the consultation process in and i be proud that it support the bill i also wish to thank his majesty ’s treasury for the support it give i in prepare for today ’s reading 
 the bill will make building society lend on a similar basis to bank free up more money to help more work people in the uk it have the potential to unlock billion of pound of additional lending capacity at a time when so many people need it i commend it to the house 
 it be a huge pleasure able to join friday business as a back bencher and to support this important bill on behalf of my mid norfolk constituent let i start by congratulate   the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott   on introduce the bill and on win that prize place in the ballot so that she can make a difference with the bill i thank the government for work with she and all of we who have support she on the bill this be a good example of cross party work and of the government work with back benchers in the interest of our constituent and the shared and mutual interest of the citizen of this country i only wish more people around the country be able to see the quality of the work go on in the house on day like this 
 i want particularly to highlight the importance of the bill for rural area such as mine the hon lady represent the magnificently urban constituency of sunderland central but i represent a magnificently the rural constituency of mid norfolk—114 village and town as i candidate i rashly promise to cycle the border saturday morning but then discover it be mile long it take i rather more than saturday morning much of this country be rural up north as well as down south and in the south west i want to focus on the importance of the bill and building society in rural area and on our town high street in provide cash facility and support time buyer and pensioner with cash 
 in dereham recently i see nationwide pack with queue outside of pensioner move from the bank which be close to support nationwide as nationwide support they in my part of the country we have a huge number of retire folk who want cash they do not all want to be totally digital they value and need that interaction with a living and breathe human being when they go to save or take out cash nationwide building society be do great work to support they i be really keen to support the bill as the hon lady know largely because of that particular rural need 
 i should declare that i be a member of building society and until recently i have a mortgage with nationwide i agree with my hon friend about the importance of build society in rural community i think of local   example such as suffolk building society but elsewhere around the country there be newbury building society and similar that connection to the community really matter it be important to get on with this primary legislation but we also need to get the negative secondary regulation through as quickly as possible so that we can boost mortgage borrowing for family who be keen to get on to the housing ladder 
 i completely agree my right hon friend make an excellent point and we will come to that in due course she be absolutely right 
 i want to focus on build society in rural area the flight of the bank in particular from rural area but also from a lot of high street banking and the role they have traditionally carry out this be partly why the bill be so important highlight the importance of cash in the rural economy many of my local small business be really struggle with how to bank cash properly we also have a problem in our part of the world with atm now be subject to jcb theft atm be rip out of the wall so there be a cash problem and building society have a really important role 
 as well as reflect the very good of old labour this be also if i may say so the very good of civic conservatism this be edward burke ’s little platoon this be the weft and the warp of local connect responsible civic community base capitalism the sort of capitalism that small platoon civic conservatism have long champion i would argue that all party in government over the past year have slightly forget that that need to be champion we have see the rise and the domination of big capital big bank and big disconnected capitalism i be here today as a card carry supporter of the mutuality model and civic capitalism i think both main party have that in common in their different tradition and history 
 on rural banking and finance in mid norfolk we have town and village we be not quite halfway between cambridge and norwich traditionally it have be something of a rural backwater it be an agricultural community with many retiree and pensioner move to quiet rural norfolk it be a real challenge to ensure that our village remain vibrant and our town remain thrive the model of development over the past year have be over focused on commuter housing people drive their car to norwich and cambridge during the day and that suck the life out of many of our village 
 the rise of online commerce and digital retail have also take quite a lot of the life out of many of our town and our high street be struggle to remain vibrant the government ’s move to reduce business rate have help but the pandemic and the cost of energy crisis come off the back of the ukraine war have hit rural area disproportionately hard that be a theme i will be pick up in the come month in this house in the run up to the budget everyone have be hit by the cost of energy increase of course but in rural area there be a double triple whammy every member of staff in a company have to drive most of my relatively low pay work family have or car they be not a luxury they need they to be able to get to work all our public service be hit our bus service and our county council service all across rural area   we be pay a double whammy because of an over dependency on transport and heating that huge rural impact be hit remote backwater rural area very hard particularly in my part of norfolk 
 in that context it be urgent that we encourage the revival of the rural economy i have long believe and campaign locally that with a slightly different approach to planning and development in our area we could trigger something of a rural renaissance with many small business pop up off the back of the cambridge phenomenon and the norwich research park small business often start off by work from home or look for converted farm unit they be not in the city centre but distribute if we can get more business back into village and small town we will have more people of work age in community during the day that will reduce congestion and commuting 
 the model of a vibrant rural economy be key to so many of the priority of successive government we will never get to net if we keep shovel people into car and make they commute long distance in congested traffic jam the more we can get people to work from home or nearer to home travel when they need to during the day and not in peak hour the well that vision of rural renaissance be key but it will never happen if young people can not afford to buy a house near to where they work if thriving business on the high street be unable to cash up save and deposit cash safely and if pensioner be unable to save take out their deposit and interact with banking in the way they have for the past or year we need to ensure that we build an economy for the people who live there 
 that be what my campaign the norfolk way be all about it be a project to promote that vision of rural growth the bill touch on much of that have only to see the flight of the mainstream bank out of such area i know that colleague in other constituency see that and the desperation that people feel whether they be time buyer or pensioner 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech but we should not see building society as a panacea they be close branch in my area as well how do we encourage build society to keep branch open when they be close throughout the country 
 my hon friend make an excellent point i do not want to suggest that they be a total panacea i be laud and applaud nationwide in dereham because it be do great work but we need to make sure that the bill be part of a broad approach i hope that treasury ministers think about the run up to the budget and look ahead will think about how we can encourage more choice more competition and more presence from both build society and bank we need choice and competition in rural area and other area that be not well serve as well as in area that be 
 the opportunity for rural renaissance be hit hard by the pandemic as well as by the ukraine war with its impact on energy price putin turn off the gas tap and the cost of living crisis that we have all experience it be in that context that the bill represent a chink of light and have be hugely support locally i be delighted to have help the hon member for sunderland central bring it to the house 
 i want to say something about the bank because over the year for which i have be privileged to be the member of parliament for mid norfolk the closure of bank a cause on which i remember fondly work with the former prime minister my right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss in have gradually hit much of rural norfolk everyone understand that we can not have a hugely staff bank branch in every village but there be a contract at the heart of the state between citizen government and operation such as bank that work under regulation bank be there to provide a service too and if they be not go to provide that service we need to look at who will 
 give the number of people go into bank to do their business these day it be not unreasonable that there should be some restructuring i think the idea of banking hub where all the main bank club together to ensure that there be a proper facility in a town or substantial village be a good idea do my hon friend think that it be important that they should take in cash and taking from small business because they do not all do that 
 i do my right hon and learn friend amplify exactly the point i be make he be right that sparsely populated or rural area will often require different solution in the same way as small rural school require we to network and support they through multi academy trust similarly we need to be imaginative in how we support cash access and banking and save in rural area that touch on a deep problem that i have witness over many year whitehall tend to see these problem through an urban len and we need to think a bit about how rural area often need a slightly different approach i hope that the bill and the cross party support for it will help to encourage the treasury to think about how we can do more to make this a moment to encourage great choice and competition out in the market 
 it be particularly sad that the bank have step back from the service i describe over the or decade in which many of they have focus rather more on big international and complex financial trading the derivative that lead to quite a lot of problem we have back in the great crash it be particularly sad in norfolk give that it be where of our great bank barclays actually start with the gurney and barclay family the bank have its root in king ’s lynn dock as people be require to pay duty they require credit finance i encourage anyone who have not be to king ’s lynn to go there as it have a beautifully regenerate and refurbish georgian dockyard where they can see the plaque commemorate the credit facility that become the great barclays bank it be particularly sad to see a bank such as barclays step back from the place in which it start everyone have history root and heritage and i be not such a romantic that i expect barclays to put a bank in every norfolk village but i do think there be a responsibility on all these company to make sure that the people they be there to serve be get the service they need 
 i wish in particular to highlight the importance of access to cash on high street for small business as it be become a serious problem i know that the minister   understand it and i be grateful for his acknowledgement of it across east anglia and i be sure this be happen elsewhere we be see an increase frequency of atm raid where jcb be drive into bank and atm be take out however that be the thin end of a big wedge and many business in dereham attleborough wymondham watton and hingham be begin to struggle with what to do with cash on a monday morning and many local people be struggle to find a bank they can access 
 i know that many people wish to speak this morning so i will not detain you or the house for too long madam deputy speaker but i want to touch on mutuality which my right hon and learn friend   the member for north east hertfordshire sir oliver heald   address early we need to talk about celebrate champion and promote it more in this house some year ago we be write the rule book for modern capitalism define the joint stock limited company and set out the legal framework in english constitutional law in common law that drive the industrial revolution we create limited liability company which allow people to invest raise money and back project and that be a key part of what this country do 
 in an age of globalise capitalism and high technology we have a challenge to make sure that capital do not become disconnected from the people who be provide the money the saver and the people who need the money to build business for capitalism to work we need a connection between money the people who be save it and the people who be borrow it the last crash in the city be a clear example of what happen when a disconnection be allow to get to crisis proportion whereby people do not know where the money that they have deposit be go and people who buy a complex derivative bond do not know what it be build on or what be underpin it we then have a serious problem i be not suggest that we go back to an agrarian revolution of trading wheat for a lift on a cart into dereham but i think there be a real issue in our economy in respect of connected capitalism 
 conservative members in particular as card carry advocate for the market need to continue to champion and make clear the fact that market work when they have value connection and people at the heart of they when market be completely disconnected they have no sense of the requirement of the people put the capital in or take it out they do not value that connection and regulator do not understand the importance of the bond of responsibility between people who be trade with each other 
 mutuality be a proud tradition at the heart of the old labour movement but it be also a proud tradition in civic conservativism it be burke ’s little platoon in a spirit of cross party philosophising on this friday morning perhaps i can put some wind in the sail of the movement for mutuality i would love to see more mutuality in different sector such as in finance banking and housing where clearly the building society have be a great reform i would argue that the housing association have also be a great conservative reform in housing 
 there be many example of where we could blow on to the ember of mutuality and encourage more of it in different area particularly in some of our social care sector and health provision it should not be a stark choice between private profit and public state there be a   whole sector of mutuality membership organisation that can deliver public good with cost reimbursement and important discipline of financial control that be not necessarily either public sector with all the efficiency challenge that go with it or private sector with all the incentive for high profit there be a whole raft of organisation out there that we could be deploy well in health and care but also in criminal justice and a whole range of area where the state have struggle in the past few decade to achieve its stated objective 
 my hon friend be make an outstanding speech and we could philosophise all day which i be tempt to do very badly mutuality in the modern day require a profit element for all building society branch to remain open the business have to produce a profit mutuality in the sense of ketley ’s building society in be a different concept completely we therefore should always come back to the point he make that for mutuality to succeed it must be base on a civic conservative and capitalist model it can not work in any other way 
 my hon friend make an excellent point and encourage i to wrap up my philosophising he be right i be not at all anti profit it be about what be do with the profit of the genius of mutuality be that the profit be recycle back in to pursue the interest of those who put in the capital in the place 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for give way again i must not keep trespassing on the house ’s time because i have a bill come up later do he agree that if we look at pension fund and the possibility of extend that sort of approach into social care there would be a lot in the idea of mutuality also on the point about profit if those fund be invest in national good such as important national infrastructure and thing of that sort we could all benefit but of course it have a financial aspect to it as well 
 again my right hon and learn friend make the point even more eloquently than i be try to do and he be right i make this point in all seriousness in so many area such as infrastructure as he say i dream of a world in which people can put their own saving into mutual vehicle i would love people to be able to invest in the cambridge norwich railway development corporation to fund the regeneration of neglect station or to create and fund investment vehicle there be a whole wealth of instrument vehicle and body root in that fertile period of and century english capitalism and scottish capitalism too the enlightenment in edinburgh be a big part of it we could draw on those model well in pursuit of many of our public sector objective 
 as i wrap up i will return to the more mundane and practical issue this be an important bill for update the law and give building society a chance to get back to where they be in the early 90 they be responsible for something like of the market they have drop down to we want to help build society compete and get back to provide their core service to help those who want to save in build   society not bank and time buyer who particularly in my part of the world in norfolk do not have high salary and be look for a safe and reliable local building society that could hopefully help they acquire a local house build for they rather than for commuter move into norfolk we need to think about the people who be drive public service and the rural economy for time buyer this be an important measure 
 as the hon member for sunderland central say in introduce the bill increase lending capacity be in itself a huge step forward i think the figure be £ of extra lending capacity which will allow the provision of another mortgage that be hugely important particularly for time buyer i conclude by genuinely congratulate and thank the hon lady for bring the bill forward the government for work with she and we on it and all those who have help the bill strike a small but important blow and send a key signal that build society be back we want to support and help they as part of a broad commitment to civic small local platoon connect capital that can help people in community up and down this country to save and withdraw money in the way they need which will support the local economy on which the national economy be build 
 i congratulate   the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott   on bring forward this important bill as have be say she have support across the house it be with some trepidation that i follow my hon friend   the member for mid norfolk george freeman he have take the debate into a much wide context as i also intend to do although from an urban and community banking perspective he be absolutely right about the importance of civic activity and community base financial service and the bill go a little way towards trigger that by bring about a level playing field between build society and bank so that they can compete more fairly 
 the bill will support build society to do more lending in a safe and secure way and it be welcome by many as the hon member for sunderland central say include the building societies association it be a great starting point but the economic landscape continue to change and building society need the opportunity to remain competitive so secondary legislation will be require to ensure that change to regulation for other financial service provider be match by update the framework for building society the government consult on similar change in and the bill largely mirror the proposal from the consultation which be welcome by the industry 
 there be some modest but fundamental change in the bill that be really important building society be found to help work people to own a home of their own and their mutual status mean that their sole purpose be to serve their customer they direct a great proportion of their lending to time buyer than bank do but they be constrain by archaic legislation unfit for today ’s economy without this small but important piece of legislation the competitive playing field in lending be not as level as it could or should be 
 under the building societies act build society be subject to funding limit that their high street banking competitor be not those limit require at least half their funding to come from saving deposit make by retail saver in area such as stoke on trent both the average saving and the number of saver be low than in more affluent area and consequently small local building society be restrict in the number of mortgage they can offer even though they be need 
 the propose change to the act will not alter the funding limit but as the hon lady outline they will remove certain key impediment thereby enable building society to lend more and ensure that more mortgage loan be available to uk homebuyer at competitive rate and crucially to time buyer who be the lifeblood of the housing market as well as those further up the ladder 
 indeed the bill seek to unlock billion of pound of extra lending for time buyer and homeowner it be estimate that for every £ of new lending capacity that be unlocked there be the potential to support an additional average time buyer risk need to be manage but small building society in particular should not be tar with the same brush as high street bank regulation need to be simplify and make easy for they because within their customer base they cater for a group of people who be on the edge of mainstream banking 
 if local building society do not exist some people would be entirely disenfranchise by banking so their mission be a social as much as a financial the banking sector have essentially become a risk management business as build society grow they manage more risk and the regulator be not keen to take that on although the inertia that create be understandable it make it incredibly difficult to change the system particular issue on which i have campaign for some time be the size fit all regulation that burden small lender and stifle innovation in the banking and non banking financial sector 
 the netflix movie bank of dave which tell the story of dave fishwick ’s journey try to open a community bank in burnley hit the top in america day after its release and capture the imagination of the british public last year dave ’s innovative idea make sense to the nation but the exist regulatory framework do not seem able to adapt and respond to they i have be work with dave fishwick and forward think organisation in the financial service sector to push for a simple regulatory framework and to enable a model that can provide the template for the creation of community bank throughout the country 
 we do not have enough regional bank or facility such as build society where those who serve local people understand their need people do not want to be face with a computer that simply say no if anywhere need a healthy local banking system in which local people feel include it be stoke on trent as well as norfolk of course we need small business to be able to access loan and homebuyer to be able to secure mortgage from those who understand the people they be serve and whose bottom line be help their community rather than maximum profit 
 in our quest for economic growth we know that the big growth sector be small business which represent more than of all business yet high street bank be not lend to they because they represent the high   risk level many small business need to borrow to grow and the current option be not adequate so let we enable the small challenger bank and community development finance institution to flourish and make it easy for build society to lend more to time buyer 
 building society offer a huge opportunity they be community pay for the community which matter hugely in place like stoke on trent where there be a great sense of place and pride and people want to help each other building society can offer more to the community than high street bank because they have a social mission i recently speak to hanley economic building society in my constituency and it share its plan to use fund from dormant account to invest in local project it still protect the dormant account holder but in the meantime want to use the business to make a difference in stoke on trent it make sense because it use local people ’s money to invest in local project 
 modernise the legislation on building society be long overdue building society be found to help work people to own a home of their own and be an essential part of our community in order to be sustainable build society need to be allow to grow at least at the pace of the rest of the sector in order to do that they need to lend but without the retail funding that the bill would allow they can not do so effectively other sector whether that be mutual or friendly society have have similar update to bring their regulation in line with competition in the sector so this be a crucial opportunity to enable build society to do the same 
 the bill be an important starting point and primary legislation be need but as the economic landscape change build society need the opportunity to remain competitive so secondary legislation will be necessary to ensure that the legal framework be up to date that include measure to tidy up anomaly in the act long overdue piece of legal housekeeping be to make the director retirement age provision in the act explicitly consistent with the equalities act section 60(8 of the act state that the normal retirement age for a director of a building society be a retirement age for plcs use to be set out in the companies act but after the equality act outlaw age discrimination the provision be delete from the companies act nevertheless the statutory normal retirement age have not be remove from the act 
 it may seem like a silly example but it currently mean that there be contradictory statutory provision it would be much well if the retirement age provision of the act be remove as have happen for plcs simply because a director have just have their birthday i feel this personally do not mean they be no long competent they have huge amount of experience they understand the market and fire they would be demonstrably wrong for the business 
 the bill will support building society to well weather period of financial stress and help to minimise risk in the banking sector building society have around branch as we hear early that be down by around a compare with but the number of bank branch have decline even fast more than halve since so there be a real need for more locally base lending in community throughout the country as well as more encouragement of saving that stay in the community to support lending 
 the change in the bill will help to level the play field for build society to compete more fairly with bank and will support they to do more lending crucially as the building society sector direct a great proportion of lend to time buyer compare with bank that will benefit more people look to get on to the housing ladder increase lending be essential to the uk ’s future prosperity and economic growth 
 in the bank of england launch a project call strong and simple the aim of which be simplification and which go to the heart of what i be say early small building society and small bank and other lending institution spend far too much of their time have to comply with regulation that be write for high street bank and large global pound or dollar business if thing be make less onerous for they they could innovate more and proliferate throughout the country 
 a strong and simple prudential framework for non systemic bank and building society publish by the prudential regulation authority set out a vision for simplify the prudential requirement for small domestic focus bank and building society while maintain those firm resilience the invitation to comment seem to have meet with resistance from the risk averse industry which in my view be base on penalise the minnow while protect the giant so inertia reign and progress be slow 
 i hope that small change such as those propose today to make for fairer competition will be the forerunner of large reform such as a new framework for small domestic deposit taker that will enable the financial service sector to embrace change for the benefit of the most marginalised and under serve community and business 
 i be pleased to follow my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon who make an excellent case for the importance of both the local aspect of build society and the way in which they help people in her community and other people in deprive community who need to get on to the housing ladder 
 i congratulate   the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott   on her good fortune in secure the top slot in the ballot which be like win the lottery for we parliamentarian on the back benches her choice of bill be a tribute to the seriousness with which she have take that good fortune and that responsibility the bill be important to my constituent in dover and deal and the local village and it will have an impact on the whole country which really matter 
 i strongly welcome the bill ’s aim to begin to level the play field between bank and building society by update the funding rule for building society which will enable they as we have hear to raise additional capital and will open up competition for the benefit of customer in the mortgage and saving market while retain that critical mutual model and without reduce financial stability and also to modernise arrangement for meeting and the execution of deed 
 i be a proud member of principality building society i serve for year as a main board director and chair the group risk committee i have a passion for the importance of mutual in general and build society in particular we have hear of other mutual and other not for profit organisation such as housing association and i agree with what be say by my hon friend   the member for mid norfolk george freeman but building society be vital in have purpose as well as for instance provide fund 
 during my time at principality i face an annual re election to the board at the annual general meeting as do every other board director include the chief executive every year now as a member of the building society if i be unable to attend the agm in person i can vote electronically that annual act of receive and respond to the agm paper connect i directly and personally to my building society i enjoy look at the paper and consider the performance and the objective of the society and read about the current board member 
 let i turn to the bill ’s proposal to allow member to attend and speak at agm remotely as well as to vote hybrid and indeed virtual only meeting have become more common since covid it will be important to consider how a decision to use hybrid arrangement will be make and who will make it for example will member be consult will it be the sole decision of the chief executive or will it be a decision for the whole board 
 it will be important to ensure that a decision to proceed with virtual arrangement do not diminish effective participation and that the decision be not make for other reason such as to cut cost or to hold an agm somewhere more difficult for member to get to on the basis that they can participate virtually this particularly matter because as the house have recognise physical attendance have a special value 
 it should be note that in this chamber it be perfectly possible to have virtual debate virtual questioning of ministers and even virtual voting all of which happen during the covid pandemic but we now meet in person debate in person question ministers in person and over many hour and often late into the evening vote in person although often consider further modernisation of this place have be reject many member may share the view that more could be do to modernise parliament far but it must be note that be together in place have particular benefit that carry much weight 
 on lords amendment 22b to the levelling up and regeneration bill we recently vote not to allow council meeting to be hold with virtual participation the basis of the government ’s position set out by earl howe in their lordship house include the need for councillor to interact with citizen and to be hold accountable 
 when i be a board member at principality i be subject to the scrutiny of the member who attend the agm and the interaction and engagement that come with that i enjoy and look forward to those agm which be well organised and well attend year after year member would come to chat and have a cup of tea with the board of director which be really important 
 i remember of my regular mrs jones who would come along with mr jones who say rather less mrs jones would invariably take i to task on the rate   of interest on saving ask why it could not be high member would comment on financial performance and the savings rate and many take huge interest and pride in the building society ’s purpose and passion be that the commitment to time buyer or the commitment to building home 
 principality become the building society in recent time to put build back into building society building society be root in build home for home ownership i champion this renaissance at principality with the ely mill development create quality affordable home and hundred of new job on a brownfield industrial site in cardiff the of its kind project be lead by principality commercial and the welsh government lead the way for other building society to consider how they could reconnect with their house building root the project be an exemplar in how to remediate brownfield land in a way that capture value and improve viability for development and it show again how the community purpose focus and interest bring forward by be a building society root embed and commit to its community can make a difference 
 i know at hand that the discussion and feedback at an agm be every bit as important for an effective board as the discussion and feedback we might have at meeting with our constituent or in the lobbies and corridor of parliament be for we although the provision to allow hybrid agm be a welcome step forward we should not ignore the caution or concern to ensure that such change improve and do not detract from engagement all the more so because while company be already do this a building society be not just another company it be something very special and very different that difference mean engagement connection and participation with member that be at the heart in the very dna of what it mean to be a building society 
 the experience of company have not always be to the benefit of shareholder participation indeed in the financial reporting council issue guidance for good practice in remote corporate meeting with a particular focus on annual general meeting the guidance provide helpful insight into the sort of issue that may be beneficial for secure effective hybrid participation include ensure that virtual moderation be transparent that any character limit for text question be reasonable and that there be fair representation between question ask virtually and in person if building society choose to exercise that virtual opportunity it will be important that they do so in line with similar good practice and their core value they must never miss the wisdom and accountability that come from build society member such as mrs jones 
 clause be a long overdue amendment to align the execution of document for build society with that of company it will be heartily welcome by company secretary and lawyer alike i must say as a former transactional lawyer in banking and finance that ensure that the right authority be in place that the right people under those authority sign the document and that the document be complete in the right way could not be more important they be not legal unless that happen as we consign those heavy seal to legal history i look forward to they re emerge in their new life as doorstop and bookend 
 let i turn to clause on the funding structure of building society build society support a great number of our constituent as we have hear there be around customer of the building society ably represent by the building societies association some of those building society be large and very familiar household name such as nationwide while some be less well know nationally many have geographical name such as leeds building society coventry building society the principality the west brom and many other that local aspect be key to understanding what make building society so special they be not just mutual they be root firmly in and for community 
 the funding structure with which building society begin which have evolve and the further evolution of which we be debate today be not that of a bank the description of their history have be set out fully and ably by the hon member for sunderland central the clue of course be in the name the building society they be club of ordinary people who come together for a purpose to get a home of their own what an extraordinary and wonderful purpose how very relevant that be today as it ever be the whole house know that we be not build enough home and that the rental market be in dire need of urgent reform and indeed of reduction in favour of home ownership and affordable rent housing surely we must be due a revival of co operative mutual housing delivery that promote and enable the funding and building of home just like those early building society that may be something to consider far in committee 
 the bill have secure cross party support in that spirit i echo the word of the labour prime minister ramsay macdonald who say that no movement of co operative self help be more worthy of support than that of the building society he say 
 a house should be an expression of a personality and wherever it be possible it ought to be own not merely rent would that every workman could own his own house just as he own his clothe 
 those word resonate through the decade 
 as we have hear it be on the conservative benches that there have be a long stand commitment to mutuality the conservative prime minister mr stanley baldwin write of the expansion of the building society movement that council should use the power of co operation enable by the chamberlain act to work with building society imagine local authority work closely with build society to deliver home for local people he write 
 they afford abundant evidence of the grow popularity of the building society as a medium for the investment of saving and of the success which have be achieve in the encouragement of thrift and independence which be of the main objective of the founder of the movement these figure indicate also a steady increase of the number of those who be become owner of their own home the work and aim of the building societies will commend themselves to all think people 
 how right he be 
 as we look at this bill we should have firmly in the front of our mind those purposive element of access to home ownership for work people to have a home of their own and the public and private benefit of saving thrift and independence they be as relevant today as they ever be and solution to such issue for   ordinary work people be need as much as ever link saving and home ownership be so important indeed during my time at principality i be pleased to have the support of the treasury committee chair my hon friend   the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin in my work to promote a building society isa which become the help to buy isa to make that link through a government back housing deposit saving scheme 
 although build society strive to maintain a distinct and clear purpose and function the current regulatory and legal framework put they at a disadvantage to the dominantly financial purpose of bank today we be look at what the bill will do to address that disadvantage and level the playing field but i encourage member to consider how they too might lead the way in dover and deal we have a proud tradition of mps and mayor be directly involve in the building society movement it be a mayor of dover william clarke who set up the dover investment and mutual building society of the early terminate society that we hear about early and it be a member of parliament sir brook bridges who head the dover cottage building and improvement society base in buckland in dover local people and business have be involve throughout the history of the movement in dover and east kent 
 in the dover and east kent building society and the dover investment and mutual building society feel in competition with each another at point there be much rivalry between different organisation as the movement develop there be also the establishment in of the dover permanent benefit society which take in the dover cottage building and improvement society that have be set up by sir brook bridges mp some year before the list go on with example of people ’s active engagement active leadership and active participation in create lead and deliver mutual model base and embed in the community they represent all member of parliament and those in local governance role have that opportunity to lead establish and show the way i very much commend the excellent history of those build society in the dover historian produce by local historian lorraine sencicle as an excellent insight into the development and role of people and place for the benefit of provide housing 
 let i turn to today ’s change and the matter of level the playing field the banking market dominate the mortgage market but that be not always the case as recently as the early 1980s build society hold the dominant position in the mortgage market liberalisation of the banking market during the 1980 create a massive change in participation in the mortgage market by the bank and increase mortgage fund availability but now a small number of player dominate the market lloyds banking group be the big mortgage lender by outstanding balance in it have a market share of mortgage which be nearly in mortgage across the country the net effect of the change be a near reversal of the position of dominance of the building society and that be a result of the financial market liberalisation and change in legislation and regulation that be to the detriment of competition price and availability for customer 
 the bill will go some way to level the play field between build society and bank but there be more to do let we consider a responsibly run financial entity like principality with its approval for run its own internal risk rating basis that mean it be able to use its internal model to determine the risk rate asset and can decide on the basis of these highly technical professional model how much capital it need to cover its risk it can do that it do not need to follow the standard size fit all for other organisation this be a tough regulatory hurdle require detailed and extensive engagement with the pra and the bank of england and i can say at hand that it be a tough threshold require forensic and detailed work because i make it of my key priority to help secure that approval when i chair the group risk committee at principality it be take very seriously and only responsibly run financial entity with very good technical and risk management be allow to do that 
 we should compare that with other bank such as metro bank which have be a fail bank due to poor financial control and inadequate system include a serious accounting scandal time and again metro have be on the financial brink so no wonder it have be reject for its airb advanced internal rating base approval for too long successive government have not back our establish responsible building sector movement and instead have favour fail or rate challenger bank i hope this matter will be explore far in committee but i also hope the minister will reflect far on it 
 turn to deposit funding the context of clause be that build society must fund of their fund from customer deposit in other word from customer saving account as we have hear the bill do not change the percentage but do propose to change the calculation for funding type this will enable build society to go far towards the threshold than currently it will give they great flexibility and allow they to well manage their funding stream and the price and availability of product in the interest of both the customer and competition 
 however the current dominant deposit funding approach to customer saving that apply to build society still put build society at a disadvantage to bank in other way that be not fully take into account the financial services compensation scheme operate on the basis of size of deposit rather than size of the risk that disadvantage build society because they be finance largely by their deposit while the bank be finance largely by their wholesale market building society will have more deposit and therefore will have a large amount of deposit with regard to their overall liability under the scheme 
 alongside today ’s amendment i hope the bill committee will consider the operation of the financial services compensation scheme to level the play field for build society include increase the deposit protection amount from £ to £ to capture more account give the role of build society in have saver to provide well and separate protection for small and medium sized business which should be fund by those who provide sme banking service and to provide fast access for customer in get hold of their compensation when there be a failure by   fund it from the bank of england with recovery to follow either from the fail entity or if necessary the fscs levy 
 finally i will comment on the propose exception to the funding limit that we be address today these will enable build society to raise additional capital and open up competition for the benefit of customer in the mortgage and saving market while retain their mutual model and without reduce financial stability the change be to exclude the bank of england ’s support fund from the funding limit those fund be make available precisely for the purpose of manage financial stress event they should not artificially dilute the calculation of saving ratio that be hold by the building society the amendment in the bill will address that issue
