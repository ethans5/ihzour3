 project gigabit ’s state aim be to ensure that no be leave behind but that be not true for the resident of mulberry close on my home estate in eastbourne who have not be connect to full fibre despite bear the brunt of invasive work on their doorstep will the minister meet i resident of mulberry close and local internet provider to ensure that those resident be connect and not leave behind

 what step his department be take to keep child safe online 
 as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on child ’s online safety my hon friend will know that keep child safe online be a priority for this government we be focus on implement the online safety act so   that child can benefit from its wide reach and protection the child ’s code that be come in next month will see a step change in the experience of child online in the uk while we do not pretend that that be job do and we be work at pace to develop a further online safety package child will no long be able to access pornography or other unsuitable content include content that encourage or promote self harm eat disorder or suicide 
 the national crime agency and other law enforcement agency have highlight the grow prevalence of ai generate child sexual abuse material as of the big threat to public safety it be a grow threat to we online that be why i be astonish last week to see the tories and reform vote against the crime and policing bill which contain world lead measure to tackle this horrific crime do the minister agree that it be frankly disgusting to see the tories and reform use this issue for party politic 
 i do indeed agree with my hon friend on that child sexual exploitation and abuse be of the most horrendous harm and the government be commit to ensure that uk law keep pace with criminal use of technology include ai as he say we have introduce a world lead offence in the crime and policing bill to criminalise ai model that have be optimise to create child sexual abuse material this new offence build on the protection in the online safety act and i be very clear that nothing be off the table when it come to keep our child safe 
 as the minister say the online safety act have pass into law and be be implement but parent in my gosport constituency be still desperately worried about the scale of the inappropriate content that very young child can stumble across in the online world can she reassure we when will they begin to practically see the change that the online safety act promise and when will the big online provider really start have to do what they say they be do to keep our child safe online 
 i absolutely agree that some child be still stumble upon material and content that they should not be when the online safety act be fully enact in july we will see a step change in what child can see online ofcom will monitor this and ensure that where such material be continue we take action 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i begin by congratulate   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah   on her well- deserve honour in the king ’s birthday honour i hope the whole house will agree that it be a fitting and well deserve honour for her expertise and service to the house 
 protect child online should be a top priority for every government and that be why the conservatives pass the online safety act to give this government all the sweeping power they need to act but when the   minister be ask in parliament why implementation under labour be so slow she say that implementation must be 
 as proof against judicial review as possible ”—[official report   february vol c. 405wh 
 why be she more concerned about protect herself and the government than about protect child 
 it be the hon gentleman ’s party that drag its foot in bring forward the legislation and that water it down we be busy try to implement the act as it be set out in the guidance while the act be not perfect we will see a huge step change where there be issue and gap we be not afraid to act 
 it be my party that pass the online safety act it be the minister ’s party that be fail our child ian russell who set up the molly rose foundation follow the tragic death of his daughter say that britain be now go backwards when it come to protect our child online the government be be timid when they should be bold their priority be wrong and legal caution be trump child ’s safety why be the minister still defend this government ’s track record of total failure 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his question the implementation be happen as set out and against the timeframe that be set out as i say we be not only busy implement the act but look at all the gap that exist in it because ministers in his government water down the bill as it go through the house we will review those gap in the legislation and come forward with extra measure where they be need 
 what step he be take to improve rural mobile coverage 
 rural mobile coverage just be not good enough which be why we have commit all the money need to complete the share rural network with new mast come online every month i can also announce that ofcom ’s new coverage checker will come online tomorrow and i urge every single member to check their constituency then 
 i thank the minister for his answer i be go to say that have look at the village in my constituency on the mobile map which be suppose to be update this month it be not up to date it be good to hear that it will be many of my constituent have to rely on the g network which be be shut off we may be year away from get high speed broadband across the south hams so have access to a reliable g network be crucial can the minister tell i exactly how he be work with mobile phone provider to ensure that everyone have access to mobile voice and data coverage 
 the hon lady be absolutely right the new checker come online tomorrow i know that many hon member will have look at the checker in the past and think that simply do not bear any relationship to my live experience from tomorrow it will the new   checker be much well member will be able to see different number for all the mobile operator which i think will encourage the operator to put up more mast and improve their coverage 
 i know that the hon lady have talk about the village of staverton in her constituency which have a population of people the sea trout i think be the pub it even have a telephone booth in it although i be not sure whether it be still work i have this horrible fear i do not want to leave the hon lady like blondie hang on the telephone 
 in my constituency of the most rural part of the uk whole area be without mobile phone coverage people be force to cope with unreliable phone line and most worryingly be sometimes unable to call can the minister assure i that after the withdrawal of the public switch telephone network no will be leave without access to a phone simply because there be no mobile signal once their landline be switch off 
 i have be very keen to ensure that the withdrawal of the pstn which be be do because it be necessary as the copper system be not work any more and be more fallible do not leave anybody unable to contact or get the service that they need i be very happy to arrange for my hon friend a meeting with bduk to go through precisely how we can ensure that we have proper investment in every constituency in the land so that people have the mobile signal they need to live in the modern era

 will the minister outline what step be be take to reduce academic dishonesty and plagiarism in school result from the use of artificial intelligence tool 
 ai have demonstrate that it can help the education workforce by reduce some of the administrative burden and the hard work that teach staff and school leader face in their day to day role on the hon gentleman ’s question evidence be still emerge on the benefit and risk of pupil and student use generative ai we will continue to work with the   education sector on use case to develop our understanding of how to use ai safely and effectively as i have say the department have issue guidance to teacher on how to identify and good use ai in school 
 i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 ai be already prevalent in the workplace and in the education system and we need to equip the next generation to be able to use ai tool productively and securely while also deliver on their unique potential as human being how be the minister work with the department for education to ensure that the ai tool that be use in our education system support this kind of learn specifically what advice have she give to the department with regard to the procurement of edtech tool which be widely available some be free and some need to be pay for so how be school to decide which to use 
 as i have say i work very closely with my counterpart in the department for education early this year we launch safe standard for the sector and provide guidance on how to safely develop ai tool for education the dfe have also provide guidance to school on how to safely use ai in school that work be ongoing as i have say we be work both with the sector and with educator to make sure that we get this right 
 when he plan to bring forward legislative proposal on ai 
 as soon as we have legislative proposal on ai we will introduce they to the house and let the right hon member know in the usual way 
 be the minister aware of the concern about the propose creative content exchange which appear without consultation in the creative industry sector plan will he confirm that any ai legislation will not seek to impose a statutory licensing model but will instead facilitate a market lead dynamic licensing model base on robust copyright law and enforceable through meaningful transparency 
 the right hon member have become terribly eeyore ish of late he have be eat too many thistle i think the truth of the matter be that this be a really good idea it be only at an embryonic stage it be consult on in the creative industry taskforce which be lead by baroness shriti vadera and sir peter bazalgette of course we will consult with everybody else in the sector about how we can make this work but it could be an answer to ensure more licensing of creative content by ai company and importantly remuneration for the creative industry 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i echo the congratulatory comment about   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah they be absolutely deserved 
 donald trump ’s proposal to ban us state from regulate ai for year have be condemn by microsoft ’s chief scientist show that we can not trust the us to provide safe and sensible ai regulation do the minister agree that now be the time for the uk to lead on ai safety and will he join i and the head of google deepmind in call for an ai safety agency model on the international atomic energy agency and headquarter here in the uk 
 both the under secretary of state and i have be remiss in not congratulate my hon friend   the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah   on her damehood as you know mr speaker all knight love to see a dame enter the chamber the under secretary of state and i work closely on ai and copyright and on make sure that we have the ai safety and security that we need the liberal democrat spokesperson make a fair point and it be of the thing that we be consider at the moment 
 what step he be take to distribute funding for science and innovation 
 the chancellor have announce that the government ’s research and development spending plan go through to and that our r&d budget be rise from £ in to £ in a real term increase and will total £ over the spending review period i be sure that that will benefit my hon friend ’s york constituency 
 york and north yorkshire be a national leader in the bioeconomy bioyorkshire will create job as well as start up and spin out it require £ to build its facility over the next decade but it will return £ back into the economy when will the science plan recognise the economic and scientific impact of the research base can we have a meeting to talk about the brilliant bioyorkshire project 
 my hon friend be right that it be a brilliant project and it be precisely the kind of thing the uk excel at we manage to get the private sector work with government and local government to deliver not only job but real innovation as the secretary of state be not here today i be sure i can offer my hon friend the opportunity of a meeting with he 
 over the past year many tech start up have leave the uk and go to silicon valley which cost the uk a huge amount in job and tax revenue what be the government do to ensure that start up currently at seed stage stay in the uk and grow here so that we avoid the uk become an intellectual property farm for other country to harvest 
 really important part of the industrial strategy we publish on monday and the sector plan within it be that we identify a problem many people in the uk face which be that they have a really good idea but can not take it to market because they do not have access to finance in particular to capital unless they be in london and sometimes unless they be a man we want to change all that which be why we have say categorically that we be give the british business bank much more significant power to be able to invest in these sector that will mean we be a powerhouse in precisely the way the hon member want 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of funding for health science and innovation on the uk ’s global   influence 
 from the development of vaccine to the discovery of the structure of dna british medical innovation have play a fundamental role in change the life of people globally and extend the uk ’s global influence our industrial strategy and forthcome life science sector plan will put the uk at the very centre of global effort 
 as the minister will know gavi and the global fund not only provide a global vaccine programme and programme on save life from malaria and hiv but provide we with biosecurity and job in the uk not least over research and development job and funding for the institute of tropical medicine what assessment have he make of whether the uk be to reduce our effort in that regard 
 gavi the vaccine alliance be absolutely essential not only for other country in the world where we have manage to save many life by introduce vaccine but for uk innovation we be fully commit to gavi we will be produce our life science sector plan soon and we want to celebrate the sector which represent business and £ of turnover every year 
 the minister will be aware that the life and health science launchpad in northern ireland have so far fund business lead project that be good news but of the project be in the greater belfast area will the minister join i and other in our effort to ensure that there be great knowledge about the launchpad across the whole of northern ireland so that we can all benefit from this very worthwhile project 
 yes indeed when i be talk about the creative industry sector plan as part of the industrial strategy last week exactly the same point be make belfast be obviously a great centre for innovation and the creative industry but we need to make sure that the sector extend across the whole of northern ireland it be a point that have be extremely well make 
 what step his department be take to improve digital inclusion in southend east and rochford constituency 
 the digital inclusion action plan be of thing i be proud of only this morning i launch the it reuse for good charter thing that be really problematic for many family who do not have access to the internet be that they simply do not have a device i urge every member of the house to get every business they know to sign up to the it reuse for good charter so that we can get device to the people who really need they 
 digital inclusion and exclusion vary widely between individual household and even community often it be those in low income rural and coastal community who be leave behind what step be be take to ensure that labour ’s action plan reach all community and equip everyone with the tool they need 
 my hon friend make a strong point we need digital inclusion for every community if we be go to have a digital government we need to have a digital nation and we can not have some people exclude from that future that be why we have announce £ in this financial year for the innovation fund and i hope that local authority will come forward with innovative idea on how we can break down the barrier to digital inclusion 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the department be determined to make the uk the good place in the world for science and technology last week the spending review commit £ to research and development enable every aspect of our tech economy to start fire on all cylinder build on that we publish the digital and technology sector plan as part of our modern industrial strategy on monday back our innovator in field like quantum life science and engineering biology with over £

 order member be not mean to walk in front of the member who be speak it be discourteous   the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin   deliberately look and carry on 
 the mobile phone signal be uniformly terrible across the northern part of my constituency mean that my constituent be miss out on opportunity will the minister work more closely with industry to identify and deal with those rural mobile blackspot to further the government ’s growth mission 
 i know that that be an issue in my hon friend ’s constituency because he have table at least question to i on the subject over the last week all of which we have answer in time i be keen to ensure that we as mp persuade the mobile company to invest more in get well mobile coverage across the country both in rural area and in urban one 
 i call the shadow minister 
 why be the government ignore the advice of the ai opportunitie action plan to encourage the start up and scaling of tech business in the uk and instead favour market dominant corporation from abroad over our own domestic business when award government contract 
 we be not 
 as the government produce their strategy to support the development validation and uptake of alternative method in scientific procedure what step will the minister be take to ensure that that include specific commitment to phase out the use of dog in scientific and regulatory procedure replace they with modern human specific technology 
 the government remain committed to end the use of all animal include dog in scientific procedure replace they with modern human relevant technology our long term goal as set out in our manifesto commitment be to phase out animal testing entirely as my hon friend say we will publish a detailed road map this year alongside convene roundtable with researcher industry and animal welfare organisation to ensure that we achieve that and hit the target 
 my constituency be home to game developer do the minister agree that the use of ai in video game development should not be allow to push out human creativity what assurance can he give i that the government be not be complacent in their approach to ai 
 we be completely and utterly not complacent and we be determined to ensure that creator be remunerate for their work we would never surrender other people ’s labour to a party i know that the hon member use to be the editor of cruise international and i very much hope that as a former journalist she will help we develop policy that can answer the question she ask 
 it be clear that europe and the united states of america be diverge on how they will regulate ai give that our eu reset commit we to work closely with europe on ai regulation what talk have the minister have about how we protect uk copyright in that context 
 of the issue that be undoubtedly at the heart of ai and copyright be how we ensure that the policy we advocate in the uk work with other country around the world i assure my hon friend that we be work closely with our european ally to ensure we do precisely that 
 in july the secretary of state pledge to launch a consultation on the regulation of frontier ai system shortly   however recent report suggest that it will not be forthcoming until summer as lead ai company have admit that their system could be use to develop biological and nuclear weapon will the minister confirm why there have be a delay 
 i be afraid the shadow chancellor come in during the question i have know he for a very long time and i would not cheer he quite so enthusiastically myself—[interruption as charm a man as he be it mean that i do not hear the question ask by   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney so i be happy to write to her afterwards to confirm 
 stratford and bow be a thriving hub of innovation which be why the prime minister choose it for the launch of the ai opportunitie action plan early this year brilliant example be healthtech-1 once a kitchen table start up of doctor and tech expert it now automate admin for of gp practice and its new patient registration system have save the nhs a staggering year of time what be the government do to support home grow innovation like that to scale up its work

 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the conservatives give up on law and order they betray our country and let criminal run riot now they desperately post wannabe superhero video shamelessly point at the problem they create last week they have the chance to put it right and what do they do they vote against tough action on knife crime on antisocial behaviour and on violence against woman and girl do the deputy prime minister agree that they should hang their head in shame for fail to protect our street 
 order this be about government responsibility not the opposition i call sir mel stride 
 thank you mr speaker it be a pleasure to stand opposite the right hon lady despite what many may think we have a great deal in common not least that we both viscerally disagree with the chancellor ’s tax policy it be also great to see the right hon lady stand in temporarily for the prime minister for the week run although i know that many sit behind her wish that this be a permanent arrangement indeed we will find many of their name among the who have sign up to oppose the government ’s welfare bill they say that the bill be dangerously rush and ill thought through will the right hon lady explain why she think that she be right and of her colleague be wrong 
 it be nice to face the late wannabe at the dispatch box i will tell the right hon member why we be press ahead with our reform it be because we be invest a pound in tailor employment support in a right to try in order to help more people back into work and in end reassessment for the most severely disabled who will never be able to work we will not walk away or stand by and abandon million of people trap in the fail system leave behind by he and his colleague 
 the right hon lady completely sidestep my question she can not even defend her own government ’s policy can she at least assure the house that the vote on tuesday will actually go ahead 
 i do not know if the right hon gentleman listen to what i say because he be read off his script i do not need a script but i can tell he that we will go ahead on tuesday 
 there you have it there will be a vote in this house on tuesday on the welfare bill although many on the back benches could be forgive for think that they have hear this before with the winter fuel payment where they be march up the hill and we all know where that story end on the conservative side of the house we be absolutely clear that we will help the right hon lady get their bill through if the   government can commit to actually reduce the welfare bill and get people off benefit and into work can she make that commitment right now yes or no 
 if ever we need a reminder of the conservatives have no shame it be their demand for this bill the right hon gentleman demand a programme to help people into work exactly what this bill do after he leave in young people out of the economy he demand no new taxis from the party that raise taxis to record level he demand welfare saving from the man who be in charge as the welfare bill absolutely balloon they say cut the welfare bill they fail they say put people in work they fail they say no tax increase they fail 
 i be afraid that the right hon lady have clearly not read her own legislation the bill will see the number of people on welfare rise for every single year go forward there be no commitment from she to cut the number of people on welfare even if the government manage to deliver these reform almost every respected economist now say that tax rise be all but inevitable in the autumn but after the budget the chancellor say 
 i ’m not come back with more taxis 
 british business have be hit again and again by labour ’s economic mismanagement they be desperate for certainty can the right hon lady give they that certainty now and repeat to the house the chancellor ’s promise not to raise taxis at the budget 
 this be a bit rich unbelievable with inflation above and the big tax rise i will take no lecture from the conservative party on this issue in particular they can not make up their mind they say our reform be take too long then they say they be rush then their front bench say our measure be too tough and now they say they need to be tough no plan no idea i wonder why their party be leave in such a mess 
 the whole house will have hear that the right hon lady do not repeat the chancellor ’s promise not to raise taxis britain ’s business have today be put on notice tax rise be come specifically in the right hon lady ’s own area despite labour ’s promise to freeze council tax the institute for fiscal studies say that the spending review will mean the big council tax increase in a generation a £ tax rise yet the chancellor and the prime minister have repeatedly claim that the government will not raise taxis on work people why do the right hon lady think that council tax be not pay by work people 
 again the conservatives have an absolute nerve when council tax rise ever single year under their government in fact i have to turn down the tories on the local government association who want i to take away the precept to ensure that they could raise taxis above the we have keep it there while deliver money for local government while they have austerity put taxis up and ruin the british economy 
 when you cut out the blather be not the reality that this labour government have condemn we to high taxis more debt few job and more pain for business up and down our country borrowing unemployment and inflation be up yet the right hon lady tell we that the government ’s plan be work it be not just i who be not convince the member behind she be not convinced either nor be the public in fact i be not even sure whether the right hon lady herself be convince be she not just a little embarrassed to defend policy that she do not even agree with 
 i be embarrassed every week that an opposition member come here who do not apologise for the mess they leave this country in party crash the economy and leave family to pay the price we be put work people i be proud that we have get a huge boost to the minimum wage the big uplift in affordable housing in a generation and that we have expand free school meal to half a child the tories choice billion of pound in unfunded tax cut for the very wealthy we know where that get we it be the same old tory fail approach they have not listen and they have not learn a thing 
 prudhoe   community high school in my constituency be force to relocate to washington after its just over year old building build under the previous government be find to have crack in the infrastructure this incredibly distressing news have require huge resilience and strength from the local community will my right hon friend join i in pay tribute to the staff the parent and most importantly the student at prudhoe community high school and in commend they for their hard work and dedication during this incredibly destabilising time 
 i will do i thank my hon friend for bring this important issue to my attention i can only imagine the disruption and challenge face the school community of the shameful legacy of the conservative party be leave school across our country literally crumble we be fix that with £ of investment in the school rebuilding programme over the next decade to rebuild more than school i know that the minister for early education will be happy to meet he 
 i call the deputy leader of the liberal democrats 
 i associate myself and my party with the remark of the deputy prime minister in call for de escalation in the middle east the release of hostage and urgent aid to get into gaza 
 we liberal democrats oppose the government ’s cut to personal independence payment and carer ’s allowance with a grow rebellion on the government benches the government may be force to push these cut through with the support of the official opposition the deputy prime minister know that some of those affect be still wait for justice after the carer ’s allowance scandal see thousand of innocent carer hound for repayment can the deputy prime minister give a cast iron guarantee that if these cut be pursue at the very least not a   single person will lose a penny until the carer ’s allowance scandal review have be complete and the recommendation have be implement 
 i thank the hon member for her opening comment she know that we have already take step on the carer ’s allowance and those step will continue as she also know the welfare system be fail people labour be the party of work but we be also the party of fairness that be why our bill will deliver the large permanent real term increase to basic out of work support since the 1980s invest in tailor employment support so people can try work safely and ensure that those who can never work be properly support 
 it be disappointing that the deputy prime minister could not give that cast iron guarantee but if the government pursue the bill next week we will pursue this matter on behalf of carer 
 give the report that the government be give a green light to president trump ’s demand for a state visit to be bring forward to september do the deputy prime minister agree that the uk should urgently convene talk with the white house in advance of the visit in order to leverage it to secure us guarantee for ukraine include the use of frozen russian asset and to secure a joint uk us message to putin that together our country will not let he win his illegal war 
 the uk government be always in discussion negotiation and talk with our us counterpart we be really pleased that the us president be come for a state visit and we will continue to welcome in that vein and continue to have those discussion 
 in oldham family be currently live in temporary accommodation and family be on the waiting list that obviously have a devastating impact particularly on child in those family will the deputy prime minister outline how she will use the £ that be allocate to her department in the spending review to fix the housing crisis leave by the opposition so that family in oldham saddleworth and wide can get the affordable home they need

 give that the right hon lady appear to be enjoy spend yet another week practise to be prime minister maybe she can give we her view on who she would get rid of in the come reshuffle would it be the chancellor for kill economic growth would it be the work and pensions secretary for the botched handling of the welfare bill and the winter fuel cut would it be the environment secretary for try to destroy british family farm would it be the foreign secretary for give away british sovereign territory and pay billion to rent it back or give that the prime minister be now poll as have have the most unpopular year in modern british political history would the right hon lady do herself and the country a favour and tell he to show himself the door 
 maybe the hon gentleman want a go next week because it have be quite a carousel the leader of the opposition say that she be go to get well week on week she already have in the last week by not turn up i be just wonder when she be go to give the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick a go 
 i be proud and honour to say that i have serve this country as a reservist parachute regiment soldier that be why i would like to take this opportunity to thank all our service member and their family during armed forces week this labour government have announce the large sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war will the deputy prime minister set out how the government will rebuild britain and secure our defence for the future 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his service he be absolutely right our armed force represent the very good of britain and put their life on the line for we every day it be our responsibility to support those who defend we so we be deliver the big sustained boost to defence spending since the end of the cold war the strategic defence review set out our vision for defence drive job and prosperity and renew the nation ’s contract with those who serve to secure britain into the future 
 it be a pleasure to be ask the right hon lady another question at prime minister ’s question although just the this time there have be a proliferation of house in multiple occupation in my constituency in place such as potters bar and borehamwood quiet residential street such as tiverton road and organ hall road be be blight by family house be convert into house in multiple occupation lead to a surge in antisocial behaviour and parking problem may i therefore urge the right hon lady to look at enhance the power of local council to stop these kind of development where they be not want 
 i do miss our exchange i hope the right hon gentleman have be wear his factor he know how it can get for we ginger in the hot weather he also know that local authority have plan power to limit the proliferation of small house be turn into house in multiple occupation his government leave a housing crisis and i be get on with fix that through the home that we be go to deliver 
 just this week   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   put a singular burn injustice the plight of overseas billionaire who pay too much tax do the deputy prime minister agree with the hon member ’s priority or do she agree with i that reform uk do sweetheart deal with the super rich be a betrayal of british work people 
 i be ask about the hon member for clacton ’s mathematic the other week and my hon friend be absolutely right the mask have slip again this week the hon member for clacton   demand billion more in unfunded tax cut for the very rich while he march through the lobby in the house of commons to vote against sick pay for the low earner we know what would pay for reform ’s tax break for overseas billionaire it would be tax hike on work people and patient be charge to see their doctor labour will not let that happen 
 when my young constituent axel be give his education health and care plan a year ago his primary school place be withdraw with no replacement offer his nursery allow he to stay on until christmas but since then apart from a short break at a school he have have nothing he be at home with his mum with no alternative provision for young child who can not travel a long way his mother also can not go to work i welcome the white paper in the autumn but can the deputy prime minister commit to axel ’s mum and the parent of freddie ieuan ethan and the other child with special education need and disability with no school to go to that there will be somewhere for they in september 
 i be really sorry to hear about axel and the other case that the hon member mention those with special educational need deserve proper support and should not be leave at home we be determined to fix the send system and support child before issue escalate to this type of crisis point we be invest £ this year to deploy specialist team across early year and primary school setting help to identify and respond to speech and language need particularly for child with send we will set out our full plan on the reform of send this autumn include support for the early year 
 growth need to be deliver and feel in all part of the country and the infrastructure strategy change to the green book and the £ secure for the north east be a clear demonstration of our commitment to that in my area moor farm roundabout be block growth and cause misery for people locally do the deputy prime minister agree that improve infrastructure in the north like at moor farm will show how we be invest in all part of the country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the previous government do not have a plan for area like the north east i know she have be a champion for the moor farm roundabout this government be change the situation by invest £ in local transport project across the country open up access to job and improve living standard include in the north east 
 labour have invite proposal from city to expand their boundary and the mayor of leicester want to expand the city to swallow up area like oadby wigston and great glen but local people do not want that and thousand have sign our petition against it it be not just about the high council tax they want to keep their own local identity will the deputy prime minister rule out this totally unwelcome city takeover if she do want to press ahead with it will she at least give we a say in a local referendum so that we can tell she again that we do not want this 
 well what the conservatives be tell at the general election be we do not want you interruption all right i mean they the hon gentleman ’s government he might have slip through the thing that i will say be that the hon member have say about his own government there ’ a lot of thing we should have do that we do n’t do to be honest i could not agree more and we be get on and do it 
 in armed forces week will the deputy prime minister join i in pay tribute to my former colleague at raf brize norton i know she will share my horror that some on the opposition benches respond to the appalling attack on that base not by recognise the consequence of year of conservative under investment in our defence but by personally smear of our brave member of the royal air force do she agree with i and my hon and gallant friend   the member for north east derbyshire louise jones   that this labour government will always support our armed force and that those shameful comment by the deputy leader of reform   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice bring disgrace upon he and his party 
 my hon and gallant friend speak with great authenticity and authority on this matter the attack on raf brize norton be disgraceful but what be even more disgraceful be reform blame the command officer an accomplished woman who have serve her country rather than the criminal who be responsible that be not leadership but we should not expect anything well from the party of the putin apologist 
 london borough be collectively face a funding shortfall of at least £ for the current financial year despite that the money allocate to local authority in london by the government ’s spending review fall short of the amount request by london council under the government ’s plan change to local authority funding the council in my constituency richmond and kingston be set to lose out even more while the cost of fund local service continue to rise be it the government ’s policy that london resident should continue to receive ever increase council tax bill while their local authority have less and less money to spend 
 we be fix the foundation of local government after the year of austerity that be inflict on local government with the aiding and abetting of the hon lady ’s party we have put record funding into local government with multi year settlement we be help local government where the last government ruin it 
 digital black spot area without good mobile broadband connectivity be hold community back in middleton an area that my right hon friend know well as a fellow greater manchester mp many local business and people remain cut off from the economic growth of the wide city region due to the lack of a mobile signal how can we ensure that this government ’s mission to capitalise on the promise of technology be feel in all part of the country include middleton 
 i have experience digital black spot as well so i understand my hon friend ’s frustration the industrial strategy be launch this week and there be some great idea to make sure that we get superfast broadband everywhere and we can all use our phone to make sure we can get connect whereas the last government leave we disconnect 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday june 
 israel ’s recent action be appalling and counterproductive and we strongly oppose the expansion of military operation settler violence and the blocking of humanitarian aid we have suspend free trade agreement talk and sanction extremist support settler expansion in the west bank it be a long stand principle that genocide be determine by competent international court and not by government and we do not sell arm directly to the israel defence forces when that might breach international humanitarian law 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on his department ’s plan to procure nuclear certify f-35a aircraft 
 the uk will purchase new f-35a fighter jet and join nato ’s dual capable aircraft nuclear mission in a major boost for national security the prime minister have announce at the nato summit that the uk intend to buy at least a dozen of the dual capable aircraft which can carry both nuclear and conventional weapon the secretary general of nato mark rutte say this morning 
 the uk have declare its nuclear deterrent to nato for many decade and i strongly welcome today ’s announcement that the uk will now also join nato ’s nuclear mission and procure the f-35a. 
 the decision will support job in the united kingdom with of the global supply chain for the jet base in britain support highly skilled job and opportunity for work people and deliver a defence dividend across the country the announcement respond to recommendation in the strategic defence review recommendation that the uk commence discussion 
 on the potential benefit and feasibility of enhanced uk participation in nato ’s nuclear mission 
 and recommendation on the mix of f-35b and f-35a. 
 the purchase represent the big strengthening of the uk ’s nuclear posture in a generation and reintroduce a nuclear role for the royal air force for the time since the uk retire its sovereign air launch nuclear weapon follow the end of the cold war the uk ’s commitment to nato be unquestionable as be the alliance ’s contribution to keep the uk safe and secure but we must all step up to protect the euro atlantic area for generation to come 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question you will recall that the government ’s plan announce today to procure nuclear certify f-35as be previously cover in the sunday times the day before the sdr be publish you therefore grant an urgent question that day on this very subject but we receive no meaningful answer at all i hope the minister can be more forthcoming today 
 on   may i write in the express that our nuclear force need to be even more resilient include in respect of the continuous at sea deterrent but also 
 potentially by diversify our method for deliver nuclear strike 
 that be because we have to recognise the threat pose by russia in particular and its ability to operate nuclear weapon at tactical and theatre level to deter effectively we must be able to do the same 
 in principle then i welcome the announcement but i have the following question what be the anticipated in service date for the f-35as will they already be nuclear certify or will that occur after delivery we note that the f-35as will be order instead of f-35bs but will the government still order the remain f-35bs   as plan how will the f-35as be air to air refuel give that the current raf refuelling capability be probe and drogue on operational sovereignty we be fully commit to our strong military partnership with the united states but give that the announcement be about diversity of delivery have the department give any thought to additional tactical option for which we have great industrial input such as storm shadow and typhoon 
 ironically it be lord robertson as defence secretary in who remove our last air launch nuclear capability it be noteworthy that as of the author of the sdr he say to the select committee recently that the author be 
 not terribly enthusiastic about it 
 that be before we get to the fact that the deputy prime minister and the foreign secretary vote against the renewal of trident on this side of the house we wholeheartedly back our nuclear deterrent do this situation not show why we need a robust plan to get to on defence in this parliament rather than labour ’s smoke and mirror and lack of a fully fund plan to properly increase defence spending in this parliament 
 on the in service date as the secretary of state say this morning we be hopeful that the aircraft will start deliver before the end of the decade on the tranche be order that will now include f-35as yes we will still be order the remain f-35bs so there will be extra f-35bs in the next tranche on refuelling this be a nato mission and nato will of course be able to do the air to air refuelling it be quite normal for different ally to contribute their different capability whether nuclear capable or conventional to nato ’s nuclear mission 
 i welcome the announcement and on behalf of the defence committee i welcome the additional detail that have be add to the sdr it be imperative that we recognise and close some of the gap in our national defence include the size and shape of our combat air force and this announcement do part of that but year of under investment mean that some of the choice about base and complementary capability will bring some challenge will the minister provide additional detail on how some of they may be address 
 i be pleased that my hon friend be supportive of the announcement as the house be aware this government have increase our defence spending by more than at any time since the end of the cold war the increase be fully fund unlike some of the fantasy plan of the previous government 
 it be 2.4%—less than we spend 
 we have show how we will increase spending to of gdp by that be fully fund and we have make clear how we will get to in the next parliament as condition allow the announcement be make today at nato of a target all ally will focus on provide that funding in due course over the next year nato will check every year as it always do whether its requirement be be meet and we fully expect to be able to meet they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be clear that we have enter a new and uncertain era putin ’s imperialism represent a once in a generation threat to our security we must maintain the effectiveness of the uk ’s independent nuclear deterrent to stop putin or anyone else launch a nuclear attack it remain the ultimate guarantor of britain ’s security 
 we support more investment in our defence capability but we need more detail on the propose use case for the f-35as and on their relation to our exist strong deterrent through trident we also need a clear explanation of why the government have choose this priority over other there be still huge gap in the armed force include as a result of troop be cut by the conservatives and those gap need fill if we be to show putin that we be serious can the minister confirm whether the government will move far fast in rebuild the strength and size of the other essential guarantor of uk security and deterrence the british army 
 i be glad that the hon lady support these measure as i have already make clear this decision be not at the expense of buy more f-35bs which we will do the extent to which we fully implement the strategic defence review and the order in which we implement its recommendation will be decide through our investment plan which be be work on now and will be fully publish and available in due course there be no doubt that as she say the threat we face be increase we need to make sure that we be capable of deter those threat with our ally in nato and this decision will assist we in that by join the nato nuclear mission we will be able to play our part as we say in the sdr our policy be nato and our commitment to nato be unshakeable 
 i commend the government on the prompt procurement of the f-35a fix wing which be of huge strategic importance but this be already create great uncertainty in lancashire in chorley mr speaker and in my constituency of south ribble where the workforce of the typhoon eurofighter live can the minister please assure i that the government will still be constant in look to procure the typhoon aircraft for the raf also with our nato partner all increase their defence spending be there not a huge opportunity to urge they to procure the typhoon eurofighter as well 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment what we be talk about do not of course preclude any support for the typhoon we be very committed to our typhoons and we be committed to upgrade they as per our exist plan we be engage in many effort to export and would hope that some of they will come off at some point in the not too distant future 
 we be very keen on make sure that the skill and ability of the workforce at warton be fully use we of course have the future combat air system and the global combat air programme which will use those skill in the long term many people work for bae systems not at warton but at samlesbury make part for the f-35 and i think they will be pleased to hear the announcement today 
 i join conservative front benchers in welcome the answer to the urgent question although maybe it should have be a statement may i ask about autonomy and national sovereignty over the weapon system that will be deploy from this aircraft there be considerable press reporting that it will be dual key mean that the brits can not use it without american say so be that true if so why have the ministry of defence elect to take that option rather than have full national sovereignty 
 we have a fully sovereign national nuclear capability a continuous at sea deterrent that be dedicate totally to nato and to protect the european homeland the current decision be about join the nato nuclear mission any deployment under that mission require the agreement of the nato nuclear planning group of ally who act as a senior body on nuclear matter in the alliance under that governance arrangement the uk will always retain the right to decide whether or not to participate 
 may i say how much i welcome this announcement and the extra capability that it will bring will the minister outline how this decision will support job across the uk particularly for those in my constituency of north east derbyshire who work in defence 
 the procurement of the f-35as and the next tranche of f-35bs will support job across the uk with over uk base supplier contribute to the f-35 programme that demonstrate yet again that defence can be an engine for growth because these be good job across all part of the nation and region of the uk include in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 i fully welcome the announcement and i thank the minister for make the statement in an age of uncertainty about the reliability of our us ally it seem an odd choice to be lean into they in the sense that we will be drop dual key us make munition from these plane it make more sense if this be a stepping stone to a fully sovereign uk capability but that would raise question about the nuclear non proliferation treaty will the minister comment on whether this be a stepping stone to a fully sovereign uk capability 
 it be not such a step we be join the nato nuclear mission we have just publish a strategic defence review that set out that our defence posture be nato we be try to support our ally in nato in deter any threat that might come from possible adversary that be what this be about it be not a stepping stone to anything else 
 i also welcome this announcement of increase capability the f-35as that will be bring to the defence of this country this announcement which be in line with the strategic defence review show that this country be once again serious about defence what response have we have from our nato ally to our join nato ’s nuclear mission 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s support we have have strong support from our ally in nato in my reply to   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge i read out the response of the secretary general who be full of praise 
 the minister be well aware of my interest in the f-35 programme lockheed martin manufacture around jet a year and there be nearly on order by everyone from switzerland to singapore on top of that there be still to be deliver to the us air force so whereabouts be we in the queue she mention that we would expect the delivery before the end of decade but be we cut to the front of the line give that the order from some ally be not due to be fulfil until will delivery of all plane be complete within a decade on refuelling will she clarify that we have no sovereign air to air refuelling capability outside of a nato mission 
 i know that the hon gentleman have a very close interest in these matter because i have to answer all his parliamentary question and i welcome that interest as the secretary of state say this morning we hope that we can start receive delivery of these plane before the end of the decade the hon gentleman be right that any manufacturing capability have queue but order be subject to contractual discussion and arrangement can be make so that be what we be aim for obviously we will keep the house inform of how we get on 
 i welcome the news that our deterrence capability will be enhance and make more flexible as we take another step on the escalatory ladder we be talk about a us aircraft with substantial uk industrial participation a us weapon us uk decision making and a nato mission do the minister agree that this be a powerful statement about the strength of the special relationship between the us and the uk and the strength of the nato alliance 
 i agree very much with both point the decision indicate the strength of our alliance with the us as well as the grow strength of nato 
 i do not understand industrially or militarily why the f-35 be the default choice if the f-35 can be deliver only by the end of the decade why be tempest which be more than capable of be deliver by the mid-2030 not be consider that be if we agree with the decision to be part of the nuclear sharing enterprise and i do not agree with that because no other nuclear armed state take part in nuclear sharing no other p5 member deliver any other nation ’s nuclear deterrent and no nuclear power in the world deliver anyone else ’s nuclear weapon 
 i hear what the hon gentleman say we be commit to buy f-35s in the next tranche of f-35s we have substitute f-35as for what would have be f-35bs so there be that change to the mix as recommend in the strategic defence review of the recommendation be that we should   consider the mix and we have consider it another be that we should rejoin the nato nuclear mission we have consider that and consult and we be act we have already implement of the major recommendation of the sdr give the welcome that the sdr have from member around the house we should all be glad to see the implementation of those recommendation 
 i thank the minister for the welcome announcement of the f-35a programme which come at a time when this government be increase defence spending at a rate not see since the cold war bae systems in my constituency be of the company lead on the programme to support avionic for our force and there be an outstanding invitation for the minister to visit the company will she confirm that this announcement will mean a significant increase in job and opportunity include apprenticeship for local people young people and constituent across my area and the country 
 yes i have be remind of my promise to visit that be on the list and the visit will move close to the top of the list after today i agree with my hon friend if we be to deter potential aggressor and adversary it be key that we implement the finding of the sdr and increase our capability and that be what we be do 
 may i encourage the government not to be at all bashful about the fact that the decision on whether of these weapon will be use heaven forbid will be an american there be a long tradition of american nuclear weapon be base in nato country not least the cruise and pershing missile of the 1980 which help to end the cold war will the minister confirm that not only do this fill a gap in our deterrence spectrum but it reassert the commitment of the united states to the defence of the other nato country 
 the right hon gentleman be correct that the decision do all those thing and he have make a very good point 
 i welcome the acquisition of the f-35as not least for the impact it will have on industry and job in my constituency in answer to the question about refuelling the minister describe very well how this new capability mesh with exist nato capability will she say a little more about how this capability support the defence of not only the uk but our nato ally 
 my hon friend be correct in addition to the industrial benefit that we ought to glean from increase the f-35 order it be absolutely right that it strengthen nato that be what the strategic defence review say that we should focus on and nato be what we be do rejoin the nato nuclear mission be a striking commitment we accept the recommendation to make that commitment and we be now implement it 
 i also welcome this announcement but can we talk about money we already know that of our defence budget be spend on the nuclear deterrent it be disproportionately   expensive if we be now extend the nuclear capability with these airdrop weapon what impact will that have on the budget for the rest of our conventional armed force 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s support the f-35as be actually cheap than the f-35bs so replace f-35b order with f-35a order be a cheap option and she do not have to be too concerned about the direct impact of the decision on budget the total cost of the next procurement tranche include the f-35a model will be an estimate £ but these be plan that be there and that we be now fund 
 will my right hon friend join i in praise the rugby no branch of the royal british legion who i believe be in tesco this week for a service and the hillmorton branch of the rbl who will be hold a ceremony on armed forces day i be pleased to see that this commitment will support job across the uk in the year to come with over uk base supplier contribute to the f-35 programme do she agree that this demonstrate that our national security and economic security go hand in hand and that this government will deliver that 
 i commend my hon friend ’s royal british legion branch who be get on with what many of we be do in armed forces week which be attend event that show our appreciation for our armed force in every part of the uk he be correct to say that in addition to deter our enemy and support nato and our ally more strongly there be growth potential and economic benefit from the spending that we put into our armed force and our capability 
 the propose nato target will be split into category a new broad set of defence relate item at up to of gdp alongside a commitment to spend at least of gdp on traditional defence will the minister confirm the uk government ’s commitment to article of the nato treaty on the development of peaceful and friendly international relation will she also confirm that funding for un peacekeeping mission qualify as defence spending to nato and that this budget will not lose out on the increase in the mod budget 
 i would argue that defence spending be there to create peace not to fight war it be cheap to deter war than it be to end up fight they so i would argue that our commitment to as it will be by to in the next parliament and then on to the target include the broad definition by show a very strong commitment across nato to do just that let ’s deter these war 
 i welcome the minister ’s response to the urgent question the purchase of new f-35a aircraft will increase our nuclear capability and show that our commitment to nato be unshakeable as the chair of the yorkshire and north lincolnshire all party parliamentary group i be always on the lookout for opportunity for growth in my region give that this announcement support job and place of the global supply chain   in the uk will the minister say how that will benefit my region and how she will ensure that all the investment job and growth opportunity will be spread to each part of the uk 
 i can not say precisely whether any of the company that be uk base supplier on this programme be in my hon friend ’s constituency or his region i will have to go away and look it up but i do know that these procurement spread prosperity around all region and nation of the uk that be great thing about the defence industry it provide job and growth across the uk 
 i welcome the minister for defence procurement ’s announcement this be welcome news for our country give that in service date for key piece of military equipment be often later than predict have she give any thought to train our pilot in advance of delivery either on a simulator or by embed they into a unit that operate these plane around the world so that we be ready to hit the ground run as soon as they be deliver 
 the hon gentleman be correct anything that can bring in service date forward slightly by planning and training in advance be something that we will be in favour of try to do these day it be much more the case that such arrangement be think of at the same time as the procurement so i be certain that we will be on to the point that he make 
 follow on from the previous question i have to declare that i have fly an f-35—[hon member ooh it be a simulator dramatic pause there there be company in edinburgh that be involve in the supply chain and i be keen to see what they be construct 
 i welcome the minister ’s leadership on this it be a fantastic sign that we be absolutely committed to nato and it be also a fantastic advertisement for our young people who be look for a great career they need look no far than the raf much of the discussion have focus on the nuclear capability of this aircraft but can she confirm that it could have a much wide role and be put to much great use 
 my hon friend be correct this be a dual capability aircraft which will not only be use to fly nato nuclear mission but be available to do training and all the other thing that our fantastic pilot in the raf do 
 i feel like a lone voice but in an increasingly unstable world i personally find it quite harrowing that the british air force might be fly plane that can drop nuclear bomb and where that might lead can the minister tell we whether under this agreement tactical nuclear weapon will be store on uk soil and if so what safety and security measure the government will be undertake for their storage 
 i be not sure i quite understand that question mr speaker what i can say though be that we do not normally confirm or deny where nuclear weapon might be store it be not something that we have   ever do i think that be what the hon member be ask but i be not absolutely sure i would be happy to speak to she afterwards if i have get that question wrong 
 have any alternative platform be consider for the potential delivery of a tactical nuclear weapon in particular have the government look at the astute class attack submarine as an alternative or additional platform or at its successor the ssn aukus 
 we be not seek to widen our range of nuclear capability we be join the nato nuclear mission and contribute to that as i say early this be not some kind of step stone to acquire tactical nuclear weapon our nuclear deterrent be our submarine operate continuous at sea deterrent casd and that be how it will continue 
 the prospect of uk fighter jet carry donald trump ’s nuclear bomb can not be anybody ’s vision of security this decision fly in the face of our obligation under the non proliferation treaty it tie we far into a us military that can not even keep its own classified intelligence secure it tie we far to a trump administration who be the very definition of a loose cannon give the inescapable truth that nuclear weapon make the world more dangerous and that normalise tactical weapon be incredibly reckless how can the minister possibly justify this decision 
 what i have announce today be compliant with the non proliferation treaty 
 the letter not the spirit 
 it be compliant with the non proliferation treaty the nato nuclear mission have as a governance the nato nuclear planning group of ally everybody get a say so it be not a question of it be donald trump or any other us president ’s nuclear bomb this be a nato mission to defend europe and to do what nato be set up to do deter another war 
 on   january i raise with the minister in this chamber the fact that refurbish typhoons will not touch the side of maintain the strong workforce at warton in my constituency and that rely on export order that have not be secure will not keep the workforce in work for now before the gcap come online when i ask the minister whether she would give a delay christmas present of an order for typhoons she reply 
 it might not be a christmas present i do not know when his birthday be but a present some time later ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 we be await an order of typhoons for the warton site in the strategic defence review but it turn out to contain an empty box instead of a present if the minister be not simply buy time and give false hope to the workforce then when will we see the order of typhoon jet for the raf 
 i do not think the previous government be commit to buy typhoons so i do not see why the hon gentleman should be so outraged by the fact that after less than a year we have not yet order any more typhoons we be commit to the typhoon fleet that we have the buying of any more will have to be consider in the investment plan that be be work on now other european nation be buy some typhoons so there be some work there although i know they be not assemble at warton if other nation buy they we also have export order that we be try to pursue although i can not advance what i say to the hon gentleman previously it be something that i be very conscious of and we will continue to see what can be do about the future of our typhoon fleet we be committed to the fleet that we have and to the upgrade that we need 
 in response to an early question i be pleased to hear the minister commit to seek to compress the timetable between delivery and the in service date i believe i hear the minister say that the delivery date be the back end of the 2020s can she confirm the anticipated in service date 
 i can not confirm the anticipated in service date beyond say that we be hopeful that we will get the aircraft as soon as possible and that we will be able to use they as soon as possible thereafter subject to all the usual requirement to get something in service that be as good as i can do for the hon gentleman today i be afraid 
 the minister just confirm that the uk adhere to the nuclear non proliferation treaty that treaty require the declare nuclear arm state not to allow proliferation and to take step towards nuclear disarmament what the minister have announce today be an increase in nuclear capability with the construction of new nuclear warhead that can obviously be use anywhere in the world by airdrop they can she explain how it be possible to say that this announcement be in compliance with the npt when it be so obviously and clearly the very opposite of that 
 the right hon gentleman be wrong i be afraid it be in compliance with the non proliferation treaty the nato nuclear mission would carry us nuclear weapon which be already subject to the non proliferation treaty what we be announce today be the buying of aircraft that be capable of assist with that mission not the purchasing of new nuclear weapon i hope that be clear for the right hon gentleman 
 clearly the aim be to enhance what nato have as a defensive structure so will the minister confirm that this be not a substitute for any of our other nato ally withdraw aircraft from service and that we be add to the potential cover against threat in case we be attack 
 we be add some of our capability to the nato nuclear mission by purchase these weapon which have be welcome by our ally and by the nato secretary general as improve the position for the nato nuclear mission 
 i thank the minister for her statement follow the announcement of the purchase of these f-35as i have read concern express by defence analyst this morning over the size of this fleet and whether it truly represent either a capable offensive launch or indeed a capable deterrent in early statement i think the minister have say both that these f-35s be part of the current f-35 purchase envelope and potentially that these f-35s be in addition to those currently on order i would be grateful for clarification on that point finally could the minister offer any reflection on the effect that this purchase will have on our commitment to gcap 
 for clarity i do not say that this order be in addition to our already commit tranche of f-35s i say that we be substitute what would have be f-35bs with f-35as so it be not in addition we already have and we have already purchase not all of which have be deliver this be a tranche of the next of which will be f-35as and of which will be f-35bs it be part of acquire the next tranche of f-35s that government of all stripe have be commit to over the time that the f-35 have be in production 
 i be sure the minister recognise that in addition to this plan to diversify the deterrent launch method the uk must ensure that our strategic casd enterprise have an effective and productive industrial base deliver fast maintenance time can she therefore confirm whether these aircraft will be budget from the ringfenced defence nuclear enterprise budget 
 the ringfenced defence nuclear enterprise budget be not for purchase aircraft it be for deal with our submarine it be a fair question i hope that that be a clear answer 
 i thank the minister for her answer which have be positive and strong it be just what this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland need today i welcome the news that these jet be to be procure have watch the red arrows intricate manoeuvre in newtownards on armed forces day last saturday i know that our skilled pilot be world class and they deserve the tool to do their vital job i recently read that the royal navy have regularly fail to meet recruitment target since what can the minister do to get boot on plane on boat and on land by enhance recruitment particularly in our royal navy at this very important time
