 the minister of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of recent increase in violence in the west bank 
 what assessment he have make of recent increase in violence in the west bank 
 whether official in his department have have discussion with their counterpart in israel on the recent escalation of violence in the west bank 
 the government have make it clear that settler violence and the targeting and on occasion kill of palestinian civilian be completely unacceptable 
 as call for an urgent ceasefire in gaza and an endure peaceful resolution in the region continue we must also remain opposed to the violence take place in the west bank to that end do the minister share my view that settlement building in the west bank and across the occupied palestinian territories be unacceptable and unlawful and must stop immediately 
 yes the hon lady will know that the position of the government be and have be for many year that those settlement be illegal i be pleased to be able to confirm that for she 
 the same question could be ask again it be unlawful but what be the government go to do about it do the minister think that day we might actually see some prosecution in relation to those violation of international law 
 on the point about settler violence if that be what the hon gentleman be refer to we believe that it be not good enough just to arrest those responsible they need to be both prosecute and imprison 
 the problem be that there be key figure in the israeli government who be stoke this violence with the finance minister publicly declare that there be nazi in the west bank what representation be the secretary of state make to israeli counterpart to demand a far more robust response to this violence 
 i can tell the hon lady that the prime minister speak about this directly with prime minister netanyahu on   december   and he make clear that we welcome israel ’s recent comment condemn instance of settler violence but that israel must take meaningful action to stop it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 another day when the foreign secretary be unaccountable in the middle of a war that could still get even bad west bank violence be rise hezbollah have attack israeli position and israeli airstrike have hit town in south lebanon a widening of this conflict be in no ’s interest and all party must show restraint while he be absent from this place what step be the foreign secretary take to prepare for further escalation and to deter all party from full blow regional war 
 of all i fully understand that the right hon gentleman wish to have close contact with lord cameron as the foreign secretary but he will be aware that he be in almost continuous contact with the foreign secretary by text and whatsapp indeed mr speaker if he be in any close contact it would probably be a civil partnership 
 on the substantive point about the widening of the conflict the right hon gentleman will know that very early after   october the prime minister move a british military asset to the eastern end of the mediterranean to try to ensure that if there be any arm be move we would know about it and secondly to have eye on what be happen british diplomacy along with that of our like minded ally and friend be devoted to ensure that the conflict do not widen 
 we come now to the snp spokesperson 
 the uk be provide logistical and surveillance support to the state of israel have any evidence come to light that give concern   about the commission of war crime in the west bank or in gaza 
 britain be provide some overflight of gaza to help we identify and move forward the issue of recover the hostage that be exactly the right thing to do 
 to repeat the question have any evidence come to light that give concern about the commission of war crime can the minister assure we that any such evidence that come to light will be send over to the international criminal court in response to its call for evidence under article with which the uk be surely bind to co operate 
 the hon gentleman will know that it be not just the government but many different organisation that be seek to identify what be happen on the ground and the extent to which international humanitarian law be be abide with any such evidence will undoubtedly be put before the relevant authority the court that he mention specifically if such evidence be available 
 what step his department be take to implement the uk ’s commitment in the white paper on international development publish in november 
 the white paper include commitment to be deliver through to i have ask official in the foreign office to work with colleague across government to implement the commitment and determine the order of priority 
 i thank the minister for that reply and for his leadership on the excellent white paper particularly because in the run up to its publication he clearly listen to call for more target support and humanitarian relief for those who be leave behind on account of their religion or belief the challenge now be to turn those innovative commitment into reality which will require a revised approach to development programming will he meet i and other at a roundtable to discuss that 
 it be always a pleasure to meet my hon friend who have an office next to mine in the foreign office may i thank she for her comment about the publication of the white paper the way in which it have be receive around the world demonstrate renew energy and vigour i hope that it show britain ’s reinvigorated leadership on those important matter and of course value for money for our taxpayer 
 the white paper also talk about development diplomat how many will be train and what will be the cost 
 how many 
 development diplomat they be in the white paper 
 yes the right hon lady be quite right we be increase the number of development diplomat i think she mention something about water but   i may have misheard the point about the white paper be that it set out very clearly the aim and aspiration that britain have to drive forward the sustainable development goal and ensure that we increase climate finance at this critical time she will be pleased to have see that and will note that we be now drive forward that agenda 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in mauritius on the negotiation on the sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 the foreign secretary have not yet have a chance to meet his mauritian counterpart however the prime minister meet the mauritian prime minister at the g20 in september to assess the state of negotiation they welcome the progress make and agree to meet again soon 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer but in my year of loyal service as a conservative member of parliament i have never be more disappointed alarmed and angry about the conduct of the foreign office in this matter it be negotiate in a neocolonialistic way with mauritius an entity that be over km away from the british indian ocean territory without consult the indigenous people the chagossians whom we expel in to make way for an american air force base the time have come for we to respect the right of self determination and ensure that the chagossians be allow to return to the british indian ocean territory and for they to decide the future of those island rather than hand they to the chinese client and puppet state of mauritius which would be highly counterintuitive to our aukus commitment 
 the uk have be work in close co operation with the us since negotiation begin in november and it support our approach the uk the us and mauritius have all make clear that protect the base on diego garcia include by prevent foreign malign influence be a top priority we will ensure that any agreement achieve that it be in our national interest and that of our partner and it be vital for regional and global security 
 the government be prepare to disregard international law with their rwanda bill today they seem to continue to want to disregard international law in the case of decision hand down by the international court of justice and other international body with regard to the chagos island if the uk government will not live up to their international obligation and the finding of international body how with any credibility can they ask other country to do the same 
 we be work closely with the relevant government with mauritius as i have say to take forward those negotiation they be be take forward in good faith notwithstanding the need to protect our national regional and global interest at the same time 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza 
 what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to support civilian in gaza 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 britain have increase plan assistance to palestinian civilian to £ and have deliver over tonne of aid the recent pause in fighting be a welcome opportunity to get hostage out and aid in we know that more be need more fuel increase humanitarian access and assistance into gaza and compliance with international humanitarian law 
 do the minister see the analysis recently publish in the respected israeli newspaper haaretz that the proportion of civilian death in gaza be significantly high than the average civilian death toll in all conflict around the world during the century do that not give the lie to any claim that israel be avoid civilian death and as the death toll in gaza approach be it not now time for the whole international community include the uk to support a ceasefire that protect civilian life 
 the hon gentleman will know the importance that the government and opposition front benchers attach to save civilian life and will know that britain have make it absolutely clear to the authority in israel that we expect they to abide by international humanitarian law and understand and accept the rule of war he will equally know that the unprecedented figure he refer to follow on the back of an unprecedented attack by terrorist on   october a pogrom in which more jewish people be murder than at any time since in the holocaust 
 i wholeheartedly welcome the fact that the uk have increase its humanitarian aid by £ since   october can my right hon friend outline how his department be work to ensure that that funding be spend as effectively as possible by which i mean reach those in the most urgent need i be sure we have all be greatly distress by the suffering of the innocent civilian in this conflict 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we have tonne of humanitarian supply in cyprus ready to go and tonne of medical equipment ready to go as soon as there be the possibility of get more aid and support into gaza we will be use those supply to do exactly that 
 in the past week over palestinians include child have be kill by the israeli security force in the west bank and over the past year we have see a dangerous rise in the number of attack by violent illegal israeli settler against palestinians and their property even the united states announce that it would impose a travel ban on violent extremist settler last week but all the uk government have be able to announce be that planning be go on how much more bloodshed do we need to see before the government stop plan and start act and will the minister take real action today against violent illegal settler 
 i make clear in my answer to question that the government condemn without qualification the illegal attack by settler on palestinians the hon gentleman ask i specifically about visa ban while i can not give a commentary in this house i can tell he that our plan in that respect be move forward 
 a stop start approach be likely to prolong hostage captivity and increase the risk to hostage life it also continue the relentless loss of civilian and innocent child if the un security council resolution return with a condemnation of hamas will the uk do the right thing this time and back an immediate humanitarian ceasefire 
 as the hon lady will know not least from the urgent question ask in the house yesterday by   the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy neither the government nor the opposition believe that a ceasefire be the right way to proceed however i can tell she that we be very heavily engaged in what be happen in these security council resolution and the security council permanent member be at rafah yesterday look in detail at the situation on the ground 
 there have to be a ceasefire to protect civilian in gaza do the minister agree with the us secretary for defence when he say that 
 protect palestinian civilian in gaza be both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative 
 and that 
 if you drive they into the arm of the enemy you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat 
 be the government make those representation to the israeli government 
 of course the position of the american defence secretary be exactly the position of the british government and that be why we say at all point that everyone must adhere international humanitarian law 
 the whole house be appal by the atrocity commit by hamas but also by the civilian suffering in gaza will my right hon friend set out the step he be take to relieve civilian suffering and also the step he be take against illegal settlement and the action of violent settler because they be an obstacle to the state solution and to a lasting and just peace 
 on the part of my hon friend ’s question i can tell he that we have deliver tonne of aid to el arish which we be try to make sure get in on specific relief i can inform the house that truck and litre of fuel do get across the border into rafah yesterday it be nothing like enough but there be some progress yesterday 
 israel have detain huge number of palestinians in gaza the international committee of the red cross have receive report of miss between   october   and   november and many also in the west bank we have see the image of those man strip on the beach and haaretz have release an article show that to of they be connect to hamas which mean that nearly be not be this government make representation to the israeli government about their treatment of palestinian detainee 
 the situation the hon member describe be not clear in the fog of war but i can tell she that we emphasise to everyone the importance of abide by international humanitarian law and of course the geneva convention to which she be refer 
 every life lose whether palestinian or israeli be a tragedy and so often in conflict and war it be the child who suffer the most what further discussion have my right hon friend have with the united states and other partner about have new humanitarian pause finally i be supportive of the government but may i ask he whether he feel that the israeli response be proportionate 
 we be argue in every way we possibly can that there need to be humanitarian pause and that they need to be day long so that we can get relief and humanitarian supply into gaza on my right hon friend ’s final point about proportionate force as i say early during these question that be why we emphasise continuously the importance of abide by the rule of war 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in gaza almost of the population have be force from their home with nowhere safe to go sewage be flow in the street with enormous risk to health while hospital and ambulance continue to be hit half the population be starve the most recent report be of over palestinians kill include utterly appalling number of child i recognise the effort of ministers but it be barely even slow down the tide of death when the humanitarian crisis simply need to end what be the minister ’s strategy to do that 
 at all point britain be try to use its brilliant international network work not only with the other united nations security council member but through our intense diplomatic network around the middle east on try to see a political track when it become available britain with its ally be do everything possible to achieve that on the suffering that the hon lady describe everyone in the house will agree with her analysis of that the foreign secretary recently announce an additional £ of support we be look at how that can be use specifically to assist with medical issue particularly for child 
 what step his department be take to support the overseas territory with climate change adaptation 
 the fcdo be work in partnership with the territory to develop climate security assessment through the conflict stability and security fund our blue planet programme have provide over £ since to enhance marine protection and build climate change resilience 
 i be reassure that the uk be invest heavily in climate change adaptation do my hon friend agree that the good way of future proofing that be for the fcdo to appoint a dedicated minister for all the overseas territory and to ensure that the uk never relinquish sovereignty for any of they 
 i have recently be appoint as the fcdo minister responsible for the overseas territory furthermore the prime minister have make it clear that every department should have a minister whose portfolio cover responsibility to the ot the uk have no doubt about its sovereignty over the overseas territory any decision to end british sovereignty should be on the basis of a clear constitutionally express wish of the territory ’s people 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as you know mr speaker our global british family in the uk overseas territory contain of all the unique specie that the uk be responsible for these huge marine area throughout the world ’s ocean be hugely vulnerable to climate change yet be negligible contributor to it it have be great to see more ot sign up to the blue belt initiative work with group such as great british oceans and attend the recent cop what be the minister do to encourage more overseas territory to join the blue belt and to assist overseas territory to get access to strategic international funding for conservation adaptation and resilience 
 it be an important question our need to tackle climate change extend widely to the ot we have do significant work on the blue belt programme and we have engage a large number of ot at cop28   this year so that we can help push forward their work and give great access to this funding it be vitally important 
 whether he have have recent discussion with his counterpart in pakistan on the maira shahbaz case 
 we strongly condemn force marriage and the force conversion of woman and girl include in pakistan we regularly raise our concern include individual case at a senior level with the pakistani authority and we fund project in pakistan to address the underlie cause 
 at the age of maira shahbaz be abduct force into a marriage and rap she escape and have be sit in room with her entire family terrify she be now i have lose track of the number of meeting i have have with successive home secretaries and the letter i have write nothing have happen to get this girl out yet at the same time fit young man be pour across the channel in search of a well job for god ’s sake can we not show some christian compassion what more can the foreign office do in pakistan to try to stop these force conversion and force marriage 
 we continue to press these individual case with the pakistani government the former foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for braintree james cleverly   raise human right include the persecution of minority with caretaker prime minister kakar on   september lord ahmad raise the need to protect minority community with caretaker foreign minister jilani on   september   and again in a letter on   october we continue to raise in islamabad the issue of force marriage and conversion with the pakistani authority 
 this be not only about the case of maira shahbaz but about the case of many other young christian girl young hindu girl and young sikh girl in pakistan be kidnap from an early age it be clear that there be an epidemic in pakistan of the kidnapping and abuse of young girl what be be do with pakistan to change the attitude and the law of the land 
 as well as make representation at a senior level we fund programme in pakistan work to address child and force marriage and gender base violence discrimination and intolerance especially against minority in an effort to achieve cultural change that will attend to this matter of course that be slow and painful work but our team in islamabad be fully focus on it 
 what recent discussion he have have with his israeli counterpart on israel ’s obligation under international law 
 israel have the right to defend itself against terror restore its security and bring the hostage home but it must abide by international law and take all possible measure to protect civilian 
 i do not disagree with anything that the minister have just say but the question be what do israel have to abide by international law actually look like we know that it have act with impunity in the west bank with illegal settlement and historically with the building of the wall and so on as my hon friend   the member for hammersmith andy slaughter   say the sheer scale of casualty of innocent civilian in gaza raise serious question what do it actually mean when we say that israel have to abide by international law 
 it mean precisely what it say the fact that israel be a democracy and the fact that all around the world people will be look carefully at how thing be be conduct in the region should give the hon lady hope that international humanitarian law count and will be support 
 i call the shadow minister 
 recently the international criminal court prosecutor karim khan kc visit israel and the west bank in relation to gaza he state 
 a law be not some cosmetic adornment that can be disregard it ’ a fundamental requirement that must be comply with 
 i assume the minister will agree with that if that be the case will he ensure that britain co operate fully with the prosecutor in his work 
 as a strong supporter of the international criminal court britain will always co operate we strongly support the icc the hon gentleman will know that as a state party to the geneva convention the israeli government be oblige to take action against israeli national accuse of grave breach of international humanitarian law be there to be any so that would not be a matter for the icc 
 what step he be take to help tackle destabilising activity by iran in the middle east 
 iran bear responsibility for group it have long support we have step up our response to recent attack hms diamond will bolster our maritime presence in the region and a new iran sanction regime will soon be in place give we great power to designate iranian activity 
 the regime in tehran have be blatant public and even unapologetic about its backing funding and arming of hamas terrorist who we now know be not just murder but rapist in the light of that be it not time to snap back the full range of sanction on iran to sanction a wide number of official in iran and to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 our new iran sanction regime will be lay imminently give we new and enhanced power to counter iran ’s hostile activity in the uk and around the world and its oppressive practice at home we have already sanction more than iranian individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety 
 i agree with the comment make by   the right hon member for chipping barnet theresa villiers but should we not also be wonder about what iran be do within its own border and people be execute in iran between january and july and have be execute since   october iran have be use what be happen in israel as a cover for much fast execution include those of year old hamidreza azari a child and milad zohrevand who be the woman life freedom protester to have be execute by this horrible regime be it not time that we really take the case to iran about its own human right record 
 the hon member make a very important point we call out the brutal repression of the protest that have take place and we continue to hold iran to account for its human right record include the repression of woman girl and child as he highlight we will as i say bring to bear a new sanction regime to assist in those effort 
 whether his department be take diplomatic step to help ensure that perpetrator of alleged human right violation against the tamil community in sri lanka be hold to account 
 the uk be work closely with international partner on this long stand priority include at the un human rights council where the uk lead resolution on sri lanka 
 many prominent sri lankans be credibly accuse of war crime against the tamil minority particularly towards the end of the year civil war in sri lanka but all these year on they be still at large unlike the nearly tamil who go missing and be still unaccounted for in response to the snp spokesperson my hon friend   the member for stirling alyn smith we be tell early that evidence of war crime would be take seriously how can the people of palestine have any faith in that if the tamil people of sri lanka have have the evidence sit there for all these year and the government be do nothing other than wring their hand 
 we all take these issue very seriously i be in sri lanka just a few week ago and i be able to raise the need for progress on human right on reconciliation and indeed on accountability with the president of sri lanka during my visit 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group for tamils may i ask my right hon friend the minister to assure the house that the fcdo be actively consider the evidence for sanction those credibly accuse of war   crime who be active participant in sri lankan high society and that she will pass that evidence on to the united nations human rights council in line with resolution 
 i commend my hon friend for his active and championing work as chair of the appg he be right and we absolutely recognise the concern of the sri lankan public and indeed victim group about the creation of a credible domestic accountability process we continue to urge the sri lankan government to address those concern as i say i raise they when i be there i be also able to discuss human right and justice issue with member of civil society tamil representative and the governor of the northern province when i visit jaffna 
 i call the shadow minister 
 sri lanka be a key member of the commonwealth family and occupy a strategically vital position geographically warm relation be vital but for far too long those accuse of brutal crime in the past include against the tamil minority have escape justice will the minister outline what step she be take to support the tamils call for justice include if necessary by take action against exist and former sri lankan ministers will she outline the support for sri lankan democracy and human right 
 the hon lady be absolutely right we welcome the recent write update on sri lanka by the united nations high commissioner for human rights and in september the uk government issue statement that emphasise the importance of inclusive transitional justice and effective governance reform in order to highlight the arbitrary use of law to suppress dissent as i say we lead unhrc resolution on sri lanka provide the mandate for the office of the un high commissioner for human rights to report on sri lanka and we continue to work with it 
 what recent diplomatic step he have take to help secure peace in israel and palestine 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of formally recognise the state of palestine 
 what step his department be take with international partner to support a state solution in israel and palestine 
 whether he have make an assessment of the effectiveness of israel ’s campaign against hamas 
 there must be a political solution to the israeli palestinian conflict a state solution that provide justice and security for both israelis and palestinians 
 the aerial bombardment by israel of of the most densely populate region in the world in gaza have be devastating recent statistic report in israel show that of death in gaza have be civilian when the prime minister speak to the israeli prime minister last week do he urge he to stop besiege and blockade gaza to comply with international law which must mean be proportionate and to protect innocent life 
 the hon member be right at the cop the prime minister be able to have meeting with qatar egypt and jordan as well as with israel and he reiterate the point that he have make publicly before which be that israel have the right to self defence but it must operate within international humanitarian law 
 the minister talk about the need for a state solution and we will not find much disagreement on that but how can he advocate a state solution when the government refuse to recognise the state of palestine be he confident that there will be much leave of palestine after israel ’s continue bombardment that be why we need a ceasefire right now 
 the government strongly support the state solution of course before these terrible event on   october there be new partnership with israel develop across the middle east think in particular of the emirates and bahrain when there be a break in the cloud and an opportunity for a political track to get go we will do everything we can to build on the important point that the hon member underline 
 notwithstanding the attempt genocide of   october   and the cynical use of palestinian civilian as human shield the single good solution for peace in the region be a state solution what step be the government take to facilitate that do my right hon friend agree that the kidnapper murderer and rapist of hamas can not be involve in those negotiation 
 yes we certainly agree with the united states that gaza should be under palestinian control in due course and that there be no place for hamas in all of that in respect of my hon friend ’s point about how we advance towards a state solution he will know that the foreign secretary have be both in tel aviv and on the west bank in ramallah and we be look to see what britain can do to help build the capacity of the palestinian state in the future and to bolster it 
 the minister will have access to intelligence our and that of our ally that he may not be in a position to share with the house will he therefore share his understanding of the effectiveness of israel ’s campaign to weaken and eliminate hamas and return the hostage give the appalling and unacceptable loss of innocent palestinian life thousand and thousand of child have be maim and kill give the catastrophic humanitarian situation in gaza give that more than israeli hostage remain in captivity there and give that hamas continue to fire rocket into israel every day 
 we be do everything we can to help the hostage to whom she refer and to ensure that they come home we do that through negotiation not least in qatar and through the overflight which i refer   to early the hon lady may rest assure that the government take precisely the same view as she on what should be achieve 
 whether he have have discussion with his counterpart in the philippines on the case of leila de lima 
 we welcome the release of leila de lima on bail which be a positive step for human right and the rule of law the uk ’s ambassador have repeatedly raise this case with the philippines government and visit she during her detention 
 i agree that it be good news that senator de lima have be release on bail after nearly year of detention what representation be the government make to their counterpart in the philippines via the ambassador about resolve all the other charge against she which be believe to stem from her vocal opposition to thousand of extrajudicial killing in connection with former president duterte ’s war on drug and about a meaningful investigation into those killing 
 the uk government regularly engage with the government of the philippines on the full range of our human right concern we welcome the un human rights council resolution which propose technical co operation on human right between the government of the philippines and the united nations the resolution result in a year un joint programme which commence in to which the uk have contribute £ we will continue to work alongside they 
 whether he have have recent discussion with his commonwealth counterpart on the propose readmittance of zimbabwe to the commonwealth 
 i regularly discuss a broad range of issue include zimbabwe with commonwealth counterpart most recently on sunday in dubai when i meet the commonwealth secretary general baroness scotland the decision on re entry be for all member base on the membership requirement and the value and principle set out in the commonwealth charter 
 give the recent enlargement of the commonwealth the matter that the minister refer to be important more than zimbabweans live in the uk many in south wales and thousand work all year round in our nhs what engagement have the minister have with the zimbabwean diaspora to understand the diversity of perspective and to support their view about commonwealth membership and other challenge and issue that they face 
 the hon lady be right that zimbabwe have a productive and vibrant diaspora in the united kingdom and we hear their view many time britain warn that the election need to be violence free and fair and it be certainly violence free we be wait for the full report of the observer before make a judgment on further event 
 what step he be take to help secure the release of hostage hold by hamas 
 we be work with international and regional partner to secure the release of hostage include british national 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer the hostage who have be release report sexual and physical violence commit against they while in captivity the israeli health ministry report that hostage be drug to make they look happy do my right hon friend agree that hamas be treat hostage in an inhumane fashion the international red cross should be give the opportunity to visit they all and we should ensure that they be return home as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be quite right about the right of the international red cross we be involve in intensive diplomatic effort to secure the release of the hostage it be continually raise by the prime minister who meet family of british people take hostage by hamas and of other hostage during his trip to israel my hon friend may rest assure that while i can not give a running commentary on these matter we be do everything we can to secure their release 
 i wholeheartedly support the call for the immediate and unconditional release of all the remain hostage hold by hamas and other group however far to the minister ’s response to my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck i refer he to un resolution of when the uk support a ceasefire in gaza and a permanent ceasefire follow a few day later 
 the hon lady will be well aware of the view of the government and indeed of the opposition front bench on the possibility of a ceasefire at this time which we simply do not think exist on the early event that she refer to the situation then be very different from the that pertain today 
 on the issue of hostage taking the british russian dual national vladimir kara murza be jail and poison by the putin regime for criticise the war in ukraine he be a de facto hostage of the regime i have just meet his mother who be in parliament today will the minister arrange for i to meet the foreign secretary with his relative to hear about the condition and torture he have be subject to 
 i be advise that minister have meet the family but i will see what i can do to facilitate a meeting as my right hon friend request 
 small number of hostage have be release in the past as a result of pause in the response by the israeli authority will the minister undertake to ensure that there be wide understanding both here and internationally that those pause be well activate whenever hamas do not take advantage of they and again embe themselves in hospital and civilian population 
 the hon gentleman be right to emphasise the importance of humanitarian pause and preferably humanitarian pause that be several day long we be do everything we can to try to ensure that the case for humanitarian pause and the ability that would result of get aid support and supply into gaza be achieve

 mr speaker can we bring the minister to the house to explain why he have leave the cop talk and what that mean for our negotiation

 the reasoned amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition have be select 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 before i speak to the bill let i say that the house may well be aware that tragically there have be a death on the bibby stockholm barge i be sure that the thought of the whole house like mine be with those affect the house will understand that at this stage i be uncomfortable go into any more detail but we will of course investigate fully 
 this government be stop the boat arrival be down by a this year as illegal entry be on the rise elsewhere in europe indeed small boat arrival be up by in the mediterranean but they be down by a across the channel the large ever small boat deal with france tackle the supply of boat engine and part the arrest and conviction of people smuggler and a increase in raid on illegal working be have an impact a positive we have sign return and co operation agreement with france bulgaria turkey italy georgia and ethiopia hotel be be return to their local community and the initial asylum backlog which stand at be now under we have send back illegal migrant and the uk ’s arrangement with albania prove that deterrent work 
 rise 
 i will not give way yet as i have just start 
 last year a of all those arrive in small boat to the coast of this country be albanian this year we have return albanians and arrival from albania be down by but in recent year some of the government ’s effort to tackle illegal migration and deport foreign national offender have be frustrate by a seemingly endless cycle of legal challenge and ruling from domestic and foreign court 
 rise 
 i will give way in a moment of course this government respect court judgment even when we disagree with they but parliament and the british people want an end to illegal immigration and they support the rwanda plan 
 the home secretary point to deterrence he have often use the australian model of offshore detention centre as a gold standard what be his comment then on the fact that australia have recently shut down its offshore centre because of the high financial and human cost 
 the hon lady raise the case of australia it have illegal migration by boat and that have trend pretty much down to deterrence work 
 i be sure that my right hon friend will agree that the british be world champion at queue we do not like queue jumper which be why illegal immigration grate with we will he confirm that the government will take all step to ensure that we remain within international law not just now but go forward in that case i will certainly be support the bill tonight do he also agree that some colleague in this place need to be careful what they wish for 
 i be confident and indeed the conversation i have have with the government ’s legal adviser reinforce my belief that the action we be take while novel and very much push at the edge of the envelope be within the framework of international law that be important because the uk be a country that demonstrate to the whole world the importance of international law we champion that on the world stage and it be important that we demonstrate it 
 rise 
 i be go to make further progress judge of course play an important role but they be not policymaker and they should not be policymaker when the court find a particular formulation of policy unlawful it be the job of politician to listen to their view respect their view and find a solution 
 rise 
 i will make further progress thank to the effort on the part of the uk government and the government of rwanda that be exactly what we have do in response to the verdict from the supreme court the new treaty that i sign last week with rwanda and the bill that accompany it be game change the principle of relocate people to a safe country to have their asylum claim process there be entirely consistent with the term of the refugee convention both the high court and the court of appeal unanimously confirm that point 
 my right hon friend be an excellent foreign secretary so he will know the extraordinary tension that exist between the democratic republic of the congo and rwanda the democratic republic of the congo accuse rwanda of sponsor the m23 terrorist organisation which be violate congolese woman and kill congolese soldier this week the congolese president name the rwandan president as a hitler like figure what be my right hon friend ’s response to the concern of our congolese friend in that regard 
 in my former role i have extensive conversation with the government of both the democratic republic of the congo and rwanda we do   not agree with that assessment of the government of rwanda more importantly other international organisation also rely heavily on rwanda include the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the european union they would not do that if they believe that rwanda be an unsafe country 
 rise 
 i intend to make further progress this be reading and there will be plenty of opportunity for colleague to speak but i give way to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 just yesterday i receive correspondence state 
 eu council directive ec be catch by article 2(1 of the protocol therefore can be rely upon in ni but not gb 
 it add that article of the directive 
 confer the right to remain in the territory 
 while a claim be be process which 
 create additional right in ni 
 that do not apply in gb and 
 expressly frustrate the core intent of the rwanda bill from apply in ni 
 have the home secretary have the opportunity to look at that 
 the point that the hon gentleman make about differential treatment in different part of the united kingdom be that we be conscious of as the bill progress he and other will have the opportunity to raise concern about specific detail we will of course listen to his concern and those of other when pass the bill will address the practical implication at the moment the challenge of the number of refugee be not as significant in northern ireland as in other part of the uk but as the hon gentleman have hear i say before we be always conscious to make sure that all part of the uk be and feel that they be in the thinking of the government as we move forward 
 rise 
 i will make further progress as i say the principle of relocate people to a safe country to have their asylum claim process be entirely consistent with the term of the refugee convention the high court and the court of appeal unanimously confirm that and the supreme court do not dispute those finding in own finding week ago 
 do my right hon friend agree that it be clear in international law and in relation to the question of the rule of law that in this country with our unwritten constitution a clear and unambiguous use of word clearly establish the intention of parliament in the enactment of a law take precedence over international law in accordance with the judgment of lord hoffmann as well as judgment and statement by lord judge lord denning and other very distinguished jurist include in paragraph of the judgment make last month 
 my hon friend make an important point he be right that when the wording of a bill be clear and unambiguous where there be a deeming clause that   be the express will of parliament that parliament be sovereign and that that thinking must be adhere to through the legal process 
 rise 
 i be go to make some progress 
 a few week ago the supreme court uphold the judgment of the court of appeal mean that we can not yet lawfully remove people to rwanda that be because of concern that it express that relocate individual might be refoule i be sure the house know that that mean that those individual might be re deported to a country the government disagree with that verdict but as i have say we respect the verdict of their lordship it be important to understand that the supreme court ’s judgment be base on the fact as they exist month ago and that the court say the problem could be remedie as i tell the house last week we have work on and find that very remedy our asylum partnership with rwanda set out in a legally bind international treaty the obligation of both the uk and rwanda within international law 
 i be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for give way as he say international law and domestic law be both important but they be different the bill seek to give this house the power to deem rwanda a safe country can he confirm for i that what it do not seek to do be suggest that this country or this house have the power to deem itself in compliance with international law my worry stem from clause1(5 of the bill which of course reflect the government ’s intention to deem rwanda a safe country but then go on to describe the safe country as 
 to which person may be remove in compliance with all of the united kingdom ’s obligation under international law 
 will he confirm that it be not the government ’s intention to suggest that it fall to any country to deem itself in compliance with international law he do not need i to explain what the consequence of that might be elsewhere in the world and that he will look again at the language and whether it need to be change to clarify that point 
 i can reassure my right hon and learn friend that that be absolutely not the intention of the bill the deeming clause be specifically about the safety of rwanda because of our response to their lordship position at the supreme court hearing we be not seek to redefine through domestic legislation international law 
 if the right hon gentleman be right and the treaty with rwanda meet the concern of the supreme court why be this bill necessary if rwanda be now a safe country as a result of the treaty why be this highly controversial bill which be clearly cause great problem in his own parliamentary party necessary 
 we be put forward legislation that will be clear and unambiguous so as to support the treaty the treaty address the concern raise by their lordship 
 rise 
 with the indulgence of the house i intend to make some progress i want to make sure that other have a full chance to speak in this debate 
 the bill set out to parliament and to the court why rwanda be safe for those relocate there the treaty that i sign last week put beyond legal doubt the safety of rwanda it provide the basis to end the merry go round of legal challenge that have guess the will of parliament and frustrate this policy this house and the desire of the british people 
 rwanda will introduce an even strong end to end asylum system strong still than the that underpin its relationship with the united nations high commissioner for refugees it will have a specialist asylum appeal tribunal 
 i thank the home secretary for give way since we last speak in this house it have be confirm that the government have give the rwandan government £ with a furth £ to come in april all independently of anybody be be send to rwanda will he now confirm that the government ’s deal also mean a furth £ in and a furth £ on top of that in 
 the right hon lady be ask i to confirm figure that we have put in the public domain unsurprisingly i be totally comfortable confirm what i have already say rwanda will introduce an even strong 
 rise 
 the right hon lady have the chance to make a speech in just a few moment 
 the system of specialist asylum tribunal to consider individual appeal against any refused claim within rwanda will have rwandan and other commonwealth co president and will be make up of judge from a mix of nationality select by the co president to the point the right hon lady be make about the money spend by the british government as be the case with many country around the world the government spend money capacity build with our international partner and we have be work extensively with rwanda to build capacity too 
 the treaty make clear that anyone relocate to rwanda can not be remove from rwanda to another country except back to the united kingdom it be bind in international law and enhance the role of the independent monitoring committee which will have the power to set its own priority area for monitoring the committee will have unfettere access to monitor the entire relocation process from initial screening to relocation and settlement in rwanda relocate individual and legal representative will be able to launch confidential complaint directly with that committee it be that treaty and the accompany evidence pack that enable the government to conclude with confidence that rwanda be safe we will need to be certain that domestic and foreign court will also respect the treaty and that be why we have introduce this bill 
 on that point on foreign court clause 5(2 say 
 it be for a minister of the crown to decide whether the united kingdom will comply with the interim measure 
 be the advice from the attorney general that it will be compatible with international law for a minister to refuse to comply with such an indication 
 my right hon friend who be an expert proceduralist in this house will know that advice from the ag to government be privileged and i be not go to share it at the dispatch box but he will also know that the government ’s position be clear and unambiguous that this be in accordance with international law he can rest assure of that 
 will my right hon friend confirm that as a matter of law an interim measure under rule be direct not to the court of the uk but to the government of the member state therefore what the bill say simply restate what be the position anyway it be the member state that it apply to not the court 
 my hon friend be absolutely right 
 will the home secretary give way 
 i will give way more time and then i will make more progress 
 the home secretary say he will not reveal to the house the attorney general ’s advice and that be fine but on the issue of the money his permanent secretary be in front of the public accounts committee yesterday and tell we that as well as the payment of £ due next year there be payment plan for year and be he willing to share with the house how much will be pay to rwanda in year and of the programme 
 the hon lady will know that we have commit to a reporting schedule that be completely consistent with other government departments and with the reporting schedule of the home office in other area we intend to commit to do that 
 this bill build on the illegal migration act and complement all other measure that this government be employ to end illegal migration the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill make it unambiguously clear that rwanda be safe and it will prevent the court from guess the will of this sovereign parliament 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i have to make progress 
 the bill give effect to the judgment of parliament that rwanda be a safe country notwithstanding uk law or any interpretation of international law for the purpose of the bill a safe country be to which people 
 may be remove from the united kingdom in compliance with all of the united kingdom ’s obligation under international law 
 i hope that will reassure my right hon and learn friend   the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright 
 that be relevant to the treatment in that country of person who be remove there 
 it mean that someone remove to that country will not be remove or send to another country in contravention of any international law and that anyone who seek asylum or who have have an asylum determination will have their claim determine and be treat in accordance with that country ’s obligation under international law 
 rise 
 i be go to make progress i have be generous but i want other to have the chance to speak 
 anyone remove to rwanda under the provision of this treaty will not be remove from rwanda except to the united kingdom in a very small number of limited and exceptional circumstance should the uk request the return of any relocate person rwanda will return they decision maker include myself or the holder of the post of home secretary an immigration officer and the court must all treat rwanda as a safe country they must do so notwithstanding the relevant uk law or any interpretation of international law by court or tribunal that include the european convention on human right the refugee convention the international covenant on civil and political right the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human being which open at warsaw on   may customary international law and 
 any other international law or convention or rule of international law whatsoever include any order judgment decision or measure of the european court of human rights 
 the prime minister have be crystal clear that he and the government he lead will not let foreign court destroy this rwanda plan and curtail our effort to break the business model of the evil people smuggle gang 
 my right hon friend make the point about foreign court but what about domestic court be there not a danger that in pursue quite stringent measure in this bill we be really test the principle of comity to breaking point this house and this parliament be sovereign but we also have the independence of the court and the rule of law to bear in mind and restraint on both side by the judiciary and by this place be essential if we be to maintain the balance of our constitution 
 my right hon and learn friend know i have a huge amount of respect for he not just as a friend and an individual but for his experience at the bar at a very high level he raise an important point and i want to give he complete reassurance that we have look very carefully at that balance he speak about and we respect the importance of that we genuinely believe this bill get the balance right although because of the grow nature of this extreme and perverse trade in human misery we have to take firm action we be therefore act in a way that maintain that balance it be novel he say it be contentious and that be true but we be do it because we have to break this business model we have to do this 
 when the european court of human rights this speak to the point make by my right hon friend   the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg   just a moment ago indicate an interim measure relate to the intended removal of someone to rwanda under or purportedly under a provision of the immigration act a minister of the crown alone not a court or tribunal will decide whether the uk will comply with that interim measure 
 in order to far prevent individual claim to prevent removal the bill disapplie certain relevant provision from the human rights act in particular circumstance include section and this be lawful this be fair this be necessary because we have now address every reason that have be use to prevent removal to rwanda we have block asylum claim from be admit with legislation that have already pass through this house when the illegal migration act be enforce modern slavery disqualification provision will assist with speedy removal 
 the only possible blocking of removal be if an individual can demonstrate with compelling evidence that there be an immediate risk of serious and irreversible harm to they in particular under their individual circumstance that set the bar rightly very high so that the chance of that happening be rightly extremely small the only way to deter people from come here illegally be to convince they that if they do they will be unable to stay instead they will be detain and swiftly remove to a safe country or their home country if it be safe to do so 
 rise 
 i will conclude as i have be on my foot for a while 
 this be how we will save life at sea this be how we will deter illegal migration and this the house should take note be how we will break the business model of the most evil and perverse trade that we currently can see the trade in vulnerable people the people smuggler be not humanitarian they be vicious criminal and we must take action to stop they this be how we restore confidence in our immigration system and assert full control over our border 
 rise 
 i be nearly do let i conclude 
 this be how we will overcome the intolerable pressure on taxpayer public service and local community that illegal immigration create that be how we will ensure that the system be fair fair to those who play by the rule and fair to the british people who be rightly sick of people arrive here from france in small boat from france a safe and wonderful country rwanda stand ready to welcome those new arrival it stand ready to work with we to find a solution on this global issue rather than be part of a problem and for that i believe it should have our thank and admiration this be an innovative and humane solution to a grow global problem other country be look at what we be do and make similar plan of their own a new treaty and this bill make it clear in law that rwanda be a safe country to which to relocate illegal migrant 
 i want to extend an offer to the whole house colleague across this house must know how much this matter to our constituent our voter no matter which party they vote for be warm and welcome people to those in genuine need we have see that in the way in which people across this country have open their home to many of the half a people who have come here via safe and legal route in the past decade but the british people rightly expect everyone to play by the rule and they expect we in this house to do what it take to stop the boat that be what vote for this legislation mean our voter be horrify when they see image of people drown in the channel they be horrify when they see people smuggler take advantage of people they want an end to illegal migration this government have a plan that will provide an alternative home for illegal arrival to the uk and deter other from come here illegally i commend the bill to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add 
 this house while affirm support for secure the uk ’s border reform the broken asylum system and end dangerous small boat crossing decline to give a reading to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill because the bill will not work to tackle people smuggle gang end small boat crossing or achieve the core purpose of the bill will lead to substantial cost to the uk taxpayer every year whilst apply to less than per cent of those who claim asylum in the uk threaten the uk ’s compliance with international law far undermine the potential to establish security and return agreement with other country and do not prevent the return of relocate individual who commit serious crime in rwanda back to the uk 
 i join the home secretary in express our sympathy for the family and friend of the asylum seeker who have apparently die on the bibby stockholm i understand that the home secretary can not say more about that at the moment 
 this should be a debate about how we prevent life be lose about how we strengthen our border security about how we stop dangerous boat crossing and about how we fix the broken asylum system instead we have just get total tory chaos what a fine mess this weak prime minister have get they all into and get the country into as well they be tear lump out of each other over a fail policy while let the country down 
 a home secretary have be sack an immigration minister have resign and the tories have spend almost £ of taxpayer money on rwanda without send a single person the home secretary seem to confirm today that in fact it be £ without a single person be send more home secretary have be send to rwanda than asylum seeker that be about £ per trip the climate minister   the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart have be call back from the dubai cop for the vote well i guess the government can say that at least flight have take off as a result of the legislation 
 we have have the tory home secretary send to rwanda in year the bilateral agreement with rwanda in year and now the tory law on asylum and rwanda in year and they be about to write their cheque to rwanda it turn out that   they set up a direct debit hundred of million of pound for a fail scheme that be only ever likely to cover a few people less than of those claim asylum last year and have become a proxy for the deep civil war in the tory party 
 in this carousel of conservative chaos we have the european research group the northern research group the new conservatives the old conservatives the nation group the implausibly name conservative growth group and if you think that be an oxymoron mr speaker we also have the conservative common sense group seriously there be so many fighting faction but they all have thing in common they do not believe in the bill 
 the prime minister be force into an emergency breakfast meeting this morning less a smoked salmon offensive more butter up his mps with bacon butty and side of briefing and backstabbing promise his mps amendment and then row back tell they that he really want to break international law but that the rwandan government will not let he he be hide behind the kigali administration because he be too weak to even defend his plan weak weak weak 
 the prime minister say that his patience be wear thin well how do the tories think the country feel when watch this chaos he be hop that his party will calm down over christmas but they all know who the christmas turkey be and he be sit in no 
 the prime minister have come up with a plan he be committed to it we have have assurance from the dispatch box that all step will be take to stay within international law what be the official opposition ’s plan 
 the hon gentleman hop that his prime minister have a plan but no back bencher on either side of the house seem to agree with it we be clear that what we should be do be use the hundred of million of pound that the government be waste in cheque write to rwanda for nothing for a scheme that will send at good only a few people to strengthen our border security go after the criminal gang and make sure that we clear the asylum backlog and save the taxpayer billion of pound interruption actually he have not the home secretary like to claim that he be do that he like to claim that he be bring down the number of people in hotel but in fact that number have go up to a record high of since the prime minister say he be go to end asylum hotel use it have go up by a further because he be fail 
 i welcome the new immigration ministers to their post of whom   the hon member for corby tom pursglove have be an immigration minister before i think that during the time he be immigration minister net migration treble and the number of boat crossing also treble but i be sure nobody will hold that against he the government have obviously appoint immigration ministers this time in case another resign because he think their policy be totally fail and too weak in the word of the ex immigration minister   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick this new law will not work do not do the job and be 
 both legally and operationally fundamentally flawed 
 will the right hon lady give way 
 i will give way to the hon member if he can say whether he agree with the previous immigration minister or the current 
 i be grateful to the shadow home secretary for ask i question she overestimate my ability talk of christmas turkey this morning the leader of the opposition give an interview on radio that typically contain no policy whatsoever can she outline how she would reduce immigration and tackle the problem that she be castigate this government for give that everything she say she would do the government be already do 
 the trouble be that they be not they be just not the scale of the government ’s operation to go after the criminal gang be tiny the £ that the government have already commit to rwanda be a of the budget of the national crime agency they be prepared to put that investment into rwanda into this tiny scheme that will affect only a couple people but be totally fail to invest sufficiently in tackle the criminal gang work with europol and go after the supply chain there be warehouse of boat across europe that the european police force be totally fail to go after which our party have say we would go after we would work with europol and get new security arrangement in place which again the government be fail to do 
 instead we have the former home secretary   the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman who sign the last agreement and bring forward the last piece of legislation say that the bill be fatally flawed and will not stop the boat yesterday we have back benchers say that the bill should have be pull because it be partial and incomplete and the home secretary who privately call this whole thing batshit”—is out to bat for it today even though he know it will not work 
 this be the tories asylum crisis year ago we do not have a major problem with dangerous boat crossing but they let criminal gang take hold along the channel they fail to work with france at the beginning when they have the chance and they let smuggler spread their tentacle along the coast organise dangerous boat crossing that undermine border security and put life at risk 
 at the same time the tories let home office decision make collapse they decide to downgrade the skill and experience of caseworker then shrug their shoulder when productivity drop they fail to return people they have let return collapse down by compare with the last labour government the next labour government if we be elect would set up a new major return unit with additional staff to increase return rather than the total number of return collapse and the government fail to return people who have no right to be here our party would introduce a new return unit to make sure we have proper enforcement interruption 
 order just shout at the shadow home secretary be not a good look you should be listen to what she have to say 
 will the right hon lady give way on the last point 
 i will 
 i be extremely grateful be this not just a fig leaf for a completely incompetent home office i have a constituent who have exhaust his leave to remain and want to go back to fiji he apply to the voluntary return service in september and give his passport to the home office in december that be in the local church be go to pay for his ticket yet he still can not return if the home office can not deal with case like that how can we trust it with anything else 
 the hon member be totally right i have now hear of a series of fail asylum case in which people want to return to their home country and have apply to the home office to be able to do so and the home office have tell they that they will have to wait month because it be so incapable of get a grip in the case that the hon member have raise somebody have be wait for month to be able to return to their home country there have be a drop in return compare with the last labour government because the tories always go after gimmick and they never get a grip there be people whose asylum application have fail and who have not be return and people the government have just lose they do not even know where they be it be their policy to let the backlog soar and put people in hotel this be the tories asylum crisis and they be fail to fix it 
 the prime minister have make this legislation this policy the tories flagship it be extortionately expensive and it be fail minister have repeatedly try to hide the cost just day ago the home secretary be try to suggest that it be only £ it have already cost twice that for nobody to be send under a scheme that home office official have describe as unenforceable and at high risk of fraud those hundred of million of pound could now be £ and i would like whichever immigration minister wind up today ’s debate to explain whether this be now in fact a £ plan that be hundred of million of pound that could have be spend on thousand more police to boost our border security and smash the criminal gang it could have be use to clear the backlog entirely end hotel use and save we a further couple of pound or train doctor or nurse 
 of course if the government manage to send people to rwanda they will have to spend further money probably around £ per person perhaps the minister could also confirm that figure that be more than twice as much as it cost here in the uk so can the government confirm that by the time they have finish close to half a pound will have be pay to rwanda for just a few people around of those arrive in the country the court of appeal have say that there be only capacity in rwanda for around people even the judge who agree with the government say that talk of thousand be political hyperbole the asylum system in rwanda be also limit it have only process an average of people a year for the past year so at most it will be a few people some people be in hotel apply for asylum last year and be wait in the backlog so potentially less than of those people will be cover by the scheme it be no wonder that the permanent secretary say yesterday 
 we do not have evidence of a deterrent effect 
 the government be now on their new law in year the home secretary say that the bill mean 
 if you enter britain illegally you will be detain and swiftly remove to a safe country such as rwanda”—[official report   march vol c. 
 except that be not the current home secretary but his predecessor talk about the last bill the illegal migration act pass month ago the main section of that act have not actually be enact because the government know it will not work the home secretary have also say that the bill will 
 deter illegal entry into the uk”—[official report   march vol c. 
 and that anyone who arrive illegally will be send 
 to the country they arrive from or a safe country 
 but that also be not this home secretary or this bill it be his predecessor but   the right hon member for witham priti patel when she introduce the main provision of the nationality and borders act pass month ago the main section of that act have be revoke because it make thing bad the act be largely revoke because it make thing bad and the be not yet in force because the government know it will not work so forgive we for not believe a single word about the bill that be before we today we have hear it all before 
 when he respond to the debate the immigration minister should explain what be go to happen about clause of the illegal migration act which require the home secretary to remove everyone to rwanda or elsewhere if they arrive after july the government have put that provision on hold apparently until after rwanda get off the ground but even if they do manage to do that quickly more than people will have arrive in the country on small boat since then all of whom the government have now promise to send to rwanda if rwanda be only go to take a few people a year it be go to take the government over year to send those people who have arrive since they pass the last law it will take they year to send everyone who have arrive in the last fortnight alone in the meantime while they focus on this gimmick they be fail to get a grip and they be fail to bring down the backlog instead we have people in asylum hotel at the taxpayer expense at the astronomical cost of £ a day
