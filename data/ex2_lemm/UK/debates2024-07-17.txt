 our and year old and our young people need a real voice and need those measure in this parliament i hope that when we debate the bills put forward in today ’s king ’s speech the voice of young people be seek out and listen to and that many change and addition be make where they be need most include remove the child benefit cap 
 i be grateful for the patience of hon member in listen to i i greatly look forward to see the impact of the young voice i plan to raise up in this chamber be grant the same attention and respect 
 thank you for call i to speak mr deputy speaker i be grateful for the opportunity to make my   maiden speech during this important debate like other i wish to congratulate all those who have speak before i particularly those who make their maiden speech not least   the hon member for york outer mr charters   whose contribution be very substantial 
 i be originally from the village of dunloy in the north east of ireland i represent the aberdeenshire north and moray east constituency in the north east of scotland i pay close attention when   the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis   be advise new member on our ambition for the future particularly because i want to share my ambition i be the mp for aberdeenshire north and moray east and i hope to be the last mp for aberdeenshire north and moray east 
 this be a coastal area that stretch from the river spey in the west to cruden bay in the south it be an area note not only for its industry but for the industriousness of its people and its community its long stand economic strength be in farming fishing and their associated sector include food and drink production and in more recent time in the oil and gas industry and their supply chain the area make a substantial and significant contribution to the nation ’s energy security and food security 
 we be now undergo a new industrial revolution associate with the renewable sector as the world adapt to new challenge i believe that it be our duty in this parliament to capitalise on the opportunity that now present themselves in the north east of scotland it be also a most beautiful area something of an undiscovered gem with a develop tourism industry member will remember that the next time they enjoy a single malt an aberdeen angus steak a prawn cocktail or perhaps a fish supper because the chance be that they come from the industry base in my constituency 
 there be also significant poverty in particular child poverty in this otherwise prosperous area although this be mainly concentrate in large town it be also a challenge in village and rural area where it be often less visible recent figure suggest that around child in this constituency be live in serious poverty some of they in absolute poverty to be clear that mean that they do not have enough money to meet basic need for shelter clothing and food that be something that we should all remember in our position of privilege and it be something that we should all work together on to change 
 i want to pay tribute to the outgoing mp david duguid who represent the previous banff and buchan constituency which disappear in the recent boundary change some member will know that david experience sudden and significant ill health before the general election be call i wish he a speedy and full recovery david be an excellent mp who do his good to represent everybody in the constituency but most notably the interest of the energy fishing and farming industry his effort be in stark contrast to the way that he be treat in the end when he be effectively deselecte by his colleague i wish david and his family well in whatever their future plan may involve i also wish to acknowledge the work of the last snp mp in this area eilidh whiteford who be an outstanding political representative 
 today in the king ’s speech the government have an opportunity to immediately abolish the harmful child cap on child benefit and the notorious rape clause which my former colleague the outgoing mp for glasgow central alison thewliss work so hard to end the failure to do this be an early indictment of the government ’s policy position i be encourage when i hear contribution from   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier   and   the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell but what about the contribution from   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   when he say no if no but just do it 
 it be simply not good enough for the people of scotland an energy rich nation to pay so much to heat their home while so many of their bairn be live in absolute poverty i will be focus on this issue over the course of this parliament i will seek to defend the interest of our farming and fishing industry to protect our public service and to help realise the potential of renewable energy and carbon capture to deliver job and economic growth but above all i shall be a voice for the weak and the disadvantaged after year of austerity we need a change of direction not more of the same i wish to make special mention of the waspi woman who have be so unfairly treat by successive government and who deserve compensation 
 to conclude i thank the people of my constituency for their support at the ballot box my colleague in the snp and in other party and the various member of house staff on the westminster estate who have be so welcoming and helpful on my arrival and during my induction 
 finally and member would not expect i to say anything less i will be work hard in this place and elsewhere to press the case for the people of scotland to be afford their democratic right to determine their own future 
 it be an honour to have be elect to represent moray west nairn and strathspey which be something of an amalgam of a couple of previous constituency i would like to thank the electorate of the constituency for send i to this place to represent they and for put their trust in i for the year to come on my arrival here an amazing job have be do by the house staff the independent parliamentary standards authority and other and i can not thank they enough for the welcome that they have provide we as new mps 
 i have a number of predecessor that i need to thank not least because it be nearly constituency roll into of all there be douglas ross who represent   moray for the conservatives for several recent year we be not very close on the political spectrum it have to be say but there be a number of occasion where we do come together across party for the benefit of the constituency and the wide region notably in the achievement of the growth deal for moray and to maximise the spend that we get on that i be sure the official opposition would also want to thank he for his service in the scotland office 
 my predecessor in inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey be drew hendry who be a regular contributor from the scottish national party bench he represent we as an opposition spokesperson on the economy trade foreign affair business enterprise and investment and transport over several term as an mp for that area he be also an assiduous campaigner on energy poverty which be a particular issue for the highland and island and in moray i hope that energy regulation be of the area that the government ’s commission on poverty will look at very seriously 
 my right hon friend   the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn the leader of the snp in this place mention the child cap i will not go into too much detail on that because it have already be well cover but energy poverty be a critical issue for many family throughout the highland and moray bring in a social tariff for example would certainly make a big difference to family right across the highland 
 other predecessor have include several well know parliamentarian labour members will i be sure be pleased to know that my constituency be the birthplace of ramsay macdonald and it have also be represent very ably by several notable snp mps over the year of the most famous be winnie ewing who reconvene the scottish parliament in and also represent the area in the scottish parliament in this place and in europe her daughter in law margaret ewing be an assiduous campaigner on poverty issue and will be well known to old member of the house or long serve member of the house be perhaps more parliamentary more recently there be angus robertson who lead the party in this place for a good number of year and be now a cabinet secretary in the scottish government 
 we can take a quick stroll through moray west nairn and strathspey it go from the white sand of lossiemouth burghead and nairn right up to the cairngorms peak it have the city of elgin in it which have now be establish as a cathedral city for year it be celebrate the anniversary of the cathedral be establish there the constituency have the speyside town of rothe aberlour and dufftown dufftown of course be build on still rather than hill in the badenoch and strathspey town we get grantown aviemore newtonmore and kingussie among other we have surfing skiing and mountain biking there be a mountain railway and we have a national park and a major wildlife park with everything from pine marten to polar bear 
 move back up to the coast in ardersier we have the green freeport the scottish government have work closely with the uk government on that and i be sure they will continue to do so the green freeport be incredibly important to we in moray west nairn and strathspey   it be project to have job within year and it will be vital for just transition that will need careful scrutiny over the come year 
 tourism the labour market and affordable housing be major issue particularly in the badenoch and strathspey area business have difficulty with staffing they be often open only or day instead of there be not really any significant unemployment it be about to there may be some room for get more employment from the local labour market but fundamentally the big impact on the labour market there have be brexit immigration in that part of the world be a really significant issue in that there be not enough of it we have difficulty staff care home the nhs and many business which be fight over the same labour population 
 we have iconic food drink and fashion brand include walker ’s shortbread and baxters not to mention the distillery that produce malt whisky and the numerous other distillery that produce gin and vodka there be also a number of brewery we contribute extremely significantly to the exchequer and it be really important that we get some of that back 
 we also have military basis fort george currently host the black watch the battalion royal regiment of scotland kinloss barrack be home to engineer regiment and raf lossiemouth be home to typhoon poseidon and arrive wedgetail squadron the welfare of service personnel and veteran be absolutely vital and it be something i will raise frequently in the house 
 civilian aerospace and space be the other major emerge sector orbex in forres employ well over people and it will be do vertical launch from sutherland and the saxavord spaceport   the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   will have to forgive i but its headquarter be in fact in moray west nairn and strathspey 
 finally there be agriculture crofter and hill farmer base in badenoch and strathspey in the cairngorms national park face particular challenge we also have arable and the pork sector in the laich of moray where there be again employment challenge that need to be tackle 
 moray west nairn and strathspey be the large constituency and it take more than hour to drive end to end but what a drive it be i would recommend it to anybody i look forward to represent the people live and work the length and breadth of my constituency 
 i agree wholeheartedly the work that the right hon member and i carry out throughout the last parliament be an example of how we can work co operatively with member of opposite party and find those issue on which we can serve our constituent well he join we at an opportune moment as i be about to talk about an issue that be close to his heart 
 my final urgent request of the government be of moral duty to recognise support and compensate our nuclear testing veteran and their family these be the man who put their life at risk in dangerous atomic weapon test to ensure our long term security for decade campaigner labrats veteran and their family and the indefatigable susie boniface have be fight for recognition for these hero they have highlight scientific study that show increase rate of miscarriage increase birth defect and the same rate of genetic damage as clean up worker at chernobyl 
 of course the campaigner take pride in the fact that the defence secretary and the prime minister meet they when labour be in opposition and support their   campaign to receive the long overdue recognition they deserve but despite win the campaign for medallic recognition the uk sadly still remain the only nuclear power that refuse they adequate compensation research and support unlike the us france canada and australia medal criterion be very limited there have not be a formal recognition event and even access to war pension have be impede 
 veteran and sometimes their wife widow and descendant have report make repeat request to gain access to their blood or urine testing record from sample the veteran recall be take during the nuclear testing programme sadly many confirm that their service medical record frequently do not include the test result and they just do not understand why the data be vital for their war pension application and for understand the condition they suffer but sadly the absence of such record mean that many veteran war pension application be refuse 
 i want to place on record my thank to hon member right across the house who have continue to support these veteran particularly   the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who have work closely with i and campaigner in recent year this week we have both write to the defence secretary and the minister for veterans and people my hon friend   the member for birmingham selly oak al carns request that they urgently meet we veteran and campaigner and work with we to deal with their concern we hope that be make an urgent priority because ultimately the government can and should deliver justice for these family and now be the right time to do so 
 thank you mr deputy speaker for call i to make my speech as part of this important debate 
 may i thank   the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale   for his contribution may i also pay tribute to all those who be make their speech today i wish they well today and for the remainder of this parliament and i hope that we each manage to repay the trust that our new constituent have place in we 
 i be lead to believe that certain convention apply to member speech i wish to assure the house that i will abide by those convention accordingly i wish to pay sincere tribute to my predecessor damien moore who diligently serve southport for the past year pave the way for a new government to ensure that the town ’s good day lie ahead i wish he nothing but the good for the future 
 i also wish to refer to another of my predecessor as the mp for southport somebody already mention in today ’s debate at the general election william gladstone be elect as of the members for the south lancashire county constituency which take in both southport and my original hometown of prescot as i be sure member will appreciate this fact help i somewhat over the past month or so in draw a link between where i be bear and where i now represent in this house 
 i expect that i be not alone among new member in have be rather overwhelmed over the past couple of week by the mountain of email correspondence that we have receive from constituent and other since be elect 
 i can though take some comfort in the fact that my inbox refer solely to the much small constituency of southport rather than to the whole of the south lancashire constituency that william gladstone represent i can only imagine the additional stress and strain on members in gladstone ’s day if they too have have access to a parliamentary email address 
 as well as be part of the same old county constituency both prescot and southport be also within the boundary of the old of west derby this fact be bring far to my attention when the boundary commission announce during the last parliament that the new southport constituency would from now onwards also contain tarleton and hesketh bank beautiful village on the south coast of the ribble as a result of this change i research at my local library whereabout the boundary of the west derby be hop that i would be able to say that tarleton and hesketh bank have many year ago also be under the same county division as southport alas this be not to be after quite some hour of research i realise that the information i be look for have actually be star i in the face all along it appear that the boundary between the hundred of west derby and leyland lie along would you believe?—boundary lane and that boundary lane be situate in a hamlet call end it be a lesson i think in not ignore the obvious when it be right there in front of you 
 my predecessor in previous parliaments have talk about how they have feel that southport have sometimes be take for grant or take advantage of and so have subsequently seek to discuss and elevate division between the town of the local borough i wish to assure my constituent that i will take a different approach instead i will work to ensure that our country ’s new government will not look to cause division with our   neighbour whether they be other country thousand of mile away or even other town just a few yard away instead i will work with colleague to ensure that the government will look to unite our country in the task of national renewal because the politic that i believe in be a politic of the common good a politic where each of we look out for the wellbeing of the other rather than try to do other down 
 many town and village in this country have see well day than over the past few year southport be no different whereas other area have have for instance much need housing not build or much need transport link not implement issue that i be pleased to see the new government be plan to address southport ’s problem have manifest themselves in the temporary closure of the town ’s much love pier and in the town centre whose main street need more than their fair share of love and attention i promise to work with colleague in this house and beyond to fix these issue 
 the new government ’s priority on economic growth be entirely the right approach unless we get the trend rate of growth back to pre-2008 level our task in this parliament of reduce poverty will be much hard the government have my full support in their approach i wish it to be know that i will do my utmost to make sure that southport ’s good day lie ahead of it that the decline of recent year will be arrest and that the town ’s fortune will be turn around and that i will work with good people of good faith to bring that about no matter what their party affiliation with that i would like to thank you mr deputy speaker for allow i the opportunity to make my speech in this place i thank the house for the manner in which the speech be receive

 it be a privilege to call the seconder 
 may i start by congratulate my hon friend   the member for bootle peter dowd   on his fantastic speech as the eld of girl we like the last one because we can blame they for everything 
 it be an honour to follow my hon friend and to the loyal address not only for i but for my constituent across vauxhall and camberwell green when i be ask by the chief whip my excitement be quickly replace by fear because i remember my attempt to make a big shaq reference during reading of the procurement bill which go completely over the head of   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart   and indeed many other member in the chamber i nearly back out but then i remember that this be my opportunity to get on record that nigerian jollof be the well jollof before my hon friend   the member for erith and thamesmead abena oppong asare   put forward any other idea 
 it be nearly year since a labour member second a loyal address the last labour member to do so be my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry my good friend i have to say that the notice i receive when she visit my constituency be perhaps my favourite i remember receive a note from her office say that she be go to tour the beefeater gin distillery in my constituency the next evening and that i should join she sadly i do not drink gin but i know that she drink my share i can only say that i look forward to welcome other member to my constituency many more time during this parliament can i remind all member that it be their duty to let i know if they be attend of the many fabulous party in vauxhall and camberwell green otherwise i will be complain to mr speaker 
 it truly be a wonderful constituency we have the national theatre the british film institute the southbank centre the young vic and the old vic which be currently host a play about the life of an mp in which james corden turn out to be of their constituent although i believe he live in california so perhaps he should get in touch with the leader of the opposition 
 we also have the london eye i be sure the whole house will be delighted to know that it receive permanent planning status in may this year that keep it safe even from the clutch and planning reform of the chancellor and the deputy prime minister we have community from all over the world even among the sea of england shirt on sunday there be a few brave spanish fan proudly wear their colour although they may have just be snp mps 
 we be also home to a number of mp advocacy group and journalist which mean when i be try to avoid a journalist or to politely decline an invitation i often get hit with the dread line oh but i be a constituent as well i do warn journalist and member that i shall continue my policy of give no special treatment when they come up to i with any casework 
 like many continue mp the area that i represent change significantly at this election follow the boundary review sadly this mean that i no long represent of the brixton estate that i grow up on my church and my old primary school the church be central to my life and it be a microcosm of lambeth after mass i can see   the impatience on the face of my family as i often discuss varied casework from the congregation i just want to reassure my hon friend   the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy   that she be go to receive multiple blessing for all that varied casework i know the ward that i have lose will be well represent by she then again base on past experience not all the lobby journalist will notice that anything have change 
 if the house will indulge i i wish to speak briefly to a couple of policy issue that be close to my heart and to the heart of my constituent and that i be look forward to work with the new labour government on as an mp of the hard conversation that any of we will have be with the victim of violent crime i have sit in many front room hold grieve mother and father as they tell i about their love one who have be take from they too soon with every hug and tear wipe away i can feel their pain and the impact that that have on the sibling and other family member crime rip communitie apart leave too many people vulnerable and open to exploitation 
 area that i be proud to work on be prevent abuse of gang associate girl sadly their mistreatment be just example of why our street need to be safe the home secretary ’s commitment to halve rate of violence against woman and improve the support for victim should be welcome across the house 
 over the last couple of year i have see at hand the impact of the cost of live crisis on my constituent in vauxhall and camberwell green and on community right across the country we also know that tackle climate change be of the most urgent issue face the world and that we can not delay meaningful action any long i be therefore very pleased that the government be commit to address both issue with an investment in the clean energy transition that will lower energy bill for household and restore the uk ’s reputation as a climate leader 
 but for million of work people real change will not come without action on housing that be why i welcome the deputy prime minister ’s plan to build new home across the country include a new wave of council house like the that give i and my family security i still remember that daily commute from a b&b in king ’s cross and the excitement on my mum ’s face when we receive the key to permanent housing we no long have to lug our belonging around in black bin bag sadly in that be still the case for so many people vauxhall and camberwell green be also home to a high number of young people many of whom be private renter the power that section give immoral landlord to evict tenant for no reason be an outrage i be glad that the government will finally ban no fault eviction for good 
 lastly i be proud to be an advocate for the eradication of hiv and aids an issue on which we have make so much progress recently alongside my fellow co chair of the all party parliamentary group on hiv and aids in november last year i have the honour of host a reception in mr speaker ’s house to thank sir elton john for his work in this field over the last year it be a fantastic event at which our new prime minister reaffirm his commitment to end new hiv transmission in the uk by it also mean that today ’s royal event be the in the last month at which i have have the privilege of speak because we can all agree that sir elton be music royalty 
 this parliament see a large churn of mp so may i take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome new member do not worry if you get lose i have be here almost year and i still get lose my piece of advice be this make sure you know where westminster hall be because you will always find   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   there on hand to point you in the right direction after he have finish speak in whatever debate be go on that day 
 although it be wonderful see so many labour mp win on   july it be mix with a slight sadness that we have to say goodbye to colleague who work across the house for their constituent with great dedication although i be delighted to see my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake   in her place on these benches i want to refer to the important work i do with her predecessor my friend nickie aiken as the mp responsible for westminster bridge we work together in the last parliament to commemorate the horrific westminster bridge attack in which people sadly lose their life include the late pc keith palmer and to improve the safety of a very busy and active part of london nickie also work tirelessly to ensure that the pedicabs london act be bring into law despite the persistent objection of   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope which i be sure many new member will also get use to 
 i also pay tribute to the outgoing father of the house sir peter bottomley i remember as a new mp walk into a meeting of the all party parliamentary group on vote at the room be buzz with excitement energy and all these young people and to my surprise sir peter be in the chair he really prove that age be just a number 
 i must mention my good friend and former constituency neighbour the new baroness harriet harman her year in office blaze a trail for the right of woman in politic and wide society when harriet be elect just of mp be woman that figure now stand at while there be some way to go that rise be a testament to harriet ’s unende work and drive never to take no for an answer while i be daunt to have the responsibility of represent part of her former constituency in camberwell green i could not have have a well example to learn from my pledge to she and my new constituent be that i will do my good to carry on her legacy and be a strong voice in parliament for those community 
 lastly i can not think of a more fitting replacement as the mother of the house than my good friend our auntie my right hon friend   the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott she be elect when i be just year old and see she in the medium make the voice of black woman hear in parliament give i the confidence that i could stand here and ensure people in my community have a voice in the decision that impact they i say to she we stand on your shoulder and we respect and salute you thank you 
 i welcome the government ’s plan to introduce draft race equality legislation to build on that work and i look forward to work with ministers to develop it we should not underestimate the difficulty that both baroness harman and my right hon friend have go through to make their voice hear or the challenge   they face even now but their trailblaze example mean that those of we elect today face few challenge in represent our community and we have more friend to go through those challenge with because of they mr speaker a black working class girl from a south london estate can stand before you today with the honour of second this loyal address 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 before i turn to the address i be sure the whole house would like to join i in pay tribute to his majesty the king it be typical of his dedication to duty that despite the medical challenge he have face he be here today to open parliament and will travel to the commonwealth heads of government meeting in samoa and to australia this autumn the king be a true model of public service i know the prime minister will value his audience with his majesty as much as i do we all recognise that the king be aid by the constant support of her majesty the queen and i know the whole house will join i in wish she a very happy birthday 
 today we also pay tribute to tony lloyd tony serve the people of greater manchester for year and for of those as a member of this house he be a great parliamentarian kind and wise his family should have enormous pride in the contribution he make to this place and to the community he love and serve they be in all our thought today 
 i welcome all new member to their place be elect as a member of parliament be a great honour and a great responsibility we serve our community and our united kingdom i know whatever our political difference might be we be all motivate by a desire to make life well for our constituent and to make our country strong i know the whole house will join i in deplore the assassination attempt on president trump our thought be with the victim violence and intimidation have no place in the democratic process 
 i commend the proposer of the address on his excellent speech i know the whole house will agree that   the hon member for bootle peter dowd   have set a high bar for speech in this parliament my little sister always remind i that be the young mean have to learn how to make oneself heard well the hon gentleman be the young of and it really show i have the good fortune to get to know he when he be shadow chief secretary to the treasury and he be always courteous and pleasant as my opposite number as he outline he come from a family commit to public service both his great uncle be member of this house and although he be very modest about it he have be in public service for more than year the new member of the house have much to learn from he i know that i speak for the whole house in say how much we all admire his personal bravery in campaign for more victim support follow the tragic death of his daughter in a hit and run accident 
 not only be the hon gentleman of the more popular member of the house as we hear but he be also the most popular constituency mp enjoy the big majority of any member of this place in a   recent election he even win an astonishing of the vote he might be the only person who can persuade kim jong un of the benefit of democracy although the people ’s republic of bootle do n’t quite have the same ring to it 
 i wonder whether the hon gentleman be choose to speak today to head off the reintroduction of his minute rule bill i speak of course of his bill for a day week i be not sure whether he have consult his whip on how compatible that would be with their desire to make fridays a new norm sit day i will say this to he if they will not let he have his minute rule bill he should work to rule although i suspect that as a labour member for merseyside he need no tip on trade union organise from a former banker 
 the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi   speak with typical verve she be inspire by a desire to serve and her strong faith but she never let any of this go to her head today she be choose because of the high regard that she be hold in but she be also of the kind members of this house regularly bake victoria sponge for her staff and other although post the election result perhaps red velvet might now be on the menu she have campaign bravely against gang violence in both the london assembly and this house and she be so right that we must not become desensitise to knife crime she represent the place where she grow up and do so with passion and determination 
 now that i have a lot more time on my hand i intend to be a regular visitor to the hon lady ’s constituency especially in the summer month of my favourite place to watch cricket be of course the oval as prime minister i have the privilege of play there with the wonderful ebony rainford brent and the young black cricketer of the african caribbean engagement programme i applaud the hon lady for her work with that scheme i can reassure she that i will not go as far as the last conservative prime minister to speak from this dispatch box who propose remove that part of her constituency to a desert island along with his favourite record 
 the hon lady ’s story be truly an inspirational to go from care for her mother as a teenager to be a member of this house show what be possible in our country but the online abuse that she have receive an experience that be far too common in this house show of the challenge face our democracy the intimidation that some candidate receive in this election both physical and digital be completely unacceptable and be a threat to our electoral process there can be no excuse for threat of physical violence or intimidatory protest outside politician home 
 the hon lady will have be pick to the loyal address because the whips office have she down as who will go far may i offer some word of advice to labour member on the government benches life come at you fast soon you might be fortunate enough to be tap on the shoulder and offer a junior ministerial role then you will find yourself attend cabinet and then in the cabinet then when the prime minister ’s position become untenable you might end up be call to the high office and before you know it you have a bright future behind you and be leave wonder whether you can credibly be an eld statesman at the age of laughter 
 it be right to begin by congratulate the prime minister on his decisive victory in the election he deserve the good will of we all in this house as he take on the most demanding of job in the increasingly uncertain world in which we now live the labour party have successfully tap into the public ’s desire for change but it must now deliver change and we in the opposition will hold it accountable for deliver on the commitment that it make to the british people in the national interest we will not oppose for the sake of it but when we disagree with the government it be our responsibility as the opposition to say so what will guide we will be our principle sound public finance a belief that people know how to spend their own money well than government do and that private enterprise not state intervention be the key to deliver growth and prosperity public service that work for those who need they an education system that give everyone the good start in life secure border and a strong national defence 
 i welcome the government ’s decision to bring forward martyn ’s law i be sure that the prime minister will find as i do that of the most humbling part of the job be see people whose life have be touch by tragedy not turn to anger or bitterness but campaign to ensure that other family do not have to endure the same pain i particularly commend figen murray for her work to get this law on to the statute book i can assure she that this measure will command consensus in this house and we will work with the government to make sure that it become law as soon as possible 
 i be also glad that the government will continue with plan for a smokefree generation i know there be deeply hold view on both side of this issue and i have deep respect for those especially on my own bench who disagree with i on this question measure that end access to product be never easy but i believe that ensure that our child can be the generation that do not have to suffer the false choice between quit smoking and not because they will have never start be a truly worthy aim it will make we a healthy fair country where people live long and well life 
 the duty of government be the defence of the realm and we be fortunate in our country to be protect by armed force who be unrivalle in the world for their professionalism bravery and skill i know the whole house will agree that they be truly the good of we 
 every month in my previous job i become more concerned about the threat to our country ’s security we live in an increasingly uncertain world we need great investment in our military if we be to deter our enemy and defend our interest as i warn early this year there be an axis of authoritarian state that be a threat to our value freedom democracy and the rule of law and we must collectively stand up to they the world be more dangerous now than it have be at any time since the end of the cold war so i urge the prime minister to commit to boost defence spending to of gdp by if we lead the way on this issue we can make the new nato benchmark for defence investment that be the single good way to strengthen the alliance it would show the americans that we do not expect they to bear every burden and would show president putin that nato be serious about bolster its defence and be the most effective way to deter further act of russian aggression 
 in the past few year there have be an impressive amount of consensus across the house on foreign policy on the importance of support ukraine and on the centrality of nato to our national defence in that spirit i commend the prime minister for his work at the nato summit and i be glad that he and the secretary of state for defence have take such rapid step to demonstrate that although the government have change this country ’s commitment to ukraine ’s security remain constant i also welcome the visit of   the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy   to the middle east it be of fundamental importance to this country that as we make real progress towards a state solution our friend and ally israel have a right to defend itself and to live in peace 
 let i turn next to another crucial issue face not just our country but the broad western world illegal migration the fundamental question be what to do with people who arrive here illegally but can not be return to their home country our approach be to send they to a safe country the prime minister be clear that he would scrap those plan and i acknowledge that our fear remain that without such a deterrent the country will end up have to accept that a large number of those who cross the channel illegally will end up remain here how to prevent that be something that the government i know will soon look to address when it come to legal migration i urge the home secretary to retain the measure that we implement which be forecast to halve net migration in the next month 
 if i may turn next to the economy i understand well that the chancellor be keen to paint as bleak a picture as possible but i would gently point out that that be not exactly what the fact say with inflation at unemployment at and the fast grow economy in the g7 so far this year the labour party have inherit an economy that be already on an upward trajectory 
 the government have set out plan to strengthen the role of the office for budget responsibility and we will examine those proposal carefully but the work of the obr already mean that labour members have the full detail of the public finance when they set out their manifesto the obr have rightly take away from government the ability to make forecast say what they want they to say but that have also take away from oppositions come into government the ability to say that they do not know the true state of the public finance as paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies have say 
 the book be wide open fully transparent 
 in his word try to pretend that thing be bad than expect really will n’t wash 
 labour members promise no tax rise on work people and no plan for tax rise beyond what be in their manifesto in full knowledge of the public finance it would be difficult for they to claim that thing be bad than they think and then renege on those pledge and we will hold the government to their promise come the budget 
 i note the plan for new employment legislation in this country our unemployment rate be far low than the european average and that be thank in part to our flexible labour market i urge labour not to impose new burden on business business leader themselves   have warn of the unintended consequence of those plan that they could lead to firm be less likely to invest and less likely to hire so increase unemployment in the long term 
 i far note the government ’s desire to impose new potentially rigid legislation on technology such as artificial intelligence we be only to the us and china in the size of our fast grow technology sector and we lead the world when it come to ai safety we should all in this house be careful not to endanger this country ’s lead position in this field which will drive growth and prosperity for decade to come 
 although today ’s king ’s speech contain a slew of bills what be miss be a concrete plan to tackle the unsustainable post covid rise in the welfare bill without action the cost of provide benefit to the working age population with a disability or health condition will rise to £ more than we spend on our national defence school or policing that be not only unsustainable but unfair to taxpayer that be why in government we have lay out a plan to reduce the welfare bill significantly but crucially to support all those who could do so to go back into work i hope the government look at those proposal when they have the time to study they in detail on the conservative benches we will continue to advocate for a welfare system that be compassionate and fair to those who need it but fair too to those who pay for it 
 the government have set out plan to change the planning system we will of course study those thoroughly as well as we all wish to see more home build and the planning process speed up however i would say that a system that do not allow local people to have a say will damage public consent for more housing in the long term i regret that there be no mention in the king ’s speech of farming and rural community much like my own but i hope in time that the government will bring forward proposal 
 turn to net this country have decarbonise quick than any other major country and we have manage to do that while grow the economy as a country and across this whole house i know we will all be proud of that achievement the government plan to decarbonise the grid by but there be a real danger that if the government put the speed of do that ahead of family finance and our energy security we will again lose public consent for the measure necessary to ensure that we actually reach our net target a target on which there be genuine consensus between our party as even of the prime minister ’s own supporter have warn this plan 
 just mean we have to import our energy strategically we become more vulnerable we pay more money for our energy 
 i hope that the energy secretary reflect on those thought 
 lastly the government have set out plan for reform to the other place look at the government benches there can be no doubt about their ability to get they through this house but the effect of the change will last long beyond this parliament and long beyond our tenure in these job i would suggest that when it come to constitutional reform it would be good to proceed on a cross party basis rather than to use a simple majority in this house to push thing through   that consensus should include the cross benchers whose convenor would be remove by the government ’s proposal 
 i also suspect that the public would prefer the government to prioritise practical real world issue over constitutional wrangling however i welcome the news that the government have pause their plan to force member of the other place to retire at that proposal always feel like it would be a blunt instrument indeed in the dissolution honour the prime minister nominate rightly the former right hon member for derby south who will be a strong addition to the other place despite the right hon lady be already over the retirement age that the labour manifesto propose 
 let i close by say that we of course recognise that the british people have entrust the labour party with the task of govern our country on our side of the house we will fulfil our duty as the loyal opposition professionally and effectively across this house we be all and foremost patriot we all wish to see our country and our people flourish and succeed in that spirit i wish the new prime minister and the new government well 
 i now call the prime minister 
 thank you mr speaker i join the leader of the opposition in his tribute to his majesty the king it be so heartening to see he in his rightful place deliver the gracious speech i be sure that the whole house will not mind once again wish he a speedy recovery i also join the right hon gentleman in wish her majesty the queen a happy birthday 
 we also wish president trump a speedy recovery from the appalling attempt on his life at the weekend i speak with president trump on sunday night to pass on our good wish and also to share our revulsion at the senseless violence which have no place in democracy the last time that we debate the loyal address and i stand at the opposition dispatch box i could see for the time the then new plaque now behind i commemorate the memory of sir david amess i know how hard that loss be for conservative members now stand on this side of the house i can see for the time in front of i the plaque to our dear friend jo cox with her word that catch the air of this chamber even more at a moment like this more in common while our thought at this time be of course with president trump and the american people we can not think that this be something that only happen elsewhere we must heed the word of president biden to lower the temperature of our democracy work across our disagreement and find each other ’s common decency 
 i congratulate the england football team on their achievement in the euros which the leader of the opposition and i be talk about this morning yes the trophy elude we again but the team can be proud of another exceptional performance something i be sure the whole house would be only too pleased to recognise we pay tribute to gareth southgate who shoulder the burden of national leadership with such dignity 
 this government have be elect to deliver nothing less than national renewal to stop the chaos of the past year turn the page on an era of politic as noisy   performance and return it to public service and start the work of rebuild our country a determined rebuilding a patient rebuilding a calm rebuilding it be a rejection in this complicated and volatile world of those who can only offer the easy answer the snake oil charm of populism as the past year have show that road be a dead end for this country it do nothing to fix our foundation and the british people have reject it as they have throughout our history 
 what people really want be change and change be what this government of service will deliver a king ’s speech that take the brake off our economy and show to the british people that politic can be a force for good the vehicle for improve the life of million no matter who they vote for 
 this be a day when we get on with the serious business of government yet a house with no time for levity would go against the grain of our tradition so it be fantastic to hear my hon friend   the member for bootle peter dowd   in such fine fettle today when he propose the humble address he speak with great passion as he always do for his constituency which be famous as he mention for the antony gormley sculpture on crosby beach that work of art be entitle another place a collection of gently rusting figure for whom the tide be perpetually come in a solid grounding should my hon friend ever consider a career in the other place 
 i be sure that the house will agree that my hon friend be also of the warm and most generous member that generosity extend ahead of a previous election to an offer to hand deliver conservative leaflet a commitment to the democratic process that should be applaud not least because it result in a stonke increase in his majority for labour 
 as anyone who know my hon friend will confirm although he do like to relax with a glass of wine and listen to engelbert humperdinck for he family always come the leader of the opposition refer to my hon friend ’s daughter and grow up he be care for by his sister now he be never happy than when he be with his grandchild who be convinced that he know mary poppins personally a belief that i note he have never discourage he have be a tremendous servant to our family the labour family and we thank he for his outstanding speech today 
 the address be second by my hon friend   the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi it be a fitting tribute for a royal occasion as i be tell that she be know as queen flo on instagram the house will know she as a tireless champion for her community as well as a found member of of our most vital affiliate the labour friend of karaoke in fact i be reliably tell that queen flo do a mean queen bee which we look forward to hear at labour conference 
 truly it be a fantastic speech another demonstration that my hon friend be a shin example of our movement she be a young carer when grow up and be a fighter for their cause on aids and hiv on the health inequality that still deliver poor outcome for black woman and on sickle cell which her late mum suffer from i know what it be like to watch your mum move in and out of hospital as a child so i respect and admire the way my hon friend now champion young people from poor household and fight for the opportunity that they deserve 
 perhaps most powerfully of all my hon friend have speak about her own experience of arrive at the scene of a stabbing and have rightly demand that we never allow ourselves to become desensitise to the tragedy of knife crime as a fellow inner london mp i know how much this be hurt our city as it be hurt town and city across the country i know how much potential be lose and how many family fear that their child could be next so be under no doubt turn the tide on this violence be absolutely central a key mission that this government of service will take on 
 both speech be in the fine tradition of this house let i follow the leader of the opposition and mark the passing of our colleague in the traditional way since the last gracious speech the labour party have lose a stalwart of our movement with the passing of tony lloyd who serve in year of distinction the community of rochdale manchester central and stretford i have the chance to speak to tony just day before he leave we when he be leave hospital to go home he know that it be for the last time and that he would not see a day like this without be partisan i can tell you that he would have love to have see the house set up as it be today he would have tell we use his experience to use every precious moment that we have to serve those community that he hold so dear that be what he stand for the good of our movement he be a champion of politic as a force for good 
 that be the great test of our time the fight for trust be the battle that define our political era it be a task not just for the government but for the whole parliament we be all responsible for the tone and standard that we set i want to thank the right hon gentleman the leader of the opposition because in every exchange that we have have since the election and in his word today he have go well beyond the usual standard of generosity i thank he for that 
 in that spirit this king ’s speech pick up some of the important business not conclude in the last session on football governance and the reduction of smoking we hope to proceed in a manner that recognise the previous consensus we will also carry forward the holocaust memorial bill so that we build that memorial next to this parliament and ensure that every generation reaffirm our commitment to never again 
 we will also honour the promise that i and the leader of the opposition make to the family of martyn hett and all the family affect by the horrific event in manchester that day figen murray martyn ’s mum walk mile to tell we that britain need that law quickly i tell she then that she would get that from a labour government and we honour that promise today i be grateful for the indication of the cross party support that we will have on that important provision because the security of the british people be the most fundamental priority of any government and whether our fight be against terrorist the vile criminal smuggling gang that weaken our border or foreign power that threaten the security of this nation we will leave no stone unturned when it come to keep the british people safe 
 we will recognise the bravery of those on the frontline of keep we safe with a new armed force commissioner that be not just a name or a role but a strong and independent champion for those who have commit to the ultimate service as a way in which we can show our respect 
 we will also move quickly on the lesson from the infected blood scandal that the house debate in almost the final act of the last session a day when we all of we undertake a solemn responsibility not just to deliver justice to those people but to take on the work of prevention to ensure that those lesson shape the future of public service in our country because scandal like infected blood windrush horizon and hillsborough be unite not just by the scale of the injustice but by the indignity that the victim and their family have be put through merely for stand up for truth and justice so it be high time to bring in a duty of candour the hillsborough law because a government of service must also be a government of accountability and justice that be what service mean 
 i thank the prime minister for give way during his excellent speech outline the hope and renewal within the king ’s speech which be much need in constituency such as mine luton north where over of child be grow up in relative poverty what reassurance can he give i and my constituent that he personally take this issue seriously and that his government will address it 
 let i reassure my hon friend and the whole house that i take child poverty extremely seriously i be proud of the last labour government ’s record on reduce child poverty they clearly have a strategy and we will have a strategy i be very pleased to have announce today the taskforce that will lead our strategy to reduce child poverty no child should grow up in poverty we will work across the house on that issue 
 i be grateful to the prime minister for give way on his newly announce taskforce which beth rigby announce on twitter as we be all in this chamber can the prime minister outline how many child will remain in poverty while that taskforce undertake its work which ultimately will lead to the same conclusion that we be propose to scrap the child benefit cap 
 i do welcome this and i know that it be an issue across the whole house i do not think there be a single member who do not care about child poverty the point of the taskforce be to devise a strategy as we do when we be last in government to drive those number down it can not be a single issue but that cross a number of strand and we will work with people across the house in order to tackle it what matter be the commitment to drive those number down that be what we do when last in government and we will do it again 
 rise 
 i will make some progress and then give way 
 i respect the tone of the leader of the opposition ’s contribution but i can not stop my mind from wander back to month ago when he be at this dispatch box his great political hero nigel lawson once say to govern be to choose every day serve the people   of this country be a chance to make a difference for they the last king ’s speech be the day when the veil of his choice slip and we all see his party content to let our country ’s problem fester and to push aside the national interest as they focus almost entirely on try to save their own skin 
 we will have time over the week month and year ahead to debate the measure in this king ’s speech and the choice of this government but i defy anyone on the opposition benches or elsewhere to look at the ambition and purpose of our intent and not to see a return to the serious business of government no more wedge issue no more gimmick no more party political strategy masquerade as policy this be an agenda focus entirely on deliver for the people of this country legislation for the national interest that seek only to fix our foundation and make people well off and to solve problem not exploit they 
 rise 
 i will just make some progress
