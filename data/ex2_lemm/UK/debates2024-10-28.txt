 during my time in this house i hope to be an action woman someone who add to our north west leicestershire bag with clean waterway well public service for all and most importantly an anytime day return ticket on the ivanhoe line 
 with your permission madam deputy speaker i would like to make a statement to the house about the action the chancellor will take this week to fix the foundation and rebuild britain 
 economic growth and modern public service can only be build on strong foundation that be why this government have bring political and economic stability back to britain after year of chaos from the conservative party chaos that cost family business and public service dear the british people be now rightly look to this new labour government to clear up the mess from the last government fix the foundation and rebuild britain that be the change that my party promise the country and it be the change that we will deliver 
 to deliver that change the fiscal rule that the chancellor will set out this week will establish the basis for stable fiscal policy mean careful management of day to day spending and responsible long term plan to invest and grow the economy 
 as we commit to in our manifesto the government will have robust fiscal rule that will guide the decision we take the be our stability rule we will pay for all day to day spending on public service from receipt the budget be last in surplus under the last labour government and this labour government will return the public finance to that position the be our investment rule which will get debt fall as a proportion of our economy it will ensure that we can secure the investment that our economy need to grow and to generate job and opportunity for people across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland while maintain a strong fiscal anchor and ensure that our debt burden fall over time 
 the plan that we inherit from the last government would have see public sector investment decline to the low level in more than year the path of decline investment be the path of a decline nation and we refuse to follow it instead we will seize the huge opportunity of the future to support the enterprise and talent that this country create 
 the government recognise that sustain public investment be a crucial driver of long term economic growth give the private sector the confidence to invest too but our ambition for public sector investment must be balance against the need to maintain debt on a sustainable trajectory and ensure that we invest every pound of taxpayer money responsibly that be why i will deliver a year national infrastructure strategy next spring work with colleague across government the nation and region and with our mayor and the private sector to set out a robust long term strategy for sound investment that be also why our new approach to overlap multi year spending review will improve the way that we allocate and spend capital and why the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and i will lead the new national infrastructure and service transformation authority which will drive well delivery of major project and infrastructure across the country in addition there will be the work of the new office for value for money and the national audit office those robust guardrail will ensure that our capital spending be value for money and that our financial investment deliver a positive return for the exchequer 
 finally the chancellor have be listen to the view of institution such as the international monetary fund and to expert economist as she have set out that be why the treasury have be review the right measure of debt to target in the fiscal rule ahead of the upcoming budget the detail of that policy will be announce to the house in the chancellor ’s statement on wednesday alongside an economic and fiscal forecast produce by the independent office for budget responsibility in the usual way the fiscal rule will be publish in a draft charter for budget responsibility on which member will vote in due course i commend this statement to the house 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of housing 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of housing 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of housing in town in the makerfield constituency 
 this government be commit to deliver quality home over this parliament under the tories house building plummet as they bow to pressure from their back benchers to scrap local housing target we be take bold action to reform our planning system deliver a new generation of new town and unblock stall housing site 
 i recently meet member of dover district council who tell i that they be keen to help the government where they can to deliver our ambitious housing target around the edge of dover high street we often see consistently empty unit what can the government do to help we turn those into the housing that our community so badly need and will the minister meet i to discuss how we can help 
 my hon friend be absolutely right compulsory purchase order can be use by local authority to acquire empty property where the authority can demonstrate that the acquisition would be in the public interest i be also aware that there be a problem with home build under section agreement be leave empty the government will continue to work with house builder local authority and affordable housing provider to tackle the problem i be sure that the housing minister will be happy to meet he 
 will the secretary of state consider allow council the ability to buy land for house base on current use rather than hope value and commit to reform the land compensation act 
 the hon member will know that we be look at a number of measure to help council house to be build further measure will be announce in the budget as i have mention in a write ministerial statement today we want council and social housing provider to be able to build those home and we will help they as much as we can 
 we know that the barrier to build more house in town such as those i represent in makerfield be often political not technical for year conservative members allow themselves to become mouthpiece for the blocker and the naysayer which be why as co chair of the labour growth group i welcome the commitment by the secretary of state to back builder what step be her department take to increase the supply of housing in town such as those   i represent in makerfield 
 i welcome my hon friend to his place and the reason he be here he be absolutely correct on this be that the previous government do nothing to help house building and we do not see growth either this government will reform our planning system deliver a new generation of new town unblock stall housing site and reform the housing market as well as deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation 
 i call the father of the house 
 with so much good agricultural land now cover by solar panel how will the government incentivise builder to build on brownfield rather than good agricultural land thus ensure regeneration rather than imperille food security 
 the right hon member will know that we have already set out a number of step include the brownfield passport and the national planning policy framework and the use of local housing target to ensure that brownfield be use and we get the house that we desperately need for the last year the conservatives fail to meet their housing target every single year this government be determined to meet our target 
 i call the shadow minister 
 certainty for council be vital for housing delivery but give the uncertainty create by the government ’s new top down target which will delay the implementation of local plan and therefore plan decision how confident be the government of meet their housing target 
 britain be face the sharp housing crisis ever because of the failure of conservative members we will ensure through our mandatory housing target    and in the announcement that have be make and that will be make in the budget that we get the house that britain need interruption 
 order i do not want to hear a conversation all the way through 
 in the rush for number we must not ignore the need to ensure that new home be build to appropriate standard give that the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government   the hon member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali have be strip of responsibility for build safety because of conflict of interest can ministers assure the house that the haste for target will not undermine building safety 
 we will ensure that house be build to decent home standard which we have already set out and that we meet those target unlike in the year under the conservatives 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of shortfall in council budget 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the cost of deliver statutory local government service in rural area 
 what step she be take with local authority to help ensure that they have adequate resource to fund   local   service 
 what step she be take to help ensure the financial sustainability of local authority 
 council across the country of all political stripe work hard to deliver vital public service in our country we know that year of mount pressure be bite hard we be committed to move towards a multi year funding settlement end wasteful bidding competition that essentially set council against another last week i meet political group leader at the local government association conference to understand what specific demand pressure they be face and we be commit to work together on those big issue member will know that we can not pre empt the budget statement due later in the week but we be of course fully engage in that process we stand ready to speak to any council experience financial difficulty as i confirm in my letter to mps just over a week ago 
 as the minister know i have meet he to discuss this subject my local authority woking borough council effectively go bankrupt last year it have have to cut service that many consider essential and it will have to consider cut other do the minister agree that it be time for government and parliament to review which service be class as statutory and non statutory 
 i thank the hon member for meet i at of our regular drop in session his concern be reflect across the country local community recognise that their council be be force to choose vital neighbourhood service against target for adult social care child ’s service and homelessness service in the end we need to rebuild the foundation from scratch and that be exactly what we be commit to do 
 my constituency be largely rural and as in many rural constituency parish council play an important role in local government service delivery do the minister agree about the importance of parish council to rural community and what role do he see for parish council as part of the government ’s devolution agenda 
 we will of course publish a white paper on the english devolution bill it will set out an ambitious programme for a power shift from this place and whitehall to combined authority to local government and of course to community we be absolutely committed to that top to bottom power shift we recognise that parish and town council have a role to play 
 rise demand rise cost and year of conservative public sector cut mean that many local authority and service be at break point my own borough of lambeth a deprived inner london area with high demand for social housing and temporary accommodation and for social public and youth service have be particularly affect which have be quite challenging will the minister commit to an emergency increase in funding to combat the immediate crisis for local authority and in the long term to a much need update of the funding formula to well reflect local need 
 like every member of the house my hon friend will know that those year have take their toll and that it will take more than month to repair that but we be absolutely committed to repair the foundation and our multi year financial settlement will give security of course we recognise that the demand lead pressure in many place be the back end of a big problem temporary accommodation relate to the housing crisis that need fix the same apply to child ’s service and adult social care 
 the financial future of west sussex county council be bleak it face a cumulative budget gap of over £ for at present of the council ’s budget be be spend on adult and child ’s social service and that be set to rise how will the minister ensure that west sussex county council and other do not have to close library cut bus route or reduce road repair in order to meet the grow demand for the most vulnerable member of our community 
 we always say that local government be pay for way or the other either we pay at the front end through fair funding be fairly distribute across the country or we pay at the back end because eventually the system fall over and we must repair the damage if we take ourselves back to the coalition year when austerity come in the cruelty be that    we do not reform public service repair they from the ground up to get ahead of those system change that be a waste opportunity 
 this year hartlepool borough council be set to overspend on child ’s social care by some £ due in no small part to the outrageous charge levy by private sector child ’s home what can the minister do to cap those provider charge to ensure that local government can continue to deliver its statutory obligation 
 i recognise that in large part child ’s service be the funding pressure that be drive council budget we can not forget though that behind every of those number be a child who often be not get the outcome they need far too often what we be see in the system be that high cost be not just send council to the point of bankruptcy but deliver bad outcome for young people we want to see far more resilience build back into the system and there be example today of council that be build that public sector provision back into the marketplace 
 the previous government cut county durham ’s budget by and we have all see the royal tunbridge wells video in which the leader of the opposition boast about that act that be have a real impact on my constituent and the ability of durham county council to deliver vital service so will the minister consider a discussion with cabinet colleague about revise those funding formula to take account of social care cost and deprivation 
 we do see the former prime minister take great credit for essentially shift money from primarily urban and deprived community into rural shire in an overtly political way i want to ensure that in the funding review we be carry out whether that be the initial rescue operation that will take place this year or the recovery operation through the multi year settlement we do not pit council against another but take an approach that genuinely understand the need cost demand and cost pressure face by local authority in the end though we have to accept that there be no fair funding at all if funding do not reflect the deprivation in an area 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 at the last oral question the secretary of state assure i that she have no plan to increase council tax for anyone however when press by my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart she would not give the same guarantee that the single occupant discount would be retain will ministers take the opportunity to do so now 
 i can see the shadow secretary of state make that point repeatedly because at this stage we be all wait for the statement and the budget that will contain that information but i can say that the right decision will be make in the interest of work people we recognise the cost of living crisis that be   be face across the country i be sure that she like all member of the house be wait with interest for wednesday 
 local authority employ people and commission service such as adult social care the impact assessment for the secretary of state ’s employment rights bill say that the bill will increase cost those cost be likely to be pass on to council so have the secretary of state assess the impact of the employment rights bill and an increase in employer national insurance specifically on local authority if cost do increase will local council be compensate 
 any decision relate to the budget will be take at the appropriate time as will any decision on the local government finance settlement what i can say though be that this be a new partnership from this government we be not lock local government out but stand shoulder to shoulder with it only last week at the local government association conference in harrogate the secretary of state launch the leader council a forum where central and local government will reset that relationship 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 rough sleeping be the most visible end of the homelessness crisis but it be also brutal the average age of death for rough sleeper in london be just the rough sleep initiative be literally save life in bournemouth christchurch and poole people be keep alive every year through that programme but it be due to end in march remove it have be describe by local team as nothing short of catastrophic so what assessment have take place of the impact of that initiative and what assurance can the secretary of state give local authority about the maintenance of the scheme so that they can plan for the long term 
 again i ask hon member to wait for the spending review on wednesday and for the provisional settlement in december we be under no illusion about the pressure face by council on homelessness in the end we need to repair the system which be about provide safe secure and affordable housing for people to live in we will do that but we also recognise that there be a problem today further detail on that will follow 
 what plan her department have to develop stretton hall through the new home accelerator programme 
 stretton hall be of site that the government have identify to date that we believe would benefit from support through the new home accelerator which be a joint programme between the department and homes england aim to speed   up the delivery of large scale housing development   across england 
 document from harborough district council reveal that there be site with a capacity of up to home around stretton hall the government ’s press release in august say that there would be around home on the site that they be involve in will the minister confirm which minister visit the site before the announcement will he agree to publish the methodology that lead to our community be select and the list of site that be consider but not select 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i have not have the opportunity to visit the site but i intend to do so in the future along with the other new home accelerator site on the point of principle to meet housing demand and housing need in england every area of the country must play its part the site in question be currently be promote in both the harborough local plan and the oadby and wigston local plan as it cross the boundary of both local authority although i appreciate that it do face a number of planning and enable challenge the government believe that it nevertheless have the potential to make a significant contribution to housing supply in leicestershire 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that every property have access to either gigabit broadband or a g or g mobile signal 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that every property have access to either gigabit broadband or a g or g mobile signal 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that every property have access to either gigabit broadband or a g or g mobile signal 
 it be essential to keep pace with grow demand for internet bandwidth and mobile datum from local business resident and those who visit our community that be why the government ’s ambition be to reach national gigabit and national g coverage as soon as possible by commit to support investment in high quality reliable digital connectivity so that community can benefit from fast economic growth and great social inclusion my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology be lead that work and will provide an update in due course 
 in the parish of ruishton west hatch staple fitzpaine and castle neroche the term connect devon and somerset be clearly understand as exactly what be not happen in the county rather than a description of the so call delivery agency cabinet and trunk cable be in place but there be still no sign of house be connect will the minister or the minister for data protection and telecoms   the hon member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant meet mp for the affected area to understand how those house can finally be connect 
 i be grateful for the question although i be sorry to hear it those be contract from the previous superfast broadband programme which have be supersede by project gigabit that mean that connect devon and somerset be responsible for the management and oversight of the contract which be jointly fund by central government and local authority the community in discussion deserve a high quality service so i or the minister for telecoms will meet the hon member 
 the village of gittisham in devon be also subject to connect devon and somerset different company have attempt to enable broadband access but the fibre often stop metre short of the house gittisham be also a g notspot so resident be cut off and unable to contribute to the economic growth that the government say they want to see accord to the labour manifesto the government ’s target for achieve broadband coverage be but can the minister offer a percentage of broadband coverage that will be achieve in rural area in this parliament 
 the hon gentleman rightly refer to our manifesto commitment and he have hear a commitment today that we want to see full gigabit and full national g roll out as soon as possible we be get on with it but i be sorry to hear that there be issue as i be keen to meet   the hon member for taunton and wellington mr amos i may well meet he too if he be similarly keen 
 time lucky it be somerset here i know that the government want service find a home look for help pay taxis working and even learn during covid to be access online but in my part of mid and north somerset people can only dream of gigabit broadband they would be really happy if they have superfast can the minister investigate how to inspire a national broadband roll out programme that be realistic be it time for a new national plan as access to superfast broadband have so many hole and still cost billion 
 i be grateful for the hon lady ’s question and i think of the challenge in my own constituency where my constituent ask i question in a similar vein to be very clear the government know that the market will be able to provide considerable coverage across the country but that there will always be community include her own i suspect where that have traditionally be a challenge and we be committed to make sure that that gap be fill we have the same aspiration and as i say we intend to meet it as soon as we possibly can 
 rise 
 order mr jermy you start to bob and then you stop so i be not sure you have a question but please let we hear it 
 many rural village in my constituency have spend hour produce excellent neighbourhood plan with some area hop to go to public referendum and adoption soon give that such plan help community   to shape growth will the minister confirm what prominence the government will afford neighbourhood plan as part of plan reform 
 our commitment as a government be to bring community into that conversation and to make sure local leadership have that say in the service of a wide national goal 
 if she will take step to regulate property management service provider

 my constituent david have report that his service charge have triple in the past few year even though dangerous cladding have still not be remove leave he in a leasehold debt trap with an unsellable property i thank the minister for confirm our intention to abolish the whole feudal system of leasehold but what more can be do in the meantime to help people to challenge unfair service charge 
 of the most urgent thing we need to do we be work on this at pace be to bring into force the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act as i make clear in response to an early question that will increase transparency and standardisation across service charge but we want to   go far we be committed to finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end and across the parliament that be precisely what we will do

 against my wish and advice the previous government bring in a planning presumption in favour of application to add extra floor to apartment block irrespective of the horrible effect of build those extra floor and attempt by rogue freeholder to ste the leaseholder for the remedial work result from error in build graft on extra floor as a short term measure will the minister consider remove that presumption in favour of planning permission for these ill consider scheme 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that point he be absolutely right that the previous government significantly expand permit development right after we acknowledge the criticism of those expand right particularly because of the low quality development that they have bring forward he raise a specific issue for leaseholder but the problem go wide than that i be more than happy to give consideration to the point he raise 
 i welcome the minister to his place the labour party have propose several reform to the private rental sector include to the leasehold system which will only punish landlord more of whom will sell up at a time when people be struggle to get on the property ladder why be this government determine to drive out landlord and reduce the supply of available rental property for those who rely on they 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that point though it be not about leasehold but about the private rental sector our renters rights bill which be currently in committee pose no threat to good landlord indeed it will improve the situation for good landlord by drive out unscrupulous and rogue landlord from the system as part of that bill landlord have robust ground to take back possession of their property when it be appropriate to do so what they can not do be   arbitrarily evict tenant through section we will finally abolish section no fault eviction where the previous government fail to do so

 do the right hon lady agree that reduce the capacity of council by by allow worker an additional pay day off every week that be what a day week actually be be unacceptable and do not provide good value for money for taxpayer or resident 
 i be really proud of our employment rights bill and i be really proud to stand here as someone who advocate for flexible working we do not dictate to council how they run their service we work with council the right hon lady should be able to work out that flexible working be no threat to business and no threat to the economy in fact it will boost productivity

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 high street be the beat heart of our community those in place such as broadstone in my constituency   be really bounce back and reinvent themselves the public assume that council be able to flex business rate and that they own most property but we all know that that be not the case will the minister provide a timeline for the reform of business rate and assure pub and shop that their exist relief will be maintain 
 i be afraid the hon lady put i in quite the pickle with less than hour before a fiscal event she would not expect i to pre empt the chancellor but we have hear the hon lady ’s call and those from business alongside any rate change we will seek to provide the tool such as high street rental auction or community right to buy to give community control of their high street again 
 i recently meet local business in my constituency to discuss   what can be do to attract more people to visit our high street will the minister set out what action the government be take to help regenerate local high street and will he meet i to discuss this issue far 
 we all want to see our high street thrive it be the business of government local council and local community to push back on some of the decline that have be see as inevitable in recent year as part of that we will be give local community the tool to reshape their high street such as high street rental auction and the community right to buy 
 sadiq khan the mayor of london have consistently call for the power to impose rent control across greater london he can not do that unless the government change the law whenever it have be try around the world it have fail typically with rental property supply fall and rent perversely rise will the secretary of state take this opportunity now to rule out the possibility of impose rent control in greater london 
 as the shadow minister will know from our exchange in the renters rights bill committee the government have absolutely no plan to introduce rent control in any form 
 consett blaydon and other town across the north east be keen to play their part in grow our local economy and of the thing that growth come from be make work pay in the day of a labour government the secretary of state have deliver the big upgrade to worker right in a generation can she update the house on her work in support the new deal for work people 
 the new deal for work people be contain in the employment rights bill which have its reading last week we will continue to push forward other measure that do not require legislation but what we hope to see be a new culture between business trade union and local community to ensure that work really do pay 
 minister have acknowledge in reply to early question that they recognise the financial pressure be place on local authority especially in connection with child ’s service and adult social care whatever may or may not be in the budget can the minister reassure council tax payer that they will not bear an undue burden as a result of any change 
 this government be acutely aware of the impact of the cost of live crisis on work people and that be firmly in our sight as we approach the spending review this week but we will have to repair a fair amount of the system not just the finance the early warning audit have be leave shatter follow year of mismanagement and single year settlement have leave council not know from year to the next how much money they have to spend so we will have to introduce multi year settlement there be a great deal of work to do and we can not repair year of damage in month but we be well on the way to it 
 let i draw attention to my declare interest as a trustee of fields in trust 
 in the last parliament the housing communities and local government committee receive a large amount of evidence concern the importance of well design open space for child and young people but the national planning policy framework mention they once and mention bat twice be it not about time we get our priority right and do more to improve the design of 
 order just a minute please of we will have to give way 
 the hon gentleman be of the most senior member of parliament he should be look at i when he be ask a question not at the minister come on clive i be well look 
 i will agree with you on the latter point mr speaker 
 will the minister tell we whether he will change the guidance in future to place more emphasis on the importance to child and young people of properly design open space 
 but not in this instance laughter 
 the national planning policy guidance will recognise the importance of high quality open space and opportunity for sport physical activity health and wellbee in our community our proposal to release grey belt land for development will depend on developer meet of the golden rule and ensure that all new development have accessible green space 
 my constituency like most other be see a great   deal of new housing be build which mean more infrastructure more business and more opportunity   for growth key to that however be access to reliable high speed broadband give the snp government ’s previous failure to deliver gigabit broadband to every home as promise can the minister tell we what discussion be take place and what consideration be be give to support its efficient delivery in scotland 
 through project gigabit we have a commitment to level up all community in the united kingdom and through the welcome work of my right hon friend the deputy prime minister we have a commitment to reset relationship with the devolved administration hopefully by put those together we will be able to make significant progress 
 i thank the secretary of state for everything that she be do to tackle islamo phobia this anti muslim discourse be a scourge on our community in burnley padiham and brierfield will she join i in celebrate the work of local volunteer church mosque lancashire police and other who organise burnley ’s diversity picnic bubbles in the park and who work so successfully in avert potential disturbance over the summer

 i be grateful for the question of course i would be very happy to have a meeting i point the hon gentleman towards the very helpful innovation of high street rental auction at the back end of this year which will give local authority the tool to bring into use vacant unit and to make sure that developer know that they must use they or let somebody else do so 
 the plan increase in housing supply be crucial as we all know but my resident in west lancashire be concerned about access to service can the secretary of state tell we what she be do to ensure that the increase in housing supply be meet with the relevant infrastructure and access to service 
 it be incredibly important that the relevant infrastructure amenity and service be in place we have take a number of step to well support that in the short period we have be in office not least through the national planning policy framework but there be more to be do in that area i will keep it under very close review 
 what assessment have the secretary of state make of the merit of reform the planning system to introduce new measure to help reduce flood risk 
 the national planning policy framework be very clear that inappropriate development in area at risk of flooding should be avoid by direct development away from area at high risk include flood plain we consult in the national planning policy framework consultation and seek view on how the planning system can more effectively manage flood risk as i say my department be analyse response with a view to publish a government response before the end of the year 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the secretary of state will know the financial difficulty face so many of our local authority a recent local government association report show that in local authority will apply for additional funding it be fair to say that for a number of they march will be too late what discussion have be have with the chancellor to ensure that our local authority get emergency support 
 may i welcome the chair of the select committee to her place she will do an outstanding job for local government and housing 
 the government absolutely understand how difficult it be for local authority to make end meet we understand that the pressure in adult social care child ’s social service and temporary accommodation be bite hard and we be work through those issue with the sector 
 before the next business i have a short statement to make in medium interview last week the chancellor announce that she intend to introduce change to the fiscal rule relate to the funding of day- to day spending through tax receipt and to the measurement of public debt these be major new policy announcement with significant and wide range implication for the government ’s fiscal policy and for the public finance it be evident to i that they should therefore have be make in this house in the instance and not to the world ’s medium this principle be clearly and unambiguously set out in paragraph of the ministerial code while this can hardly be describe as a leak the chancellor herself give interview on the record and on camera the premature disclosure of the content of the budget have always be regard as a supreme discourtesy to the house indeed i still regard it as such 
 i be very disappointed that the chancellor expect the house to wait nearly a full week to hear she repeat the announcement in the budget statement on wednesday i have always defend the undoubted right of this house include the opposition party and back benchers in all part of the house to be the to hear   major government policy announcement when such announcement be make ministers should expect to face proper sustained scrutiny from the elect member of this house not american news channel i can assure the government that that be still my firm view and that i will use the power i have to make sure the house be able to hold ministers to account 
 i be glad that there will be a statement later on fiscal rule perhaps that be no coincidence hon member may be wonder how they will get a seat on wednesday but to be quite honest the way it be go they will not need as we will have hear it all already this be not acceptable and i do not want it to continue i want this house government and opposition to be treat with the respect it deserve it be totally unacceptable to go around the world tell everyone rather than member of this house they be elect by the constituent of this country and they deserve to be treat well when the conservatives be the government it be labour complain to i get your act together on all side and treat member with respect 
 i remind the house that the case of christopher berry and christopher cash be sub judice and no reference should be make to it in the house 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on his recent visit   to china on china ’s report human right abuse in xinjiang on the case of jimmy lai and on sanction on british parliamentarian 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question on china this government be clear that the uk ’s national interest will always come pragmatic engagement matter not only to co operate on share challenge but to make progress in area where we disagree on my visit i make it clear that chinese company must stop supply equipment to russia that be be use in ukraine i also highlight north korean recklessness in step up its support for putin a threat to european security and stability in the korean peninsula i be robust on human right include in xinjiang i raise our serious concern which the right hon gentleman have also raise on many occasion about the implementation of the national security law in hong kong and call for the immediate release of british national jimmy lai i call on beijing to lift its unwarranted sanction against parliamentarian include the right hon gentleman this be a matter that i raise with you mr speaker before attend i raise taiwan and warn that cyber activity or interference in our democracy be unacceptable and will always be meet by a strong response 
 i also cover area of mutual interest china be the world ’s big emitter so we need to co operate on the global green transition it be also the world ’s large economy and our trade with china be worth almost £ china have the second- large number of ai unicorn of any country worldwide like the last government we will work with china to create rule to keep the public safe this be grow up diplomacy after year of inconsistency under the conservatives this government will set a long term consistent and strategic approach to china with foreign minister wang yi   i agree to maintain channel of communication at ministerial level this bring we up to speed with the united states whose secretary of state and treasury secretary have both make visit in the past month as well as with partner include australia france and germany this government be currently carry out a china audit to improve our response to the challenge and opportunity that china present to the uk once it be complete i will gladly update the house again 
 i thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker china be even now carry out military exercise threaten taiwan and threaten to blockade it which would damage all our economy yet i see in the foreign office ’s readout after the visit to china that there be absolutely no discussion of that   issue why not on human right in xinjiang the house of commons include the labour party in opposition vote that genocide be take place in xinjiang yet the foreign office readout simply say human right be discuss this be a genocide take place with slave labour why be there not more robust condemnation from the government to china 
 in jimmy lai ’s case he be a british citizen and a prisoner in hong kong for commit no crime whatever do the foreign secretary not only call for his release as he just say but demand full consular right of access on sanction on british parliamentarian the week before last the leader of the opposition ask the prime minister whether the foreign secretary would tell the chinese government to lift the sanction on parliamentarian the prime minister say that he would however i see from the foreign office read out that the foreign secretary do not even raise that let alone call on the chinese government to lift those sanction give your brave support mr speaker for those of we who be sanction i simply ask why the government can not follow suit and demand that from the chinese 
 i have just hear this be my final point that there be a move in the foreign office to lift british sanction on chinese official responsible for the brutal genocide in xinjiang as a deal to lift the sanction on parliamentarian here i must tell the foreign secretary that i for would never accept such a shameful deal at any price and i hope that he will stamp on that straightaway will he make it clear what our real position be on what be become a clear and massive threat to our freedom 
 i thank the right hon gentleman again for his interest in my travel but i have to correct he on a few point i do of course raise xinjiang in the context of human right i absolutely raise as i   assure you mr speaker that i would the position of parliamentarian of course i do not just with the foreign minister but with the foreign affair spokesperson for the chinese communist party i raise that as a matter of huge concern i also raise the threat and aggression that we be now see in the south china sea jimmy lai i raise member of this house i raise xinjiang i raise hong kong i raise it would be totally unacceptable for any uk foreign minister to go to china and not raise those issue of tremendous concern 
 the right hon gentleman know that the previous government bounce around on china they have a golden era he be part of the government who have that golden era and be drink pint with president xi a former prime minister and foreign secretary be find to be lobby on behalf of chinese belt and road initiative so i be not go to take any lesson from the opposition on how to handle china 
 i call the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs 
 my right hon friend have rightly outline the complex nature of our relationship with china may i add to the long list the tension in the strait of taiwan and the effect that that be likely to have on international trade if it go wrong the fact that the relationship be complicated however do not mean that we should   not get clarity that be important not just for member of the house but for other whether they be promote british export overseas or be human right campaigner such as sebastien lai whom i meet last week or be british representative in mongolia we need clarity in our approach to china so we urgently need to know when the china audit will be complete will my right hon friend tell we when that be likely to happen and will he also commit to appear before my committee to answer question about it 
 yes of course i will appear before my right hon friend ’s committee whenever she command to answer question she be absolutely right the issue in the taiwan strait be very serious i raise those issue in china and also in indonesia and in korea we need a consistent approach to china which be why   we be do the audit it be my hope that it will be complete early next year 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   on secure this urgent question and i thank you mr speaker for grant it 
 it be disappointing but not surprising that the foreign secretary do not see fit to update the house follow his visit to china i want to press he on what the visit achieve because compare the read out i would be forgive for think that very separate visit   take place the opposition understand the importance of engagement but not at any cost all interaction with the chinese communist party must be clear eyed and part of a meaningful strategy as per the high level china strategy that the foreign secretary inherit from our government yet as he say this visit occur before this government have conclude their so call china audit would it not have be well to wait until he know what interest he be seek to defend and far 
 on the conservative benches it look as if the foreign secretary rush into engagement without a plan concerningly in a fundamental breach of the constitutional principle that parliament be sovereign he be willing to pressure parliamentarian into cancel the visit of former president tsai of taiwan the week before his trip unlike in an autocratic state the government do not tell members of parliament who they can or can not meet indeed the conservative government tell the ccp on multiple occasion that no it could not shut i and other member up despite its request 
 we be tell that the foreign secretary raise british citizen jimmy lai ’s sham detention jimmy be and   be be hold in solitary confinement yet the foreign secretary still have not meet jimmy ’s son despite his come to the uk on multiple occasion and ask for a meeting will the foreign secretary now meet sebastien to update he on his father ’s prospect and will he share with we the outcome of his visit 
 will jimmy lai now be release will the chinese communist party now step back from its human right abuse in hong kong xinjiang and tibet will sanction on mps now be lift will the chinese communist party now refrain from action to support russia ’s war   machine and the intimidation of taiwan will the transnational oppression of hongkongers and uyghurs now end which of those objective do the foreign secretary achieve thank to his visit 
 it be easy to say that the visit be a reset in relation but as we all know in every relationship there be giver and taker have the foreign secretary not simply prove that he give and they take 
 really that be quite bad 
 the leader and the foreign minister of the united states have have engagement with china france have have germany have have japan have have and canada have have   the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly   go once and the hon lady ask i what i have achieve i will go again and again to get outcome in the uk ’s national interest the hon lady would expect nothing less 
 give the various global challenge we face i fully appreciate that strategic dialogue with china be in our national interest in the light of the persecution and diabolical treatment of uyghur muslims christians buddhists falun gong follower and pro democracy hongkonger to name but a few it be however important that human right concern be raise can my right hon friend assure i that he raise those human right concern forthrightly with his chinese counterpart 
 i assure my hon friend that i raise those issue robustly there be disagreement across the table on what the chinese government maintain that they be do particularly in xinjiang and in relation to minority mr wang yi suggest that i be confused in my account of the treatment of minority i assure my hon friend that we will however continue to raise these issue robustly and to hold the chinese government to account 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we remain deeply concerned by beijing ’s abuse of human right and disregard for international law too often the previous government pursue trade link instead of act on these concern will this government now do the right thing and recognise that the crime perpetrate against the uyghurs amount to the crime of genocide 
 china be not listen to the uk on hong kong jimmy lai remain in prison and the police have offer bounty in relation to pro democracy activist will the foreign secretary now put action on the table include review our position on hong kong ’s autonomy and whether it should continue to receive preferential custom status can he assure the house that hongkongers   who have seek refuge in the uk be receive proper protection 
 finally give that taiwan be a democratic ally can the foreign secretary assure the house that his department play no part in prevent parliament from host former president tsai 
 i do not recognise what be suggest in relation to taiwan 
 i assure the hon gentleman that jimmy lai ’s case be a priority for the government and will remain so we continue to press for consular access to jimmy lai and for his release diplomat from our consulate general in hong kong attend his court proceeding on a regular basis to keep abreast of what be take place
