the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 we will all know somebody with special educational need or disability and understand how vital it be to get a child with special educational need or disability the right support early on in recent year we have see a massive increase in special educational need in our country which be why we have expand funding to a record level at £ up by in the last year and why we be reform the system to deal with the increase in demand include the big investment in build special educational need school place in our country ’s history 
 child in lewisham be wait on average and a half year to get an autism diagnosis this be wrong and unacceptable it be also a national issue but it be make bad by a shortage of clinical staff the government be fail to recognise the seriousness of the shortage of educational psychologist can the secretary of state tell i why they have fail and what be be do to recruit more educational psychologist as well as to tackle education health and care plan wait time 
 i thank the hon lady for her question around half of new ehcp be issue within the statutory time limit of week and some local authority be deliver over but of course we recognise that the system be under pressure post both the pandemic and the massive rise in demand for special educational need support that be why we have increase the budget and put an improvement plan in place with regard to her question about educational psychologist we be train more which be a big increase 
 i have a constituent it could be many of the constituent who come to i who have a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism and other severe learn difficulty she have to   wait an awful long time for an ehcp for her child and in the end the plan list the very school that say it can not cope with the need of the child this happen routinely a school that say it can not cope be still list on the ehcp what be the secretary of state do to ensure that council and other people who do the ehcp be not just ignore what the school say and be actually put down the school that can cope with the need my constituent ’s child now have only hour a week of education that be surely not good enough 
 we need to do all we can to support child with special educational need they be vulnerable and need the support as early as possible we have programme in place to support local authority but the big thing that we be do be increase the number of special educational need school place this will be the large increase in a generation—60,000 more school place and it be in stark contrast to when labour be last in power when the number of place reduce by that be something we be very focused on do many of those have already be deliver some be work in progress and some will be in the hon member ’s area 
 far too many family know what a battle it can be to secure an ehcp assessment for their child but for force family this battle can become a recur nightmare as they be force to restart the process all over again if require to move base before it complete it can not be right that those who sacrifice so much for our country be so let down by the current assessment system how can we put this right 
 of course we be always look to improve the system and we do have an improvement plan in place i will take away the hon gentleman ’s specific point about people who move around from place to place but the most important and fundamental thing be that we have increase the budget which have now go up to £ a increase in the last few year we be also invest in build the right provision the number of educational psychologist and the workforce we have a thorough plan in place and we be work to deliver it 
 parent in portsmouth be rightly concerned that few than half of the primary schoolchildren in the city be achieve the expect standard in reading writing and math while under the watch of the lib dem run council waiting list for send support continue to rise do the secretary of state agree that family in portsmouth deserve well than a council that be fail child and fail family 
 yes and that be the conservative government 
 the royal college of psychiatrists have find that autistic child be time more likely to think about or attempt suicide than other child not get the support they need can affect autistic child into their adult life this be a matter of extreme concern as be the fact that more than wirral child be persistently absent from school in which be double the pre pandemic figure i note the minister ’s early comment but what assessment have the government make of the percentage of child in   wirral and across england who be miss from school and who have special educational need and disability what specific measure will the government take to address their need 
 the hon lady be right to identify the crossover between special educational need and absence from school this can sometimes result in poor outcome which can lead to mental health issue later that be why it be important that we get early help to child as quickly as possible we have a special educational need and alternative provision improvement plan and in term of workforce which be the most important thing on top of the place we be train more special educational need co ordinator we have change the training for new teacher we be make sure that we invest in a new national professional qualification to upskill teacher and we have more educational psychologists—400 more in training and more speech and language therapist there be a huge workforce element in the plan to improve our special educational need offer 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome what secretary state have just say about the workforce and it be vital that we get that into place but a week on from the publication of the buckland review and year on from the education committee ’s call to bolster career support for child with sen can she update we on what ministers and the department be do to work with the department for work and pensions to provide wide opportunity for young people with autism 
 we all know that most people with learning disability want to work and with the right support they can work the send code of practice be clear that all child and young people with special educational need should be prepare for adulthood include employment we be invest £ in a support internship programme which be very successful and we will be double this by march we be work with the dwp on a number of programme and follow the buckland review the dwp be set up a task group to consider all the recommendation 
 with a rise in complex need fund over year reach £ in with £ of funding for special free school in the spring budget and with the special educational need and disability and alternative provision plan to support everyone with need and disability to age do my right hon friend agree that it be this conservative government that be work hard for the life chance of every child in our country 
 absolutely right my hon friend be also right to say that we should take no lesson from the opposition on support child with send let we not forget that the number of child benefit from be in special school fall probably because there be no specific high need fund at all for local authority to support people with special educational need in contrast we be invest record funding and we be obviously build more place than we ever have in our country ’s history only the conservatives have a plan to support child with send 
 in all my year in teaching before i come to this place i experience only episode of violence at the hand of a student when they hurl a chair at i across the classroom i be month pregnant then only episode in all those many many year but increasingly teach staff be tell i that this be become more and more commonplace in fact they expect it my most recent conversation about this be on saturday when a teaching assistant say that they have finally be force to retire because they could not cope with the stress any more some of this will be due to unmet or unrecognised special educational need and i thank the secretary of state for outline all the provision that be be make indeed i have a new special school in my constituency but some be not will she meet i to discuss some specific local concern 
 yes i be sorry to hear about the situation of the teacher in my hon friend ’s constituency of course good behaviour be the bedrock of school and school standard we be invest more in behaviour hub which be help school that need help with the behaviour of child we be also invest more in alternative provision school we be build new one be already open and the rest will be open in the come year 
 in essex it have be take far too long for child to get their education health and care plan so i be pleased to hear that the county council have just recruit additional member of staff it be also build new special school include more in chelmsford but what can make a difference be specialist hub within mainstream school help child from that school and from neighbouring school give that we have large number of school be rebuild in essex due to reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete raac do the secretary of state agree that this could provide an opportunity and that we should look at all the school that be due to be rebuild and consider put specialist hub into those rebuilding programme 
 my right hon friend mention the considerable investment that be go into special educational need and high need budget there be also provision for capital to build new free school and school place as we look to rebuild some of the school affect by raac which have now all be identify every school have its budget detail we urge local authority to consider what will well meet the need of young people in their area there be flexibility on free school place as well those school look at what to come forward with as regard provision that be need to address local need 
 i call the shadow minister 
 coram ’s childcare survey find that just of local authority be confident that they will have enough childcare place for disabled child high quality early year education be essential in ensure that child ’s need be identify at the most important time for their development the child ’s minister   the hon member for wantage david johnston do not give a clear answer on this last month and his statement last week make no reference to disabled child be the secretary   of state really confident that every eligible family with a disabled child have be able to access a childcare place as part of the april expansion yes or no 
 i will expand on the yes or no as the hon lady want a clear answer and obviously have not hear the clear answer that she be give before local authority have a statutory duty to provide place for all child include those with special educational need but we be work with organisation such as dingley ’s promise to review special educational need inclusion and to see what more we can do to encourage provider to far consider what they can do to provide place however we will work with local authority to make sure that we improve this 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the number of apprenticeship achievement 
 the proportion of apprentice who achieve their apprenticeship standard rise to in which be up percentage point on the year before we be take action to ensure that every apprentice have a high quality experience we be review and improve standard where there be poor achievement rate we be invest £ in the provider workforce development programme and ofsted will be inspect all provider by 
 give all young people a good education be key to level up our country yet the number of apprenticeship start have fall by a over the last decade and there be few completion than year ago we have improve on last year but we be not there yet why have the government let the number of offer and available apprenticeship slide and why do the minister think that young people be not qualify at the rate they be year ago 
 we want all young people to have access to good high quality apprenticeship because they offer a valuable experience and an opportunity to upskill at the start of their career we have see a increase in apprenticeship start by young people under the age of so far this year and of all start have be by those age under last year we see a increase in apprenticeship achievement in the hon lady ’s constituency that be welcome news but of course there be always more to do i be very happy to work with she on the issue 
 be it not the case that apprenticeship achievement have go up by over the past year that over of apprentice who complete their apprenticeship get good job or good skill and that start be go up too be it not also the case that we now have more than quality apprenticeship standard in everything from aeronautic to zoology and that any attempt to dilute the apprenticeship levy would not only destroy the number of start but harm achievement it be this side of the house that be build an apprenticeship and skill nation 
 during his time as a minister my right hon friend help to completely rebuild the apprenticeship system introduce high quality standard apprenticeship be now long well and have more off the job training with proper independent assessment at the end they be more value by employer and we have see start since he be an incredible advocate for further education follow he in this role i learn very quickly that i have big shoe to fill i look forward to work with he to ensure that we continue deliver in this area 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the truth be that not only have apprenticeship start plummet since but new datum show that the overall achievement rate have drop since with level apprenticeship hit hard almost half of apprentice do not complete their course which be simply not good enough employer be call out for reform but this government have their head in the sand be this not yet more evidence that far from tackle barrier to opportunity and boost britain ’s skill the government be fail our young people and our business and that only labour have a plan to turn this around 
 we have make apprenticeship more rigorous they be now more credible they be design by employer and have proper robust assessment the only plan labour have without more funding be to cut the number of apprenticeship start in our country by obviously the hon member miss the figure publish last week which show a increase in level attainment rate we be deliver high quality standard with more off the job training and that should be welcome across the house 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the adequacy of send provision 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of send provision 
 have undertake a review of the special educational need system we publish our improvement plan last year provision be regularly review through school and local area inspection by ofsted and the care quality commission we also collect and review datum on education health and care plan include on timeliness and volume and on capacity in special school send unit and resource provision 
 last week i meet the chief executive of a chain of independent school which include a lot of independent special school approximately of the child there have special educational need she be concern about any proposal to put vat on school fee she feel all this will do be put up school fee and a lot of parent who be just about manage to send their kid to independent special school will take they out put more pressure on the state education send system do the minister share my concern that although people may think that this policy be smart politic it   may be people with special educational need include those on low income household who pay the price for this short sighted policy proposal 
 my hon friend be a great champion of child with sen and he be absolutely right labour ’s ideological obsession with private school mean that it will even charge child in an independent special school vat for their need that will make it hard for those family to afford the provision they need and drive up demand for place in state special school it be just another example of the mess labour would make of our education system 
 the inequality in the funding formula be drive inequality for child with sen in york we be see not only the lack of placement that be need but staff be lay off because of an inadequacy of funding we know that the number of child with send be grow exponentially in york so will the minister not only review the funding formula to ensure that it be fair but give local authority the power and provision to provide for the future need of our city 
 york be in our safety valve programme to provide support with the financial challenge it have it have see a increase in per head funding in the last financial year we review the funding formula every year the big complaint people have be the historic factor which be difficult to reduce quickly because there be child receive that provision at the moment 
 wyre forest school a special school in kidderminster have be do a fantastic job for a number of year but it have be run way past its maximum capacity for some time there be potential for relief when its next door neighbour baxter college secure funding from a generous grant from the school rebuilding programme for a mutually beneficial rebuilding to expand capacity on both side however with that project be in phase wyre forest school and baxter college may have to wait until before they can see any beneficial relief will the minister or the secretary of state meet i and the head of the school to discuss how we can expedite get this rebuilding programme under way 
 i would be very happy to meet my hon friend 
 on saturday i meet a lady who have move within shropshire but into north shropshire and it take week for her year son with sen to be place in a school it be without any to support which be a big downgrade on his previous situation his parent report to i that all he have receive from the school be detention for not complete his work fast enough we be desperately short of sen place in shropshire can the minister reassure i that the government be look at shropshire and work to provide proper provision for those child who be be so badly let down 
 obviously i can not comment on that specific case but i can tell the hon lady that we be in the process of create more special school place there school already open and approve to open 
 if her department will make an assessment of the potential impact of sport and pe on mental resilience in young people 
 it be well and widely recognise that pe and sport support child and young people ’s health and general wellbeing the school sport and activity action plan update publish in july set out how we will support all young people to participate in pe and sport in school 
 i recently host an event here in parliament with nick dougherty the golfer and the golf foundation to kick off their unleash your drive programme an amazing initiative provide young people with the life skill they need to survive in the modern world include mental resilience the scheme have be roll out to over school since september last year with fantastic result will the minister meet i and the golf foundation to discuss this success and how we can encourage more school to teach mental toughness skill through sport as part of the school sport and activity action plan 
 i know about the good work of the golf foundation under the leadership of brendon pyle i would be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss its work specifically the unleash your drive programme 
 sport pe and outdoor education have a huge impact on build resilience among young people help they to gain a love of learn as well as the outdoor which can be great for they for their whole life do the minister agree that it be a great shame that just the other week the welsh senedd vote down by a single vote the bill propose by his colleague and my friend sam rowlands which would have make outdoor education an experience that every young person in wales could access will the minister go furth and back my equivalent outdoor education bill which will receive its reading on   june so that this place ensure that every young person in primary and secondary school have the ability to access an outdoor education experience for free 
 the hon gentleman have be entirely consistent for some time in talk about the importance of outdoor education about which i be happy to agree i be not sure it be always necessarily a case for law but it be certainly important for young people to get outdoors to be in touch with nature and to see the countryside as well as run around enjoy pe and sporting activity 
 what step she be take to support education on israel and antisemitism in secondary school 
 i have be horrify and appal to see the rise in antisemitism in education since   october it be unacceptable and it can not be tolerate my right hon friend the secretary of state have write to all school and college remind they of their duty under prevent and we be invest £ to help tackle antisemitism across education 
 my right hon friend be clearly right that the rise of antisemitism in school or anywhere be absolutely unacceptable of the cause be the failure of school to teach child about the history of israel and the fact that jewish people have occupy israel for over year indeed the balfour declaration set up the creation of the modern state of israel as that be not communicate there be widespread ignorance and people do not believe that jewish people have occupy that land for so long will my right hon friend conduct a review of the curriculum to ensure that young people be properly educate about the history of israel 
 i appreciate what my hon friend say history be a very important subject for many reason learn about israel and the wide region can be cover in history for example in the challenge for britain europe and the wide world since theme in general we do not specify individual historical event in our national curriculum with the sole exception of the holocaust as he will know 
 i thank the minister for his positive and helpful response what discussion have he have with counterpart in the devolved nation in particular in northern ireland where the different group the nationalist and the unionists the protestants and the catholics have be able to develop an understanding on education they be able to look at each other without the suspicion that may have be there or year ago have the minister have a chance to talk to the devolved nation to ascertain whether introduce compulsory education on the importance of combat antisemitism be possible take the northern ireland example as that work 
 i always value opportunity to speak to colleague and counterpart in the devolved administration i believe that we will have another opportunity relatively soon to speak to the hon gentleman ’s colleague in northern ireland and i have no doubt that that will be thing that we will wish to talk about 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it be right that young people can recognise and denounce antisemitism and it be also right that they know something of the history of the region include the continue expansion of illegal settlement but i hope the minister agree that right wing rhetoric and islamophobia also pose a threat to our young people what step be be take to ensure that both antisemitism and anti muslim hate be treat with equal severity especially give some of the islamophobic remark that have be make by member and former member of his own party 
 the hon lady be right to call out the wickedness of islamophobia there have be islamophobic incident in school as well and tell mama be an important resource in that regard we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out whenever and wheresoever it occur 
 ms anum qaisar be not here to ask the next question but will the minister give an answer so that i can bring in the opposition front bencher 
 what recent discussion she have have with her counterpart in the devolved administration on the potential merit of provide additional financial support to school pupil in the context of increase in the cost of living 
 minister normally meet colleague from the devolved government as we be just discuss a moment ago the education ministers council be due to be host by the scottish government in late but although we have be watch our doormat no invitation have arrive the uk government be provide £ over to to help with the cost of living 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on the cost of living among concern raise by parent in response to the most recent national parents survey by parentkind the cost of school uniform trip and food come up the most labour have a plan to cut the cost of school uniform by limit the number of brand item and our free breakfast club in every primary school will put money back in parent pocket while improve attendance and attainment we have do the government ’s homework and they be still fail family will it take a labour government to give every child in this country the chance that they deserve 
 i appreciate what the hon lady say but i be afraid she need to keep up we have do the thing that restrict the cost pressure on uniform we regularly survey how much uniform be cost and some of those result be encouraging we also survey regularly the number of school that have a hand uniform facility available and i be pleased to report that that have improve we be also very clear that when a school trip be part of the national curriculum an essential thing to do there should be no charge in addition to that way many school make sure that they be provide inclusivity for all pupil and of course the pupil premium that we introduce shortly after be of the thing that facilitate that 
 when she expect the propose hanwood park free school in kettering constituency to open 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question i thank he for his ongoing support for this new school include his personal work to make sure that there be provision for boy and girl we be work with his council and sponsor trust to agree a provisional opening date for hanwood park free school as soon as possible 
 the new hanwood park free school be a key part of the future educational infrastructure in kettering and will be locate at the heart of the hanwood park development which with house be of the large housing development in the whole country will my right hon friend please facilitate a meeting in kettering with the department ’s regional director for the east midland i the local educational authority the orbis academy trust and the hanwood park developer so that together we can ensure that the school build be co ordinated as well as possible 
 again i commend my hon friend for his work i also appreciate the importance of the provision of local service none be more important than education where there be housing development i would be very pleased to convene such a meeting as he request 
 what step her department have take to improve standard of reading in school 
 since we have completely transform how we teach read in england expand the evidence base method of phonic across all of our school in the phonic screen check only of our child meet the expect standard of reading thank to those reform and the hard work of our brilliant teacher not only be that number now but our primary schoolchildren have be rank good reader in the world we be stick to our plan deliver high reading standard across our school 
 i thank my right hon friend for that very positive response in only of child in my borough of bexley meet the expect standard of reading now after the evidence base reform from this conservative government that number be 81%—a real achievement there be still much more to be do but do she share my disappointment that the labour party oppose those reform at every opportunity 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the conservatives plan to reform our reading standard completely and expand phonic across our school have mean that our primary schoolchildren be now the good reader in the world what be labour ’s response it say that phonic would not work that our literacy drive be dull and that free school be dangerous what be dangerous be the risk of a labour government who would collapse educational standard as labour have do in wales 
 what step her department be take to encourage take up of degree level apprenticeship 
 we have see year on year growth in degree level apprenticeship start at level and increase by this year there be now more than employer design degree level apprenticeship and we be provide an additional £ over year to support provider to expand their offer 
 last week i have the pleasure of host member of this house and representative of industry and of the education sector to discuss how we could leverage the resource of the private sector to support further education through a lecturer reservist programme i particularly thank the minister and his predecessor my right hon friend   the member for harlow robert halfon as well as hayley pells of the institute of the motor industry for all their hard work in make that meet a reality and for their positive engagement i would not be do my job properly if i be not cheeky enough to ask whether the minister would be willing to join we for our next meeting when we will flesh out the proposal that we discuss 
 i think we have an excellent meeting last week we have really positive discussion about the exciting lecturer reservist pilot that will run in the west midland bring together regional employer college and provider i look forward to work closely with my hon friend as the pilot progress and not just to meet he again but to visit the pilot when it be up and run 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan student loan repayment plan on level of application for university undergraduate course 
 our reform make the student loan system more sustainable and fair for graduate and taxpayer tuition fee have be freeze until and it be this government who act to cap the interest rate on student loan because we believe that everybody in our country should have access to world class high education 
 in january the number of application to study nursing fall by the royal college of nursing say that that could be a direct threat to patient safety surely the government should be do everything they can to boost recruitment in nursing but instead last september they introduce a tuition fee system that mean that future nursing graduate will pay an extra £ per month why be the secretary of state penalise people who choose to work in our vital public service 
 the system that we introduce be a progressive because lifetime earning now correlate with the amount that somebody contribute the high earner   make the large individual contribution and the low earner contribute the least for example someone who leave university in earn £ a year will now pay just £ a month repay that loan crucially the new interest rate be reduce from the retail price index plus to rpi plus which make it more affordable too it be a progressive system that we think be fair for student and taxpayer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to his place it be good to see he in his new role of course we miss the former minister   the right hon member for harlow robert halfon as my hon friend   the member for bolton south east yasmin qureshi   put it so eloquently we be in real danger of dissuade and disenfranchise so many young people from get into the sort of career in which they be interested and particularly into role such as nursing i reiterate that point because we have see a decline in the number of application for nursing at a time when we desperately need more in our health service what be the minister do do he really think this system which be introduce ahead of his join the education team be a fair 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his word welcome i to my post the point i would make be that the cycle show number rebalancing and return to a trend of normal growth in application follow the pandemic he should also look at the big impact nursing apprenticeship and nursing degree apprenticeship be have on the system i be always happy to meet he to discuss these issue but we do think it be a fair and more affordable system for both student and taxpayer and will result in more people be able to access a world class high education in our country 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of send provision in school in bournemouth 
 ofsted outcome be strong for the special school in bournemouth departmental official continue to work with the council and other service to support rapid improvement include £ of high need capital funding between and the funding allocation this year be £ a increase per head compare with 
 i be grateful to the minister for that reply he speak about increase funding but there be grow anger from headteacher and parent alike in bournemouth about the mismanagement of the dedicated school grant over the past couple of year by bournemouth christchurch and poole council school head have now take the unprecedented step of write open letter of concern to the council the council be not follow the require guidance and be demand unaffordable sum from school which if implement would see the loss of teaching assistant i ask the department for education to investigate the council ’s   decision making to ensure that correct guideline be follow in the future and that the right level of funding stay with the school 
 my right hon friend have do an excellent job of raise with i repeatedly the frustration of parent and headteacher in his constituency with bcp council i and official continue to monitor that closely to ensure that school and child in his area get the provision they deserve 
 how many child in school in bournemouth have rely on special educational need and disability provision because they have have an acquire brain injury in the last year if the minister do not know the answer he might not know it today will he be able to write to i if his official be not able to provide he with an answer will he ensure that the department establish precisely how many child in all our school across the whole country have have an acquire brain injury in the last year 
 i do not know the hon gentleman ’s constituency be so close to bournemouth as he suggest i do not have the precise answer to that question i will write to he 
 what step her department be take to accelerate the roll out of the language for life programme for nursery and pre school age child 
 early language skill be vital for child to thrive that be why we carry out landmark early education reform invest up to £ in training qualification and support and provide a range of evidence base intervention from home learning to work with local health service 
 there be grow evidence of how important it be to provide support for speech and language development in nursery and for preschool age child programme such as language for life which be support by st john ’s foundation in bath underpin the work that school be do to demonstrate how well they be do it the percentage of child need additional language support in school that participate reduce from to i be sure the minister will want to congratulate the school and st john ’s foundation on the work they be do but will the government prioritise speech and language programme such as language for life 
 what the hon lady set out sound very encouraging and i look forward to hear more about the language for life programme we have be very pleased with the finding of the government fund nuffield early language intervention which be different but have also focus on language development the neli have be find to help child to make month additional development in their oral language skill and disadvantaged child to make month additional progress 
 will the minister give we an update on this month ’s delivery of the phase of the free childcare entitlement and may i urge he to ensure that we deliver phase on time in september 
 i be delighted to tell my right hon friend and the house that the phase of the roll out go very well indeed some child be now benefit from the stage of the roll out which labour members doubt could happen we have show again that we have a plan while they have absolutely none 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of real term reduction to school budget since on school child 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question but i be afraid there be a flawed premise within it school funding be at £ the high it have ever be in real term per pupil there have be a real term increase of per pupil nationally compare with 
 i thank the minister for his response but what he say about the state of school funding be not the full picture and he know it school cost have increase much fast than fund in fact analysis by the national education union show that every single school in nottingham east have less real term funding last year than year ago that be £ less per pupil on average if the government really care about the future of child and young people should they not be fund high quality education instead of whip up culture war 
 we be fund high quality education and the quality of that education be see in the result be they the performance of year old in mathematic english and science or the result of primary school child which have improve dramatically since on the neu analysis i be afraid that it be flawed in multiple respect it do not include a number for the high need budget which have grow so much and ultimately it do not use real number for 
 on the subject of school budget will the minister join i in welcome the letter that i receive from malvern college in worcestershire this week not only be that independent school of the large employer in worcestershire but it contribute £ to the local economy and if its plus fee pay pupil have to be educate in local school that would come at a huge cost to the public purse 
 my hon friend be exactly correct if the labour party get into government there would be a hike in the cost of go to private school which would push a number of family out of that provision we do not know how many labour do not know how many and nor do anybody else but we do know that some   possibly very many would come into the state fund system cause great strain and possibly cut that would affect other child 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 with your permission mr speaker i start by send our thought and prayer to the whole school and the community in ammanford in wales 
 with exam season nearly upon we i wish all our student and teacher the very good of luck over the come month we should be very proud of all the progress that our student and teacher have make with of school now rat good or outstanding”—up from under labour in the internationally renowned programme for international student assessment our secondary school child have rocket up the ranking from and in the world for math and read under labour to and now the establishment of the education endowment foundation which have conduct nearly of all randomised control trial in education in the world be add to that success that fantastic progress be testament to the hard work of our school and the evidence base reform that we have undertake since 
 on a personal level may i thank the secretary of state for sponsor my charity event yesterday for disabled child with syngap1 of course i welcome the government ’s funding of new school place for child with special educational need but we need a fair funding formula for those resource and we need a furth £ just to prevent the crisis in special need from get bad so what step be the government take to ensure that funding be allocate accord to need not postcode 
 i thank my right hon friend who be do exceptional work to raise awareness of the impact of syngap1 and have so far raise over £ to support vital research as he have point out we be invest record amount in special educational need and disability funding we review that funding and look at the formula every year it have go up by over the past year to £ but i be very happy to meet my right hon friend and look forward to do so we say we would have a cup of tea to talk about this important topic and i will get that date in the diary soon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s comment and send my thought and good wish to all those in the school community of ammanford at this very difficult time 
 the extension do not achieve its primary aim or demonstrate value for money 
 that be a damn line from the national audit office ’s report into the government ’s childcare expansion for month the secretary of state have tell parent and   provider that they be wrong to be concern yet now we learn that even her own department consider delivery to be problematic”—her own failure expose why have she not listen and get a serious plan in place or be she simply wait for labour to publish ours so that she can steal it laughter 
 i do not think anyone in the country be wait for labour to publish its plan this be serious because of course we be ambitious deliver the large expansion of childcare in our country ’s history be not an easy task but that be the job of government and that be what we be do thank to the expansion over more child be get childcare support we be already deliver and have put that deliverability into phase to make sure we continue to deliver 
 we know what we need we need place we need workforce and we need the child but labour have absolutely no plan labour members criticise our childcare model then they say they would scrap it and now they be say that it be not their job to have a plan it be time for labour to stop talk down our childcare sector and commit to support our plan which be clearly work 
 nonsense mr speaker what people right across this country want be a general election and it can not come soon enough 
 it be not only on childcare that the secretary of state be in a total mess school leader teacher and staff have be dismay by her failure to reform ofsted she simply refuse to listen to staff to the education committee or indeed to parent i be clear that under labour the day of word judgment will come to an end so when can we expect the secretary of state to follow labour ’s lead and commit to end ofsted ’s headline grade 
 we will not follow labour ’s lead because in only of school be rat good or outstanding now thank to our reform and hard work that figure be up to we have already deliver a number of change to improve the way ofsted carry out its inspection but the answer to these challenge be not to water down standard by abolish ofsted as labour have twice propose to do that accountability be reason why of our school be good or outstanding”—up from just under labour in the past year alone over more child be attend good or outstanding school because of the work that we do to improve standard and ofsted be an important part of that 
 be power available to the secretary of state where school refuse to implement her guidance on social transitioning 
 we expect that school will follow the guidance because it be guidance to help they carry out their exist statutory duty include safeguard if they do not take those guideline into account when deliver those duty they would be at risk of breach 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for mention exam season i be sure she will include the scottish young people sit their exam whose exam start last week they be already in the throe of it 
 deepfake image and nudification app pose massive threat to the mental health of girl in particular and therefore their educational outcome i be pleased that the government have take step to criminalise the creation of such image but how be the secretary of state work with cabinet colleague to put pressure on internet company to take the radical action necessary to remove such image which can have such an impact on girl education 
 the hon member be of course right that the lead be take by a different department but we be very conscious of the pressure include from social medium in relation to pornography deepfake and nudification as she rightly identify and we be work right across government to make sure those pressure can be ease 
 bear out feedback from my excellent local conservative council a recent report from the organisation london councils highlight a drop in the number of pupil in school in hillingdon at a time of fall number on roll in outer london will my hon friend commit to work with our school and local authority to promote the opportunity for more inclusion for send pupil in mainstream school 
 my hon friend make important point there be a decline in the number of nought to year old between and and we be provide £ in this financial year to support school with manage that he be also right that although some child will always need a special school place to have their need meet many can have their need meet in a mainstream school through our send and alternative provision improvement plan we be make sure that school be inclusive and make that happen 
 the secretary of state describe special educational need as lose lose lose when she be describe the process of parent appeal the judgment of education health and care plan which as i say early often list a school that be inadequate how do she expect parent to get the right school if they be not to appeal and who have break the system in the last year it be not like that before 
 i be actually refer to the fact that parent do not feel they be receive the good service from the system the school do not feel they be give the good service and the government feel they be spend a lot more which be why it be very important that we get a grip and fix the system of course we know that there have be a massive increase in demand over the last few year not even year so we have have to put in place the special educational need and alternative provision improvement plan which be very thorough i believe that the result of that plan will be win win win 
 what step be the department take to make apprenticeship in build trade more attractive to young people and especially to woman and girl 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for all of his work on this area i know that he have be integral to the i be a housebuilder campaign to encourage more woman into the building sector our apprenticeship diversity champion network be support gender representation among employer and it be good news that stem start continue to increase year on year up in the last year but there be more to do and i look forward to work closely with he on the issue 
 the cass review have establish that social transitioning be not a neutral act and that it introduce significant risk of harm do the secretary of state agree with i that when a new minister emerge in scotland they should commit to factual science base education in school and implement the cass review finding in full so they do not suffer the same fate as their predecessor 
 i would encourage our friend and colleague in the scottish government whoever they may be at the time to pay close attention to hilary cass ’s report i think her work have inject some much need common sense into the debate and we be very grateful to she this government will always put the safety of our child and that be why the gender question guidance we have produce in draft be underpin by the important principle of parent always be involve in decision about their child 
 the liberal democrat run council in rutland have announce that it will close our specialist and outstanding rat send nursery the parks school this come with the further news that it be also go to close our only leisure centre the community be rightly devastate especially parent who want their child to get the good and most expert support do my hon friend agree that specialist provision must be protect and be absolutely vital and that the need for this kind of provision be only go to increase 
 i thank my hon friend who be absolutely right we have be hear negative thing about lib dem council from both side of the house this afternoon which sadly be not surprising she be absolutely right to be champion the need of those parent and child and i hope the council will listen to her campaign and do the right thing 
 there be no doubt but that this department have contribute to the chaos surround the opening of king ’s leadership academy in my constituency parent and child find themselves in utter limbo and this debacle have cause extra pressure on school place across liverpool in reply to i baroness barran provide absolutely no explanation of why it take the department until february to apply for planning permission despite have own   the site since last summer when will this department get a grip end the blame game and commit to exhaust every avenue in get the school open in september 
 i will look into the detail of the case and write to the hon lady 
 research by london economics and the association of colleges highlight that in recent year there have be a significant drop in level apprenticeship start will my hon friend the minister outline the specific work be carry out to reverse this decline in an area that be so vital in promote social mobility and level up 
 at level and apprenticeship make up of all start so far this year and there be almost apprenticeship at level we publish datum last week to show that level apprenticeship rise by in term of attainment we will do everything we can to make sure people have access to high quality apprenticeship and we have also invest £ over year to boost start in growth sector include engineering and manufacturing i be always happy to meet my hon friend 
 year on from the approval of a new secondary school in my middlesbrough constituency not a brick have be lay and the child of outwood academy riverside remain in an old home office block and the next year intake be go to be bus to redcar to portacabin plonk on a field child be spend their entire secondary school year in temporary accommodation and it be just not good enough will the secretary of state tell ministerial colleague to get a grip and crack on with build the new school these student need and deserve 
 we have increase the amount of money go into condition funding we be also of course rebuild school under the school rebuilding programme i will look into the specific case the hon gentleman mention and come back to he 
 my hon friend will be aware of my campaign to improve literacy across the country by improve child ’s access to library in their school and community much can also be do by parent grandparent and carer in the year before child start school what be the department do to improve access to book and audiobook in particular as well as other literary material for pre school child 
 my hon friend raise an excellent point reading be of the most important thing child can be do at a young age our little moments together campaign provide free resource for parent to encourage a positive culture of read at home and we also fund the national literacy trust which do great work to promote reading 
 can the minister give we an update on the school base work of the youth endowment fund on try to stop young people get involve in crime and can he tell we how the success of that work will be judge 
 as it happen i be meet the director of the youth endowment fund in the morning we have a quarterly meeting to review progress and make sure it be on track 
 in regard to the worrying topic raise early of antisemitism and islamophobia in school will minister please bear in mind section and of the education act the former ban political indoctrination in school and the latter say that when political subject be bring to the attention of pupil they must be present in a fair and balanced way 
 my right hon friend issue a timely and important reminder and we be very clear on that with school we also of course part fund educate against hate which have material available and i know that school also seek to go to length in most case to make sure that when tackle controversial current affair they be do so in an entirely impartial way 
 while it be welcome that minister be finally invest in childcare the scheme just be not work with local provider tell i it fall far short of what they need to meet demand exacerbate by the especially low rate pay in central bedfordshire will ministers change course to make sure that central bedfordshire family can finally access the childcare they need 
 again the stage of this roll out have go incredibly well with more than child now benefit labour mp should spend less time criticise our roll out and more in ask their front bench what their plan be because it be suppose to be like the creation of the nhs 
 st francis school and heathfield school be excellent special educational need school in fareham support a variety of child with condition range from down ’s syndrome to epilepsy but around the country there be child at independent special educational need school do my hon friend agree that labour ’s misguided attack on independent school will be harmful and punitive to vulnerable child all around the country 
 my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right this be a policy to tickle the belly of the left of the labour party the opposition do not think it through and they be now go to whack family try to get the right support for their child with special educational need with more in fee 
 in scottish student live away from home will be entitle to a minimum of £ in student maintenance whereas english student live outside london will only be get a minimum of £ give the current cost of living crisis which be undoubtedly a factor in the withdrawal of almost undergraduate student in england last year will the government commit to provide the same encouragement and reinforcement to student in england as student in scotland enjoy 
 we be try to deliver a system that be fair not just to student but to taxpayer too that be why we be take action to support student with the cost of live in england include freeze tuition fee we have increase loan by and we have make sure that if someone ’s family income fall by they can have their loan reassess it be also important that we support people from low income household which be why we have make a furth £ available include for hardship funding in this system be fair not just to student but to taxpayer more widely 
 the sir robert pattinson academy in my constituency be a great school provide an excellent education to child however it be struggle with the challenge of aged infrastructure and an urgent bid for it to rectify the heating and wiring challenge have be refuse an urgent meeting on friday with official be unproductive not least because the datum they be look at be out of date can i ask the secretary of state to please ensure that the senior leadership team get an urgent meeting with senior official and that she personally ensure that this bid be look at properly and quickly 
 i will indeed do that my hon friend have bring up this subject with i and with my right hon friend the secretary of state there be that meeting with mr hardy on friday i know there be separate case around the condition improvement fund bid and the urgent capital support bid we will continue to work with the school and i will ensure that my hon friend get that high level meeting that she ask for 
 among other cut the department for education have quietly slip out the announcement that it be slash funding for now teach which have support more than people to switch career and retrain as secondary teacher in shortage subject such as science math and modern language why on earth be the government withdraw funding when they be miss their teacher train target by in some of these subject and when now teach have have such a brilliant track record in get people to retrain as teacher 
 i must say that the statistic the hon lady just give on miss recruitment target be incorrect they be frequently repeat but not right we do think that career change be an important part of people come into this noble profession and we be continue with our career change programme we be not ax now teach we be not re procure it so we be not extend it again to put it in perspective it be roughly about to people in a typical year out of about career change come into teaching we be reassess the good way to attract more of they because we want to grow the number of career change come into teaching and make sure that we go about it in the good and most productive way 
 the secretary of state be well aware of the issue we have with academies enterprise trust and maltings academy in witham town she will know of the story of child miss out on school time because of exclusion and bullying some be even self harm what assurance can she give to pupil and   their family who have very little choice as to which school they go to locally that their concern will be hear and that they will have great educational choice over which school their child go to 
 i know we have correspond on this recently and i know my right hon friend be take a close personal interest and have be involve directly and personally in multiple case in my most recent letter i be not sure if it will have arrive yet i have say that we will as a department work with she 
 i thank the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state for their comment about the incident at ysgol dyffryn aman in my constituency last week there be obviously now a criminal investigation ongoing and a charge of attempt murder so it would not be wise to speculate but as education be devolve in wales will the secretary of state pledge to work with the welsh government to ensure safety measure follow the various investigation have complete their work 
 yes and i can assure the hon gentleman that i be always willing and ready to work with anyone from the devolved administration 
 business those in manufacturing in particular speak about the challenge in fill vacancy the solution can often be in the exist workforce but old worker can be reluctant to take up apprenticeship what work be we do to encourage more old worker into the apprenticeship system 
 work with employer be central to success on that point that be why we be deliver the local skill improvement plan to ensure that we be match the need of business and employer with the workforce they need we be work with over employer with over different occupation include on skill bootcamp which bring different demographic to the workforce to ensure that we have intensive training where industry have those skill need engagement with business be at the forefront of our mind on that point 
 this weekend the times report that some conservative mp want to see graduate visa ban will the minister ask the home secretary to quash that damaging rumour give that international student provide the uk with a £ boost 
 we be home to some of the world ’s top university which benefit from strong international tie we think it be right to try to prevent any potential abuse and to protect the integrity of our high education system but it be true that international student make significant economic and cultural contribution to our education we believe it be possible to balance a fair and robust migration policy with maintain our place as a top destination for student from around the world 
 i thank the education secretary for all the support that her department be give to bracknell forest particularly the £ safety valve programme and other sen initiative give the high number of good and outstanding school in bracknell   and the focus on apprenticeship and t level at bracknell and wokingham college might i tempt she please to visit 
 a quick yes 
 it be tempting we be proud of the safety valve programme which be be use across local authority and i would love to see it in action as i know it be provide a lifeline to many council 
 final question sir edward leigh 
 for long weary year i have be argue for an end of the faith cap which be prevent the opening of new catholic    school and have no proper effect do the secretary of state think that i should keep campaign and be patient for a bit long 
 i have also have an opportunity to speak to my right hon friend on occasion about this the catholic church the church of england and other denomination play a central part in our education typically have high quality school and typically be popular with parent we be keen to extend our academy and free school programme which have underpin the huge rise in quality and child ’s result that we have see since no doubt before too long we may wish to put the thing close together 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on the role of the uk armed force in the middle east 
 the prime minister and government ministers have regularly provide update in parliament on the recent role of the armed force in the middle east through write and oral statement in addition to respond to write question as have be say previously publicise operational activity to parliament in advance could undermine the effectiveness of operation and risk the life of armed force personnel involve 
 the uk have provide assistance to our ally and partner in the region the ministry of defence have provide support to facilitate the foreign commonwealth and development office ’s response to the deteriorate humanitarian situation in gaza and we continue to work with the fcdo our armed force personnel have play a critical role in work to establish more route for vital humanitarian aid to reach the people of gaza and in the delivery of support in co ordination with the us and our international ally and partner to date the uk have conduct airdrop as part of the jordanian lead mission drop more than tonne of vital humanitarian aid of prepackaged halal meal water flour baby milk formula and rice to gaza 
 uk military planner have be embed with the us operational team to jointly develop the safe and most effective maritime humanitarian aid route rfa cardigan bay be sail from cyprus to support the us pier initiative to enable the delivery of significantly more lifesaving aid into gaza the uk hydrographic office have also share analysis of the gazan shore with us planner to support the initiative the raf also send additional aircraft to the region to protect our ally and support de escalation culminate in the uk armed force shoot down a number of iranian attack drone the house will understand that for operational security reason i can not comment on the specific of that activity 
 as state by the prime minister on   april 
 our aim be to support stability and security because that be right for the region and because although the middle east be thousand of mile away it have a direct effect on our security and prosperity at home so we be work urgently with our ally to de escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed ”—[official report   april vol c. 
 we be direct all our diplomatic effort to that end   i will not comment on media leak and speculation but i can assure the house that the government be take all measure to support our ally and partner in the region we be press for a sustainable ceasefire that will enable the release of hostage and provide the people of gaza with the essential assistance and humanitarian aid that they need 
 i welcome the minister back to the department in his new post of course the defence secretary should be here he have make only oral statement on the middle east in more than month 
 as the minister say our uk armed force be reinforce regional stability protect international shipping defend partner country and deliver desperately need aid to gaza we be proud of their professionalism and across the house we pay tribute to their work but the agony of the palestinians in gaza be extreme child be starve family be die and famine and disease be take hold humanitarian help must flood into palestinian hand so we welcome the raf airdrop last week but why have there be only sea shipment of uk aid in more than month and none this year what be the government do to open up ashdod port 
 we welcome the new role for rfa cardigan bay in help to build the temporary pier the royal fleet auxiliary be demonstrate that it provide vital naval support be it protect from new civil service cut have ministers resolve the issue of the potential strike action what be the defence secretary do to raise rock bottom morale in the rfa weekend report suggest that uk troop could be deploy to deliver aid on the ground in gaza will the minister confirm those plan how will the defence secretary report to the house and ensure that parliament have a say on any such deployment 
 the defence secretary seem to be do the bare minimum on the diplomatic front why have he make only visit to israel and the occupied palestinian territories since   october we need an immediate ceasefire now hostage release now and unimpeded aid now we need a political route to secure a long term state settlement where the government pursue these aim they will have labour ’s full support 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question and his warm welcome he ask a series of pertinent question which i will seek to cover off he ask about our effort on maritime delivery clearly the deployment of rfa cardigan bay be lean into the prospect of a far great flow of maritime aid through the cyprus humanitarian corridor which will seek to substantially uplift that deliver so far that will have an important impact on the extent to which ashdod can come into play we make the point regularly to our israeli colleague that open ashdod would be a critical enabler of a dramatically increase flow of aid which be seriously need 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the royal fleet auxiliary cardigan bay colleague will have notice in last week ’s statement to the house that there have be a very substantial uplift in defence funding an additional £ over the next year mean that morale across all service and the royal fleet auxiliary will be resilient and high than before that uplift be a vote of confidence in our capability of which we should all be proud i certainly be 
 i will not comment on speculation that there might be a ground role for uk force it would not be right for i to comment on speculation we be very clear about the current remit rfa cardigan bay be there to provide living support for the us troop involve in the construction and operational delivery of the jlots joint logistic over the shore platform 
 the defence secretary will as be his will not continue to report frequently to this house and to make oral and write statement i be very pleased to hear that   the right hon gentleman would like to see the defence secretary at the dispatch box more often i will relay that desire to he when i see he he be a busy man but he know that his duty be to be in this house his visit to the occupied palestinian territories be important his be a global role to categorise his visit as disproportionate or a lack of interest be uncharitable to say the least 
 in all earnestness we share the right hon gentleman ’s view that a far great flow of aid and humanitarian support be contingent on a sustainable ceasefire this house will know that we call on hamas to lay down their arm and release the hostage that be the sure route to find that sustainable ceasefire 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i commend the government ’s determination to get aid into gaza and i commend the work of the raf rfa cardigan bay uk planner and the hydrographic office as the minister be aware i would not expect he to comment on speculation but some of the well lay and well intentione plan can run into problem can he assure the house that we would only ever contemplate put uk boot on the pier if appropriate force protection be in place 
 i be grateful to the chair of the select committee who speak with characteristic expertise he be absolutely right that it would be improper for i as a government minister to comment on that speculation 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 can the minister confirm that the us maritime humanitarian aid corridor be require only because the israeli government will not allow the port of ashdod to be use to receive the appropriate amount of aid for northern gaza be the uk government content with that stranglehold over the people of gaza the working assumption be that a nation will be drive truck of aid across this american facility but will that nation be the uk if it be what be the risk assessment if uk troop potentially step up for an operation that go where american troop fear to tread get aid into gaza to alleviate the unspeakable torment of the palestinians must be a good thing and the professionalism and capability of uk troop be beyond question but be ministers seriously suggest that the good that euro atlantic ally can muster be british troop have ministers forget how british force operate in palestine in the arab rebellion of the palestinians have not any risk calculation must command more robust analysis rigour and humanitarian ambition not simply uk minister ambition for positive headline 
 well mr speaker that be a mixed bag of question i will answer in the spirit of sincere debate we should say that we be lean into the cypriot and jordanian humanitarian effort that be very important because those effort need to be ground in the region solution to the problem of the region lie in the region but clearly we have a key enable role along with the us the hon gentleman invite i to comment on speculation in the medium which i will not do nor will i dwell on his reference to the history lesson from we should be upbeat and proud of the way we have   significantly lean into the delivery of humanitarian aid that be a key component of stabilisation and of any prospect of peace in gaza 
 i call the chair of the intelligence and security committee 
 of the main strategic aim of iran russia ’s ally in support what hamas do in october last year be to suck western power into the middle eastern theatre thereby divert they from russia ’s existential conflict with ukraine may i urge the minister not to comment on the suggestion that we might have british boot on the ground in the gaza strip but to take the message back to the secretary of state that this would be a completely insane idea it would be far well to have moderate neighbour arab state deal with any distribution of aid that we have facilitate as a result of the viable raf and sea power that we have rightly exercise 
 my right hon friend be right the answer to the humanitarian and political challenge in the region lie within the region i entirely agree with his analysis he make a relevant and good point about the requirement for we to maintain focus on our effort to support our ukrainian friend in defend their sovereignty that be why last week we announce an additional uplift in our annual support for ukraine to the tune of £ bring this year ’s support to £ a record amount 
 from our work on the defence committee i know that the armed force be run hot obviously the event in the middle east over the last month or so have put much great strain and pressure on our armed force what be the minister do to ensure that our armed force get proper rest and recuperation and that we improve the resilience of our asset 
 we be increase funding for defence to record level which increase the armed force capacity to train rest and attend to all the area of their life other than operation that be a huge vote of confidence in the esprit de corps of our armed force we be take defence investment to of gdp by it be a tremendous boost which will filter down and improve retention and effectiveness right across the board 
 i be in israel early this year and meet senior israel defence forces personnel who assure i that they be do everything in their power and be work with ally to increase aid to gaza it be the right thing to do and we must continue those effort but it be patent that hamas be obstruct the distribution of aid within gaza another reason why we need to support israel in defeat hamas will the minister assure the house that if and when israel go into rafah where several hamas battalion remain and where senior hamas operative and the hostage be base uk support will remain resolute and steadfast as we support israel in finish the job and eliminate hamas 
 we be clear eyed in our assessment of hamas we regard they as a terrorist organisation that have prosecute an atrocity we call on they to lay down   their arm and to release the hostage that be the precondition for any kind of meaningful and sustainable ceasefire 
 the government have so far resist have a proper debate and a vote on british military engagement in the middle east this year the engagement of the british army in bosnia in the 1990 start out as be for the purpose of humanitarian aid but be subject to mission creep as british soldier be attack by the war party in john reid say 
 we would be perfectly happy to leave in year time without fire shot 
 will the minister assure we that if the government propose use british troop on the ground in gaza they would grant this house a debate and a vote on the matter 
 the lesson of bosnia be interesting and be not lose on government members the hon gentleman should have no doubt that ministers and the government will remain fully accountable to this house 
 may i declare an interest member of my close family have be and be involve in military operation in the middle east 
 bear in mind my experience in northern ireland tour i be slightly worried that if our armed force open fire in the middle east which they have do a foreign country will at some future date put they before an international court and charge they i hope the minister will declare that such a thing will never happen 
 i be grateful to the right hon and gallant gentleman for his question he speak from a position of knowledge he should be assure as should the house that our force in the region operate with the full force of the law behind they on the basis of collective self defence 
 israeli medium be report that the international criminal court could be about to issue an arrest warrant for benjamin netanyahu and other top israeli official for the litany of war crime commit by israel in gaza it be far report that the united states government be work to prevent justice from be do and to stop the icc issue arrest warrant do the minister agree after more than palestinians woman man and child have be slaughter in gaza and israeli bombing have obliterate and decimate entire palestinian neighbourhood that benjamin netanyahu should be hold to account for his horrific crime 
 rise 
 order we have to be careful the question be quite frame i be sure the minister might want to pick part of that to answer 
 yes i regard that as out of scope 
 no i think i do that anyway i call robert jenrick 
 hamas be a terrorist organisation that hate the united kingdom and everything that we stand for it would therefore be deeply unwise for the uk to commit british serviceman and woman whether on the ground or on the pier in gaza it be for precisely that reason that the white house have categorically rule this out will the minister take the opportunity to do the same so that we can reassure our constituent that we do not make an inadvertent mistake and that british troop will continue do what they should be do which be facilitate the complete eradication of hamas 
 i agree entirely with my right hon friend ’s analysis and his comment about hamas other than that of course i will not comment on speculation in the medium 
 what discussion have the minister have regard un security force accompany truck to enable they to move into gaza in the light of the impediment they be face and also rebuild infrastructure so that truck can travel across the country to deliver crucial medical and other humanitarian aid 
 a great deal of energy from ministers and official be go into the ongoing discussion about how to operationalise the great flow rate of humanitarian aid go into gaza so the hon lady ask a relevant question 
 the minister be rightly reluctant to discuss the role disposition and location of british force in the middle east but could he again confirm to the house that the requisite force protection will be factor into all operational level planning and also that it be not beyond the realm of possibility that the un could be coerce into take a more active role in gaza 
 my hon friend also ask a relevant question and i can give he that assurance in relation to the deployment of rfa cardigan bay 
 some people be already dead in gaza many be die now in rafah from wholly preventable condition such as measle because of a lack of sanitation and medical care and the israeli bombardment be still go on that be the big problem for get aid in what pressure be the minister put on the israeli government to cease the bombardment of gaza to ensure the withdrawal of israeli force from gaza and to ensure that we will not be deploy british troop anywhere on the on the ground in gaza the west bank or any other part of the region and that instead we will search for peace and for justice for the people of palestine 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the protection of civilian we continue to make the point to our israeli friend that they must seek to protect civilian life but of course the root cause of this be the atrocity commit by hamas for peace to be secure all that would have to happen be for hamas to lay down their arm and release the hostage 
 iran continue to present of the most pressing and dangerous threat to the middle east and to global stability with the increase emphasis on the need for an integrated defence strategy comprise different nation of the region do my hon friend agree that there be an ongoing vital role for british force to play as they do so ably on the night of and   april 
 i wholeheartedly agree and we should pay tribute to those who courageously play an active role in that defence of our collective security undoubtedly british armed force have a sustained and hugely important role to play in bring peace and stability right across the region 
 the un report that of all those in the world face imminent famine be locate in gaza with over humanitarian worker kill by israeli force since october a ceasefire be essential for the effective delivery of aid and for prevent famine in both the short term and the long term how can the government justify their continue refusal to back call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire 
 the hon lady be correct that a ceasefire be need as it be the way to assure the flow of aid that gazans need the precondition of that ceasefire be for hamas to lay down their arm and to release the hostage 
 i be in israel on the night of the iran attack and i see the jet in the sky david ’s sling and iron dome deal with the ballistic missile as they come in i feel very proud to know that our force be involve and the israelis be very grateful for our activity 
 group of people in gaza who be not be provide with aid or proper medical check be of course the hostage last monday i speak to the parent of year old hersh goldberg polin who be last see on   october   be bundle into the back of a truck with his arm and hand missing have have a grenade throw into his shelter a video be release on wednesday and it be the sight of he he look in a very distressed state can the minister assure i that we will continue to do everything we can militarily and through intelligence to help israel to locate these hostage 
 i can of course give my hon friend that assurance it be a highly sensitive subject and if he would care to raise the case with i individually we will do what we can to follow up 
 month ago the house pass labour ’s motion call for an immediate ceasefire we believe that hamas must immediately release their hostage but israel must also look at release its prisoner there have to be an immediate and unimpeded supply of aid into gaza but i be really concerned about uk force get involve we should rely absolutely on aid be deliver by the charity and voluntary organisation on the ground what be the defence secretary do with our ally and regional partner to secure an immediate ceasefire 
 we continue to make the point that hamas must lay down their arm and release the hostage that be the precondition for peace 
 the key problem as my hon friend will know be that hamas and islamic jihad be appropriate aid mean for the palestinians what step be our armed force take to ensure that aid get to those who really need it not the terrorist network what step be they take against hamas ’s terrorist tunnel under the egyptian border british armed force could play a significant role in work with israel to dismantle the tunnel network 
 my right hon friend ask a very good question and a huge amount of effort be go into this we be energetically lean into the prospect of a great degree of aid flow through the cypriot and jordanian humanitarian corridor and the jlots temporary pier capability could be an absolute game changer 
 the government continue to provide huge sum of taxpayer money for arm and weapon for ukraine but minimal funding for humanitarian aid for gaza do the minister believe that the uk public share the government ’s spend priority 
 i believe they do yes 
 despite some positive noise come out of the middle east about a truce for my constituent in bolton it be deeply worry to see report of an increasingly likely ground offensive in the southern city of rafah the minister speak about not want to see any more bloodshed but if there be a ground offensive more blood will be shed what be our government the ministry of defence in particular do to avoid bloodshed happen in rafah and to prepare for different scenario 
 we always make the point to our israeli colleague that the protection of civilian life be imperative we acknowledge that israel have an absolute right to self defence and we hope that hamas will recognise that the path to peace lie in lay down their arm and release the hostage 
 my understanding be that the british government do not support the ground offensive by the israeli military in rafah will they therefore use all the leverage at their disposal include withdraw arm export licence if the israeli government act against british policy 
 we have of the world ’s tough arm export regime of which we should be very proud 
 on the middle east it be a decade since this house vote to support the uk ’s join the global coalition against daesh although territory have be liberate do not the recent strike by the raf against a rocket launcher be use to target coalition force underline the need for a sustain long term commitment to defeat and destroy terrorism 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about that and we should be grateful for the role play by the raf it be a reminder that the price of peace be eternal vigilance 
 i thank the minister for his response i very much welcome the prime minister ’s announcement last week about the extra defence spending it be important that we support innocent victim who can not protect themselves the uk ’s role in the middle east be much appreciate acclaimed and respect do the minister agree that in response to recent increase iranian threat for instance with the islamic revolutionary guard corps be responsible for hamas terrorist attack across gaza and the broad middle east we must do whatever we can within our budget to encourage de escalation and to try to prevent further attack by iran and its supporter 
 i agree with the hon gentleman he rightly say that put in of gdp by will provide that boost and ensure that we have the operational capability to achieve that global response that we need to keep our country safe 
 we talk about truck a day because that be the pre war number but that be when gaza have a relatively function economy and an agricultural sector to back it up therefore more than truck will be need by land and sea and so i thank the armed force for their help in deliver aid and in help to build the pier what pressure be we put on israel to get more aid quickly deliver by land which be the good and quick way of do it and on the use of unrwa in northern gaza as it have the most effective system to get aid to the right place quickly 
 my hon friend be correct we do need to increase that flow what would be a game changer be open the port of ashdod and we continue to make that point forcefully to our colleague 
 do my hon friend agree that his majesty ’s armed force could be provide any humanitarian support now or in the future only with israel ’s total co operation and that it should be recognise for that have he note also that israel ’s iron dome and arrow defensive system among other thing would in effect be part of the protection of his majesty ’s and other ally force do he agree that that make even more nonsense of the anti israel interest call for an arm embargo against israel because if ally force include his majesty ’s force be to be act in the region they would be look for support from israel itself 
 my right hon and learn friend make a very good point 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make a statement on the introduction of check on good enter the uk under the border target operating model due to be live on   april 
 under the border target operating model tomorrow the government be introduce documentary and risk base identity and physical check on medium risk animal product plant plant product and high risk food and feed of non animal origin import from the eu check on high risk product currently conduct at destination be move from destination to border control post and control point recent medium report suggest that the introduction of these control will be delay be incorrect 
 documentary check will happen at all risk level physical check will initially focus on the high risk good with some also take place on medium risk commodity we will build up to full check rate to both protect biosecurity and minimise disruption we will continually review our enforcement approach as we track compliance and trade flow and will adjust our approach accordingly this pragmatic approach will support trader as they adjust to the new regime 
 the government have work closely with industry inspection agency and the animal and plant health agency know as apha to ensure we be ready for the introduction of these control we be confident that border control post infrastructure have sufficient capacity and capability to handle the volume of check expect under the border target operating model we be confident that our system be robust dynamic and effective and that the inspection authority be appropriately staff and train 
 i close by emphasise that the introduction of these biosecurity control be not optional now that we have move away from the eu ’s rigid biosecurity surveillance and reporting system we be responsible for protect our own biosecurity against threat such as african swine fever 
 let we start by say this be not about brexit because whether member support or oppose brexit nothing propose here be inevitable or unavoidable have leave the eu we need border control but what be propose will not be control it will be chaos
