today the levelling up housing and communities committee have publish a special report on the response time of the department for levelling up housing and communities to the committee ’s report i thank the backbench business committee for kindly grant time to our committee for a statement on the special report and i thank the committee staff for their support to assist we in produce it 
 the house have appoint our committee to scrutinise the department the issue that our committee consider affect the day to day life of constituent up and down the country during this session we have publish report on topic such as adult social care housing supply and funding for level up we have also investigate damp and mould and reform to the private rented sector issue that be raise on a daily basis in correspondence to the committee and in our mailbag as constituency mp we have hear evidence from hundred of witness who have give up their time to share their experience in some case harrowing and deeply personal experience to inform the committee ’s work they do so in the expectation that our report and recommendation will influence government policy and improve people ’s experience of public service 
 for our scrutiny of government policy to be fully effective the government must consider and respond to our conclusion and recommendation sometimes the government will accept our recommendation and sometimes they will not what be important be that we receive a response from the government their response demonstrate that they have consider the view of the committee and allow the public to see what the government be do in response to our inquiry it be a well establish convention that the government should respond to all select committee report within month of publication we understand that that will not always be possible perhaps during a parliamentary recess or where recommendation be direct to more than department however delay should be the exception not the rule and we expect open and proactive communication from ministers and official on the rare occasion when they expect a government response to be delay 
 the experience of our committee be that the department for levelling up housing and communities have historically and consistently fail to respond to our committee report within a reasonable time during this session we have publish report and not of the government ’s response have be publish within the month deadline on average government response to our report have be almost month late the response to our report on funding for levelling up on the electoral commission ’s strategy and on exempt accommodation be all late the response to our report on adult social care be month late the response to our report on social housing be month late the response to our report on permit development right be year and month late we be still wait on overdue response to our report on reform to national planning policy and on reform the private rented sector our committee staff spend a disproportionate amount of their time resource and energy attempt to engage with ministers and official through formal and informal channel to get response 
 over the year as chair of the committee i have see response be late but thing have get progressively bad in march the chair of the liaison committee write to the then leader of the house to highlight case of egregiously overdue government response the department for levelling up housing and communities be identify as a repeat offender when it come to late response and be responsible for of the example in that letter 
 in january this year we ask the permanent secretary about his department ’s failure to respond he say 
 we need to make sure that it be an important responsibility of the department that we respond on time 
 we have see little evidence that the department have take this responsibility more seriously indeed in the case of our report on reform in the private rented sector publish in february the lack of response have be deeply disappointing 
 the month deadline pass on   april on   may the secretary of state write to the committee to explain that the delay response will be publish 
 alongside the introduction of the renters reform bill 
 the bill be introduce on   may but we have still not receive a response to the report instead we have hear that a response will be publish as soon as possible we have make separate formal request for the response as well as many informal request but we be still wait for the government ’s response it be now more than month overdue 
 the committee broadly support the legislation on private rental reform and have make suggestion for   its improvement we now need to hear whether the government plan to accept these recommendation and if not why not we expect a response in april we be promise in may we be now in september and still wait we be also wait for the reading of the bill we hope to receive the response before reading although that appear to have be somewhat delay as well 
 it be imperative that the government fully consider the committee ’s conclusion and recommendation in the report and publish a full response imminently our special report call for a government response on the private rent sector in the next week along with   an explanation as to what have cause the delay we have request an assessment from the cabinet secretary about these matter finally we have ask the liaison committee to consider a formal review of government response time include our experience with this department 
 in reality a select committee ’s power and effectiveness be significantly undermine when the government do not fulfil their responsibility towards it minister must be accountable to this house we as a committee treat our responsibility to scrutinise the department and its ministers with the utmost seriousness it be time that the department for levelling up housing and communities take its responsibility to our committee and the house equally seriously the step in do so must be to respond to our principal output our report in a professional and timely manner 
 i normally take great pleasure in come to the house to report on the committee ’s inquiry and finding it give i no pleasure at all to have to make this statement today i hope i do not have to make a similar statement in the future 
 motion make and question propose that this house do now adjourn.—(gagan mohindra 
 have sit for many year next to ann on this very spot on the back benches and on the other side of the house as well i want to echo my hon friend ’s remark about ann ’s incredible passion pride and sense of justice but i also want to mention her sense of mischief and the twinkle in her eye she bring both passion and humour to this chamber she be sadly miss and we be all greatly diminish by the lack of her presence in this house certainly in cardiff west where in her latter year she be a very active constituent and correspondent with i as her local mp i certainly miss her letter even though they create a great deal of work for i here in this place 
 i thank my hon friend for that intervention 
 ann understand the need to keep job in local community tyrone o’sullivan leader of the tower colliery buy out who sadly also pass away early this year speak at an event for ann that be organise in march last year by our local labour woman ’s branch in cynon valley tyrone acknowledge and celebrate ann ’s contribution to the fight for tower colliery and he remind i only week before his death of the importance of the working class struggle for today they show the way to build local economy build local wealth for local people not encourage local people to leave in order to get on in life i share that vision and i try to carry on in the same vein with my work on the local economy in cynon valley 
 ann fight battle on behalf of miner when she become mp our constituency be in the throe of fighting to keep the mining industry alive next year we will remember year since the miner strike the year when ann become mp for cynon valley i be as a child on the demonstration through the town of aberdare with ann in her maiden speech in parliament ann say that the miner strike be

 that fight continue public service worker rail worker and health worker today be fight against britains the have and the have not 
 ann also fight tirelessly for compensation for miner suffer health problem as a result of their work as she say in the same speech 
 it be a heartbreaking experience i wish that conservative members could share it to see a miner gasp for breath even while use an oxygen mask yet because he have not be diagnose as suffer from pneumoconiosis he do not get a penny in compensation that be more than wrong it be cruel and unjust ”—[official report   june vol c. 
 i like other member in the chamber be currently involve in the ongoing battle for miner pension right and compensation so again the fight go on the thread of history continue 
 my hon friend ’s intervention be very timely because i be just come on to the point that ann be renowned for her internationalism from cambodia to south africa to east timor and turkey and of course her commitment to support the kurdish people she be for over year chair of the all party parliamentary group on human right which continue to raise awareness of serious human right violation throughout the world she be also a member of numerous parliamentary committees include those on international development and foreign affairs and she head the ipu committee on the human rights of parliamentarians throughout the world as my hon friend say ann be sack not once but twice from the shadow cabinet 
 it be a great pleasure to be able to speak about my friend ann clwyd whom i know extremely well i thank my hon friend   the member for cynon valley beth winter   for the wonderful way she have put her memory on the record today 
 i know ann when she be elect to parliament along with i in the early 80 we share an office in the cloisters downstairs along with about other mp it be an extremely noisy place because ann have a great deal to say lord campbell savours often come along to have an argument with ann about something or to tell she what to do and she tell he what to do and so it go on tony benn be next door and there be a number of other there so it be not a quiet place 
 the office be also home to my dog call mango who come in as well ann be deeply concerned about mango ’s health and often look after mango for i day there be a leak in the roof it be literally a leak there be a lot of talk about government leak but this be a real leak with water come in from the roof the rest of we just moaned and groan and phone up service and say please fix this leak but ann no no no i open the evening standard at lunchtime that day there be a picture of ann clwyd with an umbrella over her head raincoat wellington boot the whole bit explain how parliament have so deteriorate that she be force to come in with protective gear to get through the day she have this wonderful panache for publicise event and issue but that hide a deep steel in what she do 
 she represent cynon valley where tower colliery be i be at the next desk to she the miner strike come and they want support so she ask i to get a load of people from my constituency to go to cynon valley we hire a coach and a van we take food and we go in large number ann meet we there we build up a great relationship with tyrone o’sullivan and it be an honour to be invite to speak at his funeral recently with my hon friend the member for cynon valley 
 ann be somebody who stand up for what she believe in she and i be of a very small group of mps who oppose arm sale to iraq and speak up for the   kurdish people during the chemical attack on halabja we do a lot of activity around the place and work closely together with all the kurdish group ann be rightly see as a great friend of the kurdish community while she and i do not agree on the iraq war we be both on the record as oppose arm sale to iraq there be not many of we who be oppose to arm sale to iraq before the war begin i see ann as a friend and colleague and i work closely with she as vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on human right 
 during the yeltsin period we go on a delegation to russia to try to defend the chechen people with the horror they be go through ann be extremely assertive on behalf of the human right group on that i distinctly remember sit in front of somebody who be presumably very senior in something because he have an unbelievable number of phone set out all round his desk and ann and i be speculate about which phone lead to which person it be her wit and humour that help to get thing through i want to put on the record my thank to she for so much of what she do 
 as chair of the human right group ann also lead we in a delegation to east timor in to witness its referendum it be difficult because the indonesian army be supposedly protect the integrity of the referendum which be a strange to do ann i and the late alice mahon be on a delegation and we visit all the polling station on behalf of the un and meet many people there for some reason that i never really understand ann bring an amazing amount of luggage which fill up the very small plane we go in to get there the rest of we all become porter for ann clwyd ’s luggage there be a lot of it and it be very heavy when we ask she to explain this she say i do not think it ’ any of your business how many case i choose to bring but it ’ very much your business that you ’ve get to carry they so i say thank ann that ’ great but we play our part in ensure that the people of east timor who have be through hell for decade actually see their independence and some hope for the future 
 i want to say a huge thank you to ann for the friendship for the humour and for the steel and determination on the human right cause and all the other cause that colleague have mention she be always a good friend to i we often do not totally agree on everything but we totally agree to respect each other in our disagreement so we always get along very well indeed that be a good example of how politic can work i say to all her family my condolence and thank you for the life of ann 
 it be a real pleasure to follow the many tribute to ann and particularly those from my hon friend   the member for cynon valley beth winter who succeed she in her seat it be also a real pleasure to have ann ’s family with we in the gallery 
 i want to give a few personal thought about ann i be lucky enough to know she for decade i meet she when i be year old as an intern in the welsh labour party headquarter and i remember be bowl   over by she speak at an event with great power great passion and that strong sense of radicalism exemplify in so many of the comment we have hear as often happen in politic we can meet people when we be young and think wow what an incredible figure but do they turn out to be that way when year later we meet they in parliament or have the privilege of work alongside they in parliament as i do with ann when i be able to join ann in this place she live up to every aspect of what i have see in she when i be a young teenager 
 i be ann ’s whip for a while she have obviously have a tumultuous relationship with whip and indeed with party leadership over many year but all i can say be that she be always utterly courteous and pleasant even when there be difficult issue to be discuss it be a real pleasure to work with she 
 we have hear about so many different campaign that ann be involve in include tower the nhs iraq and miner compensation and she really do apply that campaigning zeal expertise tenacity complete dedication and commitment to everything she turn her hand to i have the particular pleasure of work with she on the committees on arms export controls arm export be obviously a significant issue that she reflect on in many different capacity in her career i remember work with she on the committees i will not go into too many detail because we be not suppose to reveal certain proceeding and deal with a lot of shenanigan with thing make it out into the medium and so on ann ’s expertise and length of time in this place have see so much of it in the past be a great instructor to i on how to handle such situation 
 even amid all that she never lose track of her clear purpose which be to stand up for civilian affect by conflict for child for human right and for basic standard and decency even in war and conflict ann speak passionately about that issue on the very last day that she speak in this place in the valedictory debate which i will quote in a moment she teach i an incredible amount about stick to principle drive forward and fight through difficult political situation ann serve as an mep before come into this place i spend a lot of time with she here during the brexit debate which as we all know be tumultuous tiring and try at time 
 ann never lose sense of her principle and what she stand for my hon friend   the member for caerphilly wayne david   talk about how ann stick to her principle and be very tough but she be truly an internationalist she be never afraid to tell it as it be in this place when she think other be get it right rather than we in that valedictory debate she say 
 there be other reason why i be pleased that i go there 
 refer to the european parliament 
 i have to say that it be a cultural shock for i to come here because i have not realise how delusional people here be i will tell you why it be because we give the impression that we do everything well than everybody else when in fact there be many example of other country do thing well than we do and i be pleased to have have the opportunity of experience that ”—[official report   november vol c. 
 ann be deeply and passionately welsh and british she be proud of our country and what we do in the world when we be at our good but she be also not   afraid to tell it as it be and to question and criticise whether on domestic or international issue or on so many of the other cause that she go for how she speak in that last debate really sum she up

 ann help stand up for and advocate for so many people particularly individual detain abroad or who have their human right violate that may have be speak up for nazanin zaghari ratcliffe or other detain in a whole series of situation though i would not want to breach any confidence ann be always on the phone to i about my own constituent who she work bravely and tenaciously to support i be sure that ann ’s advocacy and campaigning touch hundred and possibly thousand of people and possibly change their life they may not ever know that but she do 
 i want to reflect on what a wonderful woman ann be to spend time with privately after she retire from this place i have the pleasure of spend a number of evening lunch and chat with ann at her home she would invite i over and we would talk and gossip about politic and what be go on in here we would get into some serious conversation about different issue and campaign she talk from her vast experience but we also talk about her cat she have story about every of they i be a cat lover and as   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   point out ann have a deep love of animal and have serious compassion for they she tell story about their personality and how they act she be incredibly proud of they that show that human and compassionate side of her character 
 i remember stumble into ann ’s house evening i do not know what have be go on but i have be run from event to another i have not eat and i be look a bit pasty i walk in and ann who be not in the good of health at that stage get up and say stephen i ’ll make you a chop i ’ll put some vegetable on and make you dinner she cook dinner for i and make sure i be feed and water that be a testament to the kind of person she be

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the contract for difference scheme in support low carbon electricity generation 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication of the outcome of the contract for difference allocation round on the future development of float offshore wind 
 i welcome the secretary of state 
 our contract for difference scheme be a uk success story have contract more than gw of capacity include gw of offshore wind since ar5 deliver a record number of clean energy project enough to power the equivalent of home and the government ’s commitment to offshore wind remain unchanged which be gw by 
 i welcome my right hon friend to her place the great advantage of the cfd scheme be that with forward planning it have the flexibility to adapt to change economic condition can she therefore confirm that the government will be work collaboratively and straightaway with industry to ensure a successful round so that offshore wind can get back on track and uk consumer and the uk economy can benefit from low cost low carbon energy 
 i thank my hon friend for his long stand support in this area and i can confirm that we be waste no time in engage the sector in advance of ar6 i personally speak to offshore wind stakeholder follow ar5 and confirm our commitment the minister for energy security and net   hold a roundtable with the sector on   september we be listen to the sector and annual auction mean we can respond quickly 
 question please 
 i know that as chair of the all party group on the celtic sea my hon friend be a long stand supporter of offshore wind we have announce that ar6 will open in march and we have publish an indicative timetable we be support research and development in float wind technology via the float offshore wind demonstration programme announce up to £ in capital grant funding 
 can we work to the order as it be a group question the question should not be answer in that way selaine saxby should be ask a direct question 
 thank you mr speaker i be keen to understand well what more can be do to assist float offshore wind in ar6 follow what happen in ar5 
 i know my hon friend be a long stand supporter of offshore wind we have announce that ar6 will open in march and we have publish that timetable we be support float wind technology through different programme and manufacture investment scheme too 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 we also welcome the secretary of state to the dispatch box with many renewable project build on the strength of contract for difference but with report of many not invoke these contract and instead benefit from the high energy price can the contract in principle be invoke later when price fall or could the government enforce the invoking of the cfd contract now at the start of the generation of these project rather than their take the high price while they can 
 the cfd programme have drive price down over time to enormous effect by since they start which be much more than people expect i would be happy to take the hon gentleman ’s particular point away but overall this be a successful programme and our annual auction change will also make a difference 
 give the unreliable and intermittent nature of both solar and wind generate energy we already have more of these project than the grid can efficiently manage do the secretary of state agree that what we really need be more reliable baseload capacity and that that can only be deliver via fossil fuel or nuclear 
 we have a strong focus on energy security and that mean have a just transition to clean energy but also invest in nuclear the hon gentleman may have see that we have start the capital raise for sizewell c and we support the oil and gas industry as a just transition fuel 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i wish the clerk of the house well in the future and i warmly welcome the secretary of state to her new role and congratulate she on her appointment to the cabinet i look forward to work together let we start with the truth the offshore wind auction that she inherit be a totally avoidable disaster it mean another lose year for our country and another year of high bill and it be because ministers obstinately refuse to listen to warn after warn from industry renewableuk estimate that the auction failure will add £ to bill what be the secretary of state ’s estimate of the cost to family of this fiasco 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for welcome i to my place i be delighted to serve opposite he and face he at the dispatch box 
 there be a couple of thing i will point out if we have try to do what the right hon gentleman suggest we would have delay the gw of clean energy that we secure which be able to power home if we want to look at what be go to hurt people and their bill i would point to his disastrous policy whether it be the ultra low emission zone which be hit people who can least afford it or his borrowing spree which will raise inflation 
 i be afraid the secretary of state be quite wrong about that because ireland adjust the price and have gw of offshore wind let we talk about the way that this government be jeopardise our energy security they have delivered—[interruption 
 order mr stuart i know this be the last day before the recess and you be excited to get some freedom but let ’s save it 
 this government have deliver the bad cost of live crisis in a generation there be a pattern here they ban onshore wind and raise bill they slash energy efficiency and raise bill and now they have trash offshore wind raise bill that be why we be so exposed i know that the right hon lady do not make those decision but now that she be the secretary of state she need to tell we after year of failure what be she go to do differently 
 let i tell the right hon gentleman about the last year we have decarbonise fast than any g7 country while also grow the economy we have grow renewable energy from of our electricity when labour leave power to now i be proud of what we have achieve over the last year we have a proud record when it come to climate change and a proud record when it come to renewable energy and i be proud to defend it 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her new role i wish i could have welcome she to her new role on   september when we have the remain stage of the energy bill but she be not here i wish i could have welcome she on   september   for the urgent question on the auction round strike   price but she be not here for that either so what have the new secretary of state be do in the midst of the chronic energy crisis face our constituent and allow her department to see shovel ready offshore wind go into abeyance what have she be do 
 i struggle to see how that be directly relate to the question but let i tell the hon gentleman what i have be do i be here for the reading of the energy bill perhaps he be not during this time i have be move forward with all the government ’s priority on energy security and ensure that we can move to a just clean transition 
 forgive i if that rendition be not immediately recognisable in offshore wind project from auction round i hope the department have learn some salutary lesson from this mess but it will be consumer who pick up the bill can i ask the secretary of state for her personal intervention in pump storage to introduce a cap and floor mechanism which industry have be clear be absolutely necessary to get this vital baseload energy source into position will she intervene personally and get that move because it be blow in the breeze just now 
 i be absolutely focused on get investment into offshore wind of the thing i do after ar5 be speak to investor from across the board to make sure i be listen to their concern and there be multiple thing they care about be have certainty there be lot of welcome of the move to annual auction the other be connection to the grid i will be look at all those thing and make sure we can get the investment the sector need 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of carbon capture usage and storage technology on economic growth 
 we have commit £ to the early deployment of carbon capture utilisation and storage which will deliver economic growth and decarbonisation of our industrial heartland our analysis have show that it could support up to job in and add up to £ to the economy by 
 i thank my right hon friend for her reply follow the commitment in power up britain to provide up to £ of funding for early deployment of ccus how do she intend to finance that support do she recognise that ccus funding need to be match by create a competitive environment for private sector investment include a carbon border adjustment mechanism to smooth the path to deployment as recommend by the commission for carbon competitiveness of which i be a member 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s work as a member of the commission for carbon competitiveness and she make an excellent point the £ will be fund through a variety of source and will be allocate in due course and early this year the government   consult on a range on measure to support decarbonisation include a carbon border adjustment mechanism the government will provide a response to that consultation in due course 
 if the secretary of state be look for innovation that will make a real difference to economic growth will she look at not only carbon capture and storage but hydrogen many of the same university and research establishment be look at hydrogen as the new energiser for transport and so much else in our life will she put some serious money into both hydrogen and ccs 
 i be interested in innovation in all of those area because that be what will get we to the ambitious target we have set out i will be look at hydrogen carbon capture and every single other area to see what more we can do 
 what plan she have to help tackle methane leak from oil and gas production 
 the government have ambitious plan to tackle methane emission from oil and gas production with support from government and key regulator industry be on track to end routine flaring and venting prior to in line with the world bank ’s initiative 
 while i welcome the government ’s introduction of new oil and gas licence in the north sea as part of a just and graduated transition to more reliance on renewable the minister will be aware that methane be a far more warm gas than carbon dioxide give that much more can be do will the government look at how they can ensure that flaring venting and leak be fix by the new licence holder as and when they occur and in the context of the north sea transition plan ensure that the new affleck oil field be not allow to flare until as set out in the permission grant to it this be all part of how we can reach net without it cost my constituent the earth 
 the north sea transition authority already expect methane emission to be as low as possible and all new development to be develop on the basis of routine flaring and venting and that they should be electrify or electrification ready of course what be require and will help facilitate that be new investment in the north sea facilitate by licence without which we be unlikely to see the reduction in emission that we have so successfully drive so far 
 the minister have not really give any reassurance to   the hon member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard as we know methane be a whopping time more powerful than carbon dioxide over a year period so if the minister be serious about tackle this issue will he explain why the government fail to use the energy bill to ban flaring and venting why do they whip their own mps to vote against an amendment that would have outlaw it and give that the practice have be   illegal in norway since the 1970 will he finally recognise that this make a mockery of ministers claim about uk oil and gas being greener 
 unusually the hon lady have get her fact wrong i do not think that amendment be even select for debate that day accord to the north sea transition authority flaring be reduce by more than just last year contribute to a reduction of nearly between and as i have say the north sea transition authority estimate that methane emission have fall by more than to few than tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent a record low we have old exist infrastructure and be move with a maximum of ambition to reduce emission and we have a successful track record to date 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her department ’s policy of the climate change committee ’s progress report to parliament publish in june 
 i be grateful for the work of the climate change committee and i pay tribute in particular to the commitment of its outgoing chair lord deben the government will respond to the committee ’s report in october 
 the late climate change committee report find that out of key indicator of government progress on tackle climate change just be on track accord to energy uk even before the disastrous offshore wind auction the uk be forecast to have the slow growth in low carbon electricity generation of the world ’s large economy up to do the minister recognise that the government ’s failure have cost every family £ in high bill 
 our climate leadership be measurable and real we have reduce emission by more than any other major economy since we be the to legislate for net we have eliminate coal which as late as produce nearly of our electricity supply the legacy of the labour party and we have lift renewable from to we have cut emission by more than other transform our energy system and we be lead on this issue internationally and domestically that be exactly what the government rely on in fulfil their aspiration to climate leadership 
 do my right hon friend accept that consequence of the climate change committee report be to increase our country ’s reliance on chinese technology and raw material 
 china have even great offshore wind capacity than ourselves it have the large wind and large solar capacity in the world and it have a significant level of production we recognise that we will need technology from all over the world include china if we be to meet our net aspiration 
 i call the shadow minister 
 accord to the climate change committee 
 the private sector be be hold back by weak policy signal uncertainty and barrier to investment 
 and perhaps we would not need to be so reliant on china if those issue be address just last month uk investor represent £ in asset write to the prime minister warn that that could mean the uk miss out on job will this zombie government listen to investor and their own adviser look at the game change intervention in the states and bring forward a uk version of the inflation reduction act before it be too late to save british business and british job 
 yet another unfunded spending commitment from the labour party the party that leave we with less than of our electricity come from renewable and that leave we reliant on coal a party that want to nationalise the industry and drive out all those company that have transform the north sea basin lead the world in cut the cost of offshore wind and make we the european leader in offshore wind and the global leader in cut emission the labour party be the big enemy of net and the big enemy of the private investment in this country that will help we get there 
 what step she be take to help develop the onshore wind industry in england 
 what step she be take to help develop the onshore wind industry in england 
 the government recently announce change to national planning policy give great flexibility to local authority to respond to suitable opportunity for onshore wind the government also want community to benefit from host onshore wind and have consult on improve the current system of community benefit for england 
 the truth be that the government have fail to properly lift the ban on onshore wind while bend over backwards to support expensive new oilfield and even give billion in tax break for those pollute project that ban have already add hundred of pound to people ’s bill undermine the investment we need in the cheap form of energy and cost thousand of good green job will the minister not admit that the government ’s failure to properly lift the ban on onshore wind will continue to keep bill higher and make we less energy secure 
 more than gw of onshore wind be deploy in the uk in our allocation round just the other day we secure gw of onshore wind capacity allocation round secure gw it be extraordinary an industry domestic uk oil and gas have low emission than the alternative from abroad and employ people every of whose job be at risk if the labour party ever get into power labour   member be suggest that there be a negative fiscal impact when that industry be expect to contribute £ over the next year the labour party be an enemy of the transition to net and of british job and prosperity 
 if the minister will not accept the argument of my hon friend   the member for leeds east richard burgon   will he at least listen to industry which describe the recent announcement on onshore wind as a miss opportunity to end the ban renewableuk say 
 the propose change do n’t go far enough 
 and would not make up for 
 year of lose progress 
 when will the minister listen to industry and lift the ban properly so that we can cut bill 
 on   september the government announce change to national planning policy for onshore wind in england give great flexibility to allocate suitable area and to address the planning impact of onshore wind i agree with the hon lady i be an enthusiast for more onshore wind where it go with the grain of community and we will continue to pursue that to make sure that we can realise the benefit that come from it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister will know although he unaccountably do not tell we that there be precisely no new onshore wind in england in the recent ar5 the minister claim that the late compromise wording which he allude to will lift the ban on onshore wind but he know really that that be not so and he know what the industry have be say about it and why it will not invest for the future the result be no new onshore wind get build in the medium term high bill for family and less energy security for the country why will his department not just face down his luddite back benchers introduce fair planning regulation for onshore wind and get the industry restart across england 
 as i have just say we announce change as recently as   september like the hon gentleman i look forward to a positive future for onshore wind in england as well as in the rest of the united kingdom 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the report by sheffield hallam university entitle over expose uyghur region exposure assessment for solar industry sourcing publish in august 
 the government be determined to ensure that our energy system be not dependent on force labour at home or abroad the supply chain and innovation sub group of the solar taskforce be therefore consider this issue as a top priority 
 i start by welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place 
 what conversation have my hon friend the minister have with the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for business and trade on eradicate force labour from our supply chain do he agree that we must ban the bad offend company from our shore will he therefore lead a cross government effort to take action on tackle slave labour in our supply chain just as germany america and the eu already have do 
 my hon friend know that this issue be a top priority for the government and for i a range of tool can be use to tackle force labour in global supply chain the government continue to keep our policy response under close review and we be work closely with our partner include at the united nations to hold china to account for its egregious human right violation in xinjiang we have already take robust action introduce new guidance on the risk of do business in xinjiang enhance export control and introduce financial penalty under the modern slavery act 
 i thank the minister for that answer as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief i commend   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   on raise this matter for i freedom of religious belief in china be paramount and should be a priority for the government i think it be to make it happen we need clear legislation in this place and real power from this government and we need to be assure that no company that use force labour in china can have its product sell in this country again i seek confirmation from the minister that that serious strong will be there 
 i concur very much with the hon gentleman ’s view on this matter the government be determined to ensure that our energy system be not dependent on force labour as i say we be continue to work with international partner to do what we can to hold china to account for its egregious human right violation and to work with the solar industry to see what we can do to weed out force labour and ensure that it be not part of that supply chain move forward 
 what plan she have to provide funding for the national grid in the south west 
 electricity network funding be regulate by ofgem through the network price control in the current price control national grid electricity transmission will be invest approximately £ in the south west ofgem have allow £ for the distribution network company cover the south west £ of which be for the south west region specifically 
 may i declare an interest as of my brilliant little sister work in the renewable energy sector i want to see more renewable energy scheme get off the ground in the far south west but i be be tell   that scheme great than mw have to wait until at the early for a grid connection this mean that dozen of renewable energy scheme be gather dust on paper when they should be generate clean power it be wrong and be set back our net ambition what be minister do to speed up grid connection for renewable energy scheme allow we to build the already approve clean energy scheme that we need which will create green job cut carbon and reduce soar energy bill 
 as the minister for energy security and net my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart   suggest from a sedentary position we be do lot and lot specifically the government be use strategic planning to support investment ahead of the need in the network include the south west the example of that be last year ’s holistic network design which set out a blueprint for connect new offshore wind project to the grid by an update to the holistic network design follow up exercise hnd will be publish early next year and provide recommendation for the connection of float offshore wind specifically in the celtic sea for the time offshore wind developer participate in the crown estate ’s leasing round will receive clarity over their grid connection from the electricity system operator at the same time as a secure seabed lease 
 i call clive lewis 
 the minister may be surprised—[interruption indeed question mr speaker 
 what plan she have with cabinet colleague to help increase the capacity of local authority to deliver area base home retrofit scheme 
 to support english local authority we fund an embed technical assistance facility provide access to expert training and guidance to enhance their capability to deliver our domestic grant scheme 
 time lucky the minister may be surprised—[laughter]—to hear the following word leave my lip and i know i be i agree with the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss in her claim that low and middle income household can not afford to pay for the transition to net where we differ be that i do not believe that we should let the planet burn as she do instead the wealthy must pay for the green transition will the minister commit to income and wealth redistribution and finally give household and local authority the ability to transition successfully 
 the government provide a wide range of funding to support local authority in reach net through the core settlement grant funding scheme and uk growth funding the government be enable local authority to tackle net goal 
 of the big challenge that we have in deliver home retrofit scheme in cumbria be not with local authority but with industry capacity and skill what be the government do to try to send the right signal to industry so that we be get the right skill into the supply chain to deliver some of these scheme especially in area such as cumbria where we have skill desert 
 my hon friend make a really important point on skill in fact we have invest £ in subsidised training over the past year and have provide training opportunity we will continue to support this important industry 
 whether she plan to issue guidance to people with oil fire heating on replacement of boiler 
 the government have create an online advice service to help consumer in replace fossil fuel heating system include oil boiler with a heat pump we be also provide funding through the boiler upgrade scheme 
 this will be helpful 
 absolutely mr speaker there be a panic now in germany as its premature ban on gas fire boiler approach the minister will want to avoid a similar panic as we approach our own premature ban on oil fire boiler will n’t he 
 as ever i thank my right hon friend we be listen as the prime minister set out we will reduce our emission in line with our obligation but do so in a way that recognise the challenge that family face off grid household will be support through the transition and we will respond to the consultation in due course 
 during the summer recess when i be tour village i find in my corner of devon that some constituent be worried about whether they should replace their oil fire boiler in the next couple of year with a heat pump or put their faith in hydro treat vegetable oil some have be encourage by the pilot of so call hvo as an alternative source to heating oil what assurance can the minister offer that it will be a truly sustainable source of fuel and not make from palm oil which encourage deforestation or should we put of our effort into heat pump 
 as the hon member doubtless know we have conduct a consultation on the use of hvo in heating and we be determined to ensure that we decarbonise heat in home include off grid home in a way that be practical and align with minimise any negative impact on those family 
 what step her department be take to help energy intensive industry decarbonise 
 the government have commit £ to support the early development of carbon capture and storage and £ for the industrial energy transformation fund to help industry decarbonise phase of which be expect to open for application in early 
 may i put on the record the thank of back benchers to the clerk of the house for his work 
 steel account for of global carbon dioxide emission and job here in the uk we have no viable alternative to steel which be why the government ’s decision to go with an electric arc furnace only model for decarbonisation do not make any sense not only do it put at risk thousand of job but it make the industry vulnerable to change in steel price as the uk will have to import it the minister speak about carbon capture but can she explain why the government have not go for a combination of technology such as carbon capture or the retrofitting require for hydrogen base steel production that way we would not only decarbonise the industry but protect those vital job and the industry in the uk for generation to come 
 as the business and trade secretary set out the government ’s deal have provide long term security for at least steel job the investment will grow uk domestic green steel production i gently urge the hon lady to look at her party ’s plan for industry which have be describe as impossible and decimate the work class 
 energy intensive industry come in many form can my right hon friend provide any reassurance that the government will review the classification of what constitute an energy intensive industry sb joinery in my constituency contain a large sawmill and planing facility but have be deem ineligible for high level of the energy bill discount scheme would my right hon friend be prepared to look at that case personally 
 i would be delighted to meet my right hon friend and discuss that particular case we keep look at everything we can do to support business as we have do this entire time 
 i call the shadow minister 
 for year people have be call on the government to have a proper plan to help our steel industry decarbonise instead the industry have lurch from crisis to crisis and now the government be spend £ in a deal that will make thousand of port talbot steelworker redundant be it not the simple truth that job and wealth will be lose because there be no comprehensive plan for steel automotive or any industry that need to decarbonise 
 i refer the hon lady to my previous comment the investment will provide long term security for at least steel job we have have record investment of £ in the auto industry this year again i urge she to look at her own party ’s plan its industry decarbonisation plan be disastrous and will push job and investment out of this country 
 if she will take step to ensure that consumer do not pay for heat network remediation 
 what step she be take to support heat network customer with energy bill 
 what assessment she have make with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of introduce a mandatory price cap on heat network 
 the government be provide million in support for remedial work through the heat network efficiency scheme we be support customer with their bill via the energy bill discount scheme through the energy bill we will appoint ofgem as a heat network regulator so that customer benefit from fair price 
 i must declare that i live in a block with a heat network many heat network will be quite expensive to change under the technical rule propose by the government for give many block have also have cladding and other pressure on leaseholder be the government look carefully to ensure that customer be not be overlayere with many more charge to remediate network 
 through the heat network efficiency scheme the government be provide £ to upgrade exist heat network and reduce energy cost the scheme will upgrade old equipment and help consumer in more than house to reduce their energy use we will shortly announce the award from the fund 
 resident live in new mill quarter in hackbridge in my constituency have be plague by a litany of problem since they be connect to the sutton decentralise energy network include an inability to change tariff do my hon friend agree that resident have be let down by the mismanagement identify in an independent report on its poor run by lib dem run sutton council will she commit to work with i to ensure that heat network customer who have nowhere else to go for their energy be protect by new measure in the energy bill 
 i know how hard my hon friend work for his constituent and i thank he for bring this scheme to my attention we want all heat network customer to receive a high quality service and fair pricing which be why we be appoint ofgem as a regulator through the energy bill and currently consult on how it will operate of course i will meet my hon friend 
 many of my resident be lock into district heat network scheme they have be pay up to time more than the rest of the uk because   they be not protect by the energy price cap do the government not think it be time to implement a mandatory price cap straight away 
 at this moment in time we do not think that a uniform price cap would benefit consumer give the huge diversity in size and scale of provider in the market however through the energy bill the secretary of state will have power to introduce a price cap should be beneficial in future 
 what estimate her department have make of the number of family in fuel poverty 
 in there be an estimate household in fuel poverty the additional support we provide last year prevent household from fall into fuel poverty in the establish target support remain in place while from july household energy bill have be fall 
 over family in bradford have be plunge into uncertainty as the tory government lurch from crisis to crisis more than in of my constituent now live in fuel poverty yet the minister still come here today with no real plan or solution and no real windfall tax on the booming profit of energy giant let i ask the minister to put herself in the shoe of my constituent what do she have to say to those who frankly have be abandon and have to choose between a warm home a full stomach and school uniform for their child 
 have experience fuel poverty myself when i be grow up i do understand completely how the hon gentleman ’s constituent feel that be why the government be absolutely committed to ensure that we support people we have give unprecedented support we have the warm home discount and the cost of live payment among many other measure to help constituent through the cost of living 
 what step she be take to help promote the creation of high skilled job in the renewable energy sector 
 this be a crucial area there be already over job in the renewable energy sector and that will rise steeply over time we be invest billion in skill include green skill and include training opportunity in energy efficiency and low carbon heating 
 may i urge the government to give real priority to the creation of apprenticeship in the renewable energy and green sector that way we can use net to create great opportunity for young people and boost social mobility 
 as a former education minister i be absolutely passionate about this area we have deliver almost apprenticeship since the minister for energy security and net my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart   chair the green job delivery group which will publish a net and nature workforce action plan in the of half of 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her position although the uk have the large offshore wind capacity in the world after china denmark have time as many job in the sector many british wind turbine be be build in spain holland and indonesia why be the government so far behind the curve on the green job bonanza that be so possible for our country 
 thank to government policy and spending we will support another job in the green sector by as i say we be lead the way in decarbonise fast than any other g7 country with the job that come with that right across the country 
 i too welcome the secretary of state to her place and remind she that we start in this place at the same time year ago will she highlight the job opportunity in the new renewable energy sector that ai present for my constituent in bolton 
 my hon friend raise an interesting point about the job opportunity present by ai which will undoubtedly have an effect across the country and a beneficial effect in this sector i would be delighted to meet he to speak about this far but we will be set out more detail on our green job delivery group and our net and nature workforce action plan in the half of 
 would it not boost skill in renewable energy generation and installation as well as encourage more uptake if all those instal solar energy scheme have to be certify under the microgeneration certification scheme so that the householder farm or business concern would be guarantee payment for surplus energy feed into the grid 
 the right hon gentleman ask an interesting question we have explore his suggestion of legislate to make certification mandatory we have no such plan at this time as there be a mature approach to certification standard and most uk domestic solar installation already take place within well establish scheme 
 what assessment she have make of the potential contribution of great british nuclear to domestic nuclear energy target 
 the british energy security strategy set out our ambition for deploy   up to gw of civil nuclear by we launch great british nuclear to help deliver new nuclear project start with a small modular reactor competition the gbn offer to successful vendor will include fund to support technology development and support with access site 
 may i say croeso and welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place 
 wylfa be recognise as the good site for new nuclear in the uk if not in europe but a welsh affairs committee report state recently that ownership of the site be hold back progress what be the minister and great british nuclear do to transfer its ownership from hitachi to an active nuclear developer 
 the term doughty champion and passionate be regularly throw about in this place but when it be a case of championing wylfa new nuclear no come close to my hon friend when launch the small modular reactor competition in july the secretary of state indicate that as part of a comprehensive offer to industry gbn would support access to site for successful vendor and wylfa be of a number of site that could host civil nuclear project however no siting decision have be make so far 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 since my appointment a fortnight ago the energy bill which will deliver cheap clean more secure energy be give a reading in this house we have fund a record renewable energy project and i have visit our pioneer culham centre for fusion energy i have also launch the £ great british insulation scheme we have bolster our energy collaboration with ireland and japan we have make our big ever climate finance pledge and just yesterday we invite partner to invest in sizewell c a major component of our nuclear revival 
 i welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her new role she will be aware that the huge increase in offshore wind farm in the east of england have lead to an unwelcome proposal from national grid to put mile of pylon across the area we do not want that we need an offshore solution will my right hon friend meet member from the east of england to discuss this proposal 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this issue today i understand that concern have be raise by local community about the national grid electricity transmission plan for network reinforcement between norwich and tilbury the minister for nuclear and networks my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie have visit the area and will continue to engage with colleague but i be also happy to meet local mp to discuss the matter far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 accord to analysis by the resolution foundation more than a of british household face high bill from the end of this month because of high standing charge and the demise of the energy bill support scheme and the people who use the least energy and those in the poor household be disproportionately bad off at the same time the windfall tax have massive loophole cost billion would not close those loophole and extend more help to people during the cost of living crisis be the right thing to do 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that the government be raise a energy profit levy and he will also be aware that stand charge be a matter for ofgem let i reiterate however that we be mindful of the cost of live crisis and have be provide support with the warm home discount the £ cost of live payment and a raft of other measure to support people through this crisis 
 the launch last week of the great british insulation scheme be very welcome so as to build on this and to kickstart a mass retrofitting revolution will my hon friend liaise with the treasury to obtain its support for the introduction of such fiscal measure as an energy save stamp duty and an employee benefit scheme similar to the cycle to work scheme 
 the government set the aspiration in the clean growth strategy of upgrade as many home as possible to energy performance certificate band c by where practical cost effective and affordable we remain committed to that aspiration although tax policy sit with the treasury we be consider how to improve energy efficiency for owner occupy home and plan to consult by the end of 
 energy company have accumulate hundred of pound if not over £ in consumer credit when those company go into administration the company take over do not honour that credit and people often with very little mean have lose hundred or thousand of pound how will the minister ensure that they get compensation and get credit by the new company with the amount of money they have lose 
 i can assure the hon lady that we be in constant conversation with ofgem on such matter although this be a matter for ofgem i have a regular meeting to make sure that we be on top of this 
 energy from waste require burn waste and it be therefore not conducive to net the expansion of the beddington incinerator in my constituency be not need to meet local demand so can my right hon friend assure i that the environment agency will take that into account before make a decision on whether or not to license 
 the environment agency ’s recent consultation on vary the environmental permit for the beddington   energy recovery plant close on   september the environment agency will carefully consider all relevant response and issue a final decision in due course 
 in the select committee inquiry into preparation for this winter of the repeat call that we have hear from expert witness be to support the vulnerable and fuel poor with a social tariff will the minister do that 
 of course we be aware of the challenge that be face consumer this come winter which be why we be keep the price cap as a safety net to give the hon gentleman reassurance we will be monitor the situation in case we need to look at this far 
 recent investment in electric vehicle charging and the ev supply chain show the benefit of the government set clear target so that the private sector have the confidence to invest do my right hon friend agree that if we have similar policy consistency across the whole of the economy we would see great investment in green growth and in meet decarbonisation by 
 the emission vehicle mandate support our commitment to end the sale of new petrol and diesel car and van by set it many year in advance and give clear notice to the market it provide appropriate stimulus to industry in a way that the ultra low emission zone singularly fail to do as my hon friend will have note 
 the energy minister get his fact wrong in his early response to   the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas so he might want to correct the record the liberal democrat amendment to the energy bill to tackle flaring venting and leaking of methane be select for a separate vote it would have reduce methane emission by why do his government vote it down 
 i stand correct on that issue we have infrastructure some of which date from the 1970 and we be move at the maximum possible speed it be technologically and economically challenging to make this change and yet as i set out early we be already show significant effort and of course we be champion of the methane pledge which we plan to exceed when i be at cop28 i will be urge other country to follow we in agree and support that world bank methane pledge 
 the hydrogen industry will i be sure welcome the introduction of the hydrogen production business model for green hydrogen with a further business model plan for next year but the storage and transportation business model for hydrogen be not due to be finalise until for customer of company such as luxfer gas cylinders of colwick in my gedle constituency this be a potential barrier to some project move forward can my right hon friend give come clarity on the sequencing and whether there be scope to bring forward the storage and transportation business model so that the timing be join up 
 my hon friend be right to talk about the challenge of bring all the piece together to unlock opportunity the government will promote the whole hydrogen economy production demand network and storage and stimulate private sector investment in august the government publish the low carbon hydrogen agreement set out the hydrogen production business model ’s term we will award contract for that in quarter of my colleague and i be happy to meet my hon friend to talk about make sure we get this absolutely right so that we maximise its benefit 
 biodiesel producer in my constituency be be undercut by cheap chinese import because of the government ’s decision to award they inward processing relief this be make it difficult for we to support uk industry so can we have an explanation for why that decision be make 
 i will write to the hon gentleman 
 write for the daily telegraph last year our now prime minister say 
 on my watch we will not lose swathe of our good farmland to solar farm 
 yet the industry have not hear that and vast swathe of farmland in my constituency total square mile be open to planning engulf whole village and use the good and most versatile land will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how he and the department can ensure that the prime minister keep his very important promise 
 i can assure my hon friend that plan policy and the associated guidance encourage large scale solar project to be locate on previously develop or low value land where greenfield site or high grade land be use developer be require to justify use such land and to design their project to avoid mitigate and where necessary compensate for any impact i hear my hon friend ’s personal testimony and i will be happy to meet she to discuss this far 
 almost of the housing stock in my constituency date from before and be therefore classify as historical what plan do the department have to improve skill level in retrofit historical residential building 
 as i previously mention retrofit be of our most important project of course skill be a real issue which be why we be delighted that this will enable we to enhance our skill basis 
 i welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her new role give the vital role that oil and gas play in manage our energy security as demand continue albeit decline and the vital job skill technology and expertise in that industry of which be think to be immediately transferrable to the renewable sector do my right hon friend share my disappointment at today ’s report of humza yousaf ’s vow to end scotland ’s place as the oil and gas capital of europe 
 my hon friend be right last year we be dependent on fossil fuel for of our energy if we import more gas from abroad it will be in the form of liquefy natural gas which accord to a report from the north sea transition authority week ago have time the production emission of domestic gas the scottish national party ably support by the labour party want to threaten job £ of tax revenue over the next year and the very subsea engineering and technological capability not to mention the balance sheet that we need to develop hydrogen carbon capture usage and storage and the rest of the transition it be madness and it be the policy of the snp 
 yes we need increase electric arc capacity to reprocess more scrap steel in the uk but trostre tinplate packaging work in my constituency need a grade of steel that can be produce only by the blast furnace process until green production technology be develop with such project elsewhere in europe will the secretary of state commit to invest in develop these technology at port talbot thus reduce emission and keep job in port talbot and llanelli 
 i share the hon lady ’s enthusiasm for keep those job which be why we be invest hundred of million of pound to ensure that these industry can make that transition i entirely agree with she on the importance of innovation and make sure it be embed so that not only do we sustain those industry but so that through innovation we can strengthen they in the year ahead 
 a decade ago the onshore wind industry commit to a community benefit protocol to provide compensation of £ per mw instal per annum to community for the duration of a wind scheme so far solar developer have refuse to do something similar and surely that be not fair do my right hon friend agree that compensation scheme must be equal whether wind or solar be involve 
 it be perhaps typical of my hon friend that not only be she ask a question and champion this issue but she have schedule a meeting with i immediately afterwards i look forward to discuss this with she and make sure that we have the most coherent position possible as to where we be set on rewarding community that host transmission infrastructure and other part of our transition i look forward to have that conversation with she in the come minute 
 my constituent lee haywood be on a communal heat network and he and his neighbour see their price per kwh double last winter what protection can the minister give as we come into the next winter as resident in dalmarnock be really worried that price will again soar in this unregulated area 
 we have put in place protection to ensure that price be not go to go up we have the energy price guarantee in addition let i point out that price be come down 
 do the government think the uk be on track to meet the net target do the government think the uk will meet that target do the government even really care 
 we have of course meet all our carbon budget to date in the progress report the climate change committee say it have increase confidence in our meeting carbon budget and yes this country will meet its net target by it will do so in line with the advice that we be give and i be proud of the fact the hon gentleman could share this with his constituent who may be concern otherwise that this country have cut its emission by more than any other major economy on earth thank to the policy of this government 
 this morning i receive a text from of the leadership team at of our local hospice it say that 
 there have be no additional support for our energy cost cost have go up while statutory support have not change hospices uk lobby for additional support to no avail we operate and have to keep the heating on you know what the weather be like in cumbria in the winter 
 when will the minister come up with a bespoke support scheme for our vital hospice 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the meeting we have have and i be mindful of the situation that hospice face we have give support and i will make sure that i keep monitor the situation 
 on a point of order mr speaker in the exchange about the amendment on flare just now i do not think i hear the minister formally withdraw his accusation that i get my fact wrong and i certainly do not hear he apologise give that he have now accept that he get his fact wrong and my fact be right i would love he to formally correct the record and perhaps even to apologise as well 
 rise 
 the minister be desperate to do so 
 far to that point of order mr speaker the hon lady be quite right to raise this in that way and i be happy both to withdraw that and to apologise to she for get my fact wrong on that occasion 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make a statement on the number of school affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and the impact of build closure on child ’s learning 
 as i say in my statement to the house on   september this government be support affect school and college to minimise disruption to education i thank headteacher staff local authority and trust who continue to provide face to face education to their pupil 
 week ago we publish a list of education setting with building affect by raac before i provide an update i want to reiterate that our view be that parent and child should find out from their school not from a list on a government website or from the medium our approach have always prioritise that give school and college the space to focus on what be important minimise disruption to education 
 none the less we recognise the public interest on   september   we publish a list of education setting know to be affect by raac thank to the hard work of school and college leader all of those setting be now offer face to face education with setting offer full time face to face education to all pupil we have today publish an update list include a further setting with confirm raac of the confirm case setting be provide full time face to face education to all pupil 
 as i have say before we will do everything in our power to support school and college in respond to raac in their building every school or college with confirm raac be assign a dedicated support from our team of caseworker a bespoke plan be put in place to ensure they receive the support that suit their circumstance project delivery team be on site to provide support whether that be order or find alternative accommodation option or put in place structural solution 
 we will fund these mitigation include instal alternative classroom space where school and college make reasonable request for additional help with revenue cost such as transport to location those will be approve we will also fund long term refurbishment or rebuilding project to permanently remove raac through capital grant or rebuilding project through the school rebuilding programme 
 i want to reassure pupil parent and staff that this government will do whatever it take to support our school and college to keep everybody safe to respond to raac and to minimise disruption to education 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker 
 before i go any far let i emphasise that the safety of child should rightly be the priority of every member of this house however the question today be not simply about whether that should be our priority but about the colossal shamble of a secretary of state who as we learn from the education committee this   morning do not merely sit on new advice about the safety of school building which she receive on   august but do nothing for day and then she act decisively she go on holiday for the good part of a week some day pass from the day she receive the crucial advice to the day the headteacher be tell to close their school cause chaos for parent 
 just a fortnight ago the secretary of state ’s response to question about the management of the department ’s own building be simple and proud the motto she have make she own 
 nothing to do with i 
 she have do a good job while other have be sit on their backside do the secretary of state still think that be good enough more simply even under this prime minister weak as he be and this government how on earth do she think she could get away with go on holiday rather than take any form of action at all will she at last take responsibility for year of failure week of chaos and the year stretch ahead of the child who be sit under steel girder when will all our child be back in their own school and classroom parent family staff and above all our child deserve answer and they deserve well from this government and well than this secretary of state 
 i thank the hon lady for her question as soon as we have information we take a decision in every case when we see the incident in we take a decision and we put out new guidance and warning we put out new guidance in we start survey directly in when the previous secretary of state start to get more concerned about raac in our school estate we then send in surveyor directly because the responsible body be not move quickly enough 
 let i turn now to the initial advice new case emerge over the summer and some be subject to advice as the hon lady say which come on   august i instruct those involve to get more technical information the last case be really what tip we into make a decision it be a very difficult decision i be not sure the hon lady would have make it because labour do not tend to make these difficult decision and the labour government in wales have still not do so because of the impact on child and because of the impact on our school leader and teacher the last case which be in another school setting in england take place on   august we go to investigate that to see what have happen 
 on my own decision i go abroad because that be the time that i could go abroad i go abroad for my father ’s birthday know that i would still be chair the meeting which i do on saturday sunday and monday and then i make the decision as we have now make a decision to come back from holiday immediately my return be delay by day because of the air traffic control incident so i get back to announce the decision on thursday 
 when i look at the new case i say that we need to get technical evidence the thing i say be that we need to operationalise this i know that this would be difficult i do not want to put school in a position where if i put out a notice via the medium or directly they would be leave with the problem i want   to stand up caseworker i want to stand up portacabin i want to speak to utility company to make sure that everything would be in place so that we could minimise the length of time that it take to put up those portacabin i want to put more structural engineering company in place because i know that we would do more survey i also want to make sure that we have a nationwide prop company so that we could put the largely horizontal structural solution in place to fix everything 
 when we have to make a major decision there be no point create more issue than we need to we need to operationalise that decision which be what i decide to do the time from the last case to the announcement be week that be probably of the quick decision that most people have make in this house and we operationalise it all while i be still work as i always do 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 i be grateful to the minister with responsibility for the school system and the permanent secretary for spend hour this morning with the education committee on this issue they be able to provide a number of useful answer include on the provision of temporary classroom 
 i have to say that i be very disappointed last night to receive what be a non answer on that question about temporary classroom which have already be ask at the public accounts committee i be glad that baroness barran be able to go far with the select committee today the information that she provide we with be that there be case from before the summer require temporary building the department be now aware of school that will require some form of temporary accommodation have that temporary accommodation in place as of friday there be the potential for as many as single classroom and double classroom to be need as temporary accommodation 
 i urge the secretary of state to ensure that those be provide as swiftly as possible and that school and responsible body have certainty about when those will be in place so that we absolutely do what she say to minimise disruption of child ’s education a key concern of the select committee be child not in school and anything that can be do to minimise that disruption to create great certainty for the teacher and the leader who have do such an amazing job of respond to this will certainly be welcome 
 i thank my hon friend the chair of the education committee i apologise about the write answer the previous night we have more recent information at the education committee the case be always be assess and the number be always be update which be why we choose a date to publish the late information the number be move very quickly he be absolutely right raac school already have temporary building that be instal or in use there be a further site i think that have make inquiry and request potential order as he rightly say there be single classroom double classroom plus a mixture of toilet provision 
 on the portacabin i would just like to say that i have be to a number of these school and meet the child at the school i visit the child be all petition i to stay in the portacabin because they actually prefer they to the classroom the portacabin be very high quality—[interruption that be true i advise the shadow secretary of state to visit some of they herself 
 perhaps the secretary of state could clarify whether it be or school that still need temporary classroom because we have hear different figure from she and from her ministerial colleague at the education committee early something headteacher have say to i be that they do not just need the temporary classroom but they need some of they kitte out as science lab or design and technology classroom for example there be a cost to do that it be not just a question of chair and table it be much more what be her department do to make sure that child have the right classroom so they can do their assessment which be already tick along towards next year ’s exam 
 i confirm that the project director and caseworker have make inquiry request potential order for a further site there be some specialist requirement for science lab or other specialist equipment and there be a number of thing take place on that school be share science lab equipment in the short term either with another school or with another part of the school we be also look at mitigation in the school i go to see where the child be very happy in their portacabin they have horizontally prop and mitigate the science lab so they be able to use the science lab in combination with the portacabin there be also specialist portacabin available which be be look at in specific circumstance
