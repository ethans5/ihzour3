i have listen carefully to concern raise about the single justice procedure as a step i have ask the courts and tribunals service to redesign the sjp and make it clear i will also call in sjp prosecutor to discuss way in which we can ensure that they consider the public interest in advance of make prosecution 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to reduce the backlog of crown court case 
 what step she be take to reduce the backlog of crown court case 
 what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog 
 we be fund crown court sit day this financial year—500 day more than the previous government originally agree to reduce the number of case that end up at the crown court we be also extend magistrate sentence power to up to month for an individual offence 
 it be important that victim of crime have the swift access to justice that they deserve so i welcome the extra funding from this government that will lead to more than sitting day in crown court this financial year that include nearly in the crown court in kent do the minister agree that deal with the court backlog leave by the conservatives be essential to make sure that offender be quickly bring to justice and faith be restore in the criminal justice system 
 i agree this government inherit a record and rise crown court backlog we walk into a criminal justice system on the brink of collapse with our prison overflow and our court buckle under the weight of demand while we can not fix this mess overnight we will do everything we can to ensure swift justice for victim and to restore faith in the entire system 
 i be sure the minister will acknowledge that the crown court backlog be cause by a combination of covid and strike action by barrister will she outline    the step she will be take to continue nightingale court sitting and to improve the quality and number of crown court judge sit and able to hear case 
 we be currently operate nightingale court in different location and we continue to recruit to the judiciary the conservatives can not wash their hand of responsibility for the crown court   backlog it be rise before covid they close more than court building they express concern now but there be scant evidence of that in the year they be in power 
 last week it be report that the crown court backlog be case which could hit unless radical action be take some case have not proceed at all because of delay include those involve victim of serious offence such as rape reinforce that justice delay be justice deny i welcome the chancellor ’s budget confirm the significant financial investment in prison expansion and the ministry of justice funding settlement which will increase crown court sitting day do the minister believe that the measure will be sufficient to reduce the crown court backlog to an acceptable level or do she envisage that further action will be necessary such as increase to criminal legal aid 
 legal aid be a vital part of the justice system and it underpin our plan to build a justice system that work fairly for all party the previous government leave the civil and criminal legal aid market in dire strait and face significant challenge we intend to publish our response shortly to the crime lower consultation which relate to the fee pay to duty solicitor in police station among other thing and we will follow up on that with our response to the law society ’s successful judicial review of the previous government ’s decision on criminal legal aid fee 
 the minister have reference magistrate court cheltenham magistrate court i regret to inform the house have backlog but also an inappropriate courthouse it be fail victim the accuse and justice of the peace and it be not accessible for disabled people the roof be leaky and it be generally consider to be in a shocking state of affair will the minister make a statement on whether there will be investment in magistrate courthouse to ensure that justice can be carry out at the local level 
 if the hon gentleman write to i with specific detail of the issue in his local magistrate court i will raise those with his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service we be successful in secure a £ increase in capital spending for the ministry of justice in last week ’s budget that will cover expenditure on prison and court 
 what step her department be take to support victim of rape and sexual violence through the criminal justice system 
 we be commit to support victim of those abhorrent crime and have dedicate £ to support service through the rape and sexual abuse support fund we have also announce our plan to introduce free independent legal advocate for the victim and survivor of adult rape and be commit to work with the judiciary to fast track rape case through the court 
 avon and somerset police who be responsible for uphold the rule of law in my constituency pioneer a new innovative way of investigate rape and sexual violence call project bluestone when roll out nationwide as operation soteria it lead to a increase in rape prosecution accord to home office datum while an increase in prosecution be very welcome it also mean that more victim include those in weston super mare be relive their harrowing ordeal when go through a trial will the minister outline how her department be work to provide support to the increase number of victim experience the incredibly difficult trial process 
 i thank my hon friend for that really important question he raise some serious point the ministry of justice fund over specialist support service for victim of rape and sexual offending as well as dedicated victim support through the witness service court personnel provide support during and after hearing and we have invest in trauma inform training to improve the victim experience throughout court 
 rape and serious sexual offence victim can also request transcript of sentencing remark for free during a year pilot i encourage all those who be eligible please to apply to the pilot 
 will the hon lady please confirm the number of criminal convict of rape sexual abuse domestic abuse and domestic violence who be now back on our street as a result of her department ’s early release scheme 
 as the hon lady will know the government take step to exclude the most serious domestic abuse offender from sds40 an exemption that be not make under the previous government ’s end of custody supervise licence scheme that be because we know that we need to protect woman and girl and we have a landmark mission to protect woman and girl from violence all the datum on release will be publish as usual the lord chancellor have make that clear but we know that we need to do more 
 we welcome the new shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker i belatedly congratulate the government front bench team on their appointment i have be a little busy over the summer the only group the labour government ’s popularity have increase during that time with be criminal how many domestic abuser and sex offender release under their early release scheme have go on to reoffend would the minister like to apologise to the victim 
 well i be go to congratulate the right hon gentleman on his new role but he seem to have a very short memory it be he who should be apologise to the country as a whole on behalf of   his government for their woeful abuse of our justice system and our prison under the previous government ’s ecsl scheme there be exemption to protect the public this government put in serious exemption to prevent sex offender and serious violent criminal from be release on to our street maybe he should have a bit of humility 
 there be exemption in the previous government ’s scheme but the key thing be that we need to get on and build more prison prison work and we need to see more prison be build the last conservative government build more prison place than any prior labour government in live memory but we clearly need to go far what funding have the lord chancellor secure to build prison over and above those secure by the previous government do the minister agree with the other junior minister that few people should be send to prison 
 again the right hon gentleman forget who be in power for the last year and who fail to build any prison place just extra prison place be build under his government ’s watch the government have allocate a record £ for prison building in the budget and we will be go far we be the party of law and order he need to look at his record 
 whether she plan to widen the scope of case cover by legal aid 
 legal aid be a vital part of the justice system it underpin our plan to build a justice system that work for victim support access to justice and uphold the rule of law we be look carefully at the evidence gather as part of the review of civil legal aid which cover issue such as demand fee level and the geographic provision of service 
 cut to legal aid and the narrowing of its scope by the conservatives have mean that many people be no long able to resolve their problem through access to early legal advice that have result in legal representation be available only to those who can afford it will the minister consider look into restore legal aid to the level it be before the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act for all area of civil law to ensure that justice be make available to all people who can afford it will she commit to review the bureaucracy of the legal aid agency which do not support the need and capacity of small firm 
 my hon friend have significant experience of work in the legal aid sector and she be right to highlight the importance of good quality legal advice to resolve a whole range of social welfare problem we be look at how to improve access to   early legal advice and support but she will appreciate the challenging financial outlook that we be grapple with i will raise the administrative issue in relation to the legal aid agency with its chief executive 
 every week i have people come to my office who be victim and have no access to money they deserve justice and the only way they can get it be with legal aid what discussion have the minister have with the policing and justice minister in northern ireland to ensure that legal aid available here can also be available in northern ireland 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question i have yet to have those conversation with my counterpart in northern ireland but i hope to do so in the come month 
 what step her department be take to support prison officer 
 by immediately reduce prison overcrowding we have make prison safe to work in we have also accept the pay award recommend for prison officer in full 
 i have be make aware of the consequence of year of neglect of our prison and probation service by the conservative party the critical overcrowding due to the lack of investment staff at all level feel exhausted scared demotivate disenfranchised and undervalued officer face unacceptably high level of violence and drug abuse and bully between prisoner what be the department do to rectify the consequence of this litany of neglect by the so call party of law and order to give our prison officer the support they deserve 
 my hon friend tell it how it be the conservative party leave our prison and probation service in a mess our job on behalf of the british people be to clean up that mess that be what we be do 
 hmp featherstone hmp oakwood and hmp brinsford also a young offender institution in my constituency be brilliantly support by amazing staff but of the pressure on they be the number of foreign national offender in those prison what step be the minister take to ensure that those foreign national offender be return to where they come from 
 we be already on track to remove more foreign national offender than the conservative party ever do 
 what step her department be take to improve the single justice procedure 
 i have listen carefully to concern raise about the single justice procedure as a step i have ask the courts and tribunals service to redesign the sjp notice and make it clear i will also call in sjp prosecutor to discuss way in which we can ensure that they consider the public interest in advance of make prosecution 
 early this year a decision by the chief magistrate overturn the use of sjp for rail fine potentially nullify and require the refunding of as many as fine in the past few day it have be report that lner have bring similar prosecution under sjp without supply any evidence at all i make no assumption about the guilt or innocence of anyone involve in those prosecution but justice must be open clear and fair it be unfair to expect people to engage with a process without it be clear what evidence have be lay against they will the minister confirm that her department will keep those principle at the heart of all our justice practice include sjps 
 i will raise the evidential question that my hon friend raise with representative of the train operating company when they and other sjp prosecutor join i in discussion in the next few week i be clear that the single justice procedure be vital for the efficient run of the magistrate court however it must operate fairly and effectively i will not tolerate poor practice and i will not hesitate to fundamentally reform the system if that be require 
 what step her department be take to support young offender 
 the young future programme will be a prevention approach to crime reduction build on the department ’s successful turnaround programme i be very pleased to visit the secure school which will put education at its heart ensure child in custody turn their life around 
 over the past decade the quality and quantity of education in young offender institution have decline as report by sir martin oliver his majesty ’s chief inspector of education child ’s service and skill and charlie taylor his majesty ’s chief inspector of prison these institution be face difficulty in manage challenging behaviour lead to an increase in child be put into isolation child in these institution deserve a high quality education that help they to turn their life around the current system be fail they badly will the minister outline what action the government can take to ensure that young offender receive a high quality education 
 order we be in danger of not get anybody else in these be become statement rather than question i be sure the minister have grasp it 
 thank you mr speaker we know there be more to be do as my hon friend   outline keep apart list make it difficult for child to access education in young offender institution so we need to find different and well way of reduce violence and deliver education in these setting 
 during the year that i be a member of the scottish parliament of the most instructive and rewarding part of my role be my occasional visit with other msp to hmp porterfield in inverness do the minister agree that encourage mp to do the same would do a very great deal not just for young offender but offender of all age 
 i commend the hon member for his action he be right that visit to local prison or prison elsewhere be a good thing to do i have recently visit humber wakefield and new hall prison and will be visit wetherby young offender institution tomorrow 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 be the minister worried about the increase criminalisation of young people i notice that the ministry of justice publish statistic last week that say in people of work age in the uk have criminal conviction should we not look at the current disclosure framework so that people with criminal record for minor offence from year ago be not prevent from find work move on and contribute to society 
 my hon friend the chair of the justice committee identify a subject that might well be useful for his committee to examine 
 a young person i know be involve in an incident at can the minister assure i that because delay to go through the youth justice system have mean that that young person have not have the case adjudicate that young person will not be adjudge an adult if they pass their birthday when a conclusion be reach 
 the hon member draw attention to an issue if she would like to write to i about that particular incident i will write back to she 
 what step she be take to ensure that the register of judgment order and fine in england and wales be an effective tool for financially vulnerable claimant and debtor 
 the register play an important role in help lender assess credit worthiness and enhance financial transparency these objective seek to support vulnerable debtor by encourage and enable responsible borrowing a consultation on include claimant datum on the register close recently response to it be very positive and i hope to announce a way forward imminently 
 i be pleased to hear the minister be move forward with the next step follow the   consultation i would far like to congratulate the minister on move swiftly on this matter especially as the consultation have be stall since january i hope that with care and attention datum protection for claimant will soon be able to be include in the register will the minister also consider other update to the register such as record partial settlement and shift the burden of proof on debt satisfaction that would really help my constituent in swindon 
 my hon friend raise some interesting point and as he be i be always very keen to help people in swindon our focus be on respond to the consultation on include claimant datum on the register which would improve financial inclusion by help people to resolve judgment debt once our response have be publish and any reform regard claimant datum be implement we will consider any wide reform 
 what step she be take to support survivor of domestic abuse and violence against woman through the criminal justice system 
 what step she be take to support survivor of domestic abuse and violence against woman through the criminal justice system 
 we be commit to support victim and survivor of these abhorrent crime include through the £ rape and sexual abuse support fund and the funding of independent domestic and sexual violence advocate furthermore we will increase the power of the victim commissioner to improve accountability when victim need be not meet 
 many of my constituent include member of our local soroptomist international group will be take part in the united nations day of activism against gender base violence which include digital violence what step be be take in the prison system to rehabilitate individual whose criminal behaviour be the result of be radicalise online and will digital citizenship education play a part in their rehabilitation 
 i thank the hon lady for that really important question and i urge everyone in the house to get involve in the day of activism this year ’s theme be it start with i which i think be a lesson that we should all take on board the prison service assess the impact of online influence and   the need for rehabilitation for convict terrorist in the year after their sentencing but digital citizenship education form just part of that rehabilitation once we get our prison population under suitable   control follow what happen under the previous government we will be able to do more of this   important work offender convict of violence   against woman and girl be also eligible for accredited programme although that will depend on their assess risk and need 
 the scottish government recently decide against include misogyny in their hate crime and public order scotland act but we know how pernicious and widespread misogyny be especially in the context of domestic abuse just of all offence be report and there be even low rate for rape and sexual assault conviction be the lord chancellor plan to review aggravated offence and misogyny in particular to ensure that woman and girl get the protection that we deserve 
 as the hon lady will know this government be elect with a landmark mission to halve violence against woman and girl over the course of a decade every single department include the department for education will look at how we tackle misogyny in our school street home and workplace online and indeed everywhere the opposition have just elect a leader who have make rape joke previously but this be about leadership and take thing seriously and that be exactly what this government and i be do i urge the hon lady to write to the home office about the specific point that she have make 
 as a survivor of domestic abuse indeed have endure the experience of my ex husband stand against i in the recent general election i have personal and direct experience of the systemic bias against we do the minister agree that we need a comprehensive approach that provide support and consideration at every stage of the criminal justice system do she agree that that require funding not least for specialist support service and do she agree that we need to address the legal aid crisis as well 
 i thank my hon friend for her bravery and for speak out about her experience as a victim survivor which have undoubtedly help countless other she be right that this will take every single department across government look into how we stamp out violence against woman and girl in our community and society she be also right about funding we be currently look through the funding we receive at the budget and in due course i will be able to outline how we will support service if she would like i to meet she to discuss this far i shall be happy to do so 
 under the last government only of report rape case make it to trial because woman do not feel safe about report rape or do not think they would be take seriously how be the government ensure that more brave woman who report their rape be see quickly and effectively in the court service and get the justice that they deserve 
 my hon friend have outline the stark reality of what rape victim and survivor face in our criminal justice system not only be far too few case get to court but of rape victim be pull out of the system which be why we be committed to introduce independent legal advocate for adult rape victim we will be work with the judiciary to fast track rasso case through our court and support victim survivor through every step of the criminal justice journey 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the new shadow justice secretary to his place as he have campaign to withdraw from the european convention on human right i be sure we can rely on he to champion international law for all of we across the world 
 i want to ask about domestic abuse for too long domestic abuser have be able to exploit a loophole in our legal system whereby the domestic abuse that they perpetrate be mask by the ambiguous conviction of common assault this have mean that under this government and the previous domestic abuser have qualify for early release scheme when i push the secretary of state on this issue the other day she admit that her measure to exclude domestic abuser from early release be 
 not of course fully comprehensive ”—[official report   october vol c. 
 the liberal democrats believe that thing need to go far will the minister meet i and domestic abuse charity to discuss some of our proposal for close the loophole so that victim and survivor get the justice they deserve 
 i thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for his question he will know that certain offence be exclude from the sds40 early release scheme not the offender this government put in strict protection to protect the public unlike the previous government who introduce an end of custody supervise licence scheme those who be release from sentence for common assault be flag for domestic abuse marker and they be give priority for electronic monitoring and risk assessment i meet the sector regularly to look at what else we can do we be learn lesson from sds40 but this government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to improve the enforcement of the code of practice for victim of crime in england and wales 
 we will implement the victims and prisoners act which lay a good foundation for ensure that victim know the right they should receive under the code and that agency be hold accountable for deliver they we will consult on the revise victim code early next year and we will go far by increase the victim commissioner ’s power so that there be more accountability for deliver the code 
 my constituent dr marie gerval be a victim of stalk by a man with whom she have have a brief relationship he even put a tracker on her car without her knowledge there be needless delay in her case and she feel that she be not take seriously so bad be the stress that her hair fall out later it transpire that the investigate officer on her case be himself convict of stalk a woman will the minister    meet i and dr gerval to discuss how the code of practice for victim can make sure that this do not happen to other woman like she 
 what dr marie gerval experience be totally abhorrent but sadly she be not alone in experience these crime the government be commit to treat stalk with the seriousness it deserve by enhance stalk protection order implement automatic suspension for officer under investigation for domestic abuse and sexual offence and introduce mandatory professional standard for individual officer the home office be also look at the police response to stalk as a part of our work to well protect victim of violence against woman and girl i encourage my hon friend to reach out to the home office minister responsible for safeguard my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips but i will happily meet she 
 what step her department be take to support victim of commercial sexual exploitation through the criminal justice system 
 the ministry of justice provide funding for vital victim support service to help victim recover from the impact of crime his majesty ’s prison and probation service have develop guidance to support and identify victim of modern slavery and human trafficking include those who have be sexually exploit 
 scottish organisation such as tara and routes out provide exemplary support to woman who be exploit through prostitution and sex trafficking however these organisation be face with an endless stream of woman in part because the law in scotland england and wales provide impunity to pimp website do the minister agree that the uk government should lead the way by outlaw pimp website and offer support not sanction to victim of commercial sexual exploitation 
 this government be lead the way with our mission to halve violence against woman and girl all woman and girl the victims and prisoners act will require local commissioner to develop joint need assessment for victim of sexual abuse in order to identify and address the current gap and to support these woman 
 on outlaw pimp website specifically i would encourage my hon friend to speak to the minister for safeguarding but as i have previously mention this government be work holistically across all government departments include the department for science innovation and technology and the home office to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take to help reduce reoffende 
 what step her department be take to help reduce reoffende 
 good reduce reoffende activity can not happen in overcrowded prison which be why we take immediate action to relieve the pressure this will allow for well access to purposeful activity which we all know reduce reoffende 
 it be a former prisons minister who identify that short custodial sentence have a high reoffending rate than sentence serve outside prison do the minister agree that we need to look at use technology to curtail offender freedom outside prison and ensure that we cut the cycle of crime 
 yes electronic monitoring be already an important part of safely manage offender in the community and of the principle of the sentencing review be to look at the punishment that offender receive outside prison consider how we can well use electronic monitoring and other technology to safely manage offender outside the prison wall 
 as a former member of a youth justice board i know that young people who be draw into offend often lead narrow life with little opportunity for personal development have the minister make an assessment of the provision of youth service such as the duke of edinburgh ’s award scheme to engage with these young people and prevent reoffende 
 we value youth service such as the duke of edinburgh ’s award scheme that enable young people to develop new skill to turn their life around in fact the d of e scheme be available in all of our young offender institution and people in yoi be enrol in the scheme in august 
 last week i meet former prisoner who have take part in greene king ’s release potential scheme which be now be expand with further training kitchen go into prison to help people turn their life around what be the government do to boost such programme and the employment advisory board that we set up to ensure that while prisoner be rightly punish they be also rehabilitate 
 such scheme and initiative be exactly the sort of thing that this government want to celebrate as good practice and replicate in other setting 
 answer to my recent write parliamentary question have talk of the positive impact that relation with family can have on prisoner resettlement however in a number of case particularly those involve sexual violence the prisoner have no contact with the family and their release be usually a traumatic moment for those family and child that be why i welcome labour ’s manifesto pledge to introduce a national identification system for the child of prisoner as a   vitally important measure what be the government do to meet that pledge and break the offend cycle across generation 
 identify child with a parent in prison be important for ensure that they receive the support they need strengthen family tie remain an integral aspect of our work which be why our family support worker help to re establish appropriate family tie and facilitate visit from prisoner child my official be work closely with the department for education to determine how much more we can do in this space 
 what step her department be take to support incarcerate pregnant woman and mother 
 we be send too many woman to prison third of whom be non violent and over half of whom have dependent child and of the time the child leave home after the mother be incarcerate that be why we have launch the woman ’s justice board which will set out its strategy in the spring its goal be to reduce the number of woman in prison and ultimately the number of woman ’s prison 
 all welsh woman in prison be hold in england and be far from home add to the emotional torture of separation from child but we can not assess the extent of the separation without public access to wales specific disaggregate datum will the secretary of state commit to make this information public so that we can ensure that pregnant woman and mother and child have the proper support they need 
 the datum on how we track the experience of woman across england and wales will be work that the woman ’s justice board once it be up   and run will be able to look into and make recommendation on which we will pick up in the spring 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the early release scheme 
 the immediate purpose of the emergency release scheme be to stop we run out of prison place and to avert a total breakdown of law and order if we look at the prison population today it be clear that we have manage to avert the immediate crisis but this be only a short term measure we have also set out a long term plan to build the prison place that the last conservative government fail to build i have also launch a landmark sentencing review so that we be never force to look into emergency release again 
 in my mid dunbartonshire constituency the community justice team be have success in prevent reoffende by work with offender in a trauma inform    way it be recognise that short sentence as have already be mention do not prevent reoffende do the minister agree that the prevention of reoffende be central to reduce cost job loss family breakdown and homelessness 
 it be clear that we have to do well on reduce reoffende give that of offender be reoffender cut reoffende be a strategy for cut crime keep the public safe and help ex prisoner to turn their life around i be sure that the sentencing review will look carefully at short sentence 
 i call the shadow minister 
 want to see justice deliver more consistently for victim be the key reason i seek election to this place so it be an enormous privilege to take up this role today 
 in response to concern raise last month about offender who have be release early not be promptly tag the secretary of state assure the house that she will monitor performance daily can the government now provide concrete assurance to the house and the public that all offender be be tag as they should on release 
 i welcome the shadow minister to his place i have always enjoy his contribution to justice debate so i look forward to work with he where appropriate 
 after the department ’s daily monitoring indeed monitor many time a day i can confirm that the performance of serco on tagging have improve significantly as of   october of all tranche sds40 release visit to install tag have be complete with a small number of prearranged alternative fitting also schedule they be now all cover 
 of course tagging will protect the public only if curfew breach be address swiftly can the secretary of state tell we whether there have be any breach of tag monitor curfew on average how quickly be those who commit a breach bring back into custody 
 the hon gentleman ’s question be really about rate of recall which be what happen when licence condition be breach include breach of curfew recall rate for sds40 release be track similarly to recall rate for other offender we will publish those statistic once they have be assure in the usual way which i believe will be immediately after christmas 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of recent change to the early release scheme on the demand for housing provide by local authority 
 with this government ’s scheme unlike the previous government ’s rush scheme we   be give our excellent staff time to work with national and local housing partner to minimise any impact on local authority 
 give that secure housing on release have a prove positive impact on the recidivism rate of ex offender which be something we all welcome how many prisoner release early by this government be be house in hotel 
 few than 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of education and training provide to prisoner 
 we have reduce overcrowding to ensure that prison have the capacity to focus on education and training for example hmp highpoint ’s state of the art rail centre of excellence give prisoner industry standard training and guarantee employment on release 
 a couple of week ago i visit the bronzefield category a woman ’s prison in my spelthorne constituency i see that prisoner do work be reward with small amount of money but the weighting of their pay preferred people who take part in numeracy and literacy over skill such as work in the bicycle repair shop or the hair salon be that a national approach or be it something the governor have do pragmatically to fit his personal circumstance 
 it sound like an interesting approach i would be grateful if the hon gentleman write to i so that i can look into it and write back to he it be certainly the sort of thing we need to be look at 
 i join   the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden   in call for the government to consider the child of prisoner i meet the child ’s minister my hon friend   the member for lewisham east janet daby just last week and i know it be very much on her radar however this be an urgent issue this week i have be tell about a child who have be live alone for month because the authority simply do not know that their parent be in prison 
 order that be not relevant to the question minister would you like to respond no in which case we will leave it there 
 what step she be take through the criminal justice system to facilitate the removal of foreign national offender from the uk 
 how many foreign national offender be remove from the uk through a prison transfer agreement in each year since 
 i share the public ’s view that there be far too many foreign national offender in our prison since come into office we have return more than foreign offender and i be pleased to say we be on track to remove more foreign offender this year than at any time in recent year 
 some of the prison population in england and wales be foreign national offender so what specific action be the justice secretary take to remove fno from our prison and return they to their country include through the use of the prisoner transfer agreement that be put in place by the previous government 
 as i say we be on track to remove more foreign offender this year than in previous year in fact over the period when the shadow justice secretary be the immigration minister in the previous government the number return be around we have already return more than foreign offender utilise all the prisoner transfer agreement at our disposal we be actively try to negotiate more such agreement so that we can continue to speed up removal from this country 
 the previous government negotiate a scheme by which we can deport albanian prisoner back to albania it be an excellent scheme albania be a completely safe country of course give that those cross the channel be commit an illegal offence be there anything legally to stop we arrest they and put they on a flight straight to albania we do not even need to lock they up in albania they can just start their journey all over again what a good deterrent 
 as the right hon gentleman well know we have legal obligation to those who arrive in this country that have to play out however pta relate to those who have commit an offence have be convict and be be hold in the prison estate they can therefore be remove from this country under a prisoner transfer agreement we be work with the albanians to ensure that the pta with albania be as effective as possible 
 will my right hon friend consider a stand alone deportation order as part of the sentencing review so that rather than taxpayer have to pay to imprison foreign offender for year on end those offender be deport back to their country of origin 
 personally i be of the view that deportation for somebody who have be convict and be due to be imprison in our country be as good a punishment as serve time in a prison in this country we be look actively at what more we can do to make the early removal scheme as effective as possible include potential option to bring forward the point of early removal from this country i will be work with colleague in the home office as we develop our plan in this area 
 of my constituent 
 order this be the topical question 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i think member from all party need a reminder about the form in this house for oral question mr speaker 
 since the last justice question i have launch an independent review of sentencing it will ensure that there be always space for dangerous offender in our prison and that we expand the use of punishment outside prison so that no government be ever force to release prisoner early again the government have also introduce their budget and we have see an additional £ of funding for the ministry of justice 
 i note the arrival of the new shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick while rumour have it that this job be not his choice and he may have be ask to do it on more than occasion by his new boss i warmly welcome he to his new position 
 of my constituent have be attend court to resolve a matter around divorce and periodical payment since although she have achieve positive result at all the court hearing with many court order sadly there have always be error and incompetence in the system will the minister meet i to discuss these matter so that i can get a final resolution after almost a decade for my constituent 
 i be shocked to hear about the extent of the delay in the case of the right hon gentleman ’s constituent he be welcome to write to i with the specific detail and i will ensure he get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 early this year it be report that over case at ipswich crown court be outstanding at the last count each case be take an average of day to be deal with with case unresolved for year or more what can the minister do to reassure my constituent as we look to clear the terrible backlog leave by the previous government 
 the government have make it clear that we be fully commit to bear down on the crown court caseload to relieve pressure on ipswich crown court in particular the south east region have begin send appropriate case to cambridge crown court for hear nationally we have increase the number of crown court sit day to which be more than agree by the previous lord chancellor 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 police firearm officer sergeant blake be a hero and we all want to see individual like he who put themselves in the line of fire respect what work be the lord chancellor do alongside the home secretary to review the threshold   for prosecution for individual such as sergeant blake so that they never find themselves in the invidious position that he do 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his question he will be aware that charge decision be a matter for the independent crown prosecution service what the home secretary have announce and what i have be work with she on be the introduction of a presumption of anonymity for all firearm officer if they find themselves be charge by the cps we believe that such a measure could have make a difference in this case the home secretary have also announce measure that result from the police accountability review work undertake by the previous government and we be take those forward

 a lady from northampton be recently give a month sentence for a tweet whereas an individual who incite physical violence on the street of birmingham as part of a pro palestinian protest receive a far less sentence do the secretary of state agree that such inconsistency create the perception at least that we have a tier justice system 
 it be incumbent on member to ensure that such a perception do not take hold and not to inappropriately compare sentence hand out in different type of case as the hon gentleman well know and   every member of this house should know sentence in individual case be a matter for the independent judge who hear those case the trial unfold in front of they

 early this year i speak with the now minister for safeguarding and violence against woman and girl   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips about my campaign to make court transcript free she be supportive but be not sure that labour could commit to spend the £ that it would cost the justice committee have urge the court to consider whether artificial intelligence power transcription could reduce the cost of produce court transcript will the minister commit to carry out the committee ’s recommendation before the end of this parliamentary session 
 i understand why the hon lady raise that issue but transcript must be accurate they be legal document so good enough simply do not cut it i will review what technology be available and i be happy to keep she update 
 a report from may show that only of the prison education institution inspect be judge good or outstanding by ofsted additionally less than of prisoner take course up to gcse level do my hon friend agree that if we be to tackle rehabilitation we must improve prison education across the estate 
 my hon friend be right the quality of prison education must continually improve if we be to achieve the good possible rehabilitation outcome 
 will the secretary of state make available perhaps through a note in the library the number and type of foreign national offender who aid by delude interest group and dodgy lawyer be resist deportation by mean of appeal either to domestic court or to european foreign judge 
 i can assure the right hon gentleman that all the datum that be publish under the previous government will continue to be publish by our 
 as my hon friend   the member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed   point out legal aid be currently restrict to those on the low income i have receive correspondence from a constituent who despite be a domestic abuse survivor can not access legal aid because her income be above the threshold will the minister consider widen legal aid eligibility to all victim of domestic violence 
 some case be eligible for legal aid under exceptional case funding if my hon friend write to i with the detail of the case i will come back to he with any advice that i can offer 
 as ministers be doubtless aware domestic abuse include financial abuse and coercive control i have a constituent whose ex partner be use the family court to perpetrate his controlling and abusive behaviour against she what can be do to prevent the legal system from be use as a vehicle for extend domestic abuse by former partner 
 the hon lady be right sadly family court be far too often use to re traumatise victim of domestic abuse the government be alive to that fact and we be roll out our pathfinder pilot to focus on a more child centre approach i be meet survive economic abuse this afternoon we have a great relationship with that organisation to see how good we can do more and support victim 
 i wonder if ministers be as astounded as i be that conservative members be still attack we as the shadow justice secretary do at the start of this question time for clear up their mess in the criminal justice system will the government commit to increase capacity in our prison system so that we can deal with the crisis that the conservatives run away from 
 the shadow secretary of state have not necessarily be in position long enough to have acquaint himself with all aspect of his government ’s performance in this area we will spend more this year on build the prison place that the last government fail to deliver and we have launch our landmark sentencing review to ensure that we never again have to make emergency release 
 hmp garth have be liken to an airport because of the number of drone that illegally fly drug into that prison what urgent action be the lord chancellor take to end that unacceptable situation 
 drug get into prison be a huge issue and i be very aware of the issue at garth the minister with responsibility for prison will meet the governor and think about how to deal with those problem in the medium and long term 
 there be welcome news for the ministry of justice in the budget last week but i do not hear any mention of legal aid funding when will the criminal legal aid advisory board recommendation and the civil legal aid review be publish and when can we expect to see some reversal of the catastrophic cut make to legal aid and advice since 
 we will publish our response to the crime lower consultation in a matter of week i anticipate be able to publish the claab report at that stage and some of the document relate to the review of civil legal aid before the end of this year 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if she will make a statement on the ongoing connectivity issue cause by belatedly announce cancellation of flight such as those between belfast and london 
 i thank the hon gentleman for an opportunity to talk about these important issue it be unusual that we be do so in an urgent question not in an adjournment debate which be the debate in which he normally intervene 
 i have go soft 
 i know that the issue of connectivity across the uk be of great interest to the hon gentleman and many of his constituent as connectivity strengthen the bond between our community cancellation affect passenger and business who rely on punctual service and connection and have an impact on confidence it be the responsibility of airline and airport to work together to minimise delay and cancellation connectivity across our country be vital the government jointly fund public service obligation route to london include from derry londonderry 
 however the uk aviation market operate predominantly in the private sector and it be for airport to invest in their infrastructure and for airline to determine the route that they operate i recognise the importance of belfast city and belfast international airport for local community and business the department for transport be actively engage with regional airport include those in northern ireland to understand how the government can support and unlock opportunity for growth 
 i thank the minister for that answer northern ireland be an integral part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we would not have a united kingdom without she and member in this chamber would be a lot poor for the lack of northern ireland we be thankful to be a part of these british isle and have fight hard to remain so however be a part constitutionally and be a part practically be very different thing and the fact be that people need to take a plane or a boat to come across to the mainland passenger travel on schedule domestic flight in the uk between july and september and the and most popular route be between belfast and london we have a huge share of domestic route and the reason be clear people in these part of the united kingdom have such strong link and such a strong need to go between they 
 yesterday a cancellation text be send to passenger book on a flight from belfast city airport to london city airport the passenger on that flight be not simply frustrated businessman and woman they include a disabled person who have arrange special assistance a person on their way to a health appointment in london and a family get a connect flight to their holiday destination we understand that bad weather can affect flight pattern and sometimes these thing be unavoidable   but my understanding be that yesterday ’s flight be cancel back in september it be the flight that never be they take our money take our boarding pass and let we through security but the plane be not there it be quite unbelievable 
 the person go to the london hospital be book on a flight hour later completely miss their appointment for the business people their day be go the holidaymaker connection have fly those attend great ormond street child ’s hospital or other hospital miss appointment as do businessman and businesswoman the whole thing be unbelievable there be no announcement in belfast city airport although we be all wait for the flight that never was—100 people from across northern ireland 
 i could understand if this be an anomaly but it be fast become a norm that will affect business investment and tourism in northern ireland procedure need to be urgently review there be to be additional air passenger duty i hope that some of the additional money raise from people travel within the uk can be use to ensure that airline live up to their responsibility and maintain connectivity as a priority thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker and i thank the minister as well 
 the limit be normally minute i know you be make up for that flight yesterday and of course the house miss you that be why you get the uq 
 business and tourism be vital for growth as the hon gentleman say we do have some connectivity problem and cancellation due to storm ashley recently and i be sorry to hear about his constituent miss appointment particularly his disabled constituent the secretary of state will lead work in this space because accessibility on flight be vital belfast be still serve   by to flight a day and i suggest that the hon gentleman take the issue up with airline and the airport 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 last month flight between belfast city and heathrow be cancel and i can only imagine how difficult that must be for member from northern ireland and their constituent the previous transport committee in its aviation reform inquiry recommend that the government revise the public service obligation route and the subsidy to improve domestic air connectivity do the minister agree that that be important to connect northern ireland with the rest of the uk and will he bring forward work on that 
 i thank the chair of the transport committee for the excellent work that she do in this field cancellation be bad for business tourism and passenger the public service obligation arrangement come up for renewal regularly and i think that flight price connectivity and cancellation should be look at in the round when we come to renew they 
 flight cancellation be a significant issue that we take seriously in government and work across the sector to tackle i be proud that in government we publish the aviation passenger   charter which include clear advice on how passenger can resolve issue to do with cancel and delayed flight as well as miss baggage and the right of disabled passenger in we halve air passenger duty for domestic flight we also make a commitment to strengthen the power of the civil aviation authority do the minister intend to take that forward when in government we also publish flight path to the future which include a substantial framework for increase the efficiency of the aviation system and support passenger as we move far towards the goal of sustainable aviation what further step will the minister take to ensure that the measure that we set out to improve the aviation sector and the passenger experience be take forward 
 frankly this government have fail the public so far last week ’s budget be in large part an attack on worker business farmer and the aviation sector the government ’s decision to increase air passenger duty have lead to a worried response from the passenger aviation sector and ryanair have already announce its intention of cut flight to and from uk airport by the government have so far show themselves to be deeply uninterested in the consequence of their action for worker farmer and now air passenger more in hope than expectation i ask the minister what step will the government take to improve the relationship with the passenger aviation sector and ensure that passenger be well serve 
 i say with all candour to the hon gentleman that i remember that during covid i shadow this brief at the time there be no specific package for airline airport or airport handler that mean that we come out of covid in a much bad position than we would have if the government have implement their own treasury ’s proposal we will take no lecture about our support for aviation on his question about right for passenger we will look at strengthen those go forward apd go up by less than inflation it have not be increase in a number of year but i refer he to the treasury for more detailed answer on tax matter 
 i think we have finally figure out why the shadow secretary of state for northern ireland have not yet be able to make it to northern ireland 
 i thank the government and the northern ireland executive for their recent commitment to the city of derry airport the public service obligation on the heathrow route be very important for connectivity to the north west of ireland when the minister review the pso for the next tranche of funding we hope to get will he do some work with the airline to bring fare down they be out of reach for many people in the area 
 i thank the hon gentleman for all he do in this space i join he in encourage the shadow secretary of state to go to northern ireland which be a fine country the hon gentleman know that i visit regularly come through belfast and derry londonderry it be a great place to live visit work and do business on the specific point about price i think there be flight or more a week in summer from derry londonderry which be well connected i suggest that the hon member get involve with the airline and the airport owner but yes we can look at that when we come up to review the public sector obligation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 thank you very much mr speaker i can sympathise with   the hon member for strangford jim shannon and i thank he for table the urgent question because we consistently have the same problem at edinburgh and other scottish airport with a lack of connectivity and the disruption that that cause i understand that the weather be a key reason for the delay this weekend but another be delay at air traffic control which be under pressure because of staff shortage and rise traffic eurocontrol the main organisation support european airspace have warn that to keep passenger safe and stop disruption well co ordination be require between aircraft operator airport and other across the continent 
 will the minister tell i what conversation the secretary of state have have with european partner on build resilience in air traffic control do the government have confidence in the robustness of air traffic control in the uk to serve our connectivity properly 
 official engage regularly with their counterpart across europe and the european union the government have commit to airspace modernisation which will improve resilience i look forward to support from liberal democrat members in the near future as we progress towards modernise airspace right across our great nation and nation 
 i thank the minister for his response and for reiterate the importance of get regional air connection right as that can help to underpin economic growth i hope he agree that we should not allow ourselves to be distract do he agree that large part of our country could be well serve by well regional rail connection which would hopefully reduce some of the congestion at our airport 
 public transport penetration within an hour of an airport be vital and be a key performance indicator for how airport can grow and serve people well well rail well bus well road link and well active travel to our airport be critical for this industry 
 aberdeen airport be another that struggle with cancel flight over of flight be cancel last year which make it of the airport with the high cancellation rate in the country do the minister agree that we must make sure that all our region in the uk include scotland have a reliable connection especially to london for thing such as business travel link our rural community to urban centre be really important so what can his government do to make sure that those thing improve 
 i thank the hon member for stand up for her local airport in aberdeen as someone who recently catch a connect flight in manchester from newquay go on to aberdeen i can say that loganair provide an excellent service it be a great honour to visit aberdeen airport recently to see its helicopter base for north sea oil and its importance to the transition that we will begin with our clean energy mission i suggest that the hon member take that up with andy   the chief executive there and perhaps the new director of corporate affair gavin newlands the former mp for paisley 
 there be no public flight from north wales to london so we depend on train traveller on avanti west coast ’s north wales service endure chronic overcrowding reduce direct service to london since covid roll stock breakdown and on the day cancellation to time high than the rest of the avanti network that franchise run to what be the government do to make sure that avanti offer the people of north wales and their economy a decent 
 order come on that be not even link to flight it be about train interruption no let we not kid each other there be no point waste time let ’s have someone else who will ask the right question i call wendy morton 
 as   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   highlight reliable regional connectivity matter when the minister be look at public service obligation route will he consider also look at the transparency of the datum come out of those route at reliability and at penalty for failure it can not be right that somebody get the additional stress of a cancel flight when they be try to get to a hospital appointment 
 people should not be miss hospital appointment because of cancel plane in the aviation sector yes i agree with the right hon member it be a consider question and when contract come up for renewal we must consider they in the round to see how good they can serve the need of the travel public 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker which as have be outline be important to many of our constituent when we sit in the airport lounge and talk to people who have have flight delay we see their frustration i suspect however that you wish you have cancel this urgent question my hon friend   the member for strangford jim shannon   delay land it and take so long that i see you get increasingly uneasy as you be listen to he 
 increasingly we be find flight delay by company in particular british airways which have a monopoly on these flight there be an economic lesson to be learn which be that monopoly be abuse have only to look at the price charge on some occasion when someone could fly to australia cheap than they can fly to london with british airways sometimes ba give technical reason or weather reason for delay a flight but often it be because plane be not full and it amalgamate flight will the minister commit to investigate with ba why the belfast route be 
 order i think you be jim shannon in disguise come on minister 
 we be struggle to get the question land we have be taxi for a bit and now we be ready for take off 
 i do not want to pick on particular airline but i be discuss regional connectivity in the uk with airline ceo which i think be vital that be the point the right hon member make i point out gently that belfast international be a great airport to fly through and it be well serve not just by a single operator it have multiple operator serve multiple airport particularly in the south east 
 in his early answer the minister speak about growth and connectivity be important how do the £ increase the holiday tax being add to airport duty make a difference especially when ryanair have announce that it be go to cut seat that will have a dramatic impact on anyone want to travel within the uk and across europe what impact assessment will the government carry out to ensure connectivity 
 i remind the hon member that as a tax air passenger duty be a matter for his majesty ’s treasury in the budget we announce apd rate from to to account for the previous extraordinarily high inflation under the conservative party and to ensure that the aviation industry continue to contribute a fair share to the public finance 
 give the dissatisfaction we be hear about connectivity in northern ireland which be a critical part of the uk it seem to i that in the next review of the public service obligation the minister must commit to include belfast city airport and a review of the operator will he do so 
 that be a good question but i would do that automatically and i extend that to the other part of our great nation where the public service obligation apply let we not forget city of derry airport which be vital for the economy of the north west in that fantastic part of our nation 
 everyone understand that there be cancellation due to weather and other issue beyond the control of airline but will the minister meet the like of ba to ensure that it understand the need for reliability and for information to be give to customer as quickly and promptly as possible so that they can take step to make alternative arrangement if possible 
 i thank the hon member for his question i recently meet the chief executive of british airways and raise regional connectivity 
 do the minister agree that good transport link between the rest of the united kingdom and northern ireland be vital for business and tourism and that delay and cancellation look extremely bad in the eye of the public will he commit to contact ba to try to resolve these issue 
 i refer the hon member to my previous answer i have already raise regional connectivity with ba and other airline odhran dunne chief executive officer of visit derry have say there be a fantastic buzz around that airport at the moment and around what be   happen in the north west it be great to see the work go on with the northern ireland executive in support that airport which be a driver of the regional economy 
 what support will the government provide to northern ireland airport to ensure our continued and improved connectivity the previous government promise £ to belfast international airport in my constituency under round of the levelling up fund which would create job reduce air and noise pollution and improve the passenger experience will the minister provide an update on that 
 it be great that the northern ireland executive be up and run in the devolution settlement they will be get more money and it be a matter for they how they spend it on northern ireland and particularly belfast only this week easyjet the big airline operate out of there provide seat have introduce new route to prague and marrakech and new aircraft the future be bright for aviation in the province 
 what conclusion do the minister draw from the fact that dubious cancellation such as those we see yesterday be far more prevalent where there be a commercial monopoly on the route such as there be between belfast city and london city airport which be the route affect yesterday if he draw the conclusion that connectivity be not help by a monopoly what action do the government intend to take to encourage competition on such route 
 the hon and learn member state that case but there be a very open market in connectivity with a number of airline fly from northern ireland and belfast in particular to the south east and other uk destination i refer he to my previous answer when public service obligation come to be review we will look at the matter in the round rest assure that i be keen on connectivity between our great nation

 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the chief inspector of drinking water to issue guidance to water company on poly and perfluorinated alkyl substance in drinking water and for connected purpose 
 decrease fertility thyroid disease miscarriage reduce sperm quality cancer what do all those condition have in common they have all be link to the pervasive presence of pfas perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance well know as forever chemical pfas be use to make material heat water flame or stain resistant they be find in thousand of everyday product from teflon frying plan to raincoat to our toiletry their bond be of the strong in nature able to stay intact for decade in fact those chemical be so long lasting that scientist have not yet be able reliably to identify how long it might take to break they down because they be so difficult to break down once they get into our environment and our drinking water pfas can easily build up in our body they can enter our bloodstream and even be pass on to our child through breast milk that have severe implication for intergenerational health study have find that child expose to pfas build up be at increase risk of low birth weight weak bone and immune resistance to vaccination 
 pfas chemical be forever and they be everywhere these chemical be in the water we drink the clothe we wear the food we eat and even in the rain that fall from our sky pfas affect every single of we young and old pfas be all pervasive which make the scale of the challenge incredibly daunting but we must start somewhere and that be why i be call for the government to start with our drinking water despite all the alarming health risk i have just outline there be currently no statutory regulation of pfas chemical in england and wales and no legal limit on the amount of pfas present in our drinking water there be only guidance that water be wholesome and a limit of microgram for only out of the thousand of exist pfas chemical it be fair to say that the presence of carcinogenic non degradable forever chemical make our water far from wholesome and instead akin to a chemical cocktail that desperately need regulation 
 i should stress that these chemical be synthetic not natural before their manufacture start in the late 1940 no pfas be present in our environment it be an injustice to future generation that they should have to suffer the consequence of exposure to these chemical before they be even bear people may ask be pfas a threat to we here in the uk yes they be and i have only to look at my constituency to see it 
 the river thames be at the beat heart of our community where kayaker paddle boarder and swimmer enjoy the river every day yet the busy stretch of the river thames in teddington in my constituency have the great concentration of pfas in the uk between and it be time above the safe level set out by the eu whose standard i will come to later 
 the thames be a notoriously polluted river but concern about our local water quality increase follow proposal by thames water to construct the teddington direct river abstraction scheme which would pump treat effluent into our precious waterway it have be promise that the treat effluent would be the same quality as the river itself yet there have be no assurance that compound and chemical such as pfas would be filter out 
 when it come to raw sewage spill the marine conservation society note that there be no legal requirement for water company to monitor for pfas in sewer overflow a study conduct by the university of portsmouth find that follow sewage discharge in langstone harbour the amount of particular pfas perfluorobutanoic acid or pfba in seaweed be more than time high than in the surround water 
 can we therefore rely on mere guidance to make water company take step to filter out these dangerous pfas chemical from our water sadly i do not think so trust in water company be at an all time low thank to eye water bill the billion of litre of water lose through leak sky high bonus and illegal sewage dumping against that backdrop it be no surprise that people do not trust water company to safeguard our water quality it be my belief that these water company will only take step if we make they do so with bind limit set in law 
 exist guidance have fail to restrict the presence of pfas accord to the wildlife and countryside link not a single english river be in good chemical health analysis by the royal society of chemistry have reveal that more than a of watercourse in england and wales contain medium or high risk level of pfas and just more than a also contain highly toxic pfa that have be ban internationally however official monitoring datum cover only a handful of pfas chemical and not all river be test so actual pollution level could be even bad 
 although i welcome the new government ’s move to ban pfas chemical present in firefighting foam which be a significant source of pfas further action be need the previous government sit on their hand and ignore this emerge health threat but as we discover more and more health risk from pfas chemical every day it be clear that they must be regulate more tightly as a chemical group not as and when the threat be slowly identify we all deserve access to clean water that do not put our health at risk 
 this be not radical action as both the eu and us have take significant stride to tackle pfas pollution in recognition of the multitude of health concern link to the chemical the us have introduce a limit of nanogram per litre for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid or pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa while from january eu member state will have to ensure that the sum of all pfas in drinking water do not go above a limit of microgram per litre 
 sadly brexit have mean that in the and a half year since the uk leave the eu registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulation the eu system of regulate chemical our response to the grow threat of pfas have move at a snail ’s pace and we have fall behind other than internationally ban substance not a single restriction on a harmful substance have be adopt since the uk leave eu   reach in that be in part due to the uk no long have access to the world ’s most comprehensive chemical registration database hold by the european chemicals agency we must now go through duplicate process for regulatory decision making 
 there be a clear need for european alignment and i sincerely hope that the government will keep their manifesto promise to see that through it be also worth note that scotland adhere to eu guideline so it will be english and welsh citizen who be leave without the protection our neighbour enjoy which be a bizarre misalignment if we do not regulate pfas as a chemical group we risk equally toxic new pollutant replace the one we regulate we risk become a dumping ground for product with ban pfas we risk become the dirty man of europe 
 in the health and safety executive identify pfas chemical as a risk for consumer exposure and recommend legislation to limit the presence of these chemical in our drinking water sadly the previous government do nothing but my cross party bill provide a golden opportunity for the new government to act to stem the untold harm be unleash on our land water and people and to answer the call of the hundred of group and hundred of thousand of citizen who be demand action only last month of the world ’s lead scientist write to the government urge they to adopt a more ambitious approach to the regulation of pfas by regulate it as a group surely it be time to listen 
 finally i want to thank the organisation who have support i with this bill and have long champion the cause well before i become aware of it include the royal society of chemistry uk chem trust wildlife and countryside link and the marine conservation society they and many other be dedicate to ensure that we have a country where we can safely enjoy nature and preserve people ’s health for generation to come ultimately this be not only about we but about our child and our child ’s child there be no well legacy we can pass on to they than to safeguard their health as good we can this bill would be a significant step towards achieve that

 this budget be the moment we turn the page on year of tory neglect of our nhs when we begin to fix the foundation of our public finance and public service when we wipe the slate clean after year of stagnant growth and under investment and when we start to rebuild britain this government be elect to deliver change from economic chaos to stability from crumble school and hospital to class public service and from short term sticking plaster to a decade of national renewal 
 on wednesday the chancellor take the tough decision to set our country on a well path to a bright future labour ’s manifesto promise to protect the payslip of work people while ask the wealthy to pay more and the chancellor deliver we promise economic stability through new fiscal rule and the chancellor deliver we promise more teacher in our state school pay for by end tax break on private school and the chancellor deliver we promise to end the non dom tax status to fund extra nhs appointment a week and the chancellor deliver 
 our country our economy and our nhs be cry out for change and the chancellor deliver she do so against the backdrop of the most appalling inheritance face by any government since the world war and not just the £ black hole in the public finance let i set out for the house exactly what i be greet with in my department alone when i walk through the door on   july 
 the conservatives have tell the country that they be on track to build new hospital by the former health secretary tell the house that the funding have be provide put aside the fact that there be never actually new hospital plan i be inform in july not only that the programme be year behind schedule but that the funding be to run out in march the only place those hospital exist be in boris johnson ’s imagination 
 the conservatives promise to cap social care cost by october just month after the general election but there be not a single penny set aside to pay for it the cupboard be completely bare within week of the general election council be warn that it would be impossible to implement the cap by next october because the preparation have not be make those be fantasy pledge that the conservative never intend on keep 
 rise 
 i be happy to give way to the hon gentleman to tell we why 
 on the new hospital programme the government commit in the budget to move swiftly to rebuild reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete hospital the queen elizabeth hospital in king ’s lynn be keen to make progress with its plan will he meet i and the trust so that we can unlock the funding and get that hospital ready by 
 that be a commitment that we have make and a commitment that we will keep i be happy to ensure that the hon member can meet the relevant minister and project team as we get under way on deliver that project 
 i do actually go back to check the pledge make by the conservative party in its manifesto just to see how extensive the work of fiction be only to find that the manifesto page on its website now read page not find the truth be have the conservatives win the election it would have be delete just as quickly 
 that be not all i be tell when i become secretary of state in july despite month of strike in the nhs there be no funding put aside to end the junior doctor dispute what be more the previous health secretary have not meet the resident doctor since march the conservatives have give up even attempt to end the strike people should remember that this winter for all the challenge that the nhs will face this will be the winter in year when nhs staff will be on the frontline not the picket line that be the difference that a labour budget make 
 i be tell that gps would be qualify this year with no job to go into the government find the funding and we be hire an extra gps this year that be the difference that a labour budget make 
 on the budget gps hospice and care home have be find to be either exempt or not exempt from the national insurance contribution will he clarify whether hospice care home and primary care be exempt or not that really matter to their cost 
 i be grateful for that intervention for reason it give i an opportunity to say to gps hospice and other part of the health and care system that will be affect by employer national insurance contribution change that i be well aware of the pressure we have not make allocation for the year ahead and i will take those representation seriously 
 secondly it give i a chance to ask the hon member and the opposition do they support the investment or not be they choose to invest in the nhs or not they be now confront with the hard reality of opposition just as when we be in opposition we have to set out how much every single of our policy would cost and how those would be fund they have to do that now if they oppose the investment they have to tell we where they would make the cut in the nhs if they oppose the investment they have to tell we where they would make the cut in school budget those be the choice that we have make and we stand by those choice the opposition will have to set out their choice too
