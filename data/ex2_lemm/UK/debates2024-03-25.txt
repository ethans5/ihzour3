the question of whether our armed force be fit for purpose should centre on whether they can carry out the defence task set by the mod and i believe that they can if i may carry on in the same vein as the previous response do the minister agree that labour ’s failure to commit to spend more than of gdp on defence present a much big risk to uk security objectively than any matter of debate among member on this side of the house 
 the waspi website have a grim counter of affected woman ’s death and of money save by the treasury the current figure be plus woman and well over £ they be rise by the minute how far have the consequence of the government ’s disastrous mini budget affect their thinking on this matter if the secretary of state will not commit to full level compensation as the ombudsman recommend what do he have to offer linda gregory my constituency bear in she do the right thing as he say she do her sum get her forecast and be repeatedly assure by the dwp and hmrc that she have contribution to retire at in order to look after her ail mum before this surprise be spring on she which have so far cost she £ 
 before we come to question to the secretary of state for defence may i just say this to minister heappey you will be miss and i be sorry you be step down on a personal level i thank you for your private briefing to ensure that the house be keep inform you will be miss and i thank you for that service 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of publish all document relate to the bombing of rfa sir galahad 
 i recognise the substantial public and parliamentary interest in this matter consequently i recently visit the national archives at kew to view the rfa sir galahad file as a result we be look to release a further file subject to the ministry of defence ’s legal adviser confirm that individual right under the data protection act would not be contravene in relation to the file of witness statement i want maximum transparency subject to the public records act and ensure that personal datum be protect i shall provide a further update shortly 
 on saturday i attend the remembrance and reunion event for the survivor and family of those who be lose in the attack on the sir galahad i know that the minister know this and i thank he for his early response but it be deeply important that the remain document from the board of inquiry be release so that we can get to the truth of what happen on   june he have tell we what he might release but for those who have live with this for year can he tell we when we will have those decision 
 i pay tribute to the hon lady for the tenacity with which she have pursue this i have enjoy our meeting to discuss the matter and also the meeting with the welsh guards it be important that this be handle quickly we be move at pace to ensure that we can do so with of course the caveat that i have just describe 
 i know people who serve in the welsh guards at the time i be myself in the scots guards and a number who do not come back i congratulate   the hon member for newport east jessica morden   on her question my right hon friend say that he be move at pace but the key point be that it be now decade since this happen there be now no question but that some kind of cover up take place when he come to look at those document again can he please ensure that on the balance of judgment we err in favour of opening up so that for those who have die and those whose reputation have be trash we can stand up and say proudly that it be not they 
 the board of inquiry be quite clear about the attribution of blame and the welsh guards be absolutely exonerated and that be the government ’s position my position be always for transparency and certainly that have be at the forefront of my mind when i have be look at these document 
 i too be at the event that my hon friend   the member for newport east jessica morden   attend at the weekend i be there on behalf of my constituent colin silva many of those who do not come back be from the brave welsh guards i have also visit fitzroy and see the location for myself i be able to assure the people of the falkland islands of the united support from this house for their defence and security may i press the minister on the timing be we talk in term of week month or year because time be move on and we need these answer quickly 
 i will not be draw on precise time but it will not be year 
 my constituent oliver richardson now the mayor of deal be just when he survive the sinking of the galahad year on he say that there be no reason for this suppose secrecy and that many people neither be offer nor want confidentiality in relation to say what they have see our armed force serve we all and we must honour that service by give they and the family of those lose and injure on the galahad the answer they need i urge the minister to release all of the falklands galahad paper at pace 
 the government will do everything we can in the interest of transparency but i be sure that my hon friend appreciate that we like everybody else be bind by the data protection act 
 what step his department be take to help ensure stability in the indo pacific 
 the uk be commit to a free and open indo pacific and we be put our regional approach on a long term strategic footing i return this weekend from australia where we have be talk to our colleague there work hard on the indo pacific programme 
 stability in the indo pacific have be largely aid by the military base presence on diego garcia what assessment have the defence secretary make of the military base and the island of diego garcia remain under full british sovereignty so that we can help to counter the many threat of the modern world whether that be china iran or other 
 as i think my hon friend know i share the goal of ensure that the base on diego garcia remain permanently available for our use and for the united states it be strategically position it be absolutely vital and there be read across to our military facility elsewhere it remain safe in our hand 
 when assess our ability to influence the stability of that region or any other have the secretary of state conduct any kind of impact assessment of the reduction of our investment in international aid from of gdp or the fact that we have the small standing army in the united kingdom for year 
 the hon gentleman will recognise that i look after the defence budget rather than the overseas development budget but i think he will welcome the fact that because of the indo pacific tilt we have ship with a permanent presence there hms spey and hms tamar and the littoral response group south which operate in the indo pacific we have already send the carrier strike group previously it be go to the region again next year that be in addition to the global combat air programme generation programme and of course aukus for which i be in australia at the weekend i think we can all agree that we be do a lot more than ever before in the indo pacific 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as you do mr speaker i pay tribute to the armed forces minister at his last defence question since the last election we have have chancellors foreign secretaries prime ministers and defence secretary but only armed forces minister he have be a rare constant in the turmoil of government totally commit to defence we thank he for that and wish he well 
 on the indo pacific we welcome last week ’s update defence agreement with australia further progress on aukus and today ’s year plan for barrow to support aukus this be our most important strategic alliance beyond nato so why have the defence secretary give the leadership of key part of aukus to the most junior minister in his department 
 as i explain i have just be in australia talk about aukus i have previously be to japan i think at least twice but possibly time on aukus and to italy sorry not to italy obviously on aukus that be on gcap but with an indo pacific tilt i agree with the right hon gentleman ’s comment about the armed forces minister but i be interested to hear his comment on the indo pacific back in when the integrated review suggest a tilt to the indo pacific he call it a serious flaw in the programme and urge we not to defocus from elsewhere in the world 
 what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and their family 
 what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and their family with the cost of living 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and their family with the cost of living 
 with other government departments the ministry of defence deliver a range of service to our brilliant veteran and their family that include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation the provision of tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service defence transition service and the integrate personal commissioning for veteran 
 a new report from northumbria university find that suicide among serve personnel and veteran could be reduce if there be well understanding within exist care provision of the specific challenge that they face the report also find that military family feel unheard misunderstood and not care for during the most difficult period of their life so what step be the minister taking alongside our nhs to deliver compassionate trauma inform support for serve personnel and veteran 
 i be glad that the hon lady have raise that issue she will know that we have a defence suicide prevention strategy which be review regularly she will also know that overall suicide in the armed force be below what we might expect in the civilian population there be a sub group within that young man where it look as if the rate be go up we be look very closely at that to well understand the reason for it and how we can prevent it 
 my constituent join the army in and serve in the queen ’s lancashire regiment until during a wrongful operation he sever all the nerve in his foot he be now year old and suffer from several condition that leave he in excruciating pain every day he be on disability living allowance and then move to personal independence payment but month ago he be tell that he be no long eligible be that really the way to treat our veteran 
 i be very sorry to hear about the hon lady ’s constituent if she would like to write to i with the detail i will be more than happy to take up that case as i say in my opening remark we work with other departments and it sound as if this be not principally the responsibility of the mod but i would be more than happy to hear from she about her constituent 
 about a year ago my hon friend   the member for wrexham sarah atherton   undertake an important and groundbreaking piece of work on behalf of female veteran and woman in the armed force follow that i have the honour of help she to set up the all party parliamentary group on woman in defence which have give a platform to female veteran and service personnel as well as those who work in defence and the charitable sector to talk to member from across the house at every level we be very much look forward to the female veteran strategy can my right hon friend assure i that the government remain committed not just to equal treatment for woman in the armed force but to an equally positive experience for everyone who choose to serve 
 i can absolutely give my hon friend that assurance i pay tribute to he and to our hon friend   the member for wrexham sarah atherton   for all their hard work to improve the position of woman in our armed force woman be absolutely central to the way in which defence will be go in the year ahead as encapsulate in our target to have our armed force be female by a challenging and ambitious target i should mention our improvement to unform policy mentoring flexible service wrapround childcare and of course our tolerance for unacceptable sexual behaviour as example of thing we have do recently to improve the live experience of woman in our armed force 
 at the last census just over veteran be live in birmingham of whom be over the age of despite pledge to end veteran homelessness government figure show that it rise last year by and up to veteran household across the uk be make newly homeless each month can the minister tell i what he be do to ensure that veteran in birmingham and across the uk who make enormous sacrifice for our safety and security do not end up homeless 
 it be plainly not right that anybody should be without a home be they a veteran or not we be do everything in our power to ensure that people be set up well for civilian life as they transition out of the armed force the overwhelming majority of people who leave our armed force be in precisely that position by use measure such as the defence transition service for those who might have particular problem when they return to civilian life as all member of the armed force ultimately do we be ensure that we minimise the number of people who have serve in our armed force and be leave without a home 
 be the minister aware of the excellent work of the battle back centre in lilleshall in my constituency a successful collaboration between the royal british legion and sport england would he or perhaps the minister for veterans affair consider visit the centre soon give that it have treat more than serve and ex service personnel for all sort of injury the staff there be fabulous and superb and they deserve a visit 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for the invitation which i will most gladly take up i pay tribute to battle back which do a wonderful job and to he for his work support it 
 veteran roy sagar a familiar face to we all in morley recently pass away in his mid-90 he do so much for veteran and the royal british legion locally and be our parade marshal will my right hon friend join i in pay tribute to roy and all our unsung hero veteran for all they do and in send thought and prayer to roy ’s family 
 yes i very much do so our veteran be a wonderful part of our community and deserve all the support we can give they i also pay tribute to the royal british legion which be always there for our veteran when they need it i speak as president of my local branch the legion be a powerful institution i know you have have a lot to do with it mr speaker and an important part of what and who we be and i pay tribute to it as well as to my hon friend ’s late constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i appreciate the minister ’s early answer but when royal british legion industries say that veteran be homeless or in danger of become so be there a need for more urgent intervention or be the minister for veterans affair right to hail get off the street as a triumph 
 i think that get off the street be good it be certainly a start but person without a home be too many whether they be a civilian or a veteran the important thing be that we look at factor that might be peculiar to defence that predispose people to homelessness because we have a particular duty to those people in accordance with the military covenant in general as the hon gentleman and i both know people leave the armed force be much well place for the balance of their life in civilian life than their equivalent in civil society but that be not the case for everyone some people fall through the crack and we must ensure that they be scoop up and look after 
 what progress his department have make on improve the readiness of the armed force 
 mr speaker thank you very much indeed for your word at the beginning of question i also thank the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey you be both very kind indeed to say what you say 
 the uk armed force be meet all of their commitment but there be no mistaking that they be very busy as would expect at such a turbulent geopolitical time people across the army navy air force and strategic command be work incredibly hard and we be very grateful to they and their family for their forbearance while they do so the government be invest £ extra in our resilience and readiness but more than investment be need which be why all service be get back into the business of be ready for warfighting the united kingdom division recently exercise its combat service support echelon   for the time in decade the royal navy be operate concurrent task group as well as forward presence a test of our naval logistic and the royal air force be refine its ability to disperse the force through its agile combat employment mechanism 
 of course we commend the effort of all those in our armed service but the defence committee ’s ready for war report substantiate that our armed force be constantly overstretch and be be deploy above their capacity when be the government go to respond appropriately to the scale of the geopolitical challenge by drive up recruitment and retention and make sure that we can face the challenge that we see ahead of we that we can take they full on and be ready for whatever come our way 
 there be no escape the fact that the world be incredibly complicated at the moment in the euro atlantic we face the challenge of russia in the middle east the challenge of iran and its proxy in the indo pacific the grow competition with china and then across africa and other part of the world there remain the challenge of violent extremism at a time of such crisis would expect the armed force to be as busy as they be that do not mean that we should take for grant the effort that they be put in but if we be not reach for they as extensively as we be right now we would have to question when on earth we would reach for they give the demand on our nation 
 i pay tribute to my right hon and gallant friend the minister for armed forces i be very sad to hear that he be go he talk of warfighting as he know i be on the defence committee i would challenge the idea that we be ready to fight a sustained war with the armed force that we have and bear in mind all the threat that we face that possibility have become very real bear in mind that his collective responsibility be about to go will he now stand at the dispatch box and say that we need to spend a lot more money on defence 
 that will go soon but not yet colleague on both side of the house will note that whenever i have be invite to respond to such a question like all good defence ministers i have never miss the opportunity to say yes but the reality be that our armed force remain fit yes it be the job of this house and particularly my hon friend ’s committee to scrutinise our readiness as the committee have do and i commend the report to colleague who have not already read it but reinvestment be need to sustain our armed force at warfighting level that be no scandal that be the consequence of a peace dividend that rightly allow successive government to disinvest in the resilience that keep our cold war force credible however as the secretary of state so rightly say in his speech the other week we be now in a pre war era so it be the responsibility of this government and those who follow to reinvest in the necessary warfighting capability 
 the minister rightly point to the ability to sustain fighting he know that an exercise conduct with the americans show that the british army would run out of munition within   day battle in ukraine show very early on that this would be an artillery war why i have ask this question of several minister so i hope that he have the answer do it take from march or april to july to place the order for new munition we can not afford this sort of delay in the ministry of defence 
 the contract have now be place and it increase our supply of .155s significantly i take issue with the point that the right hon gentleman make i be not aware of the exercise he refer to but in exercise that i have see in which the uk have operate alongside the us again and again the american senior commander have hold the uk force element in the high regard 
 as i use to do my right hon friend ’s job may i join the tribute to the outgoing outstanding armed forces minister 
 the ready for war report just reference identify problem with recruitment as issue that impede our ability to fight the defence secretary himself have call our recruitment system ludicrous and he tell the times early this month that 
 the amazon generation which be use to get thing instantly be not prepared to wait a year to join the army 
 he be absolutely right so when will the utterly ludicrous crapita finally be sack 
 i be unable to answer my right hon friend ’s specific question but he will be hearten to hear that as a consequence of all that be go on in the world and the geopolitical uncertainty that require we to use our armed force so extensively in recent month we have enjoy record expression of interest in join his majesty ’s armed force obviously we need to make sure that the time between express an interest and start training be as short as possible all colleague on the front bench perceive the need for that 
 what step his department be take to support defence job 
 what step his department be take to support defence job 
 the most recent estimate show that the ministry of defence support about job in industry across the uk i be pleased to say that this figure will be boost far by the confirmation last week that bae systems will partner with a firm in australia to build its nuclear power submarine that will support additional british job across the programme ’s lifetime 
 would my hon friend agree that mod procurement from small british company in rural area such as north devon can significantly increase defence relate job there and enhance the local economy especially when those job be in high wage research and development and manufacturing industry will he commit to ensure that the additional high skilled job and economic benefit result from contract be consider in future procurement decision 
 that be an excellent point from my hon friend who be a champion of defence small and medium sized enterprise in her constituency as to procurement rule support sme such as those in north devon our new integrate procurement model will ensure that uk industrial capability and exportability consideration be include in procurement evaluation criterion for item such as the new medium helicopter however to ensure that we absolutely maximise opportunity for british industry on friday i announce that we will undertake a rapid review of how cabinet office social value rule impact on the development of sovereign capability 
 the minister will be aware of the successful export order for high value naval electric propulsion technology manufacture by ge in my rugby constituency that order be go to singapore and it be achieve with the assistance of the mod and the department for business and trade do that not show that support for this world lead british technology enable new business in a fast develop part of the world while provide significant new high value job for my constituent 
 my hon friend ask an excellent question i welcome the valuable contribution of ge in his constituency in supply high tech motor include for royal navy ship such as type frigate and queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier it be precisely because the ministry of defence recognise the importance of ge ’s rugby facility that we be pleased to reach an agreement with the company in to ensure that those motor continue to be manufacture there finally he be right about export it be such a key part of our new integrate procurement model because it boost industrial resilience and prosperity in constituency such as his while strengthen international alliance such as in this case with the people of singapore and the singapore navy 
 the secretary of state will know that huddersfield be a centre for defence industry we have david brown gears and reliance precision for example i talk to they regularly they say to i that of the thing that they miss be train personnel the army navy and air force use to be the big trainer of personnel in the country the diminished level of training in the armed service be reflect in the sector which can not get enough highly train people to employ 
 i be aware of those company which do an excellent job support the supply chain particularly for our prime and for key programme especially naval programme i do not recognise the hon gentleman ’s description of training as he will be aware defence be the big employer of apprentice in the country we be do everything we can to support that the key be to have a close relationship with industry and to bring it into our requirement early on so that it can plan and deliver the supply signal particularly for skill to match our demand signal 
 i would like to build on the incisive question ask by   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   more than applicant to the british army be reject in the past year it have emerge that of applicant be drop or withdraw at the paperwork stage more than withdraw their application have wait for at least month what consequence will capita face for this record and when might the army bring soldier and officer recruitment back in house 
 i encourage the hon gentleman to direct question about recruitment to the minister for defence people and families as to the company the hon gentleman talk about my focus be on industry and support job which the original question be about i think we have a fantastic record boost by not only the export i refer to early but the one that my hon friend   the member for rugby mark pawsey   be talk about 
 i call the shadow minister 
 defence procurement can strengthen uk sovereignty security and economic growth we on the opposition benches believe that defence investment should be direct to uk business so that we make buy and sell more in britain with that in mind what step be the minister take in his rapid review to ensure that social value consideration properly take into account the huge advantage to the uk economy of award more contract to british business so that we create more defence job here in the uk that do not seem to happen at present 
 i think there be considerable consensus because i agree with the right hon lady about the importance of sovereign defence capability and not just because of the economic benefit although those be crucial as we enter this era which have be describe as pre war it be vital that we have a uk sovereign industrial base as the ukrainians have learn there be certain skill and capability that we will need in country should we get to a hotter military situation and that be why that be such a priority for we 
 what step he be take to end the hollowing out of the armed force 
 i refer the hon gentleman to much that i say in response to the readiness question early but the key point on this issue of enablement be that it be the unglamorous stuff that need to be invest in there be no point buy more tank until we have more tank transporter the government be seize of that and be do exactly that this be an opportunity to place on record in addition to my gratitude to the armed force which i have mention that ten of thousand of hard work mod civil servant in the mod main building and around the wide enterprise be hard at work on this problem right now and i be grateful to they for   their effort 
 like other colleague i thank the minister for his year of service since the size of our armed force have decrease by over personnel the number of royal navy warship have decrease by a more than aircraft have be remove from service in just the last year and recruitment target be be miss year on year which of those legacy of year of conservative government be the minister most proud of what action could he undertake to do well 
 the thing that i be most proud of beyond the exceptional operational output of his majesty ’s armed force every time they be call on be that the government have increase the defence budget to more than £ a year for the time the hon gentleman whose interest in defence be very welcome indeed should be enormously concerned about the shadow chancellor ’s repeat refusal to commit to anything more than the nato floor for defence spending if his concern for defence be to last he should immediately be concern about the fact that unless his party change policy urgently it will equal a £ cut in defence spending on day of a labour government 
 the question of whether our armed force be fit for purpose should centre on whether they can carry out the defence task set by the mod and i believe that they can if i may carry on in the same vein as the previous response do the minister agree that labour ’s failure to commit to spend more than of gdp on defence present a much big risk to uk security than any objective debate on this side of the house 
 absolutely we should urgently achieve of gdp the fiscal situation be improve and the conservative party have make that commitment as the secretary of state rightly say in an interview the other day both main party should strongly consider a further increase in defence spending in the next parliament 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as the former defence secretary   the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace tell the house last january the government have hollow out and underfunde the uk military over the last year that be in large part due to their total failure on armed force recruitment and damn new figure show that over the last decade people who be willing to serve and defend their country simply give up and withdraw their application the current defence secretary say that the recruitment system be ludicrous and the organisation run it get call the wrong name by   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois but where be the plan to fix this it be not work 
 the right hon lady be conflate separate issue the former secretary of state for defence and i and everybody else who have serve on the government front bench since we have return to the prospect of state on state war have refer to a hollowing out of the force that be a consequence of decision make not just by this government but by   government since the fall of the berlin wall because the force that we maintain for the cold war and all its enablement be not necessary when we be fight counter insurgency campaign in iraq and afghanistan that be what be mean by hollow out the soon the right hon lady start to deal with that issue rather than conflate it with other to make political point the soon she will start to contribute to an important debate 
 as far as recruitment go record interest have be show in join our nation ’s armed force and there be no hiding from the fact that we need to rapidly accelerate the time between express an interest and be in training 
 can we accelerate the question too 
 what assessment he have make of the security of the sovereign base area and the armed force in cyprus 
 the uk continually assess potential threat to our overseas territory include the sovereign base area on the island of cyprus british forces cyprus provide a permanent military presence and we be invest in the sba to combat current and future threat in order to ensure local regional and global security 
 i thank the minister for his response the secretary of state have say 
 we want to do everything possible to ensure the security of cyprus 
 do the minister agree that it would be appropriate to keep the cypriot government inform of all uk military operation conduct from their island should not that be an official obligation for the security of cyprus 
 the sba be sovereign basis so of course we reserve the right to operate from they as need base on the uk national interest the hon gentleman will be reassure to hear that the secretary of state his predecessor other ministers in the mod and i have very good relation with the cypriots and we seek to tell they as much as we can about operation that we mount from sba there 
 i would like to add to the warm word say about my right hon friend he have be particularly supportive of the all party parliamentary group for the armed force and the armed force parliamentary scheme both of which i chair do he agree that the sovereign base area in cyprus have a particularly important role to play in our activity in the red sea 
 cyprus be in an incredibly important strategic location which mean that it be of great use to our operation in the southern red sea as well as in the eastern mediterranean the western balkans central asia and beyond it be a vital mountain base for so much that the uk armed force do we be incredibly fortunate to have that facility 
 what step his department be take to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid to gaza 
 what step his department be take to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid to gaza 
 what step he be take with the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs to increase the number of aid shipment to the middle east 
 there be a desperate need for increase humanitarian support to gaza the uk include the ministry of defence be work collectively with ally partner and international organisation to deliver desperately need aid to the gazan population 
 my constituent be rightly proud of the work that our armed force be do to facilitate the delivery of aid to prevent a colossal humanitarian catastrophe what further step can be take to ensure that british aid find its way to civilian in need rather than into the hand of hamas fighter 
 that be of the great challenge in the current situation we be work with the british red cross unicef the un world food programme the egyptian red crescent and other to ensure that aid get to the right place that be extremely challenging and have slow down aid delivery 
 the israeli government have say that they want to flood gaza with aid will my right hon friend assure the house that we will work with our partner globally to get more aid into the hand of civilian in gaza and will assist the israelis to deliver on that pledge as soon as possible 
 i inform my hon friend that we have already deliver tonne of humanitarian aid via the raf and tonne through the royal fleet auxiliary in addition we be pursue land air and maritime route 
 with half of gaza already starve and the rest teeter on the edge of famine and the un security council voting for an immediate ceasefire in gaza access to humanitarian aid be crucial this month the foreign secretary state that the uk would support the building of a temporary pier in gaza to allow hundred of extra daily truckload of aid into the strip will the secretary of state outline what step he be take along with the foreign secretary to ensure that the pier be construct as quickly as possible 
 the hon lady will be pleased to hear that i have send team both to tampa to work with us central command and to the region to help with planning and construct that pier in addition right at the beginning of the conflict i ensure that we do hydrographic research to aid in exactly this kind of situation when the condition be right to get a pier build this be not a trivial endeavour but we be work to deliver the pier as quickly as possible there be the potential to get meal a day to gaza 
 the uk government ’s ability to deliver humanitarian aid depend on the uk ’s relationship with its middle eastern partner what impact do the secretary of state think that recent event and uk government foreign policy decision have have on that crucial relationship with those middle eastern partner 
 the hon lady will be pleased to hear that the foreign secretary the prime minister and i have be very proactive in speak to and make multiple visit to the region i have visit the majority of country in the middle east and gulf region to discuss exactly the point that she have raise there be now a large scale programme of use a pier to get food in in addition to the many other effort make as my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince   point out the issue be not just get the aid there but then distribute it that be a great concern 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 when will the government make a further public determination on israel ’s commitment to international humanitarian law give the man make famine unfold in northern gaza which be compound by israeli move to obstruct access to aid if the uk find as the un secretary general human rights watch and amnesty international do that the israeli government and the israel defence forces have violate international law what step will the uk government take to prohibit further arm sale to israel pende a resolution of the situation give that the security council have just call for a ceasefire what step will the government take through the defence sector to accelerate all available aid for civilian in gaza 
 it be a pity to ask all those question without reference the plus hostage who be still be hold by hamas who brutally slaughter the population deliberately rather than as a by product of war the hon gentleman ask a number of question i can tell he that on arm export to israel an issue for which i be responsible it be to put it in proportion i think from the top of my head just £ for the past year the number be actually very small indeed he will know that his latter question be for the foreign commonwealth and development office 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the defence procurement system 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the defence procurement system 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the defence procurement system 
 the department use a range of measure to assess the effectiveness of defence acquisition we have reduce the    average time take to deliver our project and programme but we must go far to drive pace so last month i announce our new integrate procurement model 
 the national audit office have previously highlight mod pilot training procurement failure so be the raf now meet its pilot training quota be the minister satisfied with progress in that key area 
 the hon gentleman ask a very important question of course training be fundamental to bring in the next generation to man our capability i recently have the pleasure of visit raf valley where i discuss the issue with the raf it be able to confirm to i that for the time in a long time there be more student take up their place rather than in hold that be a key metric in which we be see significant progress but yes we want to go far 
 last march the government say that they would have their ajax scheme ready between october and september give that only of armoured vehicle have be produce be the government on target to meet that deadline 
 yes 
 notwithstanding the waste of £ in procurement since will the minister join the shadow secretary of state for defence my right hon friend   the member for wentworth and dearne john healey   in a campaign to make in britain ensure our industry and economy move together to support not just our defence but our economy how will he achieve that give that tata steel to which we have pay £ be cut down its blast furnace capacity how will we be able to proceed with the aukus contract and other contract without virgin steel 
 on the important question of steel we do not expect the closure of port talbot to have a significant impact on defence but obviously we will continue to monitor that situation i would just gently point out that in the last year for which we have figure available of spend by the mod with industry be with british industry it will be an awful lot hard to make that level of spend if labour be unable to commit to match our spending commitment if the hon gentleman be so concerned perhaps he will join other colleague on the labour benches in insist that the shadow secretary of state confirm whether he will match of gdp now and our target of as soon as the economy support it 
 may i take this opportunity to also place on record my thank to the minister for armed forces my right hon and gallant friend   the member for wells james heappey   for all the work he have do it be a joy to work with he when i be in the department 
 i thank the minister for defence procurement for his procurement review it be an excellent document move forward in a pragmatic way as part of that review will he reassess where potential gap might occur between old platform be retire and new platform be delay do he agree that housing procurement accommodation for our armed force be as much an operational capability as a tank 
 my right hon friend make an excellent point he make a similar point in the debate on readiness last week about the importance of accommodation i think we can all agree that there be a tendency in defence to focus on the big shiny platform accommodation be a key priority we be very committed to improve accommodation we know that in the winter before this performance be not satisfactory that be why we put in extra investment of £ and announce a winter plan i be pleased to say that we have make huge progress for example in ensure that thousand of property have work achieve on damp and mould 
 i be delighted that the mod have confirm   the procurement of additional chinook give that raf odiham in my constituency be the home of the chinook force however it be also home to the fleet ’s frontline maintenance line engine repair and in depth upgrade and modification give that of the chinook fleet sustainment take place in the uk today can i have my hon friend ’s assurance that raf odiham will remain the home of the chinook and that there will be a similar if not high level of maintenance of the new variant here and across britain 
 i greatly enjoy my visit to odiham where my hon friend and i discuss a wide variety of issue he be right to draw attention to our commitment to the procurement of extend range chinook they have a huge range of mile but there be also the industrial benefit to the uk and of course to my hon friend ’s constituency i can confirm that not only have that procurement make we a £ saving but it will contribute £ worth of benefit to the uk ’s prosperity

 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 procurement of the new medium lift helicopter have be characteristically suboptimal under the present government but this   particular defence procurement minister have manage with his inverse midas touch to ensure that cost have grow from about £ to £ delivery forecast have slip delay year to and the number of asset to be receive have fall from to give that the forecast will inevitably slip to the right service personnel will be under resource and the budget will almost certainly grow what possible confidence can anyone have in this defence procurement minister 
 i will take no lecture from the hon gentleman whose party have be unable even to procure a ferry hon member it say here i know the subject and i can confirm to he because i be very proud of this that at my insistence our competition for the new medium helicopter will involve a far great emphasis both on support uk industry and on support export it be by support export that we secure industrial resilience and support for prosperity across the united kingdom of course it be a competition but we have very good entrant 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 like other in the house i pay tribute to the minister for armed forces my right hon and gallant friend   the member for wells james heappey soldier mp and minister during almost the entire parliament his knowledge of this subject be match only by his great passion for it and we be all very grateful for his service

 i welcome the publication of the command paper and in particular the important role play by rolls royce in derby but do my right hon friend agree that for this to be a truly national enterprise there must be a truly national supply chain and access to job for people throughout the country 
 my hon friend be right about the extent of the supply chain in addition to the very large investment in rolls royce to which the australians contribute £ last week and all the work in barrow that be describe in the command paper there be benefit for virtually every constituency in the country 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we condemn the deadly terrorist attack in moscow on friday and our thought be with all those affect but the attack must not become a kremlin cover for putin ’s illegal war in ukraine in recent day we have see multiple   russian strike on ukrainian city yet the last uk air defence support be announce last year when be the next 
 i join the right hon gentleman in send our condolence follow the horrific terror attack he be absolutely right to say that we be aware of no connection whatsoever with ukraine indeed isis have claim responsibility we must resist putin ’s effort to try to link the 
 with regard to air defence there have be much more recent attempt to aid our ukrainian friend include through the international fund for ukraine which have lay contract we have a £ fund run by the uk on behalf of a large number of other country 
 of course anything more recent be from the international fund for ukraine not the uk which be why we strongly welcome the £ of uk military support for however for nearly month since that announcement ministers have say that the delivery to ukraine will not happen until q1 of the new financial year war do not follow financial year so when will the uk move beyond this stop start military aid and help ukraine with the spring summer offensive 
 i can tell the right hon gentleman that we have a constant flow of foreign materiel that we be buy and send into ukraine i recently announce £ for british ukrainian drone and we have increase the overall amount of money go to ukraine from the previous year £ to £ i gently say to the right hon gentleman this have be raise by a couple of my colleague today that he need to explain how the opposition would manage an increase budget for ukraine when their plan be to cut £ from the overall defence budget

 can my right hon friend please give the house an update on recommendation and of the live in our shoe report which deal with this issue 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and as ever pay tribute to he for the work he have do in this area it be the case that when people move around the country they be disadvantaged we recognise that which be why integrate care board be now run a pilot scheme on how we can get around people lose their place on waiting list when they travel around the country obviously the issue involve other government departments too nevertheless we have a responsibility which we discharge in a number of way for example headfit be be adapt and adopt at the moment to ensure that our veteran and service family be able to access much of its content 
 the government have previously refuse to confirm or deny whether israeli f-35s have be use raf airbase   or indeed other military co operation between the uk and israel give the decision of the international court of justice and now the decision of the un security council to call for an immediate ceasefire what be the operational or policy reason that deny uk citizen the right to know whether their government have be complicit in israeli genocide in gaza 
 we do not comment on operational matter of that sort 
 qatar host hamas ’s most senior leader in doha and should have be apply far more pressure on the terror group to release the israeli hostage and to surrender do my right hon friend agree that qatar ’s malign activity bolster our adversary and therefore weaken our own defence 
 i be not entirely sure that i do agree i will leave the foreign office to talk about the diplomatic angle that it be pursue but in my experience qatar have be an incredibly helpful partner across a whole load of thing over the past few year we enjoy the opportunity to strengthen that partnership both through the sale of uk build defence capability and through increasingly operate together in area of mutual concern it be a relationship on which the uk can build far and have great potential 
 hms albion be twin with chester and we deeply value the ship and her company can the secretary of state provide the next date on which hms albion and hms bulwark will be at sea or will he just admit that he have mothball they both 
 the hon lady be pleased to know that i be on hms albion the other week and that she have not be mothball the other ship will be the to sail i do not know the timing as that will depend on operational requirement but they be both continue in operation 
 like many colleague across the house i attend the all party parliamentary group for uk israel and friends of israel event we be join by release hostage and a delegation consist of young sibling son daughter grandchild and cousin of those be hold hostage in gaza it be now month since the hostage be take so will the secretary of state ensure that those victim remain right at the front of his mind in all decision that be take on the middle east 
 my hon friend can absolutely have that assurance it be shocking to see what be happen in the region but it be too often forget include in this house today by some opposition member that this all begin with the taking of those hostage we will never forget 
 pension justice be on everybody ’s lip just now so can the minister tell i what this government   have do to support the veteran who leave service before and who have lose out on preserve pension 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question as he know very well consecutive government have make it plain that we do not make change to pension retrospectively as for pension for the armed force overall mr speaker you will know as i do as a beneficiary that they be equitable fair and generous 
 the well defence estate plan earmark fort blockhouse in gosport for disposal yet year later after numerous delay the site be still rot at the taxpayer ’s expense it be do nothing for the local economy the local community or the mod will the minister please update i on when can we will finally see some progress on that site 
 i enjoy my visit to my hon friend ’s constituency where we look at a range of infrastructure and accommodation i appreciate that she want to see progress but i stress that while we be engage as closely as possible with gosport council on this and want to make progress it be a complex site with significant defence event asset still in place relate to the defence infrastructure organisation and the royal navy i be committed to look at what more we can do and to engage far with she 
 ten of thousand of pregnant woman in gaza be suffer from malnutrition and be at serious risk of deliver their baby unsafely and without healthcare will the secretary of state outline what step he be take along with the foreign secretary to support the delivery of food and medical supply to those particularly vulnerable woman 
 we be work to try to bring supply to all the citizen of gaza i do not run through the list of provision but it do include provision for those in medical need particularly woman who may be pregnant as i mention we be work on plan with the americans in particular but also with the jordanians to provide vastly great amount of aid into gaza 
 the terrible terrorist attack in moscow remind we that jihadi extremism have not disappear give its ideology its reach and its strength do the secretary of state agree that isis k be just as much of a threat to the west as it be to russia 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right there be a perception that daesh have go away the daesh core be coope up in prison in northern syria but daesh affiliate be grow alarmingly quickly in other part of the world the attack in moscow be a reminder to we all that we must continue to focus on the counter terror threat as well as on the state threat 
 may i wish the minister for the armed forces all the very good for his next posting he will recall that on february he make a commitment to reassess the afghan relocation   and assistance policy eligibility specifically for former member of the triple and say that the process would take week will he update the house on what progress have be make on that work to date 
 it be disappointing to finish on a down note but as the hon gentleman know from a write answer that i give he last week it have take long than i want to establish an independent group of new casework assessor and that week period have therefore not yet begin i be tell by official when i reluctantly sign off the answer to he last week that that process be nigh on complete and that the week period should therefore start imminently he will not be surprised to learn that pre empte his question i have encourage they by suggest that week would sound an awful lot well than give the delay in get start 
 on a point of order mr speaker at defence question on   january i ask the defence procurement minister a very straightforward question about hms argyll the type of question to which i would expect he to have an answer at his   fingertip instead he say as quickly and as curtly as he could that he would write to i with an answer it be almost month later and i regret to inform you and the house that i have receive no such information from the defence procurement minister and neither have i receive an acknowledgment that he intend to write to i 
 may i ask your advice mr speaker when right hon and hon member have a slippery minister on the hook and that minister choose to wriggle off it by promise to write what recourse do we have when the minister do not write 
 i think we ought to choose our language when we want a response i have a lot sympathy and although the point of order do not relate to this question time i will give you the benefit of the doubt because this be an important matter as you be a senior member of the snp and have be its spokesperson i expect you to get timely reply i do not expect reply to take so long i be sure that those on the treasury bench have hear and i would expect a response to be send rather quickly follow this point of order 
 with permission i will make a statement about malicious cyber activity target the united kingdom by actor that we assess be affiliate to the chinese state i want to update the house on our assessment of this activity and to reassure it on the step that the government have take to shore up our resilience and hold those actor to account 
 i know that right hon and hon member on both side of the chamber will recognise the seriousness of this issue particularly in a year when so many democratic election will be take place around the world member will want to be reassure that the government be take step to address the associate threat 
 i can confirm today that chinese state affiliate actor be responsible for malicious cyber campaign target both our democratic institution and parliamentarian by compromise the united kingdom ’s electoral commission between and as be announce last summer and secondly by attempt reconnaissance activity against uk parliamentary account in a separate campaign in 
 later today a number of our international partner include the united states will issue similar statement to expose this activity and to hold china to account for the ongoing pattern of hostile activity target our collective democracy mr speaker you and parliamentary security have already be brief on this activity we want now to be as open as possible with the house and with the british public because part of our defence be in call out this behaviour 
 this be the late in a clear pattern of hostile activity originate in china include the targeting of democratic institution and parliamentarian in the united kingdom and beyond we have see this in china ’s continued disregard for universal human right and international commitment in xinjiang in china ’s erasure of dissent voice and stifle of the opposition under the new national security law in hong kong and in the disturbing report of chinese intimidation and aggressive behaviour in the south china sea that be why this government have investigate and call out so call chinese overseas police service station and instruct the chinese embassy to close they 
 however china ’s cumulative attempt to interfere with the uk ’s democracy have not succeed last summer the electoral commission state that it have be a victim of a complex cyber attack between and that be the work of chinese state affiliate actor who gain access to the electoral commission ’s email and file share system which contain copy of the electoral register as the electoral commission state in when that attack be make public the compromise have not affect the security of election it will not impact how people register vote or otherwise participate in democratic process i want to reassure people that the compromise of that information although obviously concern typically do not create a risk to those affect i want to far reassure the house that the commission have work with security specialist to   investigate the incident and remove the threat from its system and have since take further step to increase the resilience of its system 
 in addition the national cyber security centre assess that it be almost certain that the chinese state affiliate cyber actor know as apt31 attempt to conduct reconnaissance activity against uk parliamentary account during a separate campaign in hon member may recall that apt31 be of several cyber actor attribute to the chinese ministry of state security by the uk and its ally in july that email campaign by apt31 be block by parliament ’s cyber security measure in this case it be entirely unsuccessful however any targeting of member of this house by foreign state actor be completely unacceptable 
 take together the uk judge that those action demonstrate a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour that signal hostile intent from china that be why the uk have today sanction individual and entity associate with the chinese state affiliate apt31 group for involvement in malicious cyber activity target official government entity and parliamentarian around the world we be today act to warn of the breadth of target emanating from chinese state affiliate actor such as apt31 to sanction those actor who attempt to threaten our democratic institution and to deter both china and all those who seek to do the same 
 last week at the summit for democracy in seoul i say that we would call out malicious attempt to undermine our democracy wherever we find they this be an important tool in our armoury and today we be do just that the uk do not accept that china ’s relationship with the uk be set on a predetermined course but that depend on the choice china make that be why the foreign office will be summon the chinese ambassador to account for china ’s conduct in these incident the uk ’s policy towards china be anchor in our core national interest we will engage with the chinese government where it be consistent with those interest but we will not hesitate to take swift and robust action wherever the chinese government threaten the uk ’s interest we have do so today and previously this government will continue to hold china and other state actor accountable for their action 
 we will also take serious action to prevent this behaviour from affect our security the step we have take in recent year have make the uk a hard operating environment for foreign state actor seek to target our value and our institution through the national security act we now have for the time a specific offence of foreign interference that new offence will allow law enforcement to disrupt state link effort to undermine our institution right or political system 
 our national security and investment act have overhaul our scrutiny of investment into the united kingdom by give the government power to block unwind or put condition on investment that could create national security risk we have significantly reduce china ’s involvement in the uk ’s civil nuclear sector take ownership of the cgn stake in the sizewell c nuclear power project and ensure chinese state own nuclear energy corporation will have no further role in the project 
 we have put in place measure to prevent hostile infiltration of our university include protect campus from interference through the higher education   freedom of speech act the procurement act include national security devolvement provision that allow we to act where we see malicious influence in our public procurement i have take step to reduce the government ’s exposure to chinese operator ban hikvision and tiktok from government building and device through the national cyber security strategy we be invest £ to increase the cyber resilience of our critical national infrastructure by make the most important part of our digital environment a hard target for state and non state actor 
 the government be continue to build the tool expertise and knowledge to respond to the systemic challenge that china pose to the united kingdom ’s security and its value the integrated review refresh in take step toward this double funding for a government wide programme include investment in mandarin language training and deepen diplomatic expertise 
 we must be clear that this be not a problem for the government to solve alone that be why we create the national protective security authority within mi5 to help business and institution play their part in protect our security and prosperity the npsa will help organisation in the uk ’s most sensitive field include critical national infrastructure operator and world lead science and tech sector to protect themselves against state threat i set up the economic security public private forum to ensure business and business leader in crucial sector understand the threat to the uk and what they can do to defeat it 
 in parliament the national cyber security centre have launch an opt in service for member of both houses this allow the ncsc to alert high risk individual if they identify evidence of malicious activity on their personal device or account and swiftly advise they on step to take to protect their information today the ncsc have publish new guidance for political organisation include political party and think tank which will help these organisation take effective action to protect their system and their datum the ncsc be also work with all political party to increase the uptake of their active cyber defence service in the lead up to a general election a key component of increase our resilience be support the ncsc and parliamentary authority by take up that cyber security offer i urge all member of this house to do so i will be write to colleague later today set out again the step that they can take 
 at the summit for democracy i be strike by the powerful strength of our collective voice when we work together to defend our democratic freedom the summit provide the united kingdom government with a platform to build international agreement on a new global government compact on counter deceptive use of ai by foreign state in election it be important and welcome that our partner across the eyes as well as those in europe and the indo pacific be stand in solidarity with our effort to call out malicious cyber activity i pay tribute to the dedicated public servant whose painstaking work have continue to expose the reality of the threat we face 
 our political process and institution have not be harm by these attack the government will continue to call out and condemn this kind of activity in the    strong term we will continue to work with our ally to ensure that chinese state affiliate actor suffer the consequence of their behaviour we will take preventive action to ensure these attempt do not succeed the cyber threat pose by china affiliate actor be real and serious but it be more than equalled by our determination and resolve to resist it that be how we defend ourselves and our precious democracy and i commend this statement to the house 
 rise 
 order this be an important statement which be why it have run on quite a lot long than the normal minute i be sure everybody will agree that if the front bench speaker need a little extra time we will be flexible in exactly the same way i call the shadow secretary of state pat mcfadden 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and for advance sight of it it be a statement about which there have be significant briefing in the press over the past couple of day on question of national security labour will support the government in effort to counter attempt by china or any other state to interfere with or undermine the democratic process or attempt to stop elect representative go about their business voice their opinion or cast their vote without fear or favour with that in mind i pay tribute to the effort make every day by the intelligence and security service to protect the public and to protect our democracy and way of life the economic relationship between the united kingdom and china can never mean compromise on national security or our democratic integrity 
 the deputy prime minister ’s statement touch on a number of issue and i have some question about they will he say more about the government ’s assessment of chinese motif do he believe for example that beijing want to disrupt our democratic process or instead to gather datum about our citizen for some other reason on the specific issue of the electoral commission and the electoral register why do he think that the chinese government hack what be a publicly available database do he believe they be after the detail of those who may not be on a public register for good reason for example because they might be employ in security sensitive area do he believe they be after detail and the personal datum of political donor or be there some other motive 
 the deputy prime minister refer to the democratic electoral process and with an election come it be vital that people have confidence in their ability to register and to vote will he confirm that our electronic register to vote system be sufficiently well protect he say that the attack on parliamentary account be unsuccessful do he believe that china now want to engage in the kind of hack and leak activity that we have in recent year associate with russia in order to compromise either individual politician or the wide democratic process on sanction only last week the minister of state be reluctant to respond to the claim that the foreign office indefinitely pause target sanction against chinese official late last year will the deputy prime minister explain what have change in the past week 
 we be grateful for the work of the intelligence and security committee of parliament and the report it issue on china last year which cover much of the same ground that the deputy prime minister cover in his statement when discuss individual politician paragraph of that report state 
 target be not necessarily limit to serve politician either they can include former political figure if they be sufficiently high profile for example it be possible that david cameron ’s role as vice president of a £ 1bn china uk investment fund be in some part engineer by the chinese state to lend credibility to chinese investment 
 what have the government do to look into that allegation from the intelligence and security committee how can minister ensure that those leave politic be not target in that way 
 in that spirit mr speaker i have read report that the conservative back bench committee be to be brief on these matter later today give the importance of national and democratic security to all the party in this house be the deputy prime minister intend to arrange a briefing for the leader of the opposition the intelligence and security committee and indeed the other political party represent in the house 
 expert in this field have warn of china ’s voracious appetite for datum and its potential us as compute power improve for example as quantum computing develop the uk ’s record on datum security be patchy to put it mildly what be the government do to protect complex and valuable dataset from be steal now possibly in order to be manipulate later by more powerful computer that be control by authoritarian adversary 
 finally mr speaker on the broad issue do the fact that the deputy prime minister choose to make this statement today signal a fundamental reassessment of the overall threat he refer to the united states and our ally on   february the us administration warn congress that the cyber threat from china be change previously a threat that largely involve spying and influence now look like it be get ready to disrupt critical american infrastructure aviation energy healthcare and other sector be it now the uk government ’s view that we should change our assessment of the threat in a similar way if so this be of the utmost importance and we would need to know what corresponding improvement the government would make to the preparedness of our critical infrastructure because if the threat really have change then so too should our response 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i shall seek to address as many of they as i can 
 when it come to chinese motivation ultimately it be a matter for the chinese to be able justify their motivation but the point that the right hon gentleman make be apposite the chinese look at successful democratic country such as the united kingdom japan or the republic of korea where i be last week and they want to seek to undermine they it be no surprise therefore that they should seek to interfere in electoral process in the way that we have see conduct from russia that align with that indeed the successful   democratic election around the world right now stand in contrast to the sham election that we see in russia last weekend 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s point about the public record of the electoral commission i think that that be the essence of what have happen here these attack and these attempt be ultimately pretty unsuccessful i reassure the right hon gentleman and members of this house that there be no infiltration of the closed register of the electoral commission so the concern that he raise have not arise on the further strengthening of the electoral register that be precisely the work that the national cyber security centre do in co ordination with gchq work with government agency include the electoral commission 
 the right hon gentleman be right to raise the risk of hack and leak it be certainly something that we see in previous election and i remain concerned i also remain very concerned about artificial intelligence deep fake in particular be use to disrupt election hence the work that i undertake at the conference last week and the progress that we be make with the accord on artificial intelligence use by malign state 
 in relation to target sanction it be not the case that the foreign commonwealth and development office pause target sanction on the conduct of the former foreign secretary—[interruption i be not sack the foreign secretary from the dispatch box on the conduct of the current foreign secretary who sit in the other place all appointment to government be subject to the usual propriety and ethic process lord cameron be address the committee in his capacity as foreign secretary in the usual way address a wide range of issue it be not a specific briefing on this issue but if leader of the principal opposition party wish to have a further briefing on this issue i be of course very happy to facilitate that in the way that they know i have do in relation to other national security issue 
 we be highly alert to the risk of hostile state hoover up currently quantum encrypt information that could subsequently be decode with advance in quantum computing we do extensive work with the national cyber security centre and the ministerial cyber board on critical national infrastructure to ensure that we guard ourselves against exactly that risk on our relationship with china more broadly member of this house should take this moment very seriously it be a grave moment against a backdrop of an escalating threat from china and we will take proportionate action in response to that escalating threat 
 tomorrow it will be year since parliamentarian here be sanction your defence of we mr speaker have be remarkable although i welcome the sanction from the government it be a little bit like an elephant give birth to a mouse the reality be that in those year the chinese have trash the sino british agreement and be commit murder slave labour and genocide in xinjiang we have have break church and in hong kong false court case against jimmy lai my question be why america have sanction more than people in hong kong we have sanction none and only lowly official in xinjiang surely the integrated review should be change china be not an epoch define challenge strange as   that may be but it be surely a threat can the government now correct that so that we all know where we be with china 
 my right hon friend ’s view be well known to i i genuinely welcome the constructive at most time debate that i have with he but nobody should be in any doubt about the gravity of this matter these be not the action of a friendly state and they require our serious attention as he have describe this be an escalating situation the measure that we have announce today be the step but the government will respond proportionately at all time to the fact in front of we no should be in any doubt about the government ’s determination to face down and deal with threat to our national security from wherever they come 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and for advanced sight of it in the statement he say 
 i have take step to reduce the government ’s exposure to chinese operator ban hikvision and tiktok from government building and device 
 but the reality be that the hikvision ban extend only to sensitive site despite the fact that we have push he to ensure that it extend to all public building surely the majority of thing that happen in government involve some sort of confidential information will he confirm whether he be extend the ban beyond sensitive site to all government site as we have be call for for a number of year the attack on the electoral commission and parliamentarian account happen nearly year ago will we be sit here in hear about an attack that be happen right now the eu be currently deliver € for cyber security to improve its collective resilience will the government deliver an equivalent fund for these island finally without more action can he give we real assurance that this year ’s general election will take place without international interference 
 as the hon lady be aware we currently ban hikvision and indeed any other chinese technology relate to cctv we continue to keep that under review i do not rule out a further progression in the policy but that be not the case right now 
 on the time take it be essential that before minister stand at the dispatch box and make assertion attribute such activity to a hostile state we be absolutely sure of the basis on which we do so that require extensive work by our intelligence agency it require fine judgment to be make and it require work to be do with our ally around the world there will be comment from the united states shortly after my statement i would rather we do this in the proper way 
 we have invest £ on cyber security during this spending review i can never be totally confident in relation to cyber security no government minister anywhere in the world can be it be an environment in which the risk be escalate all the time and be turbocharge by artificial intelligence but i can assure the hon lady and other member that we be constantly increase our activity and vigilance in the face of it 
 like my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith i be rather underwhelme by this statement in the year since parliamentarian be sanction we have be subject to intimidation impersonation and hacking as have the family of exile from china with whom we have associate today the deputy prime minister have describe hostile actor malign act towards the integrity of our electoral system and parliamentary democracy foreign interference and sanction individual and company employ people with a turnover of £ do he think that that be proportionate and can he confirm that the government will put the whole of the chinese communist government in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme 
 my hon friend may be aware that we be currently in the process of collective government agreement in relation to the enhance tier of the foreign interference registration scheme clearly the conduct that i have describe today will have a very strong bearing on the decision that we make in respect of it 
 in relation to the sanction it be worth note that this be the time that the government have impose sanction in respect of cyber activity i believe that they be proportionate and target but they also sit in the context of action that we have be take with our international ally they be a step and we remain totally open to take further step as the situation evolve the path we be go on with this be clear 
 my reaction be be that it the spin be clearly not match by this statement the deputy prime minister say that there be an issue around nuclear and high education that be because the government encourage china to invest in nuclear and cut the budget of our university so they be reliant on chinese student the deputy prime minister also duck the question ask by my right hon friend   the member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden   about lord cameron will lord cameron publish all the money and interaction that he have with chinese entity when he be out of government the deputy prime minister say that he be committed to the security service why then in the budget on   march be the security budget cut by £ next year that be not a sign of a government who be take this issue seriously 
 the foreign secretary have provide a full declaration of all his interest 
 no he have n’t 
 i will take lecture from labour members on action in relation to security threat with a pinch of salt it be this government who introduce the national security and investment act it be this government who pass the higher education freedom of speech act it be this government who pass the national security act none of which we see from the labour party during its year in office 
 we have see report of espionage on uk campus aggression on uk soil massive cyber attack and hostile corporate takeover it be abundantly clear that china be a hostile state and pose an unprecedented threat to our national security as home secretary i oversee the enactment of the national security act which build the foreign influence registration scheme design specifically to deal with such threat so that our authority have the right power to tackle they be there not a compelling case for china to be list on that register and if not now when 
 i pay tribute to my right hon and learn friend for the work that she do she and i work closely together on many of those thing there be a strong case and my right hon and learn friend will be aware of the process that we go through to determine that it have to be agree through a collective government agreement 
 on the point about hostile state though i disagree with my right hon and learn friend it be not the case that any eyes nation have designate china explicitly as a hostile state the language i have use in relation to china reflect the complex situation of that state but i want colleague to be in no doubt about the direction that government policy be take how gravely we take this issue and the overall escalation of our stance on it 
 i too be quite surprised at the difference between what be brief and some of the information that the deputy prime minister have give we today and the sum of the action take he say that the government have take rapid and robust action when talk about thing that happen and year ago and the sanctioning of individual and a minor company do not seem to meet the definition of robust how do he think that take the tiny step he have announce today will deter the chinese from carry on in the way they have be do as the deputy prime minister have outline and be very clear from the china report that the intelligence and security committee be finally allow to publish late 
 in relation to briefing i can categorically assure you mr speaker and member of this house that there have be no briefing whatsoever from i or my department in respect of this matter as ever i would say do not believe everything that you read in the newspaper 
 as for the overall direction of government policy it be clearly set this be not just about offensive action but the extensive defensive action we have take to continuously increase the security of our government system i make no apology for the time we have take to properly call out china in this respect i want to make sure that when i stand at the dispatch box i be able to do so on a solid basis painstakingly put together by our ally and our security agency 
 rise 
 who shall we go to a former attorney general no less 
 the front page of the telegraph today report whitehall source say that china russia and iran be even fuel disinformation about the princess of wales to destabilise the nation hostile state with leader who fake their own election and be hat by their own people be spread wild conspiracy theory about the royal family among many other thing our royal family who be hugely popular and much love do the deputy prime minister agree that british people will ignore that grotesque disinformation despite the pathetic attempt of those autocratic regime 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for raise the issue and extend my good wish to member of the royal family at this very difficult time the appalling speculation that we have see over the past few week come as a reminder to we all that it be important for we to ensure that we deal with valid and trusted information and be appropriately sceptical about many online source 
 as of the parliamentarian target can i thank the security official for the work they do to repel this attack i be glad it be not successful 
 however i have to say that the deputy prime minister have turn up at a gunfight with a wooden spoon the attack that he stand up and announce at the dispatch box happen year ago but he come to the house and call this swift he come to the house and say he have take robust action but as   the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   mention the entity he have sanction have few than employee and have a turnover of £ a year he have not sanction a single chinese state official he have not even tell the house whether the chinese ambassador have be summon after what he have come to the dispatch box to tell we today interruption forgive i he say he have be summon my apology 
 can i press the deputy prime minister on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme what possible good excuse could there be for not have china in that and if we do not take more robust action and see a proper sea change in government thinking rather than this tinker around the edge will this not happen more and more and get bad and bad 
 i think everything about the hon gentleman ’s question suggest that he do not actually listen to the statement i make i say that there have be a démarche and that be exactly what be happen i have already set out the position in relation to the foreign influence registration system 
 the deputy prime minister know that cyber attack on uk institution come from a wide range of actor state and criminal as we see in the recent big attack on the british library and it be important that our law be up to date to protect against this in the government announce that they would update the network and information systems regulations to 
 protect essential and digital service against increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber attack both now and in the future 
 in that be to be do as soon as parliamentary time allow why have it not be do and when will it be do 
 the work be pretty much complete and as soon as parliamentary time allow we will be bring forward those measure 
 i be sorry but i find the deputy prime minister today utterly unconvincing the idea that swift mean take year to publish something that have already be publish by a committee of this house be utterly preposterous it mean that if there be an attempt this year we would hear about it long after the general election and possibly after another general election after that the truth be that if he actually think this be the sum total of all the chinese state ’s attempt to disrupt the british democratic system he be wilfully blind and be therefore dangerous 
 there be thing that the government could do immediately to enhance confidence in this area bring forward the motion to allow the foreign secretary to answer question in this house from member of the house of commons and secondly publish the full unexpurgated russia report 
 i be sorry that the hon member be not happy with the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who be sit to my right and who i think do an excellent job of answer question in this house on the time that this have take there be a difference between acknowledging as the electoral commission do the fact that an attack have take place and the process of attribution which take a long period of time for the reason i have set out repeatedly from this dispatch box 
 i be proud to have the british library at boston spa in my constituency and i will be meet it in a week ’s time to talk about the cyber attack that be just aspect of what have happen recently but we be talk about the protection of democracy as well and the timeframe on which we be move on some issue do concern i of the big concern will be deepfake news profile with people allege to have say thing and video of people allegedly do thing at the next election i urge my right hon friend to work now to try to establish procedure so that everybody across this house will be able to call out efficiently the fake news that may be use to try to influence the election as he have say people should be careful what they believe but what can people believe in unless there be robust system to call out what be absolutely fake 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue we be work with tech company on for example the watermarking of image to ensure that people have a sense of whether they be real however this can not just be action from the uk government we have to work internationally which be why at the global summit for democracy we launch the global government compact on counter the deceptive use of ai by foreign state in election that be the united kingdom lead across nation around the world to ensure that we can act in co ordination   to address this issue moreover everyone in this rapidly evolve technological world need to be mindful of the fact that information can not be trust in the way it use to be just a few year ago 
 the deputy prime minister talk in his statement about 
 the powerful strength of our collective voice
