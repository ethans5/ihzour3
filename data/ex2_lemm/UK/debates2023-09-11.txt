we take very seriously the work that the defence committee do we enjoy read the committee ’s report and as i hope member of the committee and of the house recognise often take the finding into policy i do push back gently however because in addition to the incredible work of qra and the support the royal air force have give to nato mission over the last month since the start of the war in ukraine they have also be able to support carrier strike deployment deployment on exercise red flag and indeed the deployment of a below squadron in strength all the way across to australia that get to exactly what i tell my hon friend   the member for witney robert courts that this ability to deploy air force with great agility far from home in more austere setting be a step change for the royal air force allow it to operate from more austere environment rather than solely from its home basis 
 let i rattle through the right hon and learn gentleman ’s question with regard to the matter cover in the precede statement i be sure he will appreciate that as there be an ongoing investigation as you also say mr speaker i be limited in what i can say specifically but i have be emphatically clear in our engagement with china that we will not accept any interference in our democracy and parliamentary system that include the sanctioning of mps and malign activity such as the type of activity allege to have take place i can absolutely confirm that the foreign secretary raise those issue on his recent visit and i reinforce that in my meeting at the g20 
 the right hon and learn gentleman go on to raise the announcement about the partnership for global infrastructure and investment what he fail to mention in his criticism be that that initiative the pgii be create by the uk under our g7 presidency far from be something that we be not part of we be the one who make sure that we be there at its inception again he be as ever jump on the late bandwagon that he can find the pgii initiative will contain a range of different project this particular be also not sign by canada japan or italy for example each and every country will participate in a range of project what do we do to make our contribution as i say we make the single large pledge this country have ever make to the green climate fund why because it be important that we play our part in help country make the transition to net something that we have lead on previously and because of that commitment we will continue to lead on 
 what else do we do we decide to work with other country to improve global food security something that african nation in particular have call on we to do they have welcome our leadership in host a summit later this year which will tackle the cause at its root improve crop yield and the resilience of food supply globally i could go on as ever the right hon and learn gentleman try to find something to score a cheap political point and completely and utterly misunderstand what this country be do as ever he would prefer to talk this country down than recognise the contribution we be make 
 i be happy to address the right hon and learn gentleman ’s comment on the trade deal i think they be tell he ask why do we not just sign it why be it not do i have a flashback to all those conversation when we be leave the eu his approach back then be just to sign any deal that be offer to we we know where that would have lead the right thing to do for the british people be to fight hard for the thing that we need we only need a deal that work for the british people and deliver on our priority that be why it be right not to rush these thing as he would do clearly we do not put arbitrary deadline on they i take the time to make sure that they be right for the british people 
 our track record be there we be the european nation to accede to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership something else the right hon and learn gentleman fail to mention that be the most exciting dynamic trade bloc that exist in the world the asia pacific account for of the world ’s population per cent of good trade pass through that region and it will account for over half of global growth in the come decade now that we have leave the eu we be able to join that trade bloc and it be excited to have we 
 lastly on the right hon and learn gentleman ’s point about brexit again he fail to point out that since we leave the single market we have grow fast than france and germany i will end where i start as ever when it come to these thing he be determined to talk britain down we be demonstrate that britain be lead on the global stage and deliver for the british people 
 before we start today ’s business i want to make a brief statement about a security matter 
 member and other will have see medium report yesterday about a security issue relate to the chinese state and access to this house i understand that the metropolitan police have now confirm that man be arrest in march on suspicion of offence relate to espionage and that they be on police bail until early october 
 as you know we do not discuss the detail of security issue on the floor of the house for reason that be well understand this be an ongoing sensitive investigation and member will of course understand that public discussion of it would be wholly inappropriate however i want to reassure member that the house follow the same vetting procedure as the government that issue raise by the medium story be be address and that our security be work closely and effectively with other relevant authority we keep our security arrangement under review at all time in order to deal with the evolve threat 
 the extremely small number of people who need to know be immediately brief on a strictly confidential basis give the national security of this sensitive matter at this stage i do not wish to say anything far about this issue and i would remind all member of the importance of not discuss security issue on the floor of the house that be particularly important in this case where comment on the identity of those allege to be involve engage in speculation about the case or discuss other detail run a serious risk of prejudice any further prosecution the comment make in the medium be unhelpful something for which i be sure no member would want to be responsible 
 i do not intend to take any point of order on this matter if member have security concern they be of course welcome to raise they outside this chamber with i or with the house security professional or with both 
 order 
 that on the day of september mr speaker do issue his warrant to the clerk of the crown to make out a new writ for the electing of a member to serve in this present parliament for the county constituency of tamworth in the room of christopher john pincher who since his election for the say county constituency have be appoint to the office of steward and bailiff of his majesty ’s manor of northstead in the county of york.—(simon hart 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the retirement a age and b condition for service personnel 
 the thought and prayer of the whole house will be with the secretary of state and his family during sit shiva 
 it be right that we record here today the anniversary of a terrible act that change our world let i also say that the uk be stand with the kingdom of morocco we be engage on the ground already and stand by to help in any way that we can 
 defence recognise the need to evolve so that we continue to attract and retain the very good to that end the mod commission the haythornthwaite review into armed force incentivisation which be publish in june i will respond formally on behalf of the department in the come month but it be supportive of the recommendation on retirement age i have commit to work with official and the single service to review rigid cut off and to consider establish an assessment framework to be use on a case by case basis 
 may i associate myself with the early remark of the minister whom i thank for his answer as he be aware i have already take an interest and write in about this issue i have a constituent who come to i recently have spend a good number of year in the armed force he be very proud of what he have give to keep our country safe but be concern that the armed force particularly the army be lose institutional memory he feel that the cut off age of for reservist be too young certainly for more administrative role will the mod take that into account in the review and consider allow reservist to stay long in those role 
 i be really happy to declare my interest at this point as i be in my year and i remain a reservist i be sympathetic to the point that the hon lady make and we will certainly factor they into our review 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we know that the defence secretary be with his close family today and we in the opposition extend our deep condolence 
 i also offer the secretary of state our warm congratulation over the year and in different role i have shadow he and he have shadow i and we both know that the duty of any government be to keep our country safe i will always look to work with he on that basis in his new job 
 on personnel level of satisfaction with service life have plunge a over the past year what be the plan to lift those record low level of military morale 
 the right hon gentleman paint an overly gloomy picture of life in the armed force for most people it be a rewarding career and they take with they the skill that they need into civilian life and prosper however we be aware of our need to compete in the workplace in the year ahead and to that end we have commission rick haythornthwaite ’s review which we broadly agree with and will respond to very soon 
 i welcome the snp spokesperson to his place 
 thank you mr speaker let i also associate snp members with the word of the minister for the secretary of state at this sad time we also think of morocco and all those new yorkers who be remember today 
 we know that the cost of living crisis be affect we all equally the minister have say some fine word today but we know that for his party there be often an inverse relationship between rhetoric and action with regard to our personnel will the minister tell the house and member of the armed force what his government will do to remedy the shameful reality of armed force personnel be give the low pay rise among public servant a paltry 
 i think the hon gentleman may be in error the low pay member of our armed force be award by the armed forces pay review body a recommendation that we accept in full senior get and those of star rank and above get that will give the good pay award to the least well pay in our armed force 
 i disagree on the number let we talk about the rhetoric from the right hon gentleman unless his government be willing to deal with pay and housing condition for the armed force properly as the armed force personnel leave the force for well pay job could it not be time to consider the reason that the police be able to secure an almost high pay rise than our other uniformed public servant be it because they have a statutory body to represent they in deal with the government and why do his government not support that action 
 the hon gentleman have ignore what i have be say he also do not make reference to the freezing of charge for accommodation and food wraparound childcare and a whole raft of measure that we have introduce to help with the cost of living crisis 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the raf quick reaction alert station 
 royal air force pilot and ground crew be poise on quick reaction alert hour a day day a week   all year round ready to scramble within minute my hon friend would point out quickly that it would be remiss of i to say that that be solely the endeavour of fast jet pilot equally poise be those in his constituency who crew the tanker that must also deploy rapidly to support qra have be launch on occasion in with every incident resolve successfully 
 i thank the minister for his kind word about my constituent he will no doubt have read the report from the select committee on defence aviation procurement wing it which warn of an unacceptable gap in combat air mass with the retirement of the hercules place even more demand on the air mobility force and the voyagers to which he rightly pay tribute be ask to do more and more each month what confidence do he have that if require to do so those force have enough man woman and machine to defend the uk in a peer conflict 
 i have complete confidence that quick reaction alert will be resource the high priority of the air force be to defend the homeland i also have complete confidence that the combat air force as currently structure be capable of perform a very wide range of duty around the world i pay tribute to the work of the air and space commander and his team who through work on agile deployment be find that we can deploy typhoon and f-35 ever more quickly to ever more austere operating environment that drive the productivity of the force even far 
 there be of course no question over the quality of combat aircrew but there be a big question mark over the quantity of aircraft that they can fly i want to challenge the minister on the confidence he have just articulate because there be serious concern that our combat aircrew be engage almost universally in transit and air policing and have very little aircraft availability to practise proper combat air what be his assessment of that concern 
 we take very seriously the work that the defence committee do we enjoy read the committee ’s report and as i hope member of the committee and of the house recognise often take the finding into policy i do push back gently however because in addition to the incredible work of qra and the support the royal air force have give to nato mission over the last month since the start of the war in ukraine they have also be able to support carrier strike deployment deployment on exercise red flag and indeed the deployment of a squadron below full strength all the way across to australia that get to exactly what i tell my hon friend   the member for witney robert courts that this ability to deploy air force with great agility far from home in more austere setting be a step change for the royal air force allow it to operate from more austere environment rather than solely from its home basis 
 what step he be take to help increase the number of uk base job in the defence sector 
 the late estimate suggest that ministry of defence investment support over job in industry across the uk i believe that the good way to keep grow job in defence be to back the british defence industry that be why i be delighted to confirm that this week in london we be host the big ever dsei defence and security equipment international showcase the very good of the british defence industry with company large and small we should remember that they provide not only prosperity in every part of our country but the mean to defend ourselves in an increasingly contested world 
 the defence secretary ’s predecessor rightly prioritise british job over buy off the shelf from america but the times recently expose a difference of opinion with the prime minister who insist on buy american helicopter can the minister assure the house that the secretary of state will stand up for british job and research and development or be our only hope to replace he with my right hon friend   the member for wentworth and dearne john healey 
 debate be ongoing in defence procurement and have be for many year about the difference between buy off the shelf and have our own sovereign capability the fact be that until we bring out the defence and security industrial strategy in arguably the default position of the mod be to go primarily for value for money since dsis we have a more flexible and balanced approach see in many specific procurement where we give much great weighting to social value and local content this be illustrate in many procurement because above all we want to support british job and have our own sovereign capability 
 my condolence to the secretary of state 
 babcock be of the large defence employer in the country but as report in the sunday press its record on refit of surface ship be woeful it take over year to refit the type frigate hms iron duke its record on submarine be even bad take year to refit a trident boat accord to the journal navy lookout which say this online so presumably the russians and the chinese could have read it a few week ago not a single of our attack submarine be at sea they be all tie up alongside this be deeply embarrassing to the department and to the royal navy whose admiral be tear their hair out it be babcock ’s fault will minister get the senior director of babcock into the department for an interview without coffee and ask they to raise their game for the benefit of the navy and the defence of the realm 
 i have the great respect for my right hon friend but he will appreciate that we do not comment on the operational availability of submarine which be a particularly sensitive matter however he be absolutely right that we need to focus on the time it be take to bring ship and all aspect of our fleet back into service i confirm that i regularly engage with babcock and i will visit devonport very soon 
 i welcome the shadow minister maria eagle to her role 
 thank you very much mr speaker 
 the government have waste £ through the mismanagement of defence procurement while fail to deliver vital equipment and oversee the loss of highly skilled job in the defence and aerospace industry since do the minister accept that prevent another year of tory failure be key to increase the number of uk base job in the defence sector back british industry and british military resilience 
 i welcome the right hon lady to her new position as my ministerial shadow we be very proud of our record because in the past year or so we have be face with a war on our doorstep in europe and procurement have rise to the occasion defence equipment and support in abbey wood have deliver kit to ukraine in record speed we have see the acquisition of equipment such as the archer on a quick basis to fit our requirement i absolutely confirm that we be committed to maximise the number of job that come from our procurement while balance that with the need to give our armed force the good possible capability 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and their family 
 the mod deliver a range of service to veteran and their family include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation and tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service defence transition services and integrate personal commissioning for veteran the independent review of those service be publish in july and we will respond in full to the recommendation later this year 
 last october my constituent a disabled veteran who serve with distinction in afghanistan and iraq apply to the war pension and armed force compensation scheme despite his supply all the information require and medical evidence he be still wait for the determination of his case almost month on will my right hon friend look into the case as a matter of urgency and carry out a review of the waiting time for the scheme to make sure that nobody else have to wait such a long time to get their due reward 
 if my hon friend be able to provide further detail of that specific case i would be happy to investigate the late armed force compensation scheme quinquennial review be publish on   july the review process aim to ensure that the scheme remain fit for purpose and to identify opportunity for improvement of the sort that my hon friend highlight the review ’s recommendation be currently be consider i think timeliness be foremost among they and a government response will be publish later this year 
 the royal british legion ’s recent report show that only of disabled veteran who apply for employment and support allowance have their service medical record consider in their work capability assessment i extend my condolence to the defence secretary but what discussion have he have with the secretary of state for work and pensions about this matter and on disregard all military compensation award for means test and income base assessment such as for housing benefit 
 such conversation be live in the context of the work i previously describe we will take into account the hon lady ’s point which have be make by several people in the defence and veteran community i know that people feel strongly about such issue ultimately of course it be a matter for the department for work and pensions and the treasury 
 this house as a whole provide vociferous support for our veteran of all kind particularly through the mechanism of the all party parliamentary group for the armed force perhaps i can take this opportunity to pay tribute to miss amy swash who have now run the appg for i for year but will sadly leave we shortly for other job i thank she for all the work she have do for a superb amount of time in particular to raise the plight of veteran 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and i add my tribute to his i also express my admiration for the armed force parliamentary scheme which do a fantastic job in inform and educate colleague 
 in july the government publish a review of the treatment of lgbtq+ veteran the previous secretary of state ’s response to that win he many plaudit and his reaction be welcome but he do say that he would take his time to ensure we get thing right can the minister give we an update on when we can expect a response to the recommendation 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman he be right to raise that at the time i say that the community should allow we time but not too much time and i be sure they will hold we to that we will respond in full to the large number of recommendation but we be broadly supportive of lord etherton ’s work and there be much in it that we utterly agree with plus some that we would like to add in the way of change for the future 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on that theme the loss of livelihood and the long term suffering endure by lgbt+ veteran due to the cruel and unjust ban on homosexuality in the armed force have be enormous the opposition welcome the etherton review into the ban and its recommendation which represent the beginning of a long overdue healing process the secretary of state ’s predecessor promise that the government would provide a full response to the review ’s recommendation after the summer recess which the house would have an opportunity to debate will the minister confirm when the government will respond to the recommendation and that the house will still be provide with time to debate that response 
 clearly we will be debate this at some length i hope the house when it see the government response to lord etherton ’s recommendation will be pleased with it at the moment we be work with the community particularly fight with pride to ensure that what we put in place be right and be acceptable to those who have be do down by the event between to 
 what step his department be take to deliver nuclear test medal 
 i be pleased to say that the nuclear test medal be now in production and we be ensure that as many as possible of the more than veteran and family who have apply for the medal will have it in time for this year ’s remembrance event 
 the minister will know that i take an interest in the veteran issue and i declare an interest as the president of hinckley ’s royal british legion a constituent alfred roy davenport serve in the raf medical team from november to november station on christmas island he be and concerned about the delay there have be in the awarding of these medal so can my right hon friend confirm that all veteran will have these award ready for remembrance sunday so that our servicemen and woman can be congratulate on and recognise for their service 
 as my right hon friend the minister for veterans affair state in the house on   september the government be do everything possible to ensure that as many nuclear test veteran as possible receive their medal in time for remembrance sunday i appreciate the importance of that a presentation event to award the medal be actively be consider by the office for veterans affairs but it be a balance between issue the medal for remembrance sunday and ensure that they be award in an appropriate manner to this cohort 
 in a write question to the minister i ask whether any file have be remove from the mod ’s health record of nuclear test veteran he assure i that the department be not aware of any removal but many nuclear veteran continue to report find large gap when request their medical record can the minister therefore clarify if the file have not be remove 
 how nuclear veteran and their family can gain full access to they 
 they will need to apply for a subject access request i reiterate what i say in my answer to her write question we of course do everything we can to locate record when people request they and i assure she that we could find none on this occasion 
 what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme 
 the ministry of defence ’s priority remain the relocation of arap eligible afghans to the safety of country at good pace his majesty ’s government continue to accommodate and support arap eligible people in country while they await relocation to the united kingdom 
 i be proud to have an afghan interpreter for the british armed force as a constituent but i be ashamed to learn from he that his brother who work for year directly for the special air service in helmand province have apply under the arap scheme and be reject without a proper explanation he be now in hiding in afghanistan will the minister take up that case as a matter of urgency and will he explain to the house why his government be still fail to support those afghans who risk so much to support our armed force 
 the hon lady mention a specific role about which it would be inappropriate to speculate on the floor of the house i will of course look at the particular case that she mention however it be worth remind right hon and hon colleague that the arap scheme be intend for those who have be in direct support of the uk military interpreter most often and beyond that there be a very narrow opportunity for those with special circumstance who have come through under category when colleague write to the ministry of defence to raise a case they often do so on behalf of somebody who might have serve in the afghan national security force not necessarily in the direct employ of the uk military that be not to cast any judgment on the case that she raise i will look at that specifically and write to she 
 there be a deep sense of injustice among former serve officer and other military personnel that we have forget the moral obligation to afghan military personnel and other who serve alongside we will the minister confirm just how many afghan former military personnel be currently present as homeless in the uk and how many be currently in hotel in pakistan 
 it seem that my initial reply might have be quite useful but the hon gentleman may not have hear or understand it arap be not explicitly for those who serve in the afghan armed force alongside the british military it be for those who serve in the employ of the british military in all but a very narrow number of case i will write to he on his precise question about afghan service personnel who be now homeless in the uk i suspect that they be remarkably few but afghan service personnel be not the main target of arap as someone who serve in afghanistan i share the sense of many of my former colleague who would have like to have do more but that be simply never what arap be design to do neither be it credible that the hundred of thousand of people who serve in the afghan national force could all be relocate to the uk 
 in i hold a public meeting shortly after the evacuation from afghanistan it be widely attend by worried and distressed resident who all want help for their relative desperate situation in afghanistan over year have pass and there be huge problem with arap can the minister say why the government be allow people and their relative to suffer for so long 
 there be a know number of people who work in the employ of the british military during our campaign in afghanistan our priority have be to work through and match the list of people we know have work for we with those who be applicant it be my understanding that only about application be outstanding and that decision have be take in the past month alone overwhelmingly those decision be i be afraid to say no to people but we be make good progress and be near the end of track down all those we know have work for we 
 i return to the question raise by my hon friend   the member for warwick and leamington matt western how many applicant be still be kick out of hotel in the uk and how many be apply from pakistan and in hiding 
 the member for warwick and leamington matt western   ask a very particular question about afghan service personnel as the record will show i answer it but i will need to go away and confirm because that be not something that arap be intend to meet and we will need to see if we can find those statistic the hon lady ask how many applicant have be remove from hotel the plan be to remove all arap applicant from hotel because they be not here illegally they have not arrive on boat across the channel they be entitle to be here they have access to full universal credit and housing benefit and much more importantly they have the right to work immediately on arrival our priority unapologetically i hope she agree that this be the right approach be to get people out of hotel and into house where they can get on with the life that they so deserve here in the uk as legal citizen 
 it be hardly in the spirit of operation warm welcome that as the anniversary of the evacuation of kabul pass afghans who support   our armed force be still leave crowd into hotel at the taxpayer ’s expense or expect to move hundred of mile from where they have manage to find employment and their child have settle into school when do the minister now expect all afghans in the scheme to be move out of hotel and give suitable offer of accommodation 
 i actually agree with the hon lady her question stand in contrast with the previous because it be about the need to get people out of hotel not suggest that they should somehow be stay in they the minister for veterans affairs have be lead on this task around government few in this house have more emotional energy to drive that mission than he do he see it as of huge importance that people be move out of hotel and allow to get on with their life as quickly as possible i will ask his office to write to the hon lady with the exact detail of when he hop to see the job do 
 i commend to the defence team and indeed the house the new book by larisa brown the gardener of lashkar gah which outline in great detail the sort of debt we owe to the people who try to help our force my specific question be not about people serve with the afghan force it be about whether we have a proper database of all those who serve with the british force and be eligible under the scheme and whether the minister can guarantee that the scheme will not be close while some of those people probably a large number of they be still in hiding in afghanistan and thus unable to apply for it 
 it will not surprise my right hon friend to know that the people who work for the british armed force over our extended period in afghanistan appear on many different list and part of the job of work over the past month or so have be to consolidate those into an authoritative list of those whom we know to have work for we however we do have very good record as would expect the military to have keep that allow we to focus our search on people whom we know to be eligible within the pile of application and of late to make rapid progress in inform those who be ineligible we will of course keep the scheme open for as long as it take to find all of those whom we know work for we 
 i thank the minister for his consider remark will he join i in thank both colchester city council and essex county council for their work in support many afghan national locally who have be in hotel since last autumn the council have aid those people to get into housing however we still have family and individual who need to be support in temporary accommodation as such can the minister give assurance to the house about the cross government work that be take place to ensure that those family come out of hotel and become settle and in particular the work that his department be lead on help to get afghans into employment so that they can settle in the united kingdom 
 i can absolutely give my right hon friend the assurance she ask for give her previous role in government she know well than anybody   that those man and woman who have come here have every legal right to start work and to settle in the uk they deserve their journey here on the back of what they do in support of our armed force so we will support they while they be in hotel and well still once we have get they settle in more permanent accommodation we will support they into employment i will make sure that the minister for veterans affair brief my right hon friend on his work on that matter 
 what step he be take to ensure the uk meet its obligation to nato 
 our commitment to nato be unwavere we have strengthen our force posture in estonia station a light cavalry squadron in poland provide the nato mission in kosovo with personnel surveillance and reconnaissance capability and provide specialist personnel to the nato mission in iraq the national flagship hms queen elizabeth sail over the weekend and will shortly fly the nato flag as the nato flagship while on operation in the euro atlantic we contribute to every nato mission declare our nuclear deterrent to nato and consistently spend at least of gross domestic product on defence we will maintain our lead position in nato over the decade ahead 
 i place on record my condolence to the current defence secretary and my thank to the former defence secretary whom we wish well in whatever he undertake to do 
 i thank the minister for his full response he will know that nato ’s obligation be to work with partner so can he say what discussion he have have with his counterpart in nato about work with the african union to ensure stability and security in that region 
 colleague have rightly offer their condolence to the new secretary of state and remark on the anniversary of but the thing that have maybe fall through the crack be for we to send our regard to the former secretary of state with whom i have the great pleasure of work for and a half year his effort and contribution to defence be quite extraordinary and i think he will be remember in history as of the great secretaries of state he should be very proud of everything he achieve 
 the right hon lady be absolutely right that nato ’s southern flank africa be of enormous importance to europe and the security of the euro atlantic it will not surprise she to know that in the wake of the coup over the summer in both niger and gabon conversation among european defence ministers and nato defence ministers have be regular and urgent as people seek to understand what the response could be it do not look like it be in which nato would be to the fore but it be clearly in nato ’s interest that a european response in africa to these coup be forthcoming 
 i send my condolence to the secretary of state 
 as my right hon friend know membership of nato require an expenditure of of gdp this be an arbitrary and paltry figure bear in mind the threat that we all face what discussion be he have with other nato partner many of which be not even spend the to increase their spending on defence 
 i steer my hon friend to the communiqué from the vilnius summit which be very clear that nato country that be not yet spend need urgently to increase their spending to do so our prime minister have go far and indicate his willingness to spend on defence once the economic circumstance allow i think that that be the right order because we can not have physical security without economic security 
 i call the shadow minister 
 after year of tory army cut serious and senior military figure be now question the uk ’s ability to deliver our nato obligation while nato be boost the size of its high readiness force from to follow putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine uk ministers plan to cut the army far to the small since the napoleonic era the last conservative defence secretary tell this house that the government have hollow out and underfunde our armed force be that still the position of the ministry of defence and will the tory army cut still be force through by this late set of ministers 
 the former secretary of state ’s comment which the shadow minister conveniently quote in a limited way be that successive government have fail to invest in the enabler that underpin our war fight capability it be to the credit of this prime minister and the conservative prime ministers who go before he that commitment have be make to grow our defence budget include under prime minister johnson a £ increase to the defence budget and under this prime minister another £ in the last year or so the shadow minister also ignore this when he say that nato be increase its rapid reaction force that do not mean that in nato army be grow it just mean that the army in nato be commit ever more of the force they have to nato ’s high readiness formation the british army be to the fore in that 
 what step his department be take to ensure that the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme be effective 
 i say in may to the house that we aim to process all outstanding initial arap application by the end of august i can report that we have just complex case remain from more than principal application that we receive we have issue over decision to applicant in the past month give they the clarity they deserve and we continue to move at good pace to process the remain application 
 i thank my right hon friend and his ministerial colleague for the work do over the summer include with hillingdon and harrow council in my constituency on support for those who have serve in support of our armed force in future as afghan bridge operation come to a close can he commit to work with local authority to ensure that those who have put their life on the line support our military operation continue to be support in their new life here in the uk 
 i certainly can mr speaker 
 what liaising do the minister do with the home office i have an afghan special force interpreter who come here have do valiant work during operation pitting his mother father and sibling leave afghanistan and end up in ukraine of all place and they move to the uk last year the home office give they temporary leave to remain only for they to receive a letter in the past couple of month say that they would have to be deport back to either afghanistan ukraine or rwanda in that case i intercede and the minister ’s office help but what be go on between his department and the home office 
 from the question i can see all sort of way in which that might present quite a confusing case to colleague in the home office especially if those in ukraine proceed to the uk under a mechanism other than the afghan relocation and assistance policy may i look at the detail of the case and come back to the right hon gentleman rather than speculate 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel 
 the government continue to invest significant sum to improve the quality of uk service family accommodation with £ invest over financial year and combine and £ in the forecast for this financial year be £ 
 ofsted chief inspector amanda spielman have repeatedly say that she have deep concern about the continue failure to improve service accommodation for armed force recruit over the past year will the minister explain why those concern from neutral ofsted inspector amanda spielman have fall on deaf ear and why those improvement be yet to be make 
 this be an extremely important subject and we care immensely about improve our estate such concern do not fall on deaf ear if that be the case we would not have put on the table a furth £ for sfa in the defence command paper refresh precisely because of that additional funding this year our spend will be almost double that of last year 
 the prime minister say he be go to lead by example and that when it come to the military base at catterick he be go to ensure that illegal migrant be house there we now understand that the general have say they do not want a bunch of afghans and iraqis next to their squaddie so nothing be happen with regard to illegal migrant be put there although the ministry of defence be so determined that its soldier should not   be place near migrant that it be move they out of raf scampton when will illegal migrant be place in catterick as promise by the prime minister i want a date and i want it now 
 i visit catterick on friday and i discuss precisely that matter with senior member of the armed force base at catterick the characterisation that my right hon friend use be not correct these matter be be consider objectively and carefully but that work be ongoing 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the defence infrastructure organisation in meet the need of injure veteran when adapt service accommodation 
 the defence infrastructure organisation provide additional need and disability adaptation to service family accommodation those provide change to sfa to meet a family ’s need as set out by a suitably qualified healthcare professional once the scope of any adaptation have be agree with all party work will be deliver as quickly as possible that give service personnel reassurance that their family need can be meet wherever they be assign regardless of the length and number of posting they have within their service career 
 the minister will remember that in june i ask about a badly injure veteran in my constituency he have write confirmation from the former defence minister in that he would receive extensive adaptation to his home those adaptation have not happen and the situation be so serious that op courage have instigate safeguard proceeding against the ministry of defence to protect my constituent in june the minister request that i write to he i do so yet again but i still have not receive a reply will the minister meet i finally to sort this out in do so will he reassure the house that a conservative minister ’s word be worth the paper it be sign on 
 i think that be a little harsh i have discuss this matter with the hon lady and i would of course be more than happy to meet she to discuss her constituent ’s case far she will forgive i if i do not share the detail with the house 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i be privileged to attend the invictus game this weekend in düsseldorf it be truly humble to meet inspire individual who have triumph in adversity i take the opportunity to discuss with my ukrainian counterpart the care and rehabilitation of veteran and the uk ’s unwavere support for her country 
 there be more than former member of the armed force in the south west many of whom reside in my constituency of east devon we must ensure that every veteran can access the service they need when they leave the service can my right hon friend update the house on the progress be make towards deliver id card to all veteran by remembrance day this year 
 my hon friend will be aware that phase of this project be already complete which be to say that as people leave the armed force they be issue with their veteran card those who leave before december should get their card by the end of this year a veteran do not require a card to prove their status there be several way to verify service and the lack of a card should not act as a barrier to access support but i recognise the importance of this card for many in particular as a form of prove their identity and accessing service 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 as minister know uk unity on ukraine stay strong and the government will continue to have labour ’s full support on military aid ukrainians be now urgently ask for more to help their current counter offensive to succeed and since january the prime minister have repeatedly pledge to accelerate ukraine ’s support when will this happen 
 the right hon gentleman will know full well that the united kingdom be probably the lead nation on many front among our european peer financially in term of kit and in support the people who be conduct the fight against putin ’s aggression we will continue to do that and at the weekend in düsseldorf i reiterate that to my ukrainian counterpart i do not think anybody could be in any doubt that the united kingdom be lead europe on this front and we will continue to do so 
 but i fear uk leadership on ukraine be flag the uk government have commit £ yet germany have now commit € the uk ’s tank have now be dwarf by from poland and last week ’s decision to proscribe wagner as a terrorist group be take by the european union month ago will the minister accept that we must accelerate uk military support and redouble the uk ’s defence diplomacy to maintain western unity and solidarity 
 the uk government prefer action rather than word and i point to the ukrainians we be train to storm shadow and to the fact that kit be go out the door right now and be use on the ground rhetoric be thing action be another in that way i be afraid that the right hon gentleman have to admit that the uk be continue to lead europe   we will certainly do so go forward and there can be no doubt that ukrainians themselves appreciate the strength and rigour of uk 
 order this be topical i decide how quick they will be i do not need any help from those on the front bench can we please make sure we get back benchers in if not tell i which you do not want to allow in 
 continuity of education allowance be an important recruitment and retention facility for the armed force but it have not keep up with inflation in recent year can the minister commit to ensure that cea level be not erode in the future 
 cea be an important way of make sure that the education of service child be not disrupt to that end i have ask for a review of cea to make sure it be fit for purpose and i will have the result of that review later this year 
 it be year since the attack on the sir galahad in the falklands conflict in which die and many more be injure ever since survivor have seek transparency about what happen but they need document declassify in full will ministers commit like the previous secretary of state to read the paper with a view to declassify will they also meet my constituent mike hermanis and other survivor to discuss that 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question yes i can commit to meet she and her constituent if she wish to do so 
 a key question from the ukrainian theatre be about the effectiveness and lethality of emerge drone technology what step be be take to ensure that nato have world class compatible deployable drone to meet emerge threat 
 my hon friend ask an excellent question it must be clear to everyone just from what be available on social medium that uncrewe air system as they be call have an extraordinary impact in theatre i reassure he that we be work on a strategy to look at how we can make the most of this capability to ensure that above all we have our own cutting edge sovereign capability 
 the ajax fighting vehicle be prove to be something of a stealth weapon when will the government produce or provide the house with a statement explain where we be up to with the project and when it will be deliver to the frontline 
 i do give a statement to the house i do not know whether the hon gentleman be present in which i confirm that we would learn the lesson of the sheldon review but above all confirm the good news that ajax be with the field army for regular training i hear that that training be go extremely well 
 deal with the challenge that armed force family face be vital for strong defence i make a promise to many of the family i be privileged to meet during the live in our shoe review that the recommendation would not gather dust how can i find out where we be on recommendation and for example 
 my hon friend will forgive i if i do not know off the top of my head what those recommendation relate to i can say to he that defence be very fortunate in have he and his colleague as co author of the report on the armed force family strategy steering group act as critical friend and hold defence to account against the strategy action plan i would be more than happy to meet he to go through those recommendation by 
 what assessment have be make of the extent of the use of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete within defence estate building have any assessment be make at faslane naval base 
 at the moment we be not release specific detail because the work be ongoing but i assure he and the house on point the defence infrastructure organisation have be undertake a huge amount of work in fact there have be work on raac in the mod context since most importantly we be not aware of any impact from raac on service family accommodation 
 do my hon friend agree that it be vital that we back british military manufacturer what step be he take to speed up delay procurement decision will he visit north devon to meet some of the innovative supplier manufacture here in the uk 
 it be good news on both front for my hon friend yes a lot of work be go on to improve the speed of procurement i be also pleased to confirm that i have already a visit plan to her part of the world in a couple of week i will liaise with her office about meet those company 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 today mark the anniversary of and while our focus now have return to state aggression do the minister agree that the threat of islamic extremism whether home grown or from abroad remain and that our defence posture should reflect that 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right although the focus of the mod and so many other part of the government have increasingly be on hostile state actor over the last few year today more than any be a reminder of the threat of violent extremism i pay tribute to the hundred of man and woman around the uk armed force who be deploy on mission counter violence and extremism as i speak 
 will the minister update the house on the progress be make to settle the claim of thousand of veteran and their family for what be commonly call gulf war syndrome 
 the hon member be right to raise that the armed force compensation scheme be up and run for they i be afraid that there have be delay in some of those application i refer to that early on on the science behind it obviously we in defence comply with the good available as assess by the independent medical expert group and we will make policy accordingly i understand the point he be make and would be happy to discuss it with he far 
 ukrainian and uk defence company be go up against barrier and bureaucracy when try to set up joint working and joint project could my hon friend update the house on how he be reduce that so that bilateral collaboration can be make easy and quick 
 my hon friend have be an absolute champion of all matter relate to our relationship with ukraine we have see very rapid procurement particularly in relation to urgent requirement go into abbey wood in his constituency i understand that he will hold a meeting shortly with some major ukrainian defence industrialist which he have kindly invite i to and i look forward to engage with he and those company soon 
 last september   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss   announce £ to be make available for ukraine in this financial year we be now in another september with a new secretary of state when can we expect that sum of money to be make available to ukraine 
 the prime minister engage with world leader all the time to discuss what be need in ukraine and he have an extraordinarily close relationship with president zelensky both my right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss   and prime minister johnson deliver on their commitment the prime minister continue to do exactly the same he will be at the dispatch box in about an hour and perhaps ukraine might be mention 
 i be sure the minister will agree that our veteran make some of the good role model in society will he applaud my constituent bill cooksey who at the age of complete the great north run this weekend on behalf of nhs charity 
 what can i say i certainly congratulate bill on complete the great north run at such an extraordinary age i admire he hugely and i congratulate he 
 the previous secretary of state promise that he would come to david brown santasalo in huddersfield to see the wonderful work that the company do produce the defence equipment that we need will of the team be able to fulfil that promise 
 it be always a pleasure to engage with the hon gentleman if i can not visit that specific company i intend to hold forum for small and medium sized enterprise around the country the next be in wales but we will certainly hold they in his part of the world and i will let he know the detail 
 while ukraine continue to combat putin ’s aggression on the battlefield there be no let up in russia ’s nefarious campaign of espionage and subversion against western democracy that threat and the so call grey zone span the public private and defence sector aim to continually challenge our critical national infrastructure capability what work be the mod do across government departments and the private and public sector to combat hybrid threat 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be helpful that the deputy prime minister be sit on the front bench as i answer her question because he lead the necessary cross government effort of which defence play an enormous part the national security act have be pass as have the national security investment act and there be £ of investment through the national cyber strategy defence support his majesty ’s government ’s activity apply defence lever to protect uk crucial interest from state threat by deny and defer adversary attack 
 order i will get a sore throat if we carry on like this 
 of the great problem that my veteran constituent have be housing accommodation it be as scarce as hen ’s tooth as we would say back home what discussion have the minister have with the housing executive in northern ireland to secure funding and housing for veteran who have just finish service or be retire 
 clearly we want to improve service accommodation all the time however of service accommodation meet or exceed the decent home standard that be admirable compare with the record of many local authority we be invest in accommodation and it be improve all the time i very much regret the occasional report of accommodation that fall short of the mark and we seek to rectify it as soon as we can 
 we have hear this afternoon how important the continuity of education allowance be for service family do the minister assess that labour ’s propose attack on private school will make it easy or hard to educate service child 
 it would certainly make it far more expensive it would also threaten small school like warminster school in my constituency which rely very much on service family i just reflect on the sacrifice make by all people i know who choose to send their child to independent school and in particular member of the defence community who be of course require to make a substantial contribution to their child ’s education in the event that they choose to educate they in the independent sector 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on claim relate to an ongoing counter terrorism police investigation that be report in the sunday times yesterday   sunday september the story allege that individual include a parliamentary researcher have be arrest on charge of conduct espionage on behalf of china 
 these be serious allegation and it be right that they be be thoroughly investigate by the police and relevant agency we must not hamper their work or prejudice any future legal process by what we say today as i believe mr speaker you say at the beginning of today ’s proceeding as you would expect i to say it would therefore be inappropriate for i to comment on any specific aspect of the active investigation itself i would however point the house to what the metropolitan police say in their own statement 
 the investigation be be carry out by officer from the met ’s counter terrorism command which have responsibility for investigation relate to allegation of official secrets act and espionage relate offence 
 of course any decision on whether to proceed with a prosecution under the official secrets act and related legislation would be a matter for the crown prosecution service 
 it remain an absolute priority for the government to take all necessary step to protect the united kingdom from any foreign state activity which seek to undermine our national security prosperity and democratic value the government have be clear that china represent a systemic challenge to the united kingdom and to our value that have be evidence in china ’s continued disregard for universal human right and international commitment in xinjiang its erasure of dissent voice and stifle of opposition under its new national security law in hong kong and disturbing report of chinese coercion and intimidation in the south china sea we be clear eyed about that challenge and we must be able to look the chinese in the eye and call out unacceptable behaviour directly just as our prime minister be able to do this with premier li at the g20 summit in new delhi this weekend an approach that have also be take consistently by our eyes ally 
 action speak louder than word and that be why i take the decision to instruct department to cease deployment of all surveillance equipment subject to china ’s national intelligence law from sensitive government site in november last year it be of the reason why i ban tiktok from government device the government investigate and call out the so call chinese overseas police service station and as the minister for security my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat set out in a statement to this house in june instruct the chinese embassy to close they we significantly reduce chinese involvement in the uk ’s civil nuclear sector include take ownership of china ’s stake in the sizewell c nuclear power project and as digital secretary i take the decision to ban huawei from our g network 
 this afternoon the procurement bill be be debate in the other place the bill will include national security debarment provision that will enable we to act when we   see malign influence in our public procurement in take this approach we be align with our eyes ally and other g7 partner indeed every single g7 partner 
 the uk will deploy again an aircraft carrier to the indo pacific in we have announce aukus a new security partnership that will promote a free and open indo pacific that be secure and stable and we will work with italy and japan through the global combat air programme to adapt and respond to the security threat of the future through an unprecedented international aerospace coalition 
 these houses of parliament stand as a monument to the freedom of expression and belief that underpin our value but just as these institution have provide the paradigm for so many modern democracy there be still those who fear such freedom and who seek to undermine they and to interfere in our society we maintain constant vigilance in our effort to understand and root out that interference and we will always take action to address it whatever its source 
 in the government establish the defend democracy taskforce a group that work to co ordinate across government to protect the integrity of our democracy from threat of foreign interference it be engage across government with parliament the uk ’s intelligence community the devolve administration local authority the private sector and civil society on the full range of threat face our democratic institution those threat include foreign interference in the electoral process disinformation physical and cyber threat to democratic institution and those who represent they foreign interference in public office political party and our university and transnational repression in the united kingdom 
 early this year the government pass the national security act which have overhaul legislation applicable to espionage sabotage and any person act for foreign power against the safety and interest of the united kingdom the measure in the act will enable our law enforcement and intelligence agency to deter detect and disrupt the full range of modern day threat include threat from china new offence in the act will enable the disruption of illegitimate influence conduct for or on behalf of foreign state whether design to advance their interest or to harm the united kingdom the united kingdom government will do whatever it take to protect our national security and this nation 's democratic institution which have stand for century as a beacon of liberty wherever the threat may come from 
 i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and for advance sight of it 
 maintain national security in the face of threat to our value and our democracy be the duty of any government in respect of which labour stand ready always to work on a cross party basis to keep our country safe i pay tribute to all those in our intelligence and security service and police and those across   government and beyond who work to protect our national security on the anniversary of the awful attack of as we remember those lose we be in no doubt about the seriousness of the work that they do 
 we recognise too the seriousness of the allegation involve espionage on behalf of china at the heart of our democracy it be essential that the police the intelligence agency and the justice system be able to do their job and we must support they as they do so however we need to know more about what action the government be take against attempt by other state to interfere in our democracy and undermine our security mi5 issue an interference alert about the chinese communist party attempt to influence parliament month ago the security service and other have also raise wide concern the minister refer to the prime minister raise strong concern with china about unacceptable interference do the prime minister do so at the time of those arrest or have he only do so now since they have be make public 
 the government set up the defend democracy taskforce to look at foreign interference but what have it actually do be the minister on it have it produce a report for the national security council as be promise have it look at vetting level and delay the government oppose the lords amendment to the national security bill that be put forward to introduce strong check on donation to political party to ensure no foreign influence and they oppose labour ’s proposal to close the loophole on shell company have the taskforce look at those measure why be it not act in that area 
 what be be do about national security prisoner it beggar belief that daniel khalife be charge with national security offence but be able to escape under a van can the minister confirm that even though this individual have already evade arrest for week when the police try to apprehend he he still end up in a category b prison can he also confirm report that in another prisoner be able to escape from wandsworth prison also by hide underneath a van have the review be complete of all national security prisoner those on remand and those convict to see what level of prison security be in place if not why not 
 i want to ask the minister about the wide issue of the risk to our national security from other state he have rightly take action on sensitive surveillance equipment and i be glad that minister have accept labour ’s proposal on procurement in his statement he rightly talk of the systemic challenge that china pose include on human right but the statement say nothing about the work of the investment security unit what be it do nor do the statement say anything about the comprehensive approach we need to the risk to our critical national infrastructure even though the head of mi5 have give a series of warning and the intelligence and security committee be extremely critical in its report in july warn of the lack of a proper strategy on china and of short termism we need to engage with china on climate change and global issue but we also need to be robust about defend our national security that be why the shadow foreign secretary have call for a full audit of china ’s relationship and why   we have support the national security act but also raise concern about iran pursue kidnap and murder threat and russia pursue cyber attack 
 we recognise that after and the appalling terror attack on the country come together the then labour government work on a major counter terror strategy the contest strategy involve everyone across government the police the intelligence agency local government and the private sector the contest strategy have endure and have strong cross party support but the government have be warn for year about rise state challenge so where be the contest strategy for state threat we will support the government in produce and a labour government would work cross party to produce but where be it we need a contest strategy on state risk state challenge and state threat to protect our national security national security be too important to ignore warning we need urgent action to defend our national security 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for the overall constructive approach with which she have address this issue it be important that we treat issue such as this on a cross party basis in defence of our democratic institution and it be timely that this statement should be make on the anniversary of i will endeavour to address the point that she have raise and i will be happy to write to she on any point that i inadvertently miss out 
 the prime minister and the foreign secretary regularly raise with their chinese opposite number chinese interference in democratic institution this be an ongoing approach that have be go on for some time 
 the right hon lady ask about the defend democracy taskforce which be lead by my right hon friend the minister for security it report into the national security council on which i sit and we receive regular update on the work that he be do work with departments across government not least the department for levelling up housing and communities which be responsible for large element of electoral integrity the devolve administration local authority and other matter the purpose of the taskforce be to bring together all those different element to pursue a whole of government and whole of society approach when address those threat 
 the principal purpose of the investment security unit be to provide advice to i as the quasi judicial decision maker in respect of acquisition that may invoke national security question i take advice from the unit on whether the government should intervene and we have issue direction in respect of acquisition in the past year that be to say we be ask company to take action the hard be to block the acquisition but it could be some other remedial action more than half of those direction be in respect of chinese company 
 the right hon lady be entirely right to raise the question of critical national infrastructure on which i have work very closely with the head of mi5 and other country around the world be look again at their critical national infrastructure particularly in relation to the threat of cyber crime which often have a blurred link with hostile state i take cyber crime very seriously and i chair regular meeting on it we be constantly up the work we do against a background in which the external threat continue to rise 
 the government will very shortly respond to the isc ’s report the draft be with ministers and it be about to be sign off i hope it will be with the house this week 
 the right hon lady rightly raise point about iran and russia particularly in relation to cyber but also across a whole range of issue as part of our overall approach we have do thing we have try to give the agency a public face with which to interface with business and private citizen in a whole of society approach for example gchq now work through the national cyber security centre to advise business and individual on cyber risk equally we have just create the national protective security authority which essentially enable mi5 to interface with business and individual on protective security those agency work through the cabinet office and particularly with the home office and the foreign office work across the range of issue that particularly arise in relation to iran and russia 
 although we take this investigation very seriously and it clearly should be conduct independently i reassure the right hon lady and the house that the government be take a whole of society approach across all these issue to strengthen our defence against rise threat 
 i call the chair of the isc 
 without refer to any specific case may i gently remind the government that their initial response to the isc ’s substantial and wide range report on the national security threat from china publish just month ago be to suggest that our finding might be out of date will the deputy prime minister therefore confirm that the full government response when it come we gather it be come very soon will set out specific step to address the threat of chinese interference particularly within our democratic system 
 the short answer be yes i have review the response and i be content that it do exactly that it will be with my right hon friend shortly 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it be timely that we be have a security update today my thought and the thought of my colleague be with all those impact by on its anniversary 
 i be glad the deputy prime minister mention the issue relate to sensitive government site and camera but member on both side of the house have to ask question on hikvision for month before the government take any action will they commit to act more quickly in future and will the procurement bill as he state allow that to happen 
 i be glad to hear that the response to the isc report be come will the government also commit to implement the recommendation of the isc report on russian interference in british politic hopefully that response will also come soon 
 to turn to some specific question when do the deputy prime minister himself learn of these allegation and arrest why do mps only learn of this from the times will the government institute as soon as possible a review into the decision make process that lead to mps not be tell in order that such critical update be give to mps in future and that this decision make process be never allow to happen again 
 order we have to be very careful here this be a major security issue and it would be wrong to expect to break all that in order to brief mp the mp who need to be tell be tell and work very closely on this please be very careful i think my early statement address some of the point but if need be we can re address thing 
 thank you mr speaker on the point that the hon lady raise we take an evidence base approach to action it be right that minister take action not on a hunch or an intuition but on the basis of detailed analysis provide to we by the agency and by other that be precisely the approach we take in relation to hikvision and other china base company subject to china ’s national security law 
 on when i or other learn about this as mr speaker say in a number of the point he make member would not expect i to give the house a run commentary on intelligence briefing that i have receive but the house would expect i to be brief on all matter 
 in conclusion i will make a broad point about parliamentary security we have the parliamentary security department and it work very closely with the agency to support member of parliament include with general advice if member have specific concern they can raise those with the psd that be the correct approach which respect the division between parliament and government and the independence of the house 
 these be extremely worrying report about the level of infiltration of chinese support force into our democracy do my right hon friend agree that we need to recognise that china be the large threat both to the world and to the uk on freedom and democracy do he not agree that the government should designate it as such 
 may i begin by pay tribute to my right hon friend for all the work she do in this space particularly when she be foreign secretary she be absolutely right to say that china represent a systemic challenge to our interest and value and it be also for example the no state base threat to our economic security the government be absolutely clear eyed about the threat that this nation face and we be robust in take action indeed that be why i personally take the decision in respect of ban huawei from our g network and in respect of chinese cctv technology and tiktok we will continue to take whatever step be necessary base on appropriate advice to provide that protection for our nation and our democratic institution 
 a key part of democracy be the ability to scrutinise the executive as the chair of the intelligence and security committee say no ’s response to our china report be to pooh pooh it and say that it be out of date i understand   that the government response be due today but have now be put off the defend democracy taskforce have be mention we have ask for an update on that but be meet with radio silence the prime minister have on his desk our report on international partnership he have have it on his desk for nearly month now he usually have day in which to respond so when will we get that sign off may i just say to the deputy prime minister that if he be talk about security and democracy in the term he have that have to include proper scrutiny there be a long list of example of where this government be try to avoid it 
 proper scrutiny be provide by the intelligence and security committee i certainly take the report produce by the isc very seriously—[interruption i be fully aware of the membership of the committee to reassure opposition members it be precisely because we take the recommendation so seriously that the committee will receive a comprehensive response address all these point include an update on the defend democracy taskforce 
 it be appal news that we have a potential espionage cell operate in and around westminster as a sanctioned individual alongside many of my colleague i be particularly perturb by the news notwithstanding that this should not perhaps come as a surprise as the isc chair by my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis have warn that the government be ill prepared and that the necessary security measure be not available 
 i ask the secretary of state a specific question when be the foreign secretary tell about the investigation be it before he go to beijing if he go to beijing with this knowledge do he raise it with his counterpart there it be important to know that with respect it be no good come to the dispatch box and tell we that we do not talk about such matter the prime minister do so yesterday and the investigation be not complete what do the foreign secretary do 
 i say to the secretary of state that the problem lie in the mess we have get into over whether we define china as a threat or not if it be a threat why do we not call it that take the action that be necessary to deal with it on that basis and sanction some people 
 my right hon friend who be a former cabinet minister and current privy counsellor know full well that the government do not provide a running commentary on update and intelligence receive by ministers i can assure he that the foreign secretary regularly raise electoral interference and interference with our democratic institution with his chinese opposite number specific case particularly those that be subject to an ongoing police investigation would not as be generally the case be raise on the wide principle we have be robust and clear eyed in address and raise these point with our chinese opposite number 
 on the action we have take i set out the step that i take in respect of tiktok and huawei and i pay tribute to my right hon friend ’s support for the   telecommunications security act which we get to a very good place there be not just that act but the national security act the national security and investment act and the deployment of the carrier fleet all those thing have happen in the past short number of year they be evidence of the seriousness with which the government take this threat 
 the deputy prime minister say that he hold the intelligence and security committee in very high regard on that basis will he commit to the recommendation that it make in its recent report on china about update the guideline of the advisory committee on business appointments in relation to intelligence and security particularly reference china how will he ensure that they be enforce 
 as i say in answer to a previous question the full response to the isc will be come shortly an important point have be raise in respect of acoba for which i have overall ministerial responsibility in the cabinet office i will take that away and discuss it with the chair of that committee sir eric pickles formerly of this house 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and i support the action that the government be take on the issue of transparency and accountability will the datum regard the volume of prosecution and conviction under exist legislation and the new national security act be collate and make available to the house so that we can track the scale of hostile state action also have the government decide on any necessary change to the memorandum of understanding with the isc as they be require to at least consider under section of that act 
 i do not think i have have chance from the dispatch box to pay a genuine heartfelt tribute to my immediate predecessor as deputy prime minister have do the job for a few month i have a particular appreciation of all the work that my right hon friend do when he be in that post 
 in respect of the volume of prosecution and conviction we seek to be as transparent as we can be with the house i be sure it be something that we can take away and look at with a desire to do as my right hon friend ask i can not give he a firm commitment at the dispatch box but if it be possible i shall seek to do so 
 we keep the mou with the isc under review we do not have any current plan to change it but we keep it under review 
 yet again we be watch the horse disappear over the horizon and shut the stable door behind it every time we act to take on china everything the deputy prime minister boast about be always state reactively just for once could we get ahead of the curve and take action in relation to genomic and as i and other have be urge for month now designate it as part of our critical national infrastructure so that in a few month time we be not again have to explain another failure 
 i say gently to the right hon gentleman that he do serve in government and in cabinet for year from to so he and other   member of his party need to bear some responsibility for the decision make although i would think that they would take pride in the decision that we take more recently under this majority conservative government we have take a huge range of step include pass the national security act and the national security and investment act 
 the right hon gentleman raise a legitimate point about genomic and its relevance to critical national infrastructure it be not currently designate as such but in my role in the cabinet office i keep the register of critical national infrastructure under review and i be explore the matter 
 may i thank you personally mr speaker for the care and support you have show to those of we who have be sanction by china we be in the frontline of this threat but i have to say that neither before nor after these revelation have any of we be offer a briefing by the parliamentary security authority or by the foreign office or home office in fact i find out more about this character from my son who happen to be at university with they than from anything i have be tell formally 
 i do not want to mention the current incident but do want to note that it be now a year on from when mi5 take the almost unprecedented step of issue a security service interference alert about a character work within parliament for which there be no consequence it be about a year on from the revelation about the activity of the chinese consul general in manchester who think it be his job to attack demonstrator for which there be no expulsion no consequence it be month on from the recent revelation about the activity of the confucius institutes which the government pledge to abolish there have be no consequence no abolition again nothing have happen and it be just a couple of week since the foreign secretary promise that he would take up the case of the sanction mps and of jimmy lai with the chinese foreign minister yet he come away with nothing there have be no consequence 
 be not the problem that for all the tough talk there be no consequence and the chinese know that there will be no consequence may i ask the deputy prime minister this will china be in the enhance tier of the foreign agent registration scheme 
 may i deal with the specific question and then reflect on the wide point we be currently review the country in the enhance tier i think there be a strong case to be make but my hon friend would not expect i to make that announcement from the dispatch box before we have go through the proper process 
 on my hon friend ’s wide point about the parliamentary security directorate we as a government stand ready to provide any further support that mps feel they require if my hon friend feel that he require further briefing i be very happy to help to facilitate that with the house 
 may i extend my genuine sympathy to the conservative colleague who appear to have be target by a suspect chinese   spy who be employ in parliament and pay for out of public fund i do know what they be feel the house will be aware 
 order i be not sure that be the case i think that be quite a bit of speculation i would stick to a general question rather than try to go into the detail of what may have happen 
 thank you mr speaker i do say suspect 
 the house will be aware that the subject of the security alert last year christine lee be never arrest have never be charge with spying or indeed any other offence and be say by the previous home secretary to have do nothing criminal however there be a court case pende i understand that ms lee have take out a civil suit against the government will the deputy prime minister update the house on when that case be likely to be hear and what the government hope to learn from it 
 i be not quite sure what to say in response to that question in the light of the lee case and other that be precisely why we have take enhanced power through the new national security act although i have to hold back from comment on individual case i be confident that we have much more robust power under that legislation that will enable we to act 
 in its china report the isc highlight the effort of the chinese communist party to influence co opt or coerce into silence potential critic of its regime in the uk we acknowledge that the government be wake up to this threat and take it more seriously but i highlight to the minister the fact that we need more urgency in particular i highlight the fact that for year the isc have be say that we need a foreign agent registration scheme and be now on its way do the minister agree that it would have be helpful have it be in operation and on the statute book at the time of the relevant event we be consider today 
 my right hon friend raise some very important point but i just observe that this apply to a lot of the question we have a relationship with china that be very different from the that we have just a few year ago it be important that we be not naive about china that we be clear eyed about protect our national security that we be clear eyed about the threat that it represent and that we be robust in take action my right hon friend rightly highlight the foreign agent registration scheme the secondary legislation under that will come before the house very shortly which will enable we to take the relevant action under that legislation 
 actually the people who have be really clear sight about china have mostly be on the back benches in this house on either side and include   the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton and some of they have be sanction i have be delighted to work with successive chair of the foreign affairs committee to whom i pay enormous tribute for the outspoken way in which they have push the government towards a more sensible policy on china 
 my anxiety be that we still flip flop all over the place this year already we have see several foreign secretaries apart from anything else and we have see they want to suck up to china moment and the next wanting to have robust word with china it simply do not work why oh why have we still not declare that china be a threat to uk national security why oh why have we still not see even the redact version of the china strategy which accord to the government the fcdo develop but which have not even be share with other government ministry 
 i have great respect for the hon gentleman as he know but i simply do not accept this slightly over the top characterisation of the government ’s approach we have be consistent we must protect our national interest in relation to china that be why we pass the legislation that i have outline why i ban huawei from our g network and why we ban chinese technology from surveillance equipment and other matter 
 secondly it be important that we align with our ally around the world i spend a lot of time on this and know that the foreign secretary the minister for security and other work very closely with nation around the world particularly but not confine to the eye to make sure that we share our understanding of chinese intent and take co ordinated action to protect we not least through the military 
 it be also the case though that we must engage with the chinese as we do with many other country around the world with which we do not share a number of their value it be not a realistic position to take to say that we should entirely cut off from engagement with china we should engage with china but be absolutely clear about where we disagree with it and clear eyed in protect our national security which be precisely the approach we be take 
 like my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith i can not wait to be able to discuss the merit of this case although i understand the situation now i want to raise a couple of issue with the deputy prime minister the government be move they have do lot of new thing and we be get more coherence but i do not understand why they keep think that we either bury our head in the sand or effectively go soft on element of the relationship with china we can debate with and engage with china all we like but we can also do so in an increasingly robust way that answer the threat it present towards we
