 whether he be take step to accelerate the roll out of the share rural network 
 the government and industry be work together to accelerate the share rural network and deliver substantial improvement to outdoor g mobile coverage across the uk in the past few month the government have activate publicly fund mast across the uk and there be now government fund extended area service mast upgrade deliver 4g. 
 in my constituency only and mile away from this house village such as cuddington be still complete mobile notspot will the minister explain how quickly the government intend to move on activate the share rural network to ensure no rural community be leave without a reliable mobile signal 
 i know about cuddington because the hon gentleman tell i about it yesterday cuddington be such a typical english village that it have feature in midsomer murders which be fictional a bit like the previous government ’s financial affair i know we have say that the desire to please be not part of what ministers be mean to do but i do have a desire to please he and his constituent the government will work as fast as we can with industry to try to develop g in his constituency i be happy to arrange for a meeting between he and my official to ensure he have street by street analysis of how we can do that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we welcome the recent update on the expansion of g to rural area under the share rural network project particularly for business and farmer who be under such pressure at the moment with the recent treasury announcement which secretary of state should we thank for the planning approval and funding of this vital infrastructure project 
 we support develop all the plan set out under the share rural network and project gigabit those plan be regularly announce by the previous   government but they never actually put any money into the budget there be never a line in a department for science innovation and technology budget that say this money be guarantee for the future we be put our money where our mouth be and we be determined to ensure everybody have proper connectivity frankly that be essential for people ’s business whether they be farmer or run any other kind of business up and down the land we will deliver that 
 what step he be take to improve digital connectivity in rural area 
 we be improve digital connectivity in rural area by roll out project gigabit contract fill in gap that be not be meet commercially predominantly in rural area and deliver well g mobile coverage and eliminate partial notspot through the share rural network 
 a number of my constituent in the village of haslington have be in touch with i about poor mobile signal and digital connectivity in the village constituent be unable to contact emergency service in the event of a medical emergency do the minister agree that the lack of progress on connectivity in our rural area under year of conservative government be unacceptable will he meet i to discuss how we can improve matter for my constituent 
 i be very happy to meet my hon friend not necessarily at the same time as i be meet   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith but haslington be a bit like cuddington they have exactly the same set of problem i be sure many hon member from across the house have similar issue in their constituency that they have a burn desire to raise with i i be happy to make arrangement for hon member to meet official and go through issue case by case in relation to the emergency my hon friend refer to i would be grateful if he could provide i with specific detail all call from mobile phone should automatically roam on to another available network if there be no signal from their own provider so i want to get to the bottom of the issue in that case 
 can i add to the minister ’s list of beautiful village to visit the wonderful village of cranleigh shamley green peaslake gomshall and bramley they be all have big problem with g and g mobile phone reception not least because app need to be use to pay for parking there can he meet i to discuss what more can be do to help those beautiful but also economically important place 
 i be very happy to meet the right hon gentleman as well i be not the pope but it feel like i will be have a series of audience over the next few week the right hon gentleman have village i have village if only he know someone who have be the chancellor in recent year who would have be able to deliver the financial support that we really need to secure the investment 
 my constituent in the village of crowthorne will welcome the government ’s action to tackle this massive issue and support connectivity for phone and g in rural and semi rural constituency will the minister have a meeting with i to discuss the issue affect crowthorne 
 i be get more popular day by day which be unusual in my life i be of course very happy to discuss the issue in crowthorne 
 thing that really concern i be that quite often the publish version of what connectivity be available in everybody ’s constituency will say that there be or of connectivity from all operator but actually if we stand there with a mobile phone there will not be any connectivity whatsoever i have write to ofcom and it have write back say for instance that in that precise location the coverage may be above or below the predict level lead some consumer to not get the service they expect there be a phrase for that 
 save it for another day 
 organisation such as techresort in my constituency support people who be digitally exclude to become digitally include the minister have a long list of meeting to go to so instead can the secretary of state come along the coast to the sunny town in the uk to visit techresort and hear more about the funding it need to power its work 
 i be pleased to say that the secretary of state say he will indeed visit when he possibly can 
 there be a really important point here poor digital connectivity exclude so many community up and down this country we have no chance of create the economic growth that we want in this country unless we take the whole of the country with we that be why it be so disgraceful that we have not have a proper digital inclusion strategy for year that be something we will remedy 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of use project gigabit funding in urban area on download speed in rural area 
 project gigabit have always be design to deliver gigabit capable broadband to premise that will not be meet by the market regardless of whether they be in urban or rural area most premise deem uncommercial by the market be in rural area but consistent evidence suggest that we will also need to intervene in some urban area to achieve full national gigabit coverage funding will continue to be provide where it be need 
 there be house that will be connect to fibre as a result of the conservative project gigabit policy there be real concern that some of those will miss out if money be redirect from rural to urban community after the family farm tax can we please give rural community a break 
 the vast majority more than 90%—of the spending in project gigabit have go to rural area because those be the area most in need there be absolutely no change in our policy to that however some urban area have significant problem as well and we need to rectify those the hon gentleman point out some of the issue in his own constituency i be happy to provide he too with a meeting if he want i see he have nod 
 what step his department be take to help increase level of innovation in the black country 
 we want to boost investment in innovation and enable people in all region of the uk to benefit from an innovation lead economy that be why the spending review support the uk ’s research and development ambition with total government investment in r&d rise to a record £ in that allow we to extend innovation accelerator for another year which will continue to bolster the west midland high potential innovation cluster fund the midlands industrial ceramics group through the strength in places fund and support the region ’s investment zone 
 last month alongside richard parker the mayor of the west midlands i be lucky enough to join halesowen college as it open its new digital and medium campus at trinity point do the minister agree that excellent institution such as this be fundamental to support innovation across our region and would she be so kind as to visit we at some point in the near future 
 i agree with my hon friend that educational institute be crucial to innovation halesowen college be of college across the region use the further education and innovation fund to support innovation and technical excellence within the local community such facility and expertise will help business to develop a workforce with skill and take advantage of that i would be delighted to visit the trinity point college if the opportunity arise 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 increase level of innovation across the uk be crucial to unlock growth and solve some of our big problem that be why i be worried to read about the secretary of state say that we have to apply a sense of statecraft to work with multinational tech company do the minister agree that what we should be do be work with such company as company not state focus on increase healthy competition and support innovative uk business so that they be not leave with the choice of be buy up or leave the uk 
 as i have say increase productivity right across the uk be fundamental to our mission to kick start economic growth through our industrial strategy and the development of local growth plan we   will build on local strength to ensure that public and private research and development business right across the uk help local place to reach their potential we be strengthen the relationship with business to deliver for british people 
 if he will take step to support the creation of a global network of scientific research on frontier artificial intelligence safety 
 the uk be a found member of the ai safety institute international network the network convene for the time today in san francisco 
 the uk be a global leader in ai development which bring many opportunity but we know that the risk associate with ai can be manage only by global co operation what step be the department take to ensure that the uk work with other main leader in ai development include the us and china to ensure that the most advanced frontier ai model be safe for global consumer 
 my hon friend be completely right to say that safety have to be there from the outset we want our country to safely explore all the opportunity that ai offer but it can do so only if people be reassure that safety be there from the outset the uk safety institute be at the forefront of this it be the safety institute and we be at the forefront of deliver international as well as domestic safety we be currently work on an international review of the science of ai safety which draw on the expertise of country 
 i call steve darling 
 on question number mr speaker may i ask the minister what step he will take to ensure that people who be visually impaired be able to engage 
 order sorry we have not reach that question i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 my hon friend   the member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan   rightly raise the need for research into frontier ai safety and i welcome the government ’s commitment to protect the public from future ai risk but ai affect all of our life already today my committee launch an inquiry into algorithm ai and their role in spread online harm as we see in the terrible riot over the summer as we build our evidence how be the minister build the evidence base on ai online harm and their social impact right now 
 i be extremely grateful to the chair of the select committee for choose this as her inquiry it be an incredibly important area this government be commit to the algorithmic transparency recording standard the previous government renege on their commitment to have individual department release their standard statement each year this government   be commit to do so again and will remain committed to reinforce the fact that algorithm be there to serve people and not the other way round 
 there be many firm in northern ireland that have the capability and the experience to offer some advice on get scientific research on ai safety i know that the minister be very interested in northern ireland so have he have an opportunity to speak to company in northern ireland so that we can play our part in how we take this matter forward 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for acknowledge my interest in northern ireland which i have already visit since be appoint in order to meet some of the pioneer tech company there i will stay committed to ensure that the government recognise the talent across northern ireland harness it for not just the domestic good but the global good 
 what comparative assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the roll out of g in a the uk and b other country 
 unfortunately the uk ’s roll out of g have be far too slow accord to opensignal the uk rank out of european country for g download speed and availability after year of conservative rule we be determined to change that aim to have high quality stand alone g in all populated area by 
 access to g datum be a real issue in aldershot accord to ofcom a of our household can not connect to 5g nearly time the national average what be the government do to give resident in aldershot and farnborough the same data access as the rest of the country and will the minister make that work a priority 
 my hon friend be right that work have to be a priority for business family and everybody engage in her constituency and for the public sector we want the ministry of defence in her constituency for instance to have the high quality datum access possible so that we can deliver more effective and productive government across the whole united kingdom the work will indeed be a priority for we 
 there have be great improvement in connectivity across ceredigion preseli but there remain total mobile notspot such as porthgain and a grow body of evidence collect locally that the connectivity report by ofcom do not quite stack up against the live experience of those on the ground will the minister meet i so that i can present some of the evidence collect by local authority in ceredigion preseli and he can address the problem 
 the hon gentleman have just say what i say a few minute ago it be great that plaid cymru be sign up to the labour party ’s agenda these day but it be upsetting that he forget to mention the high quality mast extend well coverage of g in   wales that have be instal in the last couple of month alone of course i will happily meet he and place in the library a copy of the letter that i receive from ofcom that make the precise point that we need to do much well in recognise the real experience of people ’s mobile connectivity rather than a theoretical ethereal version of it 
 what progress his department have make on the roll out of project gigabit 
 more than project gigabit contract be currently in place with a total value of almost £ and more be in the pipeline in the past few month the premise have be connect as part of project gigabit contract in area include norfolk west yorkshire and south wiltshire and the build have now start in earnest in other part of the country 
 i welcome the progress that the government be make on the roll out of project gigabit to all corner of the country but in telford the inequality remain stark with some ward have complete gigabit coverage and area such as the world heritage site in ironbridge have almost none will the government confirm that their agenda to break down barrier to opportunity include resident business and world heritage site that can not get online 
 the world heritage aspect relate to my department for culture media and sport responsibility but my hon friend be right about ironbridge i hope that we will be able to announce something shortly in relation to extend gigabit coverage in his constituency through a procurement via openreach 
 the minister will be aware that there be a strong link between communication technology and the roll out of smart meter technology in area in the north of scotland that be suffer from cold weather particularly at the moment connectivity be really important for such alternative technology to work what discussion have he have with the department for energy security and net on that issue 
 the hon gentleman be right there be a series of issue about the security and safety of connectivity in area that suffer from particular weather condition we have a successful summit on monday morning to discuss the closing down of the public service network to ensure that everybody will be secure but i assure he that we will work closely with the scottish government to ensure that the roll out in all such area work in the interest of business whatever the weather condition 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 to protect people online today i become the secretary of state to exercise the power to set out my strategic online safety proposal for ofcom to consider from increase transparency to bake safety into social medium platform from the outset those priority will support government in monitor progress on act where our law be come up short i have also launch a new research project to explore the impact of social medium on young people ’s wellbee and mental health 
 each year million of patient in england interact with or more different hospital trust most of the trust that commonly see the same patient do not use the same record system what step be the minister take with cabinet colleague to utilise the centre for improving data collaboration and other available technology to improve datum sharing across nhs hospital trust 
 what a pleasure it be to speak from the dispatch box to another labour mp from sussex 
 that issue be a department of health and social care responsibility but on its behalf the data use and access bill will include a requirement that it provider in the nhs have to meet information standard that will deliver the interoperability need so that datum can be share across the nhs often for the very time 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on the opposition benches we be proud that it be the last conservative government who create the department for science innovation and technology i be glad that labour be follow our agenda and i look forward to my exchange with the secretary of state 
 under the last conservative government britain be home to more dollar tech start up than france and germany combine but last month an industry survey find that nearly of tech founder would consider leave britain if labour raise taxis on tech business yesterday labour u turn on policy in scotland so today will the secretary of state commit to reverse labour ’s job tax which damage tech business across the entire country 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his post we work together on the all party parliamentary group on the industrial revolution which he chair and i look forward to have a constructive relationship go forward 
 the hon gentleman mention the last government give the way the conservatives be go that will have be their last government to be honest the circumstance that business large and small operate in the tech landscape have ask for be a smooth regulatory process we have already deliver regulatory reform reform to planning we have deliver reform to the planning system a stable financial settlement we have deliver that with a budget for 
 order please this be topical we will see a very good example from the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for his kind word but he have punish labour figure from his own department show that worker will be lose out by nearly £ each per year as a result of labour ’s budget will he stand up to the chancellor and oppose any further tax rise on britain ’s hard work tech sector 
 the budget give a pay rise to work people in this country and set the condition for a stable economy fix the black hole leave in our economy by the mismanagement of the last government 
 last week i be at london city airport ’s stem event which bring together student from secondary school across east london do the secretary of state agree that if we be to see thrive stem industry we need more engagement event like that 
 outside the classroom the cyberfirst programme have engage young people across the uk those be the step this government will be go far 
 recently i host a briefing event for people for the ethical treatment of animals where strong evidence be present that almost all drug research and research into other product could be do without abuse animal will the secretary of state take the opportunity to ensure that we no long experiment on animal and that we use other method to get product into service 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s question because the job i ever have be at the body shop work for anita roddick and i join her campaign against animal testing for cosmetic she would be proud to see i at the dispatch box engage in this conversation labour make a manifesto commitment to phase out animal testing in the long term that be something we be commit to and something we be take step towards 
 the peddling of fake news and disinformation on social medium platform be fuel extremism it also impact heavily on our democratic process in the uk what safeguard be the government put in place to combat this really serious issue 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for raise of the most serious issue of our time the online safety act require provider as part of their risk assessment to consider specifically how algorithm will impact a user ’s exposure to illegal content and child ’s exposure to harmful content i have introduce new measure to ensure that child be keep safe and today i issue a statement of strategic priority to ofcom to insist that it continue to do so in future 
 last year nearly british university be identify as have research tie with what be deem very high risk chinese institution subsequently the intelligence service brief university on resist the infiltration attempt of foreign agency but the   intelligence and security committee report state that it be highly likely that joint uk china research project be use for military purpose what be the department do to protect our research and our security 
 the government be work closely with individual university the university sector and our intelligence community to ensure that our research be not only world class but safe and secure

 i thank my hon friend for raise that sensitive issue it be absolutely horrifying to hear her account of it and i agree that it be abhorrent although the human tissue authority strictly regulate the public display of human remain with fine or imprisonment for breach it do not cover sale or purchase however i will ensure that a meeting be arrange with the appropriate minister to discuss the troubling case that my hon friend raise 
 we now come to the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster 
 thank you very much mr speaker i be very happy to associate myself and the official opposition with the right hon lady ’s remark about ukraine democracy must stand together 
 what be the government do to bring down inflation 
 i think it be astonishing that may i welcome the hon member to his place many people might not know that he be the minister with responsibility for growth when under liz truss inflation be at and growth flatline so we be do much well than he do 
 well i thank the right hon lady for her standard charm the truth be that the government be not do anything to bring down inflation this government be stoke inflation we have above inflation pay rise for the union then we have a budget that the office for budget responsibility say would increase inflation—[interruption 
 order interruption i be go to hear the question i suggest that we all hear it together then our constituent can understand the answer as well as the question 
 we have above inflation pay rise for the union then we have a budget that the obr say be go to push up inflation this morning we have city economist real economist say that next year inflation will hit do the right hon lady agree that this government ’s decision mean high inflation for work people 
 i ask the hon gentleman or 
 we have already talk about ukraine it be ukraine and covid that drive up inflation but this government be do it to the british people high tax high inflation low growth low reform there be a word for that it be starmerism 
 yesterday like many opposition member i speak to farmer from across the united kingdom some of they be family who have farm their land for century elderly man in tear child worried about their parent and all of they worry that their way of life be about to be destroy what would the right hon lady like to say to they 
 of all we be absolutely committed to our british farmer and—[interruption that be why we have commit £ to the farming budget over the next year that be the large ever amount for sustainable food production in the uk and it be alongside £ to support those affect by extreme wet weather and over £ to tackle disease outbreak the hon gentleman ’s party could not even get the money out the door for farmer fail to spend over £ on farming budget the farmer know that they be in it for themselves and that be why we be in government and they be not 
 perhaps the right hon lady think that everyone come to london yesterday to thank the government let we look at the fact a typical mid size acre family farm in the constituency of my hon   friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   have speak to their accountant their new liability because of this government be half a pound that be year worth of profit when this generation pass away that farm will become totally unviable and it be just of thousand and thousand of similar farm 
 it be clear the government have not get their fact right the central association for agricultural valuers the real expert in this field say so the national farmers union say so it be shortly to publish a report show that of all commercial farm will fall above the threshold if the government be not go to reverse this terrible policy will the right hon lady at least commit to no further increase to inheritance tax and no further reduction in agricultural property relief or business property relief in this parliament 
 the hon gentleman talk about the fact and i absolutely stand by the figure that the government have set out the vast majority of estate owner will be totally unaffected the hon gentleman want to talk about the figure i will be crystal clear the vast majority of estate owner will see no change and pay no tax on land pass on that be value at £ couple can pass on £ tax free and those above the threshold will pay only half the normal rate and can pay it over year interest free 
 this be just another part of the budget that be unravel everyone here and all the farmer at home will have hear that there be no guarantee there we know what that mean they be come back for more even if the right hon lady have make a promise today it would not have be worth a fig we know that the environment secretary before the election promise the farmer that this would not happen labour promise get break 
 let we put all this into context the treasury say that the family farm tax will raise on average £ a year the treasury also say that the public sector pay rise the government announce in july will cost £ a year that be over time as much why do the government think that above inflation pay rise for the trade union be worth so 
 order i do not need any more from the government bench please less of it we have have a bit of a run in recently and i do not need to have any more 
 i think it be an audacity for the hon gentleman to stand at the dispatch box and suggest in some way that labour break promise or raise taxis i will school the hon gentleman it be his government who raise taxis to their high level for a generation interruption 
 sorry we will have less of that as well unless you want to go and have a cup of tea will we hear any more be that it now yes or no 
 be you talk to i mr speaker 
 absolutely you be the who be mouth 
 i have not open my mouth yet 
 well i be sorry but you must be able to do it like a ventriloquist ’s dummy 
 it be the hon gentleman ’s government who crash the economy who see inflation rise to and growth flatline it be his government who spend the reserve time over i will take no lesson from the hon gentleman 
 i understand why the right hon lady do not want to answer question about the terrible choice the government have make it be because the truth be ugly the truth be that this be a punishment mete out to people who do not vote labour it be the same punishment mete out to parent who send their child to private school it be the same punishment mete out to the owner of small business who be terrify about national insurance contribution and it be the same punishment mete out to pensioner who can not afford to pay for their fuel this winter be it not the truth that if you do not vote labour they do not care about you hon member more 
 there will be more and it will not be what you want more of 
 after that display it be clear that the hon gentleman do not recognise the result of the general election and have learn nothing while this government have be fix the mess that the conservatives leave they have be desperately try to rewrite history they come here every week jump on a new bandwagon and take a new pot shot but with absolutely no word on what they will do differently 
 last week the leader of the opposition admit that she support labour ’s plan to invest in the nhs school and home the conservatives want all the benefit of the budget but have no idea how they will pay for they the face may change but it be the same old tory party straight back to put everything on the credit card spend the reserve time over we take the difficult decision to fix the £ black hole that they leave behind and while they be reinvent the past we be invest in the future 
 in a new report human rights watch have set out irrefutably how israeli authority be commit the war crime of forcible transfer in gaza which amount to crime against humanity israel ’s evacuation system fail to ensure civilian safety civilian be not provide with access to health nutrition and shelter that be compound by the banning of the united nations relief and works agency and much of gaza be now uninhabitable will the government acknowledge that israel have carry out mass force displacement in gaza and will they take concrete measure on arm trade and israeli official in order to comply with their duty to prevent genocide and protect palestinian life 
 the situation in the middle east be catastrophic and i know the whole house be horrify at the terrible loss of civilian life we be call at every opportunity for an immediate ceasefire with the release of the hostage and more aid into   gaza but we urge israel to ensure that unrwa can continue its lifesave work something the foreign secretary have discuss directly with the israeli foreign minister we have impose sanction in response to appal incident of settler violence and have suspend export licence for arm follow a review that find a clear risk that they may be use to commit or facilitate violation of international law we will continue to seek a state solution with a secure israel alongside a viable and sovereign palestine 
 i call the deputy leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself and the liberal democrats with the deputy prime minister ’s remark on ukraine 
 ahead of the budget i warn the deputy prime minister that increase national insurance contribution on social care provider would make the crisis in social care worse now obr figure suggest that the increase in nics will cost more to social care provider than the money the government have announce for that sector in the budget with that measure alone withdraw £ from the sector will the deputy prime minister speak with the chancellor to ensure that at the very least health and care provider be protect from take the hit 
 i thank the hon member for that question the chancellor be sit near i and i know that through our discussion we want to ensure that social care be protect that be why we confirm £ of new grant funding for social care next year an uplift to local government spending and an £ increase to the disabled facility grant our employment rights bill will help deliver the ever fair pay agreement for the social care sector as well and we will also ensure that the nhs be fund to help with the social care situation 
 it be clear that social care provider will be bad off so i urge the deputy prime minister and the chancellor to look again at that 
 somebody else who be worried about the budget be cathy a farmer in my constituency who tell i yesterday that she think the government change simply do not make sense they mean that her family may have to pay a bill that will force they to sell land which make food production unviable at the same time the government have not close the land buy tax loophole that can be exploit by equity firm and the super wealthy farmer tell i yesterday that they feel as though they be betray by the conservatives and they now feel—[interruption 
 order 
 thank you mr speaker 
 farmers tell i yesterday that they feel as though they have be betray by the conservatives but they now feel that they have also be lie to by labour will the deputy prime minister think again on this measure so that our farmer can feed britain 
 again i be sorry to hear that cathy be distress by the scaremongering around what the labour party be do the budget deliver £ for farming over the next year a   record amount the last government fail to spend £ on farmer our plan be sensible fair and proportionate and protect the small estate while fix public service that they rely on 
 there be only place in england accord to the house library where school funding per pupil be low than in aldershot and farnborough do the deputy prime minister agree that something have go badly wrong when teacher be force to pay out of their own pocket for basic school supply while many other have leave the profession in drove over the past year will ministers work with i to tackle the root of this problem so that we can give every young person in my constituency and beyond the very good start in life 
 every child deserve the opportunity to succeed in school and beyond and i be sorry to hear of the experience in my hon friend ’s constituency last week i visit ravensfield primary school in my constituency and its school council have a lot to say about the resource to our school we have increase the core school budget by £ next year increase per pupil funding in real term as her constituency be the home of the british army i know she will also welcome the expansion of childcare support to service family deploy overseas save family around £ a year i be happy to ensure that she get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 a few week ago from that dispatch box the minister for food security and rural affairs say he have be congratulate by a farmer on the introduction of the inheritance tax i think that farmer must have be a cannabis farmer because yesterday we have farmer on whitehall protest against this madcap decision do the deputy prime minister agree that the decision should be throw in the trash can along with rachel from account cv 
 the hon member talk about cv and it be good to see he do well on his bench once a labour councillor then a tory mp now a reform chief whip every time he switch party he get a promotion i have already outline what we have do to support our farmer we will continue to support the farmer and we will continue to invest in our public service to get britain back on track 
 my right hon friend have come under intense scrutiny from the press at different time and she must have find it difficult a press that be free to scrutinise politician be vital in a free society and a democracy be she as concerned as i be by the stasi like interview that be give to allison pearson of   a week last sunday do she agree that the essex police force and other police force would be well try to deal with shoplifting burglary and other crime rather than intimidate journalist 
 free speech and our press be incredibly important they be part of our democracy but in direct response to my hon friend ’s question the police be independent and it be a live   investigation so it would not be appropriate for i to comment on that i believe that we should have a free press it be part of our democracy and we should have free speech but with that come responsibility for those who do it 
 yesterday i meet constituent in parliament duncan hawley his wife nicola and his year old daughter hattie duncan be a sheep farmer and he have stewarde his family farm for most of his life he be outraged hurt and worried about the government ’s deeply damage family farm tax he be deeply worried about food security food inflation and whether he will even be able to pass that farm on to future generation my question to the deputy prime minister be simple why have this labour government declare war on british farmer

 i know how much professional care work mean to the deputy prime minister cariad care homes in porthmadog tell i that it will not be able to absorb the additional exorbitant cost impose by her government ’s budget it tell i that they pose a threat bad than covid to the business will she therefore personally intervene so that her government at least make care provider exempt from the rise in employer national insurance contribution 
 the right hon lady be right to say that i value the work of care provider and carer across the whole of the united kingdom that be why we have put in additional funding through the   budget we have be ensure that for care provider and charity include hospice the tax regime be among the most generous in the world that include tax relief for charity and their donor worth more than £ for the tax year end april we have put record funding into our nhs we have increase funding into adult and child ’s social care and we will continue to support our public service which be leave on their knee by the last government

 i absolutely agree with my hon friend who be entirely right to raise the subject of the impact of the snp ’s irresponsible management of scotland ’s finance and the austerity that it be inflict on his constituent our budget reject a return to austerity we deliver the large real term fund settlement for scotland since devolution and the result of the budget be clear the snp have the power it have the money and it have no more excuse

 pm 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if she will make a statement on police reform 
 i will respond on behalf of the secretary of state and i thank the hon lady for secure this important question on what be an important subject 
 at its good police in england and wales be truly world class every day officer perform their duty with courage skill and dedication and we be all grateful to all of they at the heart of our british policing tradition be the notion of policing by consent which be dependent on maintain mutual bond of trust between officer and the local community they serve but over the last decade or more policing have face a perfect storm as visible neighbourhood policing have be decimate as law enforcement have struggle to keep up with fast change crime as outdated technology have hold force back and as confidence have fall in community and among victim because far too often people feel that if something go wrong no will come and nothing will be do 
 for too long instead of government show leadership and help the police to navigate these testing time predecessor in our department have just walk away this government will not stand on the sideline while public confidence and public safety be put at risk and that be why we be pursue our unprecedented safe street mission to reduce the most serious violence and to rebuild confidence in police and the criminal justice system 
 to successfully deliver that mission we need force that be fit for the challenge of today and tomorrow that be why the home secretary yesterday announce a programme of police reform that will be pursue in partnership with policing under our neighbourhood policing guarantee we will restore patrol to town centre and rebuild the vital link between force and the people they serve to drive up performance and standard a new performance unit will be establish in the home office which will use high quality police datum to spot trend and improve performance and consistency and we will work with police to create a national centre of police to bring together crucial support service such as it aviation and forensic we will present a white paper on police reform to parliament next year 
 the police funding settlement for police force include full detail on government grant funding and precept will be set out to parliament in the normal way before christmas but the home secretary confirm in her write statement yesterday that as part of that settlement direct central government funding for police next year will increase by £ that be core grant and additional funding for neighbourhood policing counter terrorism and the national crime agency 
 we be at a critical juncture for police and we can not go on as we have be so together with the police we will embark on this road map for reform to get back to those precious peel principle and to rebuild the confidence of our community in the vital work the police do every day to keep we all safe 
 i be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 yesterday the home secretary announce significant reform to police through a write statement a comprehensive restructuring of police in england and wales that will affect thousand of personnel create a new performance unit and establish a national centre for police surely merit some parliamentary scrutiny and an opportunity for member of this house to question what it mean for their constituent 
 for my hazel grove constituent what do it mean for mellor the most rural part of my constituency there be no specific mention of rural crime in the home secretary ’s statement so i ask the minister what her plan mean for those tackle crime in our rural community what do the plan mean for place like woodley a district centre in hazel grove which have see far too much antisocial behaviour and shoplifting and what do the plan mean for place like offerton where illegal off road bike be cause havoc on our road how will the plan well encourage the police to work with local partner to tackle this problem which blight so many people ’s life any police reform must address the conservatives cut to the number of police community support officer who be so often the face of proper neighbourhood policing my police force greater manchester have see more than pcso position cut since 
 more than anything we need to ensure that the reform deliver the proper frontline police that our community deserve year of ineffective resourcing by the previous conservative government have leave our police force overstretch under resource and unable to focus on the crime that affect our community the most it be no wonder that the vast majority of burglary still go unsolved while for out of car theft last year a police officer do not even attend the scene 
 it be genuinely good to hear that more resource will be commit to neighbourhood policing but as we see with the conservatives police uplift programme more resource do not automatically mean that community will see the difference i would welcome assurance from the minister that the government will ensure that officer have the time and resource to focus on their community and will ensure more bobby on the beat 
 i very much welcome the hon lady ’s interest in this area the write ministerial statement lay before parliament yesterday set out the direction of travel for this government on police reform as i say in my response to the urgent question a white paper will be publish in the spring there will be full consultation with i hope parliamentary colleague as well as those involve in policing police and crime commissioner and all the key stakeholder this be the start of the process so many of the hon lady ’s question will be part of the consultation and the conversation that we have next year but i reassure she that the safe street mission be about the neighbourhood policing guarantee it be about deliver additional police officer pcso and special in our neighbourhood and reinvigorate the neighbourhood policing model 
 the hon lady mention antisocial behaviour and shoplifting those be issue that we will deal with and we will bring forward legislation particularly around shop theft that will include a stand alone offence of   assault a shopworker and the removal of the £ threshold that the previous government introduce which mean that there be almost a shoplifter charter they could steal up to £ worth of item and there would be no action we be get rid of that we be take action now but we will have a conversation about broad police reform next year the statement be about set out the direction of travel 
 on friday i spend some time on patrol with telford police and sergeant alex webb tell i about her frustration at not be able to get repeat antisocial behaviour offender out of our town centre and high street when will the government give the police the tool that they need to deal with these issue and get the yobs out of our high street and town centre 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question this be antisocial behaviour awareness week which aim to focus on the effect that antisocial behaviour can have on individual and community he be absolutely right to say that we need to tackle antisocial behaviour that be why the neighbourhood policing guarantee which will get officer back on the street and the other measure that we will introduce to keep our town centre and high street safe be so important we will bring those forward in due course 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let i welcome the policing minister to her role she be succeed i in the job that i do in the last government i genuinely wish she well in the job and i hope that she succeed in it because it be important for the whole country i be sure that the whole house will want to join i in thank the police up and down the country for the work that they do to keep we safe when they put on their uniform to go to work each morning they take risk that be require of those in few other profession 
 in march this year the police headcount hit a record number of police and high than the previous record my question be will the policing minister commit to at least maintain if not grow that record number of police officer secondly will the minister join i in welcome the fact that in the past year overall crime as measure by the crime survey for england and wales the office for national statistics say that be the good measure of crime trend have come down by the write statement yesterday and the home secretary ’s speech to the national police chiefs council yesterday mention the importance of technology which i feel very strongly about as the minister know in the march budget the previous chancellor commit to £ of spending on police technology over year of which this year be the about £ be due to be spend this year will the right hon lady confirm that the £ for this year be secure and that she and her colleague will honour the £ commitment over the come year 
 do the minister agree that it be important that police spend their time actually investigate crime not police thought do she agree that the guideline need to be change so that police spend time investigate   only real crime and investigate non crime only when there be a real and imminent risk of criminality that would mean a change to the guideline will she make that change 
 on the reform programme we need to see the detail of course but will the minister confirm that no money will be take away from local police force will she confirm that police and crime commissioner and chief constable will continue to be fully empower finally on police funding she mention some number for next year ’s funding settlement she will be aware that when i be policing minister we arrange a £ increase in funding for frontline police for this financial year compare with last year the number she talk about in her statement be much low than that so will she give a commitment that any funding increase for frontline police that she bring forward in the police funding settlement will be at least as big as the that i announce last year 
 this be the opportunity i have have to welcome the right hon gentleman to his new role as shadow home secretary but i think he might be forget a few fact as i recall over the previous year the conservative government slash police by over police officer and many support staff as well i acknowledge that the uplift programme be bring in at the end of their period in government but they get rid of a lot of very experienced good police officer also just to remind he we stand for election on a manifesto commitment to provide additional police officer pcso and special as part of our neighbourhood policing guarantee 
 i know that the right hon gentleman be very keen on technology that be absolutely of the thing that he focus on i have certainly take up some of the issue that he be concern about to do with live facial recognition and i want that investment to continue i think he be again forget a few thing when he refer to the guideline for non crime hate incident as i recall he be the policing minister who introduce those guideline i have listen to what he say but i think he need to remember what he actually do when he be the policing minister i take the approach that this should be about common sense and consistency his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service talk about the need for consistency and training i will listen to what it have to say rather than to the right hon gentleman ’s view on guideline that he introduce many of the question that he ask will form part of the consultative approach that we will adopt when our white paper be lay before parliament 
 my constituent tell i that they be particularly worried about antisocial behaviour and that they want guarantee police patrol do my right hon friend agree that that be what this government intend to deliver 
 i very much welcome that question from my hon friend and neighbour in kingston upon hull he be absolutely right to say that the neighbourhood policing guarantee will include designate police officer pcso and special who will patrol neighbourhood there will be a name officer that people can go to if there be problem around antisocial behaviour we will also bring forward respect order   which will deal with the people who be engage most persistently in antisocial behaviour they can stop they be in particular neighbourhood or even put condition on they for example if they have an alcohol problem they may have to get treatment and help for that problem but he be absolutely right to say that antisocial behaviour be a big issue for many of our constituent 
 i call the chair of the select committee dame karen bradley 
 i welcome the government ’s announcement on neighbourhood policing we have already see a real move in this direction in staffordshire under the leadership of the police fire and crime commissioner ben adams and our chief constable chris noble so i very much welcome what the minister have say she will know however that the national audit office have raise concern about the experience of officer when it come to neighbourhood policing what work will she do to ensure that officer have the right degree of experience so that their effectiveness at neighbourhood policing be maximise 
 can i take this opportunity to welcome the new chair of the home affairs committee chairing it be of the very good job in parliament on neighbourhood policing i recognise that there be good practice around the country with certain police force do it very well indeed but she be absolutely right to say that we want to equip our neighbourhood police officer with the good training to enable they to do a really good job for their community that be why we have already announce money for the college of policing to engage with neighbourhood police officer and give they the training that they deserve particularly in problem solve because that be a really important part of the role that they will play in neighbourhood 
 to deliver effective policing we need reform but police officer also need to feel that they have our support do the minister agree that agree the recommendation of the pay review body be a key part of deliver that support what view do she have about those include conservative members who would prefer not to agree those recommendation and on the impact that would have on police morale 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we need to support our police officer in the work that they do to keep we all safe day in day out he will know that this year we accept the recommendation of the pay review body and that additional funding be provide to police force to pay for an increase in salary it be important that we continue to ensure that our police be properly remunerate for the difficult job that they do the home secretary have make that clear in her support for police officer 
 farmer in my constituency tell i that they be often the victim of serious rural crime include threat of physical violence but do not usually bother to report it because they do not think our rural police force be well enough resource to give a full response if that be happen across the country presumably it mean that   rural crime be seriously under report what more do the minister plan to do to resource our rural crime team and to give farmer and other live in rural area reassurance that they can and should report crime 
 the hon lady be exactly right we need to make sure that when crime happen it be report that be absolutely vital as i say in my opening remark for too long people have feel that it be not worth report a crime because no will come and nothing will be do our neighbourhood policing guarantee be not just about urban area it also cover rural area and we want rural community to have the support that they need from police pcso and special i be also responsible for rural crime and i know that there be a range of issue that we need to look at again include the theft of agricultural machinery that be an area that i be particularly focus on 
 just last night guisborough town fc in my constituency suffer a break in and burglary i be grateful to cleveland police for respond and for meet i this morning to update i on the situation but there simply be not enough of they on the street can the minister give i an assurance that this government will prioritise frontline visible neighbourhood community police once again 
 yes i can i pay tribute to cleveland police which have make great progress in recent time 
 will the minister include reference to fraud in her white paper action fraud which would be more accurately describe as inaction fraud be preside over a complete failure to do anything particularly about fraud against online retailer can we ensure that action be take to help victim of fraud 
 i reassure the hon gentleman that my noble friend lord hanson the lords minister be look at this i gently point out that in relation to fraud we be have to deal with our inheritance from the previous administration we will now look at some of the problem with action fraud that they do not deal with 
 the late crime figure show that shoplifting have shoot up to a year high knife crime have rise yet again and violence against woman and girl remain shamefully and persistently high do the minister agree that this show the last tory government ’s disgraceful dereliction on law and order 
 my hon friend put it well this be why our safe street mission have the ambitious aim to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade to halve knife crime over the next decade to restore neighbourhood policing and to restore confidence in the criminal justice system 
 the liberal democrats have long campaign for proper neighbourhood policing so we welcome this announcement sadly i have hear at hand the concern and fear of community in dartmouth follow a police decision   to redeploy a local sergeant who have spend a couple of year build positive relationship and trust with the local community particularly on antisocial behaviour and drug dealing can the minister clarify how the neighbourhood policing guarantee will be implement and how the home office plan to ensure that community have consistent and long term access to a know name officer who will remain in the community 
 i gently point out that the liberal democrats be part of the coalition government and that through those year of austerity we see major cut to police officer include neighbourhood police officer however i take her point that be why we have the neighbourhood policing guarantee and it be why we will have additional police officer pcso and special people will be able to go to a name police officer if they have problem in their area as she request as i say early we want to make sure that neighbourhood police officer be properly train and that this be see as a very important part of policing so that officer want to stay in neighbourhood police for long 
 my constituent in nantwich often report experience unacceptable antisocial behaviour at night particularly link to the night time economy so i welcome the government ’s plan to introduce tolerance zone and respect order to get a grip of the antisocial behaviour that the last government allow to run out of control will the minister say a little more about how this will help my constituent 
 all members will know that antisocial behaviour can blight community and can cause real problem to individual and family this week be antisocial behaviour awareness week and i be strike by resolve ’s statistic that in householder be think about move because of antisocial behaviour that be really shocking and our respect order and neighbourhood police reform will start to address the antisocial behaviour that have blight many of our community for too long 
 the minister have outline the lack of confidence in police service across the united kingdom because of the failure to deal with real crime such as burglary shoplifting and antisocial behaviour at the same time we learn that police force have spend a year investigate a tweet by a columnist after a report from someone in holland surely if there be to be reform thing we should do be tell the police that they be no long the thought police they be mean to be deal with crime if that mean change the bad law introduce by the last government will the minister make sure it be do so that we do not have any more of this nonsense 
 the right hon gentleman be right that this government be prioritise the crime that affect community and individual such as the increase antisocial behaviour threat and knife enable robbery those be the thing that people care about and those be the thing that our safe street mission be design to deal with 
 in answer to the right hon gentleman ’s question it be worth reflect that the provision on non crime hate incident come out of the macpherson inquiry follow the murder of stephen lawrence that recommendation be about provide an intelligence picture for police officer it may not be a crime but the intelligence picture might benefit from know about it it be worth reflect on that of course i want consistency and common sense in such investigation and as i say early the inspectorate have also highlight the need for consistency and training because of the confusion about the guideline issue by the previous government i be happy to look at that with the college of policing to make sure we get it right but there be a place for it in some circumstance 
 resident live around wilmot park in west dartford continue to be plague by antisocial behaviour include vandalism the use of motorbike in green space noise and threaten behaviour as part of their safe street mission will the government use police reform to ensure that such crime be prioritise in dartford and across the country 
 i want the police to be get on with this now and they have power they can use to deal with antisocial behaviour but we want to make sure they have additional officer through the neighbourhood policing guarantee to ensure that they can deal with antisocial behaviour in community we have be very clear that the police will be give additional power to make sure they can seize and destroy the motorbike and vehicle that be cause nuisance to community through antisocial behaviour 
 have work with the right hon lady on committees over a number of year i be delighted to congratulate she on her appointment in that spirit i will make what i think be a helpful suggestion about non crime hate incident clearly chief constable have huge discretion over how much effort they put into investigate local crime and non crime incident of the sort that she say have a place in the spectrum could she perhaps require chief constable to report back to her department on how many hour their force spend investigate crime incident and non crime incident it appear that ten of thousand of non crime incident be be investigate every year 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his comment it have be a great pleasure to work with he on various committees over the year he be correct that this be an operational matter it be for chief constable to decide how they use the resource available to they my understanding be that very little time be actually spend on non crime hate incident but i will check that with his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary 
 come from a police family and have serve with the national crime agency i be immensely proud of british policing however i be equally devastate at the decline oversee by the conservatives can the minister outline what we be do to rebuild british policing and return it to be the good in the world 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his service we will all benefit from have he in the house share his experience and knowledge the police reform agenda as set out in the home secretary ’s speech and the write ministerial statement yesterday be about reset that relationship with the police we want to work with the police this be not about do thing to the police but about work collectively to get the very good police service for this country for today tomorrow and the year ahead 
 my resident in boston and skegness want the police on the street prevent antisocial behaviour and crime they do not want our valuable police resource waste on monitoring tweet for non crime hate incident threaten and bully resident and then that record remain on a database which can prevent people from get a job in the future it be a complete waste of time will the minister and the home office scrap those guideline as an unnecessary use of valuable time and resource 
 this government have be very clear about their priority on police in our safe street mission we have set out that we will halve violence against woman and girl and knife crime over the next decade we will restore public confidence in the criminal justice system particularly in the police and we will introduce neighbourhood policing which we know to be the bedrock of police in this country and the area in which most people want to see investment those be our priority as the prime minister and the home secretary have say and that be where the focus and attention of the police need to be 
 for too long far too many of my town and village have have to endure rise level of antisocial behaviour such as people rid unsafe bike through village centre and an epidemic of shoplifting include at my local morrisons whose staff i meet last month i be work closely with our local police and crime commissioner john tizard to push for a more robust police response what reassurance can the minister give my constituent that our new strategy will ensure that a far great priority be give to such crime and that those crime will not be tolerate as they seem to have be far too often in the past 
 i thank my hon friend for his work in this important area this government be commit to deal with shop theft and attack on retail worker and we will bring forward legislation in due course our safe street mission focus on high street town centre and community so that people feel safe there be a police presence and antisocial behaviour be not tolerate 
 week in week out police officer from my constituency be extract to go and police protest and event in central london my constituent and i be proud to live in our great capital city and in a democracy where the right to protest be cherish however under the conservatives since the capital city grant have be cut by in real term that be the money that should be use to police such protest not community police resource   which be what the metropolitan police commissioner be have to draw on will the minister review the capital city grant so that my constituent can see a bobby on the beat again 
 the hon lady will know that announcement about the provisional police settlement will be make in december in this house discussion be under way about exactly the point she raise i note what she say about the level of abstraction which be a concern but this government be commit to the additional police officer pcso and special in our neighbourhood the metropolitan police area will benefit from that as will every other police area 
 when i spend time canvass in my constituency of harlow as i often do resident tell i that they do not see community police officer any more in we have over pcso for the whole of harlow but we now have will the minister set out how the safe street mission will make resident in harlow feel safe 
 it be worth reflect on the fact that the number of pcso have halve in the past year and the number of special have reduce by third those be shocking figure we want to ensure that we use pcso because they police neighbourhood in such a valuable way also i be personally committed to make sure that we see more special on the beat people who stand up for the local community and do such work on a voluntary basis be to be commend i hope that across the house we would all support an extension to the work of special
