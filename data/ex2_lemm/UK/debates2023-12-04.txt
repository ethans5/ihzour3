stop kill child stop kill civilian that be what i want what my constituent want and what the whole country want we do not know who be the good person or group of people to do that but for god ’s sake someone stop this killing of child 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for ashfield lee anderson   for secure this important debate and for speak with such great passion he very much share my determination to do well in this area to help and support more disabled people into work and unlock all that potential that we know exist 
 in the government set the goal of see a more disabled people in employment between and i be proud to say that by the quarter of the number of disabled people in employment have increase by which mean that the goal be meet after only year by the quarter of disability employment have rise by in total since the goal be announce but we be aware that this progress have not be even those early success must be a catalyst for further change we know that most learning disabled people want to have a job and evidence show that they bring many positive benefit to their employer that be something i hear time and again as i go round the country meet employer and meeting disabled people experience the benefit of work 
 but we also know that less than in working age people with severe and specific learning disability be currently in employment that mean that more than in of this group be still unable to access the independence and sense of fulfilment that employment can bring and that many employer be not benefit from the enthusiasm skill and commitment that they can bring to their workplace we be therefore work hard in government as an enabler and with other to support learning- disabled people to secure sustain and succeed in employment 
 we be continue to improve the general support available to learning disabled claimant when they attend the jobcentre additional work coach support provide disabled people and those with health condition with   increase to personalised support from their work coach to help they move towards and into work that support be already available in third of jobcentre in england scotland and wales it will be available nationally in we have strengthen our disability employment adviser role deliver direct support to claimant who require additional work relate support and support all work coach to deliver tailor personalise support to claimant with a disability or health condition include those with a learn disability 
 as well as this general support we be provide a range of special programme that can help learning disabled people to access employment they will have priority access to the work and health programme in england and wales intensive personalise employment support provision have also be available in england and wales provide highly personalise package of specialist employment support for disabled people and people with health condition to achieve sustained employment 
 the local support employment programme help people with learn difficulty and/or autism to find and retain work through intensive to support and an evidence base approach to support employment local support employment aim to develop a sustainable model by give intensive to support to those face with significant barrier to work we have fund lead local authority to deliver local support employment in local authority area in england and wales from november until march over that period lse will help about people to move into and stay in work an average of participant in each of the local authority area be set to benefit from £ in grant funding and support which will include the assignment of job coach who can carry out vocational profiling engage employer and provide in work support to enable this group to enter and maintain employment in the open labour market 
 the spring budget confirm funding for a new employment programme call universal support which will use the prove support employment model to help inactive disabled people people with health condition and those face additional barrier to employment into sustained work do more of what we know succeed in secure meaningful outcome for people of the aspect of the coverage of this issue that frustrate i the most be the failure to recognise that it be as important to focus on retention as it be to focus on job start and that both must be see in tandem that be precisely what universal support will help we to do eligible learning disabled people will be able to opt into receive up to month of place and train support help they to move quickly into suitable work follow by wraparound support to help they to sustain that employment in the long term i be pleased to confirm that follow the announcement in the late autumn statement we be expand the universal support scheme to enable it to provide support for people a year once it have be fully roll out an increase on the place a year announce in the spring budget 
 we know that many learning disabled people will require workplace adjustment to secure and retain employment and the access to work scheme can undoubtedly help with the extra cost of working beyond those involve in standard workplace adjustment access to work contribute to the disability relate extra cost of work face by disabled people and   those with a health condition in the workplace that be beyond the cost of standard reasonable adjustment and include the provision of support worker specialist aid and equipment and help with travel to and from work as part of the scheme we be test an adjustment passport in a variety of setting to establish whether it can reduce the need for assessment when the requirement remain the same and need to be passporte around to help a person enter into a role and then make progress within it as well as make conversation with employer easy 
 we recently launch an access to work adjustment planner which will be roll out to all university and high education college the planner collect key information about a student ’s adjustment need which can be easily share with prospective employer trial result show that disabled student use the planner be more confident about enter employment we be also test access to work plus a new employer offer that can offer additional support to employer who be willing to think differently about their vacancy and consider whether they can adapt shape or flex a job to enable a disabled person to retain return to or move into employment that be relevant to my hon friend ’s point about the key support that need to be available to aid people ’s transition into work and available at various point in their life when they want to enter the workplace or increase their educational opportunity and to maximise those life chance 
 during their transition to employment learning disabled young people can benefit from support internship which be aim at those with a learn disability or autism who have an education health and care plan support internships usually last for month contribute to the long term career goal of young people and match their capability alongside their time with an employer support intern receive support from a specialist job coach and complete a personalised study programme deliver by the school or college which include the chance to study for relevant qualification if appropriate and to receive english and math tuition at an appropriate level while the department for education lead on this in england the department for work and pensions provide support for access to work where need and i would be happy to ask colleague in the department for education to provide further detail to my hon friend about the opportunity that support internship can provide 
 separately the autism employment review lead by my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland have be receive evidence this year about the barrier prevent autistic people from start stay and succeed in employment and how those barrier can be overcome although the review focus specifically on autistic people many of the adjustment and initiative that will benefit they will also benefit a wide group of people include learning disabled people and people with other disability i be hugely grateful to he for all his effort 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise this under this government we have see a reduction in carbon emission which be fast than the eu the united states of america and other we be world leader in many technology not least offshore wind and i hope shortly in the next generation of carbon capture and storage we continue to work very closely with business to help they build that resilience 
 the clerk at the table have inform the house   of the unavoidable absence through illness of the speaker from the sitting of the house this week the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 mr speaker have ask i to let the house know that unfortunately he have test positive for covid and so will not be take the chair today i be happy to tell the house that i have speak to mr speaker and that he be fight it very well i be sure that the house will join i in wish he a speedy recovery 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support economic growth in yorkshire and the north 
 for our part we wish mr speaker all the very good and we hope that he enjoy a speedy recovery but it be wonderful to have you in the chair madam deputy speaker i also welcome   the hon member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon   back to the front bench i know that he too be unwell recently so it be great to see he in his place and look so well 
 we be take considerable step to boost economic growth in yorkshire and the north include the creation of investment zone in south and west yorkshire and of course the extension of devolution to the whole of the historic county 
 i be sure the whole house want to see mr speaker back and well again very soon 
 the secretary of state must be look at different datum from that which i be look at i know he do not like expert but i have hope that as christmas approach he will have a pauline conversion he will see a flash of light fall off his camel and realise that in order to level up expertly and well he need local authority on the ground to deliver those policy will he please reconsider his attitude to local government in this country 
 i be grateful to the hon member as the minister for local government have just remind i when saul be on the road to damascus he be not actually travel on a camel 
 improve transport link with a new mass transit system for leeds be critical to the programme that we undertake we be work with local authority in leeds we be work with the mayor of west yorkshire tracy brabin and with the chief executive of leeds city council tom riordan moreover in kirklees we be invest £ through round of the levelling up fund with a new open market to provide regeneration in huddersfield and of course the upgrade of the penistone line for which my hon friend the members for dewsbury mark eastwood and for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates have be such brilliant advocate 
 i too convey to mr speaker a get well soon message 
 in addition to the amenity in yorkshire and elsewhere in the north there be a wonderful real ale pub call the bell inn at pensax in the north of the malvern hills may i put on the record my strong endorsement of its bid to the community ownership fund 
 it sound as if that particular inn in the heart of elgar country be something behind which all of we on the front bench can rally it sound like an excellent candidate for the community ownership fund which have see score of building take back into public ownership by their community for the benefit of all 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of antisemitism 
 tragically we have see a significant increase in antisemitism since the event of   october the community security trust record antisemitic incident between   october   and   november the high total in a day period since record begin in 
 despite the hand account of survivor such as yoni saadon and organisation such as zaka whose member collect the body follow the palestinian terror attack of   october and have describe mutilate genital and woman ’s body have be so badly abuse that their pelvis be break there be some in the pro palestinian movement who continue to deny that these atrocity take place whether we be talk about dead baby or gender base violence against jewish woman it appear that jews do not matter do the secretary of state agree that this risk fuel far the antisemitism that we have see in this country since those attack 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the event of   october   be uniquely horrific it be an exercise in calculate premeditate sadism which everyone in the house condemn however as my hon friend say some voice include some prominent medium voice have consider it appropriate to cavil to question and to prevaricate in the face of this violence it be vitally important for we to recognise even as we recognise that all life be precious and even as we recognise that it be vital for we to do what we can to minimise casualty in this conflict that the event of   october   stand out as the big slaughter of jewish civilian since the holocaust and for that reason there can be no quibbling when we face such a transparent evil 
 i agree with everything that be say by the previous questioner could the secretary of state engage with his opposite number in the department for education and argue for the promotion of education about the event of the holocaust i have believe for a long time that of the reason behind the increase in antisemitism notwithstanding recent event be the fact that the holocaust be now slip from memory into history and we need to perpetuate the analysis and grasp of that particular period of history 
 the hon gentleman make a good point and it give i an opportunity to thank the holocaust educational trust which enjoy support across the house the work do by its chief executive karen pollock be exemplary as the hon gentleman rightly point out as the voice of survivor fade and the holocaust move from memory to history it be vital that we ensure that every successive generation appreciate the unique evil of that event the origin of antisemitism and the need to be vigilant against its recrudescence 
 i thank the secretary of state for his robust answer to my hon friend   the member for brigg and goole andrew percy do he agree that the sight this weekend of bereaved family member from both the muslim and jewish community join together in a combine rally against islamophobia and antisemitism be an inspire sight that we should all hold in our heart and honour do that not serve as a lesson to those people from community or the other who preach hatred against other who be in fact innocent victim 
 my right hon friend be absolutely correct all of we approach any conflict with a sense of horror and foreboding for what it may mean for innocent civilian and it be in that spirit that the vigil that he mention be hold it be great to see people from across community express solidarity i have the opportunity last week to talk to leader from various muslim community group across the united kingdom and i pay tribute to they for their work in challenge extremism of all kind 
 if we be to tackle the reality of antisemitism in the present it be vital that we learn from the past in the summer of jewish child who have survive the death camp in nazi germany make their life and be rehabilitate on the bank of windermere lake at troutbeck bridge they be affectionately and proudly know by all of we as the windermere boy as we work together to celebrate their legacy and to use that legacy to ensure that we fight antisemitism in every part of our country will the secretary of state meet i and the people involve with the project to discuss how we can build a last memorial to the legacy of those wonderful young child who build a new life in this country and overcome the horror of nazi germany 
 i be really grateful to the hon gentleman for remind we of that episode in our history and i would be absolutely delighted to work with he to ensure that that signal moment in our history be properly celebrate it have be a feature of the united kingdom that we have always recognise the importance of stand up against antisemitism and provide refuge to those flee persecution so i look forward to talk to he in due course 
 the london borough of havering have now reverse the appalling decision it make last week to cancel its hanukkah festivity for the jewish community it be impossible to imagine any local authority in the country try to cancel the annual celebration of any other faith group do my right hon friend agree that all local authority   should be careful to avoid any such rash action at this sensitive time and that they should use intelligence and common sense in their decision 
 my right hon and learn friend be absolutely correct i understand that the london borough of havering have now reverse its decision but it seem to i that it be base on a misconception which be that the idea of the celebration of any faith should be see as provocative at this time we know that there be individual jewish citizen who feel uncomfortable wear the kippah or any outward symbol of their faith and to have a london borough say that the menorah should not be light because it would be provocative at this time be wholly wrong freedom of religion the chance for we all to express our faith be fundamental to british value and he be right to say that other local authority should not go down that same route 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the levelling up fund at distribute funding across all part of the uk 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the levelling up fund at distribute funding across all part of the uk 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the levelling up fund at distribute funding across all part of the uk 
 on   monday november   we announce that a furth £ will be invest in project across great britain from bolton to elgin and from newcastle to rhyl in the round we have target funding at place across great britain that be most in need as assess through our levelling up need metric we have also ensure the good possible regional spread of project so that every part of great britain benefit from the fund over its lifetime further detail be set out in a published methodology note 
 with new money help pembrokeshire county council to regenerate haverfordwest town centre with community ownership funding enable the villager of hayscastle cross to save their local pub and with new investment in visit pembrokeshire to improve accessibility for tourist visit the county do the minister agree that compare with the clunky difficult to access eu funding scheme these new pot of level up money be be distribute far more effectively to all part of the united kingdom 
 my right hon friend be right that the effort we be make in pembrokeshire in part thank to he and other members of parliament for the county demonstrate level up in action in his part of wales i be delighted to continue work with he on that 
 do the minister agree that clwyd south ’s £ of levelling up project in the trevor basin llangollen and corwen which i recently visit and the newly announce £ investment zone for wrexham clwyd south and flintshire be shin example of the effectiveness of level up galvanise investment and activity in north east wales 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for his constituent in clwyd south and for constituent in shropshire as well i completely agree that the £ investment from the levelling up fund will protect a valuable heritage site for north wales an area enjoy by local while encourage visitor to stay long and spend more in local shop cafés and campsite the recently announce investment zone in wrexham and flintshire also demonstrate our commitment to level up investment in research innovation and support for economic development in the region 
 my local council have sadly be unable to attract any levelling up funding or community renewal funding into north norfolk as i have repeatedly request in this place i need just £ for a roundabout at the top of holway road in sheringham but £ be too small for a levelling up bid and too much for norfolk county council in the spirit of christmas how can the minister give i a present of £ for a roundabout in north norfolk 
 i wish i could give my hon friend a christmas present i recognise his work campaign on behalf of the people of sheringham for the improvement of the a148 holway road junction i know he be already engage closely with norfolk county council on the project the £ investment fund agree through the norfolk county deal will provide the county council with the local mean to fund exactly this sort of project with the tranche of funding due to be available next year if there be anything far i can do i would be delighted to work with he and with colleague in the department for transport to progress this project 
 the minister will not have too much difficulty assess the effectiveness of the levelling up fund in northern ireland because northern ireland be the only country in the united kingdom not to receive penny in the last round of levelling up funding he will not level with the people of northern ireland give the spurious excuse that because an executive have not be form he can not allocate the money what discussion do he need to have with the northern ireland executive that he do not have with the scottish parliament the welsh parliament or any local authority in england before allocate money there 
 the right hon gentleman and i have have numerous conversation to that effect northern ireland have benefit from £ in round and of the levelling up fund but in the context of grow pressure on northern ireland budget it be right that the uk government should consider their approach to the funding available for northern ireland in this round in luf3 £ have be reserve for northern ireland and as part of our commitment to level up we will work with the restore executive   to find the good approach to support people in northern ireland i again confirm to the right hon gentleman that i will work with he and other once the executive be back up and run to see how we can well level up his community 
 whitchurch in my constituency have not receive any levelling up funding whether from the levelling up fund itself the town fund or the future high street fund now it have find itself without a civic centre because of dangerous reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete so it have lose its library registry office and drive test centre which be soon to be reopen follow a long campaign by myself and other will the minister meet i to work out what we can do to put that important building back into the heart of whitchurch 
 i would be happy to meet the hon member 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the resolution foundation ’s report on economic stagnation publish today show how levelling up simply be not happen under this government of the speaker at the event this morning be andy haldane the chair of the levelling up advisory council who say that great financial devolution be need in all area not just in the favour few it sound like he have be take inspiration from our propose take back control bill do the minister agree with he that more economic devolution be need in all area of the uk 
 i do agree with he that be why we be follow our devolution framework expand devolution to more area in the uk under the last labour government the only area in england that have a devolution deal be london through devolution we have be able to expand that offer to more than of england we have invest more than £ of local growth funding into community the length and breadth of the country restore pride and ensure that we tackle regional inequality 
 if the hon gentleman want to see level up in action he need only look at place such as teesside which be leave behind under the last labour government it be now be transform through the uk ’s large freeport teesside airport and the treasury in darlington town deal in redcar middlesbrough thornaby darlington and hartlepool high street funding in middlesbrough loftus and stockton and levelling up funding for eston and ts6 hartlepool guisborough yarm eaglescliffe and billingham the opposition be all talk we be deliver level up in action 
 madam deputy speaker please pass on my good wish to mr speaker for a speedy recovery 
 alongside the levelling up fund the department create the community renewal fund in order to alleviate regional disparity if the minister be to mark his own homework how do he think level up the country be go 
 as i say in response to a previous question we have commit more than £ of local growth funding to community across the united kingdom include in scotland we have commit to publish the detail of the levelling up mission in due course and i will ensure that the hon lady have an update when we do that 
 in fact academic from the university of manchester have find that the community renewal fund give £ to the south of england at the expense of other region which seem to be a trend that we see in level up do the minister agree with i that his department ’s plan be simply put do little to tackle regional inequality 
 i completely disagree with the hon lady the fact show something quite different as i say when i outline round in the house on   november the big recipient of the levelling up fund have be the north west the north east and yorkshire and the humber that tell a very different story from the picture paint by the hon lady 
 what step he be take to reform the private rented sector 
 i be delighted to announce that our renters reform bill complete committee stage in the house last week our ambitious and balanced reform will deliver on our manifesto commitment to abolish section eviction and to reform ground for possession so that landlord can recover their property when they need to 
 the secretary of state move with admirable speed after the death of awaab ishak to ensure that social landlord honour their obligation to tenant in term of mould and safety but those in private rent accommodation do not have that protection can the minister tell the house and the world why private tenant be put at risk in that way 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for the work that he do follow the tragic and unnecessary death of awaab ishak we have table an amendment to the renters reform bill to expand the decent home standard to the private rent sector for the time i look forward to work with he to ensure that the bill be in as good a state as it can be when it leave this house 
 the levelling up housing and communities committee have be take evidence about local government finance in the past year expenditure on homelessness and temporary accommodation have increase by the reality be that section notice be a prime driver of that the renters reform bill will abolish section but the government have not yet announce a timetable for the legislation ’s implementation or the abolition the government have say that we need court reform i completely agree but how be that help by the chancellor ’s announce in the autumn statement a freeze of the budget of the ministry of justice for the whole of the next parliament 
 i can confirm to the chair of the select committee that i meet the relevant minister in the ministry of justice just this morning to discuss that point we be work at pace to ensure that the court be ready for the big change in the private rent sector in over year the hon gentleman talk about local government funding we be conduct a new burden assessment for local government to ensure that any additional burden that be place on local government be fund properly 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the festive spirit i extend my sympathy to the secretary of state who seem to spend his time haunt by the ghost of christmas past in a tory prime minister promise to ban no fault eviction since then household have be put at risk of homelessness because of a section notice nearly time in the predecessor of the secretary of state pledge action to end the medieval practice of leasehold but just last year another homeowner become stuck in that expensive nightmare all the while the secretary of state have be beaver away draw up what can only be describe as alice in wonderland legislation a bill to ban no fault eviction that will not ban no fault eviction and a bill to ban leasehold that will not ban leasehold be he too scared to stand up to his back benchers or have he truly fall down the rabbit hole 
 i should remind the right hon lady that i be not the secretary of state let i also remind she that the renters reform bill be the big change to the private rent sector in year long than i have be alive we have to ensure that we get this right both for tenant and for the landlord in this country she may be willing to brush aside the concern of landlord and turn she back on what be often small business we be not we will deliver a bill that protect renter and ensure a fair system for landlord 
 what funding he plan to provide to local authority in essex in the financial year 
 the government will bring forward our proposal for the local government finance settlement in the usual way towards the end of the calendar year but i pledge that it will be before the house rise we will set out our proposal for the financial year and then invite view in our formal consultation 
 i welcome the minister to his new responsibility he may know he definitely will now that braintree district council colchester city council maldon district council and essex county council provide essential statutory service to my witham constituent and many more the cost of statutory service such as adult social care and care for child be rise i suspect that he will give a nuanced answer but can he give any indication of how the local government finance settlement will support those local authority in deliver those vital statutory service 
 i have never give a nuanced answer in my life and i do not intend to start do so now i thank all the council my right hon friend mention for the work they do in deliver service for their community local government have see a real term increase in core spending power over the period to i know she know that but i assure she and the house that we recognise and understand the pressure on local government we will look in the round at sector spending when finalise the budget at the upcoming settlement as we do every year but i shall certainly bear at the forefront of my mind the representation that she have make 
 what step he be take to reform the leasehold system 
 what plan he have for leasehold reform 
 on   november   the government introduce the leasehold and freehold reform bill which deliver the government ’s manifesto commitment on leasehold reform and make long term necessary change to improve home ownership for million of leaseholder across england and wales 
 in january the secretary of state tell the sunday times 
 i do not believe leasehold be fair in any way it be an outdated feudal system that need to go and we need to move to a well system and to liberate people from it 
 but the government ’s bill do not sort it nor do it free my constituent from their feudal master why 
 as the hon gentleman will know if he have read the bill that be introduce last week a substantial amount of progress be propose under it a substantial number of leaseholder will be much well off and experience a substantial improvement to their life as a result of the change that this government be propose 
 a large number of freehold homeowner in my constituency pay charge to property management company for maintenance service that be not always carry out the management company rarely respond to complaint from resident who often do not have the money to seek legal advice with a view to take court action will my hon friend confirm that the new leasehold and freehold reform bill will grant freehold homeowner the right to transparency about how their money be spend to challenge company when the contract service be not provide and where necessary to have the contract remove from that company 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that issue and i know that many of we will have hear of similar experience in our constituency that be another example i return to the point make by   the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham of reform under this bill that will significantly improve the life of leaseholder for the long term 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as you will no doubt be aware madam deputy speaker the government ’s leasehold and freehold reform bill design to ban the sale of new leasehold house do not actually contain any provision to ban the sale of new leasehold house because the department apparently do not have time to draft they before publication if and when the government rectify their mistake and add the necessary provision will they incorporate measure to reinvigorate commonhold by make it accessible and available to both prospective homebuyer and exist leaseholder if not why not 
 as have be outline we intend to bring forward further change to the bill during the process as opposition members know be normal because they have sit in the same committees that we have we be not propose to change leasehold to commonhold under the bill but that remain part of our long term approach and we would like to see further reform as soon as we be able to 
 outsider and apparently or opposition members misinterpret what i understand the secretary of state to be say in january can the minister confirm that the opportunity for enfranchisement will take away many of the problem that residential leaseholder now suffer and in effect that will get they to commonhold i will just add that if we have wait to transfer all leasehold to commonhold we would not have the bill now and leaseholder would have be betray 
 my hon friend make an important point we all want to see those in leasehold in a much improved situation we be make huge step forward with this bill and we look forward to continue and augment that reform in due course 
 what assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of council budget shortfall 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of assessment of relative need at ensure the adequacy of council funding 
 we be in close and regular contact with sector representative body and council from across the local government family to monitor budget and service delivery i have have many discussion with those body and organisation since my appointment as hon member will know the final local government finance settlement for make available up to £ for local government in england an increase in core spending power of up to £ or in cash term on the government will continue to look in the round at local government spending ahead of fiscal event and we will be announce funding for next year ’s finance settlement later this month 
 may i take this opportunity to wish mr speaker a speedy recovery 
 i thank the minister for his response but i say respectfully that i do not find it satisfactory i declare an interest as a proudly active somerset councillor council provide essential service such as adult and child ’s social care yet increase cost in social care alongside inflation mean that many council around the country be struggle to provide adequate care i must warn he that without action life will be foreshorten the cost of provide service be high in rural area than urban area yet rural resident will receive less per head in social care support will he reassure i that the forthcoming fair funding review will address the unequal way rural council be fund 
 the hon lady who be my constituency neighbour in some respect make an important point in a serious way i concur very much on the seriousness of the issue and the challenge that it be present to our upper tier authority as i say we will of course look in the round at all the pressure be place on local government to see what we can do to help she rightly mention the rural service delivery grant which i have champion it be very much in my mind to see what we can do during the settlement to address the issue that she raise of the cost disparity of deliver quality service in rural setting particularly where population be sparse 
 under the current relative need assessment formula the poor of council receive about below their assess need while the rich get above they that be hardly level up be it minister a review of the current formula which be over year old have be repeatedly postpone meanwhile local authority such as blackburn with darwen borough council could be miss out on thousand or perhaps million of pound which could deliver much need service in our town when will the review finally take place 
 the hon lady raise an important point about the formula i be tempt to say that if the spectre of covid have not quite rightly take up a huge amount of bandwidth in both central government and local government we might have be in a different place we can spend an awful lot of time discuss the minutia of the formula and there will be a time when that need to be do the crucial task that we have in hand at the current time be to play the card that we have be deal to deliver a settlement that work for local government and to deliver the quality and range of service that all our community irrespective of where they be in the country have a legitimate expectation to receive 
 we be not make terribly fast progress this afternoon could everyone who have their question write down cut out the bit at the beginning and just ask the question this be not speech time it be question time so let we just have question if we get short question we can get short answer too 
 local government finance have be front and centre of our local news give the stark situation in nottingham the minister   will know about nottingham ’s unique circumstance follow decade of poor decision and mismanagement but it will not be lose on he that the whole sector be under significant pressure i know that he will make the case about finance to the treasury but the government could help significantly by allow more flexibility in the system will he work with colleague around government to help we to remove ringfence particularly in area such as public health and transport in which we could make well decision if we have more freedom to do so 
 i be not go to give a running commentary on the situation in nottingham save to say that my right hon friend the secretary of state and i keep it under close review on my hon friend ’s wide point about trust and liberalisation his call fall on open ear i be happy to work with anybody who want to ensure that our local authority can stand up and deliver as long as they accept accountability and responsibility for the decision they take the government have a proud record on work in a relationship of trust with our local councillor and council in order to deliver for people up and down the land 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in tory lead northamptonshire county council issue a section notice as close as a council can come to declare itself bankrupt since then under this conservative government we have see a further council from across the political spectrum do exactly the same in september the credit agency moody ’s warn that more local authority will 
 fail over the near term 
 due to high inflation interest rate and service demand by the government ’s own assessment how many more council be at risk between now and budget be set next year 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place and echo the remark of my right hon friend the secretary of state it be great to see he back on the front bench 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point nobody be go to doubt that section be a serious issue as i have say to the local government association and other i do not think it be right for we to name and shame point the finger or assign blame we be intent on work with council that have already alert we to see what we can do to help and on work alongside council that have concern to ensure they do not fall into that situation i be not go to give a running commentary on that save to make this pledge we will work with those council to ensure that they can continue to deliver for their voter 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net on the use of land for renewable energy generation 
 the government have in place a framework develop in collaboration with the department for energy security and net that support the deployment of renewable energy technology that be balance by national planning policy which be clear that land asset such as farmland must also be protect 
 on current usage acre of solar panel be require to power around home whereas a small modular reactor require just football pitch and power home do my hon friend agree that solar be a highly inefficient land use and can he confirm that the provision to protect land use in food production remain in the new national planning policy framework 
 i know that my hon friend have a long stand interest in this issue we will be publish more on the nppf shortly but he be absolutely right that we need a variety of different energy source that can support the uk ’s future energy need 
 as the minister know there be a disparity between the contract for difference scheme for the mainland and what exist for northern ireland i have make overture to the minister responsible to see whether we can get that change but that have not happen yet will the minister use his influence to make sure that we in northern ireland be treat equally with everybody else in the united kingdom 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question he might like to write to i or i be happy to speak to he separately in order to understand the issue and either i or my colleague in the department for energy security and net will be happy to respond 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the government ’s levelling up policy at reduce regional inequality 
 a lot do a lot still to do but certainly much more than the scottish government 
 in that case can the secretary of state tell we whether scotland will receive more or less funding to tackle regional inequality than it would have receive if we have do as of voter in my constituency do and vote to remain in the european union 
 we be do well outside the european union if we have follow the hon gentleman ’s advice and remain in the european union we would have find that the fishing industry be decimate by the common fishery policy and we would not have have the opportunity to invest in new levelling up partnership in argyll and bute the western isles dundee and of course the west central belt this uk government be intervene where the scottish government can not to support local government in scotland which be why whenever i address the convention of scottish local authorities i get a warm welcome than the minister of scotland do 
 do the secretary of state agree that it be a great shame that stoke on trent city council which be now labour run have scale back its levelling up plan by get rid of the propose e sport arena the of its kind outside of london it would have build on staffordshire university ’s uk leading indeed world lead e sport course as well as the job create since the £ we get in levelling up funding the £ kidsgrove town deal and much more 
 when it come to level up and the e sport centre i be always clear that it be my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north and kidsgrove who answer the call of duty he be absolutely right to say that under the labour council now in stoke on trent the huge progress we be make on level up have stall what we need be more conservative elect representative in stoke on trent 
 what recent discussion he have have with the electoral commission on administer free and fair election 
 free fair and resilient election be pivotal to our society and if we agree on nothing else in this house i hope it be   on that the government regularly meet the electoral commission both at ministerial and official level to discuss a broad range of electoral issue and i be due to have my meeting with it next tuesday 
 i thank the minister for his answer and i welcome he to his place he will know that the cyber attack in october be not detect until august and the commission admit that it have fail a cyber security test in the same year what work be the minister do with the security minister to ensure that the defend democracy taskforce have a remit with the electoral commission i agree with the minister as should all member of this house that we should have free and fair election without intervention from other state so what work be he do to ensure the general election next year be protect from any hostile state 
 the hon gentleman and dare i say it my friend raise an important point there be a good range of discussion take place between my department and the home office and a range of meeting focus on that conscious of the role that the commission can play we must ensure that those who stand in our election participate in they and administer they feel safe and secure in their role and moreover that the result whatever they be stand up and be not open to challenge as a result of cyber attack or anything else 
 i call the shadow minister 
 a report from the all party parliamentary group on democracy and the constitution have find that the photo voter id scheme create a real risk of injustice and potential discrimination the report highlight the case of an   immunocompromise woman who be deny she right and her voice at the local election after be tell that she need to take off her mask do the minister agree that deny someone a say in how their community be run because of a disability be completely unacceptable can he confirm that any indication of potential discrimination find in the photo voter id system will be deal with prior to the next set of election 
 the hon lady raise a serious point and let i put it on record that i would be happy to meet she and the appg to discuss their issue and concern we have make great stride there be a specific workstream in ensure we maximise how those who have a disability can vote and do so in a free and unfettered way and we will continue with that i be very sorry to hear about the case the hon lady raise but if she wish to write to i on the issue i will of course look into it in my discussion with the commission it be absolutely pivotal that in all we do with regard to our election rule access to voting freedom to vote be absolutely at the heart of it and as the minister responsible for election i shall guarantee that 
 right i be go to issue a challenge to the house we have   topical question and other to get through we have very little time to do it and we have a lot of business today and i would not like mr speaker to think that we be go slowly just because he be not here short question short answer 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 at the autumn statement my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer make available to my department money for investment in london cambridge and leeds planning capacity and capability the local authority housing fund the local housing allowance home buying and selling and the affordable home guarantee scheme quite a coup 
 brilliant 
 i think i get most of that newport west be home to a thriving and inclusive muslim community and i pay tribute to the multi faith work be do to bring our community together after the terrible event in the middle east can the minister outline what discussion he have have with the welsh government about support this multi faith work and about eradicate islamophobia in wales and the uk once and for all 
 i be very grateful to the hon lady of course newport be of many city and town where there be effective work between representative of muslim community and figure in local government more widely i have the opportunity to discuss some of these issue with the minister of wales at the british irish council just day ago but there be much more that we need to do to deal with anti muslim hatred 
 over the summer the minister for housing planning and building safety my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley publish a non binding code of practice for clad remediation work follow intensive discussion with he and also my highlight the devaste case of st francis tower will he update the house on how in practice that non binding code of practice be work have it lead to improve behaviour and be a step forward and have he consider far my view that perhaps that code of practice need to be legally binding 
 my hon friend be a drive force behind that code of practice and we be monitor it actively anecdotally i be see few issue although there be still some i would be happy to receive from he and other members of the house any information or evidence that suggest there be still a problem 
 the cost to council of deliver service will exceed their core funding by £ this year newcastle expect a funding gap of £ follow £ of conservative cut to funding and year of conservative economic failure can my constituent rely on council service under a conservative government 
 they certainly can not rely on a labour government because the leader of the opposition just this morning have be talk about his admiration for margaret thatcher and cost cutting i be afraid all the hon lady be do be raise false hope that have no chance of be satisfied under a labour government 
 my interest be in the register of members financial interests why be it government policy to deny a landlord and tenant the ability to agree a mutually convenient fix term tenancy 
 fix term tenancy can trap tenant into poor quality home and trap landlord into long term tenancy with bad tenant with the abolition of section of the housing act we no long see such thing as necessary but i be happy to work with my right hon friend to ensure that the renters reform bill work for his constituent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the late government figure highlight that a record child children!—are in temporary accommodation in the lead up to christmas which be a increase meanwhile only home for social rent be build last year if we take into account all the home build since that be minus each year do the minister regret hand back £ of unspent departmental money to the treasury last year give that we be in an urgent housing crisis why not adopt labour ’s plan to get britain build again with home over that parliamentary period 
 i remind the hon gentleman that our target be home per year which when multiply by equal in the autumn statement we have measure to address the challenge of temporary accommodation we uprate the local housing allowance to the percentile there be a new £ for a homelessness fund and an extra £ for the local authority housing fund 
 do my hon friend agree that stoke on trent city council should invest its share of the £ that it recently secure from the national lottery heritage fund on of the beautiful beast of burslem include the indoor market in order to regenerate the mother town for which the leader of stoke on trent city council be a local ward councillor 
 it be fantastic that stoke on trent have be choose as of the place to benefit from the national lottery heritage fund ’s £ investment in the heritage places initiative the fund will make its funding decision under that initiative and independent from government however i be sure that the national lottery have hear my hon friend ’s loud cry for burslem and i be sure it will look at it favourably 
 sacha from kempston bedford be of an increase number of freeholder who be afflict by estate maintenance charge will the secretary of state commit to a review into the role of those excessive unpredictable and often opaque fee and insurance cost that not only treat mostly new homeowner as cash cow but be put their home at risk 
 that be a very important point and yes we be on it 
 the great yarmouth and lowestoft enterprise zone which be set up in have be very successful with no investment zone in the east of england will my hon friend meet my right hon friend the member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis and i to consider how good the enterprise zone can be enhance so that it can continue to create job in the low carbon energy sector 
 i would be delighted to meet my hon friend and my right hon friend the member for great yarmouth we have no plan at present to amend enterprise zone but i be keen to ensure that their constituent continue to reap the reward of level up include the £ of investment for sizewell c and freeport east which will generate thousand of job across his region in new low carbon technology 
 caius house be a small youth charity in battersea that lease a space in a multi use high rise building that include residential dwelling despite its have state of the art fire alarm system the charity face huge wake watch cost as the building safety act do not protect registered charity such as caius house will the secretary of state look into this case will he seek to bring forward legislation to protect charity from high cost due to fire safety remediation work 
 i think we respond to a write question on this matter just a few month ago but i be happy to meet the hon lady to talk about it in more detail if there still be a problem i be not aware of at the moment 
 horsham be suffer severe water stress and be subject to water neutrality do the minister agree that mitigation should be thorough evidence and monitor 
 i absolutely agree water neutrality be impact on small part of the country but it need to be deal with seriously and proportionately by statutory consultee and then with a can do attitude from council where appropriate 
 do the minister agree that young people leave care after their birthday should get more help to get their home will he back my campaign that i be run with barnado ’s and plymouth care leaver for a deposit scheme for care leaver and a rent guarantee scheme because every single care leaver leave local authority care deserve a good decent and safe home 
 i know the hon gentleman have do a significant amount of work on this matter within plymouth and i know that my colleague in the department for work and pensions be do a significant amount of work too and i would be happy to meet he to talk more about the matter 
 sadly a homeless person die over the weekend the number of rough sleeper be increase and the temperature be fall will my hon friend take immediate action to ensure that rough sleeper be provide with a decent place to sleep particularly during this cold weather 
 my hon friend raise an important point clearly the death in manchester be tragic local authority can activate the severe weather emergency protocol measure manchester do activate those but sadly the man be not know to local service i absolutely agree with my hon friend and we will do everything to support rough sleeper over the winter period 
 the government announce in the autumn statement £ of new money for homeless prevention for next year but that be just a drop in the ocean with enfield council alone face a £ overspend on temporary accommodation for this year when will this government recognise the scale of the crisis and provide top up funding for the homelessness prevention grant and discretionary housing payment 
 i remind the hon lady that our total package for homelessness and rough sleeping over year be £ the £ be in addition to that but i agree with she that there be real pressure on homelessness particularly in london and that be why there be measure in the autumn statement 
 it be now week since the bin be empty in warrington a national pay dispute have spill over into a local disagreement do the minister agree that it be now urgent that labour run warrington borough council get round the table with the union and find an urgent agreement before the situation turn into a health emergency 
 absolutely again and again we find that labour run local authority despite their much vaunted relationship with trade union be incapable of resolve these dispute whether in birmingham or warrington labour must do well otherwise work people suffer 
 on public service city of york council area come out of when it come to public funding as a result service be now have to be cut in the area as the council have £ less than when we last have a labour government how will the secretary of state ensure that fair funding stretch across all public service when look at the new funding formula 
 we be absolutely committed to make sure that local authority receive the resource they need have have conversation with the leader of city of york council i appreciate the constraint under which it be operate and we hope to be able to say more in the local government finance settlement 
 i have speak to ministers about the work of organisation such as fromehall mill and the sub rooms and we have be down to berkeley town with they in mind when will the next round of announcement about the community ownership fund be make 
 i be delighted to confirm to my hon friend that the next round of the community ownership fund open this week on   december we will have the outcome of the last window in the come week but i know that she be very keen on fromehall mill and berkeley books which she have be champion 
 the announcement that edinburgh airport be for sale come hard on the heel of the announcement last week that grangemouth be close the oil refinery what can the secretary of state say to reassure my constituent in edinburgh west that everything possible have be do to ensure that this do not undermine the green enterprise zone in the area 
 the hon lady do a fantastic job of stand up for her constituent in edinburgh west and she be absolutely right the uk government should be and be work with the scottish government and private sector partner in order to ensure that sustainable growth continue to be part of the plan for edinburgh and the wide lothian region 
 it be clear that the government be plan to protect council during the transition to the new planning system and be not plan to force council into have an out of date   plan by take away their right to submit a new up to date plan can the secretary of state help i get this across to my local lib dem run council which be say the exact opposite 
 i have the great pleasure of visit harborough on friday when i be able to see the enormously high regard with which my hon friend be hold unfortunately that high regard do not extend to oadby and wigston borough council or harborough   district council liberal democrat authority that be play fast and loose with the planning system and which be not put in place the protection that their resident deserve all too often we find that liberal democrat local authority do not have plan in place do not have plan department that work and let their resident down the liberal democrats be the enemy of good housing policy and that be why we need to make sure that conservative be in power in local government 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state to make a statement regard the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 a tragedy be unfold in the middle east israel have suffer the bad terror attack in its history and palestinian civilian be experience a devastating and grow humanitarian crisis as the foreign secretary make clear last week ’s agreement be a crucial step towards provide relief to the family of the hostage and address the humanitarian emergency in gaza this pause have provide an opportunity to ensure that much great volume of food fuel and other lifesave aid can enter gaza 
 on   november the british government announce a furth £ worth of humanitarian assistance triple our exist aid budget for the occupied palestinian territories this financial year and bring it to a total of £ during the pause the uk aircraft carry tonne of humanitarian aid for gaza arrive in egypt bring the total amount of uk humanitarian aid provide by british aircraft to tonne that aid be now be disperse to the united nations to support critical food water health shelter and protection need in gaza and to pre position emergency supply in the region we be also actively explore other aid route include by sea 
 the pause that end last week be a crucial step towards provide relief to the family of the hostage and address the humanitarian crisis in gaza we have say repeatedly that we would like to see an extension uk humanitarian funding will continue to support trust partner to provide humanitarian assistance and negotiate humanitarian access in gaza the uk will continue in conjunction with our international partner to advocate internationally on humanitarian priority these include respect for international humanitarian law the need for fuel humanitarian access humanitarian pause and an increase in the type of assistance we be urgently explore all diplomatic option to increase that include urge israel to open other exist land border such as kerem shalom 
 we welcome the intensive international co operation include effort from qatar and the usa which lead to the agreement and we thank partner for their continue work we remain committed to make progress towards a state solution 
 britain ’s long stand position on the middle east peace process be clear we support a negotiate settlement lead to a safe and secure israel live alongside a viable and sovereign palestinian state the uk will continue to work with all partner in the region to reach a long term political solution that enable both israelis and palestinians to live in peace 
 give recent event it be surprising and regrettable that neither the prime minister nor the foreign secretary be make a statement today the reality be that this conflict have sadly reach another phase and many more innocent life will be lose if we do not act now we   urge the government to continue to push for another cessation of hostility and for all remain hostage to be free to be clear israel must not besiege or blockade gaza it must comply with international law and protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure and ensure that attempt to address the humanitarian catastrophe be ramp up quickly 
 in the last few day partner on the ground have become increasingly concerned about the safe zone at al mawasi with report suggest that aid be not reach those who be there have the government hold talk with israel and other to ensure that it do and to seek assurance that palestinians who flee there not will not be move far still the minister will know that that be a key concern of arab state shelter be severely overcrowded dysentery be spread and the risk of cholera be now significant that must be mitigate now be there be serious plan to deal with sewage and to distribute medicine and vaccine it be winter in gaza where nearly people be displace many be in tent or in the open air i urge the minister again to follow the us ’s lead and appoint a humanitarian co ordinator to get the truck move more quickly to get fuel in and to work towards the opening of karem shalom 
 the uk and partner must redouble effort towards an endure cessation of hostility and a last political solution israel must be assure that hamas can not carry out an attack like   october   ever again but to build a last peace we must assure a generation of palestinians that there be hope that they their child and their grandchild can expect the security and opportunity that be their right with a plan for child both to prevent their death and to prioritise their life and a clear message that there can be no reoccupation or reduction of gazan territory and that those displace have the right to return home 
 i urge the government to play their part in end the illegal settlement and settler violence in the west bank and to create a plan for the reconstruction and renewal of gaza we must do more without delay to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe unfold in front of we as we simultaneously work towards a well future many more life will be lose if we do not act now 
 i be grateful for my counterpart ’s constructive tone we be in agreement we be push for a further pause which we regard as imperative the success as it be of the last show the utility of a pause in term of the increase flow of humanitarian support and we continue to strain every sinew in our diplomacy to aim for that the foreign secretary make that argument to his various ministerial colleague last week and will continue to do that with his counterpart and ministerial counterpart right across the middle east 
 the hon member mention the safe zone we continue to monitor that and official in the region be see how it unfold with regard to the humanitarian impact she be right to draw the house ’s attention to the grievous humanitarian impact of disease we be confident that channel our fund through the un agency the united nations relief and works agency the office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs and unicef be the right way to go about that but the scale of increase of need be hugely alarming and we be painfully aware that woman and child often bear the   most unfortunate brunt of such impact i assure she that we be redouble effort clearly our financial contribution have triple but that go in hand with our political effort because it be only through a last peace which she refer to that this will be resolve 
 the humanitarian component be of utmost urgency but we must not forget the political component which run in tandem our stance on the illegal settlement in the west bank and our long stand support for a sustainable solution with palestinian statehood at the heart of the region ’s future be undiminishe in addition to our humanitarian effort in our political and diplomatic effort we will continue to argue for palestinian statehood as the seed for a long term solution in the region 
 i call the father of the house 
 the house will welcome the bipartisan support for what the british government be try to do most of we know that our direct power in the area end more than year ago i put to those who want a simple ceasefire that a permanent end to violence would be help by people around israel recognise its international boundary and by israel ensure that it could withdraw to its own boundary and stop the aggressive settler activity outside its own area in the west bank 
 the father of the house make a good point a state solution in which both side respect the other ’s right to exist and in which there be an end to settler violence be an essential precondition to any long term peace in the region 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 exactly as it say it would at the end of the humanitarian pause israel have resume its offensive in gaza with full force include an appalling attack on the médecins sans frontières aid convoy official figure estimate that palestinians be kill this weekend alone a massive cull of innocent civilian be take place right now it be blatantly obvious that all appeal make by the uk government and other for israel to avoid civilian casualty be be ignore i wonder just how much this government regret give netanyahu that blank cheque particularly as million of displace people be be squeeze into a wasteland on the egyptian border and the indiscriminate bombing continue at the weekend the eu ’s foreign policy chief josep borrell echo scotland ’s minister say 
 the solution can only be political 
 and centre on state and he be correct what be hold the uk government back from officially recognise the state of palestine as a fundamental step to achieve a long term solution to this awful crisis 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s contribution we be painfully aware of the tragic and significant human impact of the miliary operation especially with regard to civilian casualty but the issue should not be simplify to the degree where we forget that hamas be a terrorist group that be prosecute atrocity we must see the civilian casualty as a product of the terrible conflict result from hamas terrorist   atrocity of   october we continue to argue very strongly to israel that military operation must be conduct accord to humanitarian law avoid civilian casualty on the state solution of the major obstacle be hamas a terrorist group commit to the destruction of israel if hamas be in charge there would be no state solution a necessary prerequisite be the evolution of a well form of palestinian leadership in gaza 
 if the raf can fly surveillance plane over the gaza strip in the much need search for hostage and to help their release what be to stop we from fly cargo plane over and parachute food and medicine to a starve population 
 my right hon friend will have hear in my opening statement that a very significant amount of humanitarian aid—74 tonne have be deliver via uk aircraft we be redouble our effort great utility lie in assess whether there can be a maritime route to increase humanitarian supply 
 i call the chair of the international development committee 
 i welcome the response the minister be give but i want to hear the foreign secretary ’s response on   november we have a harrowing session with the humanitarian organisation on the ground in gaza we write to the foreign secretary but have not have a reply we have not have a reply either about when he will come in front of our committee with such a horrific and fast move situation in israel and gaza when can this house expect to hear from the foreign secretary 
 i be sure it will be very soon 
 the idea that settlement be the reason there be not a state solution be just complete and utter tosh the reason there be not a state solution be that hamas seek the total genocide and ethnic cleansing of the state of israel they seek to murder every single jew they use the most awful sexual violence against woman on   october some report of which we read in shocking detail in the times this weekend there have not be a word from either dispatch box so far about the information on the abuse of the hostage who have be release or a condemnation of the violence that be why there have not be a state solution will the minister confirm that the government will continue to stay strong and support israel in all its activity to root out this murderous terrorist cult 
 i do not know if my hon friend hear my previous answer in which i say that a principal blockage to a state solution be hamas themselves they be a terrorist group who have commit the most heinous terrorist act we therefore continue to be supportive of israel ’s defend its people and its security 
 palestinians have lose all hope of a state solution thank to the policy of the netanyahu government in recent year would it not give they some hope if we follow other country lead and honour the vote take in this house year ago to recognise palestinian statehood 
 our effort be focus on a more pragmatic avenue work with ally in the region to ensure there be sustainable and more meaningful support right across the region for a state solution 
 if the government accept that there can be no political solution unless hamas be remove from control in gaza can the minister explain to we who exactly will remove hamas from that level of control in gaza 
 the political future of the palestinians be a matter for palestinians 
 i would like to start by agree with   the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy who speak about the rightful condemnation of the genocidal word from hamas these be the extreme of the debate and on the other side of these extreme be ministers in the israeli government who be call for the dropping of a nuclear bomb on gaza and call the siege of gaza and the spread of epidemic a good thing those extreme do not represent where the majority of palestinians israelis and the population across the world want to be which be with this government on state my question be simple state be all very well to say but in term of resource what be the foreign commonwealth and development office actually do to make it happen 
 our considerable resource by way of humanitarian aid and political and diplomatic effort be entirely focus on that we bring a considerable diplomatic heft in our relationship across the region and we be an important and permanent member of the un security council so we must not underestimate our ability to bring positive political leverage to this situation that be something we be resolutely focus on 
 over the weekend the times carry chill testimony of hamas ’s extreme violence against woman on   october gang rape woman find with bloodied underwear break bone from rape beheading and woman find with gunshot to their private part what israeli woman hostage hold in hamas captivity have endure and may still be endure now do not bear think about will my hon friend join i in condemn those appalling act of violence and this aspect of the ongoing humanitarian situation do he acknowledge that hamas terrorist in custody have speak quite openly about their order to rape and defile woman 
 i agree with my right hon and learn friend that these be deeply shocking report they be sadly and very painfully characteristic of the kind of terrorist violence that we have come to expect from hamas and we deeply condemn they 
 last week i have the opportunity to visit qatar with a parliamentary delegation we meet dr al ansari of the official spokesperson with egypt the us israel and other involve in the negotiation to release hostage and secure the temporary humanitarian truce it be clear that this be a fragile truce that require great pressure from the international community on all relevant   party from middle east country such as qatar on hamas and from the us and the uk on the israelis to bring an end to this bloodshed what be our government do as a permanent member of the un security council and a g7 nation to ensure that work be do to bring an end to the bloodshed and secure a permanent ceasefire that be what people of all background and community need we need a peacebuilding process we need our government to act what be our government do 
 we continue to use all lever at our disposal to argue for another humanitarian pause regrettably it seem that discussion of a ceasefire be premature give that hamas be commit to the destruction of the state of israel we be resolutely commit to another humanitarian pause and we be use all mean that be available to we to argue for it 
 may i remind the minister of the prime minister ’s word at mansion house he say that the uk will 
 act to shape the world not be shape by it 
 i raise that with the minister with regard to the loss of life that we have see across the board we have to do everything we can to preserve human life i support humanitarian pause to do that at a very early stage but the time have come for the uk to take a lead at the un as a member of the security council lead at the security council call for a ceasefire with regards—[interruption we all have our own view on this matter i have support humanitarian pause before but the time have come for the uk to work towards a ceasefire the release of all the hostage humanitarian assistance and a political solution in line with our own security council resolution and the border when will we push that at the security council and lead the world on this matter 
 we be continue to shape the outcome and for we the most pragmatic and useful outcome at the moment be a further humanitarian pause which we be argue for strongly 
 if every humanitarian pause be simply a prelude to the further bombing of gaza by israel what will be leave other than a refugee camp and a wasteland and who do the minister think will govern that 
 the hon member make a good point of course every civilian death be a tragedy and the house be painfully aware of the human cost of the unfold tragedy as i say aside from military operation the political future and the way that palestinians represent themselves be a question for palestinians 
 i welcome the government ’s support for the extension of the humanitarian pause so that more aid can get into gaza and more life can be save may i ask the minister about post conflict governance in gaza fatah be not hamas and hamas be not fatah clearly by definition fatah be marginally well in the eye of some palestinians but when they have go to the ballot box the palestinians have not vote for fatah they have vote for other i notice that there have be a lot of high level diplomatic visit to the senior leadership of fatah may i encourage   the government to perhaps look more widely at who might form the government of gaza in the future so that the uk do not repeat the mistake of the past and fatah do not return to office only to be throw out year later and perhaps replace by a new hamas 
 it would be easy for we to prejudge and guess political outcome in the west bank or indeed in gaza but we will not do that what we would seek post conflict be a democratic renaissance of the ability of palestinians to represent themselves and govern themselves responsibly and we must not prejudge or guess that 
 like many other member i have constituent who be british citizen and whose family be trap in gaza and desperate for humanitarian visa constituent who write to i at the weekend say that her year old mother have be displace time and be now in rafah she and her brother and sister who be british citizen and senior professional say that they do not want state fund because they can support their family but surely they can bring their family my constituent ’s year old mother her sister and her sister ’s month old baby to the united kingdom in order to look after they what can i tell these people about humanitarian visa and will the minister lean on the home office to address the question of issue humanitarian visa 
 i note the hon and learn lady ’s question with interest give that she have cite a specific case that of her constituent with link to rafah we can pursue it individually if she furnish we with the detail 
 with the humanitarian pause now close the nightmare be back for the remain hostage and their family for the palestinians in desperate need of aid and also for all citizen on both side who be fearful of what fall from the sky however with no timeline and no clear plan the next chapter be likely to be dark and more deadly do my hon friend agree that israel will not indeed can not resolve the humanitarian governance and security issue alone the international community have a vital role to play not least to avoid escalation so would the uk consider co host an international summit with the united states and other stakeholder to begin the discussion that will start to resolve the big issue 
 the international dimension be critical and what be not in doubt be our ability and our intent to use our international diplomatic network and our connection across the region because the regional approach be hugely important in this context we will endeavour to use our connection throughout the gulf state and the rest of the middle east and internationally to seek a just and long term solution 
 what i want what my constituent want and what the whole country want be to stop kill child stop kill civilian they do not know who be the good person or group of people to do that but for god ’s sake someone stop this killing of child 
 the image we have see of civilian death have of course be acutely painful we continue to use our relationship with israel to ensure that it be restrain in term of its application of force and we be also forthright in our absolute condemnation of the terrorist atrocity perpetrate by hamas and the grotesque effect that it have have on israelis of all age 
 despite the humanitarian pause the majority—137 hostage be still hold by the terrorist in gaza of those be child be over and be female and there be foreign national clearly the negotiation with these terrorist break down over the weekend so what action be the fcdo taking to ensure that the hostage be free and return to their family 
 that be at the front and centre of our diplomatic effort internationally obviously there be a complex web of negotiation effort on which i will not comment in detail but we be painfully conscious of the need to exert all our institutional effort to bring those people home safely 
 the humanitarian crisis in gaza be unspeakable with people now displace injure and the number of hospital bed down to about and dropping and more than dead my constituent noura have lose her brother and nephew who be blow up in their home after they go back when they think it be safe to do so her sister in law have lose her limb and other child be in hospital in intensive care 
 i need to ask the minister these question what be the plan for humanitarian visa what be the plan for safe zone and how serious be it what be the plan for people who have lose their home their family member and their limb what be the plan seriously to work with international ally towards a permanent ceasefire the release of hostage and a proper political solution 
 the hon lady make a good point about the impact on hospital that be why we have triple our aid we be focus on channel it through the un agency that can most effectively help people in hospital whether by the provision of fuel or other supply that be the groundwork that we hope will eventually unlock the political phase to improve the solution it be humanitarian with the politic in tandem which we be also do 
 the sexual violence mete out by hamas on   october   be horrendous in the half of last month a number of member on both side of the house receive detail pass on by a doctor in nasser hospital in khan yunis who say that of his child and of his grandchild be among the man woman and child in his house who have all be destroy that afternoon while he be work a hospital shift we be pile misery on misery so as former infantry soldier to another i ask my hon friend to make sure that the british government renew their plea for the great possible precision in pursuit of the terrorist so that we do not lose more civilian life in that way 
 my hon friend speak with experience and knowledge and we be make exactly those plea to our israeli colleague 
 week after the unjustifiable murder of jewish people in israel and the countless rape of israeli and jewish woman be the minister disappoint that the united nations woman ’s group make the most facile and mealy mouthed statement that do not even use the word rape in describe what have happen will he use his and the government ’s influence to draw to the attention of the united nations the importance of get on side on this issue and condemn sexual violence against woman and the rape of woman just because they be jews do not mean that they do not matter and that point should be make to the united nations over and over again 
 of course these report be shocking and we certainly condemn it rape be rape and we must call it out 
 the more detail we learn of the barbaric attack of   october   and the treatment of the victim especially the woman the more horrific it become can only imagine the sheer anguish that the family of the victim go through on a daily basis as more information come out so can my hon friend tell i what humanitarian support be be provide to the family of the victim of hamas 
 that be a terribly good question a large proportion of our triple humanitarian aid budget of £ will be channel through unicef and the other un agency unrwa and ocha and a large proportion of it will support woman affect by conflict 
 i be sorry but i must press the minister because i do not feel that he have answer the question on what the government ’s strategy be particularly the political strategy we all feel this so strongly no child should ever be the target of a terrorist or in any conflict so what be the government ’s political strategy to protect the life of child 
 our strategy be to exert all effort to bring about peace 
 i welcome the minister ’s grow success in get aid into gaza and the tripling of uk aid but even as he work urgently to get aid to the needy civilian of gaza in the short possible time will the government redouble their effort to bring about a diplomatic solution perhaps use a contact group in order that we can grow the humanitarian pause into a just and last peace and a state solution 
 that be exactly our strategy it be to use diplomatic effort in concert with humanitarian effort to bring about a situation whereby diplomacy can take effect and the foundation can be lay of a long term peace we be clearly not there yet and it will require a huge amount of diplomatic effort right across the region and a close relationship with many party that be something to which we can bring a great deal of expertise and utility 
 what action have the government implement to integrate their approach to prevent atrocity into the uk ’s foreign and development policy how have they involve the office for conflict stabilisation and mediation ’s mass atrocity prevention hub in risk assess israel ’s action in gaza 
 those issue be weave into the fabric of our diplomacy and they be hugely important in all our work across the middle east and nowhere more so than the occupy palestinian territories 
 the committee to protect journalists have say that palestinian journalist have be kill in the gaza strip since   october it say this be the bad period for the killing of journalist since it start keep record in do that not illustrate the wholly indiscriminate nature of what be be do by the israel defence forces will the minister impress upon the netanyahu government the complete unacceptability of this situation 
 i do not accept the right hon gentleman ’s description of it be wholly indiscriminate but of course i take seriously his comment about journalist have be kill that be tragic but i take issue with his characterisation of it be wholly indiscriminate of course we make representation to israel to constrain and focus its operation and we will continue to do so 
 like so many member i again receive hundred of email this weekend from my constituent who be appal and horrify at the continue killing of innocent palestinian man woman and child they want the killing to stop so will the minister condemn the act of violence and extremism by israeli settler in the west bank and call on the israeli authority to prevent settler violence to ensure accountability for perpetrator and to condemn extremist rhetoric 
 this government be on record i say it in my statement in condemn settler violence in the west bank but we must be very clear that this military operation be under way in gaza because of the terrorist atrocity carry out by hamas on   october that be the terrible and tragic truth 
 over civilian have now be kill in gaza and israel ’s military operation have not abate follow the pause in fighting what specific request be the government make to their israeli counterpart to stop the killing when the minister say a ceasefire be premature it sound like a tacit acceptance that the disproportionate and indiscriminate destruction of civilian area be a legitimate mean of israel pursue its war aim 
 a ceasefire would only be possible if hamas have not state their intent to wipe israel off the map and to perpetrate another atrocity of the nature of   october we be argue for a humanitarian pause to allow de escalation and the further flow of humanitarian aid 
 i echo the call for a long term political solution to this dreadful conflict and for an end to the international community include this government consign it to the too   difficult pile in the absence of the permanent ceasefire that i be sure we all want to see do the minister recognise and will he reinforce the warning from the united states and other that israel ’s action in gaza must be proportionate otherwise they be in clear breach of international law as the comprehensive evidence from multiple agency work on the ground in gaza strongly suggest i be sure he care deeply about humanitarian issue so will he join i in say that send text or qr code to advise people to evacuate a war zone when there be no internet and no power to charge phone be wholly inadequate and can not protect civilian and save innocent life 
 we have call and continue to call on israel to abide by international humanitarian law that be not in doubt its military response must be proportionate and we continue to argue strongly that it should show constraint in its pursuit of hamas ’s terrorist operative embed in the gaza strip
