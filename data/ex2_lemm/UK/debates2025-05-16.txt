 my hon friend mention many real story influence this debate i will mention more my constituent mick murray who be in the public gallery today mick help close friend bob and ann to make the painful journey to dignita both simply want to die at home with dignity and surround by love one instead they have to make that journey overseas at great cost and legal jeopardy mick say 
 i help they out of compassion and i think that be what ’ miss from our current law 
 do my hon friend agree 
 order we will set the example by follow the rule of the house we will have short intervention not speech there be a load of other member 
 i thank my hon friend for that intervention that be a very powerful point if slightly long there be people who face these really traumatic and difficult decision every day include louise shackleton who i believe be also with we today 
 on a point of order mr speaker i think this be a debate to discuss amendment not a general debate 
 it be but i think this be the open lead in to the amendment i will make that judgment call 
 thank you mr speaker if i may just finish that point 
 rise 
 order may i just say to people that if we be go to have continuous intervention and   if they continue to make the same intervention they should not be shock if they end up at the bottom of the list i want to help people because all this do be soak up time jim shannon will be a good example 
 mr speaker i will always be at the end of the list so it be important for i to make an intervention   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   set the scene very well on reading but since then thing have change for instance the royal college of psychiatrists have voice strong concern in opposition to the bill about judicial oversight robust protection against coercion and so on as well as the effect it will have on vulnerable group such as those with dementia down syndrome or mental illness do the hon lady not respect the viewpoint of my constituent who    tell i that they be oppose to the bill in principle   and all the thing that be come forward the new clause do not address the issue that the hon lady be refer to 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that intervention and he be absolutely right that there be a range of view on this issue and i be deeply respectful of that i take all those point into consideration as we embark on this debate again today 
 perhaps most importantly mr speaker i have speak to terminally ill people themselves over recent month it be impossible to know what it must feel like to receive a terminal diagnosis and i have nothing but admiration for people who have bravely speak about their personal situation some publicly include of course dame esther rantzen and other who have do so privately many by email their mp i know mine be not the only inbox full of such email 
 will my hon friend distance herself from the correspondence from dame esther rantzen who accuse those of we who have concern about the bill of have undeclared religious belief many colleague find that distasteful and disrespectful 
 i thank my hon friend for that intervention i have not see those comment but it be absolutely right that whatever our view be on this issue we must remain respectful 
 i also want to thank colleague here in parliament mps and indeed staff who have share their personal story of loss with i over recent month this be a really important point these be real people with real story and they must always be at the heart of the debate 
 public support for assist dying in this country have be consistently high for a long time now and we have see movement in jurisdiction around the world include just this week in scotland i congratulate colleague in holyrood particularly liam mcarthur msp for hold such a compassionate and respectful debate which i hope we can emulate today 
 it be right that we consider this change with great care as we be do today but we should also remember as with other big social change such as give woman bodily autonomy on their reproductive right or allow gay 
 order we do say when we have the conversation that there should just be an introduction to the debate very early on i think this be why member be begin to get frustrate we should now be speak to the amendment 
 thank you mr speaker i will move on to the amendment if i may i want to acknowledge the work of the bill committee in relation to the amendment because a huge amount of work be do by member from all party with a range of view 
 order i be really bother because today be a day for amendment and we really need to understand the view they cover as the member in   charge of the bill you will i be sure really want to get into the depth of the amendment and not continue in that way 
 i do indeed mr speaker you be absolutely right the amendment that we be discuss today build on some of the work of the committee and i think that be important we take a lot of step to strengthen the bill in committee and i be pleased to work collaboratively with colleague in that way 
 as i come on to the amendment which have be table in my name let i say that the government be of course neutral on the issue of assist dying but have always be clear that workability be essential if the bill be to pass i have work closely with an outstanding team of civil servant from the department of health and social care and the ministry of justice and it be with their technical advice on make the bill workable and give coherence to the statute book that i propose these amendment today 
 will the hon lady confirm that those civil servant be comfortable with the impact of the bill and that people with disability mental health issue neurodiversity and other medical condition will not be coerce or under pressure because of this bill 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that intervention the civil servant be clearly neutral on the issue they certainly have not express any opinion on the content of the bill they have merely provide the technical advice and expertise and they have do so brilliantly in that regard 
 new clause amendment and new schedule be table in my name as well as correct the injustice in the legal situation key tenet of this bill be choice for die people but it be also important that there be choice for doctor and other healthcare professional and indeed anyone else the bill be always clear that 
 no register medical practitioner or other health professional be under any duty to participate in the provision of assistance in accordance with this act 
 but new clause expand that protection it broaden the people to whom it apply and the function to which it relate new schedule make provision for enforcement of this right 
 not to be subject to any detriment 
 in connection with the bill 
 do my hon friend accept that there may be a weakness in new schedule in as far as it protect a person from action take by their employer for example it would not necessarily protect an agency worker who be contract to perform a service but the original medical body decide not to re engage that person ’s service 
 i refer my hon friend to my previous comment that the bill and these clause and schedule have be draft with the high level of legal expertise it be not something i anticipate be a problem 
 the bill do allow applicant to shop around for doctor and it strike i that there be a danger that some   doctor who might have an ideological view of the bill will specialise in the provision of that service which would give it rather great scope than the hon lady intend 
 i reject the assertion that patient will shop around bear in mind that we be talk about die people they be not in a position to start shop around for service but i also agree that the bill be strict in that regard there be very strict protocol that doctor will have to follow 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will just make some progress if i may 
 it be about not just patient choice but choice for professional people too we know there be a range of view on assist die across a range of profession i have always be clear that no who be uncomfortable take part should have to and nor should there be any detriment to anyone whatever choice they make in whatever role they have 
 it be welcome that new clause seek to protect more individual but can my hon friend say why she have still not choose to make provision for hospice and care home to opt out without have their funding threaten 
 there be absolutely nothing in the bill that have any suggestion that any funding would be impact by whatever decision organisation make around assist dying 
 i will make some progress new clause 10(1 state clearly 
 no person be under any duty to participate in the provision of assistance in accordance with this act 
 that be something i feel strongly on a personal level if people do not want to be involve they should not have to be involve and those who do should subsection cover pharmacist and pharmacy technician and new schedule provide comprehensive employment protection so i hope that whatever colleague view be on assist dying they will see the value of these change and support they 
 i thank my hon friend for these amendment because a number of people have write to i concerned about the very issue that she be raise do she agree that many people will just be oppose to assist dying in all its form and i entirely respect that but if that be really their objection they should be honest about that and not pretend that it be only particular amendment they need they should make the argument that they actually want to make 
 i thank my hon friend for that intervention and i agree that we must be respectful but we must also be honest with each other 
 amendment a to new clause be table by   the hon member for reigate rebecca paul who i thank for her work on the bill committee i understand the thinking behind the amendment but i worry about   unintended consequence for patient care and protection i have be advise that that be the case and i think the minister will speak to that i think there be consensus across the house that in the interest of patient safety it be vital that there be clear and open communication and sharing of information between healthcare professional in the assist dying process if an employer can stop their whole workforce participate in any sort of assist die service it could prevent the sharing of information or the recording of information in a patient ’s record that could relate to safeguard and it could put patient at risk as a result of the employer ’s decision terminally ill patient may be receive different treatment at different place and from different healthcare professional and it would potentially be harmful if they be not able to transfer information or record 
 there be also workability issue with amendment a to new clause it be not clear how it would work with regard to the requirement in subsection for professional to provide information to an assess doctor about a patient someone whom they may have previously treat or in relation to information about a specific condition that they may specialise in that information would need to be provide in the interest of patient care an employee will always be bind by their contract of employment but flexibility be need as many health and care professional work for multiple employer it be not uncommon for clinical staff to have more than employer for example a doctor may be employ by the nhs but also work for a hospice so it be not a straightforward scenario just as it would be wrong for anyone to be compel to be involve in the process it would be wrong for anyone to be prevent from do so particularly if there be an impact on patient safety 
 before reading i hold a public meeting where i hear a range of view from my constituent thing that keep come up be the need to protect medical professional from be compel to take part in assist dying i be really pleased to see that be address in new clause but do my hon friend agree that have the choice to take part must go both way for medical professional 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we keep come back to the word choice it be about choice for patient and terminally ill people but it be also about choice for medical professional and other 
 because of the unintended consequence i can not support amendment a but i be confident that new clause and new schedule provide robust protection for employee regardless of their choice about participate in the provision of assist die service 
 would my hon friend mind elaborate on the detail of the transferring of medical record it be my understanding that someone can request their own medical record as a patient 
 the patient could request information but so could doctor and other healthcare professional it would be wrong if people be not allow to share that information if it be request even if their employer do not want they to do it 
 i turn now to new clause and consequential amendment and which will ensure that the bill be workable by make provision about the replacement of the co ordinating doctor or the independent doctor where they be unable or unwilling to continue to carry out their function in the bill the doctor may be ill or on holiday retire or have a change of personal circumstance 
 what concern i about new clause be that essentially people can shop around if doctor be unwilling the hon lady have give a list of reason why a doctor might be unwilling but surely of the reason could be that there be a fundamental change in a person ’s circumstance and they do not want to do it nothing about that be record be it not a real weakness of new clause that we do not have the passing on of evidence from doctor to another 
 this be not about eligibility it be about the doctor ’s change of circumstance rather than the patient ’ if the doctor decide that the person be not eligible they will reject the application they would record that in the patient ’s record so it would be transparent 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will make some progress if i may 
 this be essentially about provide flexibility for doctor while ensure continuity of care for patient and i hope colleague can support new clause 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will make a little more progress if i may because a lot of people want to speak 
 new clause ensure that there be thorough reporting of instance where the co ordinating doctor conclude that the patient do not meet the strict eligibility criterion set out in the bill it be very important that this data be record but at present there be no requirement for the co ordinating doctor to produce a report when they be not satisfied about all matter set out in clause 23(5 and will not provide the person with the approve substance that lack of a reporting obligation do not align with the rest of the bill hence new clause which i be sure colleague will feel it be important to support 
 i thank my hon friend very much for give way although it be important that a doctor ’s reason for refuse to provide assistance be note down there be nothing in the bill to ensure that if the person make another request in the future the next co ordinating doctor will be make aware of the doctor ’s report will she say something to reassure those of we with concern that people suffer mental ill health include depression may seek assistance repeatedly until they find a doctor who will assess they as eligible 
 that would not be an issue because copy of the report would be give to the patent the co ordinating doctor if they be not in the patient ’s    gp ’s practice and the commissioner so that information would be record and it be very important that it be the report must set out the reason 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will make some progress if i may i be try to be very open to intervention but i do need to crack on 
 the report must set out why the co ordinating doctor be not satisfied and must contain an explanation of why the patient can not proceed with the assist dying process the co ordinating doctor must give a copy of the report to the person to the person ’s gp practice if they be not a practitioner within that practice and to the voluntary assist die commissioner that reflect the thorough and robust reporting and monitor mechanism throughout the bill 
 i turn to the other amendment in my name i will try to keep my comment succinct as many colleague wish to speak amendment ensure that the co ordinating doctor give the commissioner a copy of the patient ’s declaration that enable the commissioner to carry out their monitoring responsibility under clause amendment and 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will 
 persistence pay off when consider the bill i have presume that the doctor concern would be a senior clinician a senior doctor but page of the impact assessment refer to pre registration doctor who have just complete medical school and be on a provisional registration will the hon lady confirm that it be her intention that the provision in the bill may be carry out by the most junior doctor as well as by more senior consultant and general practitioner 
 i thank the hon lady for her intervention give her background she know what she be talk about regulation will set out the level of expertise require by the doctor but there will also be train for every single doctor take part in the assist dying process that be do well around the world so there be work we can build on in that regard 
 amendment and be essentially tidy up amendment that modify the wording of the secretary of state ’s duty to set out training requirement in clause and that fit with the intervention from   the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson training be of paramount importance within the assist dying process and there will be a period of year in which anyone who opt in to be part of this process will have thorough and robust training 
 due to amendment make in committee with very good intention the current wording suggest that the regulation themselves must include detail about training that obviously do not make sense and would be unworkable as it would have to be do separately similarly amendment remove unclear drafting as a result of change make in committee that could have the effect that the regulation have to contain training about training which obviously do not make sense 
 amendment and be also tidy up amendment that be necessary as a result of the introduction of compulsory training for all doctor and panel member in domestic abuse and coercive control follow amendment table by my hon friend   the member for lowestoft jess asato which the bill committee vote unanimously to accept 
 amendment ensure that the term domestic abuse in the bill have the same meaning as in the domestic abuse act it clarify the definition of domestic abuse and ensure that the term be consistent with exist legislation it provide for a very broad definition to capture the full range of behaviour include physical or sexual abuse violent or threaten behaviour control or coercive behaviour economic abuse and psychological emotional or other abuse it do not matter whether the behaviour consist of a single incident or a course of conduct these really important amendment address concern about coercion and provide additional layer of safeguarding within the bill as such i hope colleague support they 
 amendment make provision correspond to the provision in clause about the death or illness of a doctor from whom a opinion be seek for a further referral to be make where before report the independent doctor die through illness or be unwilling or unable to act the amendment once again ensure continuity of care and be an important detail to add to the bill 
 amendment and clarify the provision of clause in case where an approve substance require administration via a medical device the current drafting of the clause be not clear about whether it be allowable to administer the approve substance via a device which it be the amendment provide clarity for clinician 
 amendment expand the duty on what must be include in the final statement of patient access assist die service it include additional information to be collect include whether the person have a disability other than a disability consist of the illness or disease which cause they to be terminally ill datum collection and analysis be an important part of the robust monitoring and reporting build into the bill 
 amendment and relate to the decision of the multidisciplinary voluntary assist die panel as   set out in schedule an important change make in committee each panel comprise a legal expert a social worker and a psychiatrist 
 the royal college of psychiatrists state that it do not feel that at this moment in time there be sufficient psychiatrist able to take up a position on such a panel what response do my hon friend have to that 
 i thank my hon friend for that intervention the royal college of psychiatrists have a neutral position on the issue of assist dying if we refer to the impact—[interruption yes it do 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will just finish this point if we refer to the impact assessment the number of people who will access assist dying in the few year will be very small i think there be around psychiatrist in the country but there be also a period of time of a number of year to do the training require for psychiatrist take part in the process so i would not anticipate any problem there 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will keep go if i may because i think i have be fairly fair 
 amendment ensure that all member of the panel must agree before a certificate of eligibility be issue so abstention can not result in approval the amendment come about as a result of discussion in committee it be really important to clarify that when the panel of expert be do its work its decision must be unanimous for a certificate of eligibility to be grant and for the patient to proceed if a panel member abstain no certificate of eligibility can be grant to the person 
 schedule also set out that the panel must give reason for its decision in each case this be really important amendment ensure that those reason the reason for the panel ’s decision be communicate in write in a document to the person to whom the referral in question relate the co ordinating doctor and the commissioner this create clear channel of communication and will enable those people to fully understand the expert panel ’s decision 
 will the hon lady give way on that point 
 i be go to finish if i may because other people want to speak 
 amendment which be table by my hon friend   the member for bradford west naz shah another outstanding member of the committee state 
 a person who would not otherwise meet the requirement of subsection shall not be consider to meet those requirement solely as a result of voluntarily stop eating or drink 
 i suspect the amendment have be put forward as a result of the lengthy discussion in committee regard whether people with anorexia would be eligible for an assist death under the bill in my previous career before become an mp i work with a number of people with eat disorder i be very aware of the hugely sensitive and complex issue surround disorder eating particularly anorexia i also know that this be a personal issue for a number of colleague across the house as a result of their own experience eat disorder cause huge distress for individual their family and loved one but with care and the right treatment it be possible for people to recover and to go back to lead a full and fulfil life 
 the hon lady be absolutely right on the matter of eat disorder but my understanding of the amendment be that it relate to those who effectively starve themselves into a position of become terminally ill without have an eat disorder that be the thrust of the amendment do she see that and how do she intend to respond to it 
 the hon gentleman make an important point the amendment be not specifically about eat disorder there be a broad context i will come to that later 
 it be with that experience in mind my own personal experience and have speak to many colleague on this issue that i say now as i say in committee that under the bill as it stand have anorexia would not qualify a person to be eligible for an assisted death the bill be clear that a person can not be consider terminally ill on the basis only of a mental disorder clause make it clear that a person must have an inevitably progressive illness or disease that can not be reverse by treatment anorexia be a serious mental health condition that be not inevitably progressive and can thankfully be reverse by treatment of course at every stage of the assist dying process the patient must be find to have capacity to make the decision and this be check repeatedly throughout the process someone with severe anorexia would be highly unlikely to be assess to have capacity to make a decision on assist dying 
 the other tragic reality be that if a patient be so ill as a result of not eat and drink for whatever reason they would die before the process of assist dying be able to take place as it could take up to month to complete all the stage of the process as set out in the bill and the late clinical guidance state that the general range of survival once voluntary stopping of eat and drinking have begin be between and day stop eat and drinking also lead to a range of symptom that would make meaningful conversation as require by the bill impossible 
 have say that i know that some people have express concern that the severe physical consequence of a decision to stop eat or drink could still enable someone to claim eligibility for assist dying when they would not otherwise be able to do so and i believe that be the motivation behind amendment 
 rise 
 i will take final intervention 
 the hon lady be very kind at the moment she be outline the case for those who have problem with their eating and their diet almost to the point where they be unable to make their own decision and she be outline what be go to happen here what would she say about the situation in belgium and in canada where assist dying have be legalise for people with eat disorder this may progress from what she have say and go way beyond that as have be prove in other country across the world 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that point the eligibility criterion in this bill be very different from those in the jurisdiction he mention people with mental health condition be not eligible for assist die under the provision of this bill 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will just finish this point because it be very important 
 i acknowledge the concern that colleague have express around this issue and i believe they be the motivation behind amendment as i have set out i think that risk be negligible i have take advice and there be some concern that clinician might have difficulty assess with certainty that the decision to stop eat and eat be the only reason for a person ’s terminal prognosis as such some further drafting change may be require in the other place if this amendment should pass with that in mind however and to ensure there be no sort of loophole no matter how small the reality be of there be i be happy to support this amendment today 
 rise 
 i be go to leave it there for now if i may 
 i be conscious that many colleague wish to speak in this important debate and i be keen to hear their contribution so i will conclude my remark there i thank colleague for listening and i hope they be able to support the amendment in my name today in the interest of strengthen the workability of the bill and provide great flexibility and safeguard for patient and professional 
 it be a privilege to speak in this place on such an important bill have be part of the committee that scrutinise it line by line and on some occasion word by word for several month early this year it be a pleasure to see so many of my colleague from committee room present today a reunion of sort i be here as always with the intention of improve the bill so that if it do indeed pass vulnerable people be as protect as they can possibly be from unintended consequence 
 it be important to remember that on report and read we be not vote on whether we agree with the principle of assist someone to end their own life our role be to vote on the law in front of we on whether the word on the page be clear and do what be intend on whether the statutory process be safe and ultimately on whether the provision of assist die benefit our community 
 i be not against assist die in principle but i be against this bill i be happy to put it on the record now that i have no personal religious belief i be against the bill for the simple reason that it will harm far more people than it will help the people who will be harm be the most vulnerable in our community and i be not willing to accept that collateral damage 
 today be important because we have the opportunity to improve the safeguard in the bill so that some of those group be well protect i urge member to take that opportunity to the full it require very little skill to draft law that work for of case but there be much skill in ensure that the other be cater for as well i urge everyone to set the high standard today and think about how we can ensure that those unordinary and unexpected case be adequately protect too it really be life and death so please do not accept anything that be not good enough 
 do the hon member agree that of the great risk in this bill be around coercion it be not just about coercion    from family member or friend but about societal coercion and circumstance the current state of palliative care in our country be among the bad in the developed world without adequate palliative care patient might feel pressure to go down the assist die route instead 
 i wholeheartedly agree 
 there be much to discuss today and there be little time so i will start at the beginning of the bill at the point at which the criterion for eligibility for an assisted death be set it be there that important safeguard be need to ensure that those who should never be eligible be exclude we should not make the mistake of assume that a doctor will always make the right decision or that they be infallible it be incumbent on we to put in place law that make it hard for they to get it wrong that make it hard for someone vulnerable to fall between the crack 
 the hon lady have just agree with a point make by   the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed exactly the same point be make when this house vote against the assisted dying no bill back in would she say that in the year after the house vote against the bill we see a golden age in palliative care as a result or do she think that if we wait for palliative care to be perfect we might never vote in favour of assist dying 
 the evidence be clear that palliative care do not get well when assist dying be introduce we hear that in the bill committee we should absolutely look to address palliative care because that will benefit more people i will come to that point later in my speech so i will not discuss it any far now i do not want to get ahead of myself 
 there be many helpful amendment in this vein namely new clause new clause and amendment and in simple term they seek to tighten and refine the eligibility criterion for an assist death by set out when and for what reason an assist death should be allow and by ensure that those who be vulnerable be protect from something that may not be in their good interest 
 interestingly on read the argument put forward for assist death be that those who be die should be spar unbearable pain this be an argument that everyone understand and have full sympathy with no in this place want people to endure pain as they come to the end of their life i certainly would not want that for my love one or indeed for myself when my time come 
 but then the argument be put forward change there be less emphasis on pain and more on choice and autonomy the word autonomy come up again and again in committee and autonomy be important of course but up to a point from a proposal to provide a humane end to someone ’s pain when it can not be relieve in the last month of their life we have move to a proposal to provide an assist death service to those who choose it for any reason even if the pain can be alleviate by palliative care this approach however come with a cost to other family clinician and broad society this really be momentous there be no go back from such a massive shift a move to autonomy trump everything else change everything 
 that be why new clause table by my hon friend be so important in other jurisdiction that have pass such law up to a of people report that they have take this step because they feel they be a burden on other that be the truth of it it be not always about pain and that be the kind of autonomy that lead to disaster 
 i thank my right hon friend for make that point he be absolutely right 
 i have table amendment which would bring the bill back to its original intention it would require that in order to be eligible for an assist death the pain and discomfort experience or expect from a person ’s terminal illness could not be reasonably relieved to their satisfaction through palliative care it seek to limit assist death to the very small group of people who may benefit from it not the large group who just need adequate palliative care to give they the comfortable dignified death they deserve 
 the hon member ’s amendment speak of severe pain and discomfort but there be a reason why the medical profession have not go for that how do she propose we assess severe pain and discomfort as oppose to medium pain be a fungate wound part of severe pain and discomfort 
 the key point be that we need to improve palliative care we be spend so much time and effort focus on this bill rather than do the thing that would actually help more people my amendment in combination with amendment and table by my hon friend   the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer would drive significant improvement to palliative and end of life care get we close to consistent and universally available care   for all 
 i support the hon lady ’s amendment as the royal college of psychiatrists point out pain from unresolved physical symptom and the fear of physical pain or death can make a person want to die and depression which be also associate with a wish to die be often miss do she agree that it be vital that people be support to be free from pain by have access to good palliative and end of life care and that the bill ’s provision should be available only to those whom that can not help 
 i completely concur 
 i commend the hon lady for table her amendment amendment that would have protect palliative care and hospice from facilitate assist suicide service on their premise for ethical or practical reason have be reject so the bill leave hospice with little choice but to comply it also put they in a difficult position when it come to funding hospice will also have to provide a staff member to do this work the problem that will create for palliative care and hospice can not be ignore the bill go against that right in its totality 
 i agree and i will come to that point in more detail in the half of my speech 
 with regard to these amendment we be so blessed to have our precious nhs at vital stage the nhs quite rightly deliver care in obstetric gynaecology neonatology and paediatric but at the end of life about of care be deliver outside the nhs largely by charity and that figure be even high for child ’s palliative and hospice care so the state pay for how we enter this life but not for how we depart it there be something deeply wrong about that for our society do my hon friend agree that surely we must address that and   the delivery of universal palliative and hospice care before we go anywhere near the measure in this assist die bill 
 my hon friend make a good point and i agree in the interest of time i will make some progress 
 the current situation whereby fully fund palliative and end of life care be not available in certain postcode mean that those unfortunate patient do not have a real choice we know that of people who die in this country do not get the palliative care they need that be more than people a year and if the bill go through they will be offer a fully fund assist death as the only reliable way to end their pain that be no choice i urge member who want to see improvement in palliative and end of life care to vote for my amendment and for amendment and table by my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge if they be push to a vote 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will not because i do not have much time 
 i will move on to the lack of a good interest test in the bill which my new clause seek to remedy patient autonomy be of course important but it must be balance against what be in someone ’s good interest in certain situation when it be in their good interest treatment can be give against a patient ’s will for example force feed a young girl with anorexia it be not an easy balance to get right but in the absence of any good interest test in the bill follow the process rigidly would lead to devastating result in some case 
 the bill currently prioritise autonomy of the patient in a specific moment of time rather than what might be in their good interest in the long run it make no allowance for the fact that someone may feel a certain way temporarily due to other consideration for example when someone have just receive a terminal diagnosis it can understandably cause a depressive state and suicidal feeling but those feeling do not necessarily last so it may be in the good interest of the patient to allow a little time to pass to give they a little breathing space before consider the assist death route 
 new clause essentially try to provide a good interest test by exclude certain reason other than the alleviation of pain that might be drive a patient ’s decision for example we have hear a great deal about the internal pressure from patient themselves that be    drive by their concern not to be a burden and we hear clearly in committee that a patient could tell a doctor that they be want an assisted death only for financial reason and that would still be approve we know from the experience of overseas territory that patient will often opt for an assist death because of social and welfare issue such as be homeless 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be sorry but i do not have much time and i wish to get through my point 
 how can we be happy with a process that do not exclude such reason instead of provide the support that be actually need the state be content to put they on a pathway that lead to their death i hope that the house will recognise that whether support assist dying in principle or not it be morally bankrupt not to have some kind of good interest test to protect those who be not seek death to alleviate pain from a terminal illness 
 another group that be particularly vulnerable be those with eat disorder in chelsea roff ’s oral evidence she set out that 
 at least people around the world have be euthanise or assist in suicide 
 with 
 anorexia nervosa list by name as a terminal condition ”––[official report terminally ill adult end of life public bill committee   january c. q175 
 to paraphrase she these be young woman who be not terminally ill and have decade of life ahead of they it be important to make the point that someone suffer 
 rise 
 rise 
 i would love to give way but 
 order the hon lady have say that she be not go to give way we be aim for minute for each speech but it be go to be minute if we do not pick up the pace 
 i apologise but i do want to get through my speech 
 it be important to make the point that someone suffer with anorexia or indeed any mental condition be not intend to be eligible for an assisted death however in the case of anorexia there be physical manifestation of the illness such as malnutrition and diabetes that might mean the patient meet the definition of be terminally ill and that be the nub of the problem the bill do not adequately rule out physical manifestation cause by mental illness that be why amendment table by   the hon member for bradford west naz shah be so important because it would ensure that anyone who voluntarily stop eat or drinking be ineligible for assisted dying i support the amendment strongly as it address a big risk 
 lastly on eligibility specifically i want to talk about capacity there be such problem with the current approach to determine capacity that i barely know where to start when it come to end ’s own life a high standard should be apply the current definition of capacity be not create with such a monumental decision in mind and if it be be draft from scratch today it would look very different that be of the reason why the royal college of psychiatrists do not support the bill 
 under the bill a person be assume to have capacity in the instance a clinician only need to be over sure that a person have capacity if the person be make unwise decision that be not take into account and a person can be help to make a decision for example when a patient have learn disability i ask all member today whether they be happy with that do that sound like a robust approach to assess whether someone have capacity to make the decision to end their own life 
 let we begin with the starting presumption of capacity that too lack the standard for assist death decision i therefore support amendment table by   the hon member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis which would disapply section 1(2 of the mental capacity act for the purpose of assist dying of the big issue for i be the fact that the current approach require an impairment or disturbance of the brain in order for someone to be consider not to have capacity irrespective of whether they can make a decision in the real world that would mean a doctor could assess a patient who give the impression of be confused illogical erratic inconsistent everything about they could scream that they be not in a good place to make this decision at that point in time but they would still be consider to have capacity if there be no identifiable impairment or disturbance of their mind or brain that could potentially put those with depression anxiety learn disability or eat disorder or even those just experience physical pain that be drive they to distraction in danger of be consider to have capacity when they do not 
 so far i have focus on eligibility i will now talk about hospice 
 order please i really want to get as many people in as possible if you can come to a conclusion that would be helpful 
 i will therefore speak to my new clause and which would provide important protection for hospice which be currently lack in the bill new clause make it crystal clear that any regulated care home or hospice can decide whether to provide assist dying on its premise and new clause make it clear that they can not be subject to any detriment for not provide or permit assist death and that their public funding can not be conditional on their provide this service whether be in favour of assist dying or not we must preserve the right of organisation company and charity to choose whether to offer it they must never be force into it by public funding be conditional on the provision of assist dying 
 i note that new clause table by   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater would expand the protection for individual not to participate in the assisted   dying process if they so wish it seek to protect employee from be subject to any detriment for participate or not participate in the provision of assist dying this sensible protection would ensure that if an nhs hospital provide an assist death service any member of staff who do not want to participate would not have to do so and would suffer no detriment as a result however there need to be a sensible mechanism balance that against the employer ’s right to set their own policy on assist dying and that be what my amendment a to new clause seek to do we have already talk about that so i will not go over it again 
 i do want to talk about process and family but it look like i will not have time to do that i will end there i thank you for your patience and generosity mr speaker i be grateful that i have have the chance to speak in support of the amendment and i look forward to hear from other member 
 i rise to speak to new clause and which stand in my name and consequential amendment and i will touch on other at the end these amendment without be dismissive of those who help i draft they be imperfect those of we who be not the promoter of the bill have not have the support of government drafter in tidy up the bill we need to acknowledge that the bill in front of we today be the bill more or less that will or will not be pass by this house for any amendment make by the point of reading that be it there will be no further opportunity to redraft they 
 sadly of these amendment be reject in committee if those change have be discuss before the original bill be publish or even in evidence before committee we would have be in a well place to get that tight drafting that be need in make good legislation we be not a debating society we be now legislate for a law that would enable the state to assist in people take their life i be sad that we be able to discuss these amendment only now i do not get the opportunity to be on the bill committee but i commend all member who spend so many hour discuss and debate those issue 
 the ramification of the clause i want to talk about be important for potential user of a service for medical professional for family and for other health professional the bill currently allow doctor to suggest assist die to a patient who have not raise it themselves this i believe as i know many other do present a serious risk that terminally ill patient already highly vulnerable will feel pressured to end their life 
 i realise that my hon friend ’s new clause come from a good place but can she not see that it be inconsistent with our ethical obligation as doctor that be why the british medical association have suggest that although there should be no duty to raise the issue neither should there be a ban on do so i ask she to consider that the australian state of victoria initially have such a measure a so call gag clause as part of its bill but it be remove because it cause confusion and be detrimental to patient care should we not learn from that 
 i thank my hon friend for his point which bring i to something i really want to address as i say in my opening remark these be imperfect amendment i will get into some of the conversation that i have have with a number of people about this i be person i have not be able to consult the bma as a government or a sponsor could for example but i be aware of its concern however we be talk here about very definite and irreversible decision on life and death i know that many doctor have have conversation about that but not to the level require to legislate for it this be a different set of circumstance but i very much appreciate his point 
 do my hon friend agree that far too many people do not have confidence in the face of authority and that if a doctor raise assist suicide with they no matter how tactfully or professionally they will feel that they be be steer in that direction 
 i thank my right hon friend for that intervention give she many year as a constituency mp in the same borough as i we both know many such vulnerable people dr rachel clarke a hospital palliative care doctor say 
 if for instance you say to a vulnerable patient who have just be tell they have a diagnosis of terminal cancer have you think about assist dying i would suggest that state it broadly like that be a form of pressure and that you be potentially unintentionally coerce that patient ’––[official report terminally ill adult end of life public bill committee   january c. q93 
 so we be in a very difficult space as my hon friend   the member for stroud dr opher   highlight with his background as a practise gp we recognise that as i have say this be an imperfect process to deal with that challenge but it be a very different set of circumstance compare with the other advice that doctor give 
 rise 
 speak of doctor i give way to the hon lady 
 i rise to support the hon lady ’s new clause as a doctor i be very aware of the trust that the public place in doctor and the seriousness with which they take what we say if a doctor give somebody information about assist dying it be quite reasonable for that person to think that the doctor be suggest that they should take part in that process or be hint that their death will be dreadful and try to be kind if doctor be allow to say this be a good process more people will take it up than would otherwise have want to 
 i thank the hon lady 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i need to get into the argument for my new clause so i will not take any more intervention for the time be
