my hon friend be quite right to ask that question we would all like to see gas set the price of electricity more frequently that be why we be    accelerate the take up of renewable which be so pitifully low in quantity when labour be in power we need a conservative government to keep up progress and low bill right across the country 
 as i say we will continue to make call on israel—[interruption good make in the settlement be not allow to be import and that continue to be the case we continue to grow the work that we do on trade with israel the palestinian authority and the opt and i know the department for business and trade be focus on that development work 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support energy transition project in scotland 
 what step he be take to support energy transition project in scotland 
 we be support scotland through the north sea transition deal contract for difference for renewable energy and more than £ of net innovation portfolio funding 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response particularly in relation to cfds will he commit today to a clear pathway for the true commercial scale development of tidal stream energy a ringfence in the cfd auction be welcome but it be only scratch the surface of what the industry can deliver investor in project be stall as they need long term visibility the industry and indeed all of we need this technology to succeed let we unlock this predictable renewable power and create an industry and sector that we can be proud of and that can be make on these island we need a commitment today that the ringfenced budget will increase to allow cost to fall and true scale project to be deliver if we want energy security here be the pathway 
 we be mean to be ask question not make statement 
 fortunately the answer be pretty straightforward as the right hon gentleman mention we be do tidal power in this cfd round that be to be welcome and we look forward to this industry expand in the future as some of the technicality and technical difficulty be resolve i know that the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   have visit recently to see this in action 
 energy storage be vital to manage demand as we switch to renewable electricity pump storage hydro be the most efficient large scale storage   method uk capacity could be more than double by project across scotland that have be shovel ready for more than year they take a long time to build so why be the uk government not support investment in infrastructure that be critical for our future energy security 
 i have discuss this matter with sse in relation to that particular hydro storage project and my hon friend the under secretary of state meet msp yesterday to discuss the subject as well we be keen to have this kind of hydro storage which be why our plan allow for it to be take forward however i have to say to opposition members all of they that it be no good just have kind of storage or kind of tidal power we also need to protect the scottish economy with oil and gas to make sure we be not subject to putin or any other dictator hold we to ransom over our energy security 
 it be good to hear that the secretary of state be support the economy in scotland but my question be how be the uk government invest in grid capacity in wales in wales such investment be crucial if we be to support energy transition project such as the holyhead hydrogen hub minesto morlais bp mona lightsource bp and of course new nuclear at wylfa 
 grid capacity in scotland wales england and northern ireland be at the top of our list the winser review have do a lot of work to look at how we can speed up the delivery of that capacity give the big transition that be go on and this country ’s big lead in renewable which make that necessary 
 i call the scottish national party spokesman 
 on pumped storage hydro it be as though the secretary of state just do not get it it increase energy resilience and would reduce the £ balancing cost that be get pay out at the moment the gw coire glas scheme can be deliver in year and it would power home for a hour period the government have find £ for sizewell c and they have implement cap and floor mechanism for interconnector so why be he not have proper discussion with sse about a cap and floor mechanism 
 the secretary of state do in fact get it because we support the idea of have thing such as hydro power again i have to say that there be a choice where taxpayer money be spend it have to be do competitively in the round to be talk merely about storage and not the generation include nuclear power which be a key part of this country ’s energy security future simply mean that the overall view that the snp have be unbalanced when it come to how we power our nation 
 the secretary of state have prove he still do not get it he be not have proper discussion with sse if we move to carbon capture and storage the climate change committee ’s progress report identify risk and significant risk associate with industrial cluster and carbon dioxide storage which prove it be    nonsensical to have acorn as a reserve when will the government announce the track cluster and provide parity for acorn when do he envisage acorn start construction that be vital to meet the target 
 as the hon gentleman know we have already pump £ into acorn it be on the reserve list he ask when the answer be this year for track and track expansion so i say it again the secretary of state do get it 
 what step his department be take to help energy intensive industry decarbonise 
 the government be invest billion to support the development and deployment of carbon capture utilisation and storage hydrogen and other decarbonisation technology and have a range of policy support industrial decarbonisation such as the industrial energy transformation fund and local industrial decarbonisation plan 
 there be clean steel project across europe but none in the uk meanwhile the uk be the only country in the g20 where steel production be fall other country recognise the importance of their domestic steel industry and they recognise the importance of invest in low carbon steel why do this government not support our steel 
 as the hon gentleman know well this government do support the uk steel industry on his broad point which he mention in his original question uk industrial emission have fall since and we be make significant investment in industrial decarbonisation not least the £ announce at the end of march which will contribute to decarbonisation through ccus and help the steel industry 
 do minister agree that the government ’s competition for small modular nuclear reactor will help provide the volume of energy we need for energy intensive domestic industry and over the long term at a low cost than previous nuclear power station 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question there be enormous enthusiasm on the government side of the house for the potential of nuclear include small modular reactor we be determined to see that go forward as quickly as possible which be why the new organisation great british nuclear be do a rapid down selection of technology this year precisely in order to unlock the benefit that my right hon friend so correctly highlight 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 on decarbonisation many organisation such as the institution of civil engineers be ask about the government ’s net growth plan which say 
 the public will play a key role in the transition and therefore we will set out further detail on how government will increase public engagement on net 
 can the minister clarify when that detail will be publish 
 i thank the chair of the energy security and net committee he be right that as well as top down government policy we must unlock the huge public desire of people to play their part and make sure we have the right information in place that will be provide and produce as soon as possible 
 the minister will welcome measure that many business be already undertake simply because they be the right thing to do include traditionally carbon intensive industry such as cement manufacturing cemex in my constituency be invest to use decarbonise raw material and trialle the use of hydrogen in the combustion process which will significantly reduce the amount of co2 generate by every tonne of cement manufacture in rugby 
 my hon friend be right and he be right to champion those industry that be work so hard to decarbonise already as my hon friend say we have the net hydrogen fund which will provide up to £ by to support the development and construction of new low carbon hydrogen production plant which will be able to assist in cement as well as other industry 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of regulation for industrial lithium ion battery storage facility 
 it be a priority for this government that all net energy infrastructure be build operate and maintain in an appropriate and safe way my official work closely with the industry lead electricity storage health and safety governance group to ensure an appropriate robust and future proof health and safety framework be sustain as storage deployment increase 
 we need to increase power storage but the potential fire risk associate with lithium ion battery storage facility be now become widely acknowledge what be my hon friend do to ensure those facility be not build in inappropriate location such as basing fenn in my constituency which be a site sandwich between a rare north flow salmonid chalk stream and a hospital 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and her tireless campaign on this important issue as i discuss in that very positive meeting that i have with she yesterday i have be work with colleague across government to establish the appropriate treatment of these facility in planning and environmental regulation every site should be consider on its own merit and be a decision for our local authority 
 will this government stop chuntere on about battery and battery storage all the time will they get down to jcb and see its innovative new hydrogen fuel car and   heavy good vehicle be it not about time that we realise that hydrogen be the future and that this government should be build a pipeline of hydrogen throughout the country 
 i will not be draw on chuntering on by the hon gentleman but let i just say that it be this government who allow jcb to proceed with that technology and to develop it at commercial scale i be pleased to tell he that the secretary of state will be visit imminently 
 what step he be take to help increase the potential benefit of float offshore wind for the supply chain 
 the government be commit to place the uk at the forefront of the float wind sector i be delighted to announce that the crown estate will be provide an update to industry this morning on a gw leasing round in the celtic sea and have already commission the survey work require to support it 
 the development of float offshore wind in the celtic sea be a once in a generation opportunity for my aberavon constituency for wales and for the entire united kingdom last week the climate change committee rightly blast the government for fail to deliver on their net commitment i be profoundly concerned that float offshore wind will be squander due to the lack of grip and direction that the committee describe when will the minister be bring forward an industrial strategy for float offshore wind which will ensure that welsh manufacturing and welsh job be place at the heart of turbine and substructure fabrication start with the vital seabed licensing process 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question we be the world leader in float offshore wind and we be determined to stay there in order to realise the industrial benefit which he rightly champion and the opportunity in wales the float wind demonstration programme—[interruption the labour front bench team really do not like to hear this do they the fact that we have cut our emission more than any other major economy on earth under this government be what lead those on the labour front bench to sense their own inadequacy because they know what they leave behind that float wind demonstration programme be support innovation with £ of government funding match by £ from industry 
 float offshore wind and all these exciting generation technology be wonderful but all of they will come to nought unless we can increase the speed and capacity of the grid connection to get the electricity onshore and to the user who need it what be the minister do to sort out the national grid and to speed up the way in which grid connection be make because without this we will go nowhere 
 my hon friend put it so well it be so true whatever the generation if we can not get the electron where they need to go we be frustrate that be why we be determined to speed up the connection   that be why from the pick report on offshore wind to the nick winser review this government lead by the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie this be the time that this country have have a network minister be absolutely focused in a laser like way on make sure that we speed up and get the delivery of the infrastructure that we need to deliver the green transition 
 what step his department have take to ensure local community engagement in onshore wind proposal 
 the government want community to participate in and benefit from onshore wind propose in their local area on   may the government issue a consultation for onshore wind partnership in england propose improvement to the current system of community engagement and benefit 
 some energy firm give discount to those who live near onshore wind farm when the wind blow unfortunately though that be not the case everywhere will the minister look again at this policy nationally so that my constituent such as those who live in ulley near penny hill wind farm and even myself i live in harthill near loscar wind farm will see the benefit of clean green wind power reflect in their energy bill 
 the consultation on onshore wind partnership propose that the government work with renewableuk to update the industry wide community benefit protocol for onshore wind in england an update protocol would seek to encourage more innovative approach for example through developer support local energy bill discount the consultation close on   july 
 i be not sure there be much point in community engagement when there be no onshore wind we do not have any onshore wind last week we hear the climate change committee ’s devastating report on this country ’s commitment to net when will this government unlock the barrier to onshore wind 
 i completely refute the suggestion that we have no onshore wind onshore wind contribute gw of power to the uk ’s national grid as we speak and of course we support the deployment of onshore wind with community 
 we come now to the shadow minister 
 the minister be sort of right that there have be some onshore wind turbine build just recently since february so there be not much chance of community engagement there to be honest in december the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities promise that the onshore wind ban would be completely lift by the end of april this year why have the government break that promise 
 i will take no lecture from the labour party on develop renewable electricity when labour leave office in 2010—[interruption they do not like to hear this but when labour leave office in less than of the grid be account for by renewable now it be 
 i think maybe the government should take lesson from labour it be now generally understand that the government consultation be likely to lead to only minimal relaxation of planning rule and that onshore wind will effectively remain ban tory peer lord deben chairman of the climate change committee say of the consultation on saturday that it be simply unacceptable that the government be still discuss whether they be in favour of onshore wind or not when it be widely recognise as of the cheap form of energy generation he be right be he not 
 i really wish the labour party would stop talk down what we be do on renewable electricity i remind the house that the consultation on onshore wind finish on   july 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of additional support for energy and trade intensive industry 
 wholesale energy price have fall significantly since the peak of the energy crisis so the energy bill discount scheme strike a balance between provide support and certainty to business and limit the impact on public finance 
 i thank my hon friend for a proper derbyshire answer can she give more information on how the government be work to help wedding venue and hospitality in general with extreme cost for electricity and gas particularly where business have sign long term contract in the face of fall world price 
 i thank my hon friend from south derbyshire it be a great county to live in with great hospitality for her question business include the hospitality sector have already benefit from the energy bill relief scheme which end on   march   and provide £ of support we be mindful of the fix term contract which be a supplier issue and we be constantly engage with stakeholder and supplier on that 
 last week i attend the opening of the phase of a new solar farm at newcastle airport it be fund by the regional development fund which post brexit we no long have access to the further phase be vital to ensure that the airport meet its net target and the government meet their solar target so what be the government do to ensure that those further phase will be support in some way by the government 
 i thank the hon lady for that information with your permission mr speaker i will take that question away and find out more detail 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the director general of uk steel say this week 
 there be huge question mark over if government really want to sustain steel the backbone of british manufacturing or just leave it to shrink and rely on other nation supply 
 he be right to say that it be year since the government promise the green steel fund but not a penny have be pay why be the government fail our steel community so comprehensively 
 that be absolutely not true we be legislate for that at the moment it be incredibly important to the government that we combat that and support the energy and trade intensive industry 
 the committee on climate change say last week that 
 the government have high ambition for decarbonisation but no policy to deliver it 
 we have be slow to react to the us inflation reduction act and to the eu ’s propose green deal industrial plan   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who for the benefit of the minister be not from the labour benches say 
 where the uk once lead we be now fall behind 
 when will ministers snap out of their appalling complacency and come up with the strategy and timeline that we need to support the uk in the global race for green job and investment 
 we have meet all our carbon target and will continue to do so the government have make the commitment to continue hit and progress on those target 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on the adequacy of the planning system for clean energy project 
 my department have be work closely with the department for levelling up housing and communities on deliver the proposal in the publish action plan for reform and speed up the nationally significant infrastructure project planning process an important part of those reform involve update and strengthen the national policy statement for energy 
 last weekend james robottom the head of onshore wind at renewableuk say that he do not expect much from the government ’s consultation on planning he say that obstacle to new onshore wind development would 
 severely hinder investment in the onshore wind industry and its supply chain due to the high level of risk and uncertainty they create we be be deny the opportunity for thousand of new job and billion in private investment 
 in the meantime that be cost english family £ per year it mean damage to the economy damage to the environment and high bill for family be it not time that we get this useless government out of the way so that we can sort it out 
 this useless government who have deliver renewable on to the grid i would much rather take our record on renewable than the labour party ’ any day of the week the consultation on national policy statement close as the hon gentleman know on   june and the government remain on track to present they to parliament and bring they into effect by the end of 
 local authority have a presumption in favour of solar and quite right too but should they not also consider the cumulative effect of solar farm wiltshire be the large county in england for solar farm if the new red barn project at kington st michael be add it will be of the large solar farm in britain we be cover our good agricultural land with solar farm in county such as wiltshire when the forthcoming planning policy guidance be reconsider will the minister undertake to include a presumption against solar farm on grade 3a and 3b agricultural land 
 food security be incredibly important and we will of course prioritise less productive land for the deployment of solar farm our reform aim to ensure that infrastructure developer consider at the outset of their programme how project can address the legitimate concern of affected community engage regularly with they throughout the pre application phase and beyond engage with statutory consultee early during the pre application stage will also benefit local community and farmer through high quality application 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of end gas import from russia on energy security 
 end russian import in april have show that russian gas belong in the past our system be well supply last winter by north sea gas and reliable import a far cry from labour ’s energy surrender plan sponsor by just stop oil which would put we back at square and in the hand of despot such as putin and his tyrannical regime 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s answer could he explain what step his department be take to ensure that no country will ever be able to hold the uk to ransom through our energy supply 
 it be about have a balanced energy supply which mean renewable nuclear power and yes where necessary oil and gas licence to do without they put the security of every single person in this country at risk and mean that household bill will go up sadly that be exactly the policy of his majesty ’s official opposition 
 a recent report by the energy and climate intelligence unit show that regardless of ministers plan to expand domestic oil and gas production import of gas will continue to rise significantly unless we tackle demand new oil and gas licence simply will not deliver energy security as the oil and gas be sell at global price on international market they will cost the taxpayer dearly while be a disaster for the climate will the government finally do what be need by rule out new licence and commit instead to measure that will genuinely make the uk energy secure include a nationwide street by street home insulation programme unblock onshore wind and instal new solar on every roof 
 we have go from of our home be insulate under the previous government to nearly 50%—it will be this year and we have set up an energy taskforce to reduce the usage of energy and make it more efficient however the policy of the hon lady ’s party and that of the official opposition of import all the oil and gas that we require and not provide new licence be simply insane it mean that every single family in britain will be subject to the next tyrant like putin and that the carbon use will be double what be take from the north sea it be bonker policy 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in the population on the ability to meet net target 
 population growth be take into account when set our decarbonisation goal specifically it be account for in our baseline emission projection which help determine the effort require to meet our carbon target 
 do my right hon friend accept that in on present government policy we will have more people in this country than there be in the base date for carbon dioxide emission he obviously accept that a high population lead to high global emission but can he also say that when it come to climate change it would be a good idea for this government to concentrate on a net migration policy rather than net 
 as my hon friend know the prime minister be absolutely determined to bring net migration down to sustainable level i would also point out to he that the uk do not set decarbonisation target per capita because all country need to reduce emission in absolute term we be determined to play our part in do that to move to net but in a pro growth pro business manner 
 it be not simply about empower future generation but those that exist that be why the roll out of smart metering be important the late quarterly statistic claim that of uk household have smart meter but that mask the fact that only out of scottish local authority be above in the roll out of smart metering be below and island council   be below all those be also the area with the high fuel poverty as we approach march when radio teleswitching will go off how will we ensure that people have access to smart metering enable they to get off peak tariff 
 the hon gentleman be right both to enthuse about the importance of smart metering and the benefit it can bring even more so as we move forward in the come year and to highlight the importance of ensure as ever that something so important be equitably distribute i or colleague would be happy to meet he to discuss how we make sure that the issue he have rightly raise be address 
 what step he be take to increase the use of solar panel on build roof and if he will make a statement 
 the government be support the installation of rooftop solar in numerous different way financial incentive performance standard and the solar taskforce 
 for year now i have be try to persuade government of all colour to change building regulation to require all new building to be fit with solar panel that would have the benefit of secure supply reduce household bill considerably and help we towards net so why do we not do it 
 i assure my hon friend that i be a great enthusiast for solar panel i have have they on my home for the past year and they perform very well i want to see more people do that in fact over that period we have go from virtually no renewable in our system—6.9%—to in the last quarter i be very keen for that expansion to go far and fast we need to ensure that it be part of the building code but we also want to make sure that other form of renewable can be instal so it be a balance between not be too prescriptive and make sure that we make speedy progress particularly on all the commercial rooftop in this country 
 a few week ago i have the pleasure of visit an innovative housing project in rumney in my constituency which have solar panel in nearly all the new building but also ground source heat pump electric vehicle charge point and battery technology in the house bring down bill for the resident while contribute to net will the secretary of state join i in praise cardiff ’s labour council and the welsh labour government for the work they have do on this issue and will he explain what we be do to ensure great manufacture of those technology in this country 
 of course i be delighted that the barnett formula stretch so far in provide some of the excellent addition to those building i just want to repeat that no government have go far and fast in the g7 than this in introduce renewable and ensure that they now power a very significant part of   our grid we want to go far and fast still and we will make sure that thing such as building code help with that plan 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the adequacy of workforce skill for deliver net project 
 we recognise that have the right skill within the workforce be critical which be why we establish the green job delivery group 
 the climate change committee have express concern that the uk be fall behind on a range of net commitment include on skill a skilled workforce alongside new green job be a key component of the green new deal but the workforce plan be not due until in the light of the urgency of address climate change will the government commit to bring that forward to some time later this year 
 we be work as quickly as we can on ensure this the new skill that will be require be really beneficial for the uk economy so we be keen to work with the green job delivery group and the department for education in look at apprenticeship and how we can push this forward as quickly as possible 
 what step he be take to encourage private sector investment in clean energy technology 
 what step he be take to encourage private sector investment in clean energy technology 
 our power up britain plan seize opportunity from the transition to a decarbonised energy system our policy back by billion of pound of government funding but more importantly leverage in about £ of private investment will support up to job in 
 enfinium be build a new energy from waste facility in my constituency which will process nearly tonne of waste to generate electricity for more than home and business each year will the minister join i in welcome this investment in renewable energy and outline how the government be support energy from waste facility across the country 
 i thank my hon friend and i be delighted to join she in welcome this new investment which will be a huge asset to her community as well as have positive national implication energy from waste with combined heat and power be support through pot of the contract for difference scheme our auction system we expect to announce the result of the late round in early september and i hope the house will watch that announcement with great interest 
 what assessment have the minister make of the role of a tariff support mechanism to encourage short term private sector investment in deep geothermal to support level up 
 there be no great champion than or anyone in this house with half the knowledge of this as far as i can tell my hon friend in support the potential of deep geothermal when the prime minister respond to his report i know he thank my hon friend for all the work that go into it i can confirm that geothermal technology that generate electricity be eligible for the contract for difference scheme we be also support and encourage the development of geothermal heating project through the green heat network fund which support the development of low carbon heat network under the leadership of my hon friend i be confident that geothermal have a positive future 
 private sector business in the humber be ready and willing to invest £ in carbon capture storage and decarbonisation project however this be be put at risk because of the track carbon capture and storage project select not a single project be approve for the humber despite the humber be the large carbon emitter in the country and the fact that of the uk ’s license co2 storage capacity be accessible from the humber when will these business get the clarity they need when the track expansion process be launch will both humber pipeline be approve 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and she be right to be frustrate because of the enormous potential both to decarbonise and to unlock industrial benefit for the area we be move as quickly as possible i have already say that the viking project and the scottish cluster be in the favour position and the team be move as quickly as possible this year to provide more certainty and unlock further investment 
 private sector investment in clean energy be vital but do the minister agree that reason that the united kingdom despite have the high tidal range on planet earth after canada still use so little of it be a lack of public sector leadership area such as morecambe bay which could contribute to tidal energy bring down people ’s bill and protect we against putin be something that we could move forward will the minister agree to meet i and other mps around the bay so that we can bring forward plan to get the most out of our tidal energy 
 i be not an expert in the hon gentleman ’s history on this topic but i hope it have be consistently in favour of tidal energy and therefore different from so many other area of policy i share his enthusiasm for the potential of tidal energy that be why we be the world ’s lead nation in the deployment of tidal range and why tidal power be eligible for the contract for difference scheme notwithstanding so many issue i would be happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 what step he plan to take to support the development of community energy project 
 the government be support local authority and community energy group to work together to develop project within uk growth funding scheme such as the uk share prosperity fund   ofgem also welcome funding application from the sector to the industry voluntary redress scheme 
 why do the government remove amendment from the energy bill last week that would have support community energy and local energy trading 
 as we have outline previously the government do not support the amendment that be table in the lords and believe that the issue raise should be consider as part of wide market reform however we be proactively work with parliamentarian and the community energy sector to discuss whether further support from the government for the sector be need and if so what might be feasible 
 what energy cost support his department have provide to customer on traditional prepayment meter 
 the government have provide support to customer on traditional prepayment meter through the energy bill support scheme and energy price guarantee 
 i very much welcome the measure that the government have announce to support those on traditional prepayment meter but many resident in southend west such as those live in trafford house in leigh on sea be on communal heat network they be still face high price and have no control whatsoever over their heating what be the government do to encourage heat supplier to apply for the energy bill discount scheme ahead of the deadline at the end of this month which will benefit my constituent who have no control over their energy bill 
 my hon friend be a great advocate for all her constituent and she will be interested to hear that the government be commit to support domestic heat network customer with their bill that be why we introduce the energy bill discount scheme heat network support which aim to ensure that heat network customer do not face disappointingly high bill compare with customer in equivalent household 
 can the minister tell we the value of prepayment meter voucher not cash by the   june   deadline what can the government do to ensure that support reach those people who be eligible to get it 
 all hon member will know how abhorrent we find the use of forced entry to people ’s house over prepayment meter however we have work hard and consistently to ensure that all those on prepayment meter be treat fairly and give support 
 what step he be take to introduce small modular nuclear reactor into the energy mix 
 when his department plan to complete its competitive process for small modular nuclear reactor technology 
 i be pleased and indeed proud to say that great british nuclear will be hold a competition for small modular reactor because we want to attract the good design from both domestic and international vendor the government ’s ambition be to select the lead technology by autumn provide co funding to any viable new technology our commitment to a nuclear programme and to great british nuclear will enable the uk to be on a path to achieve its ambition to become a global leader in nuclear energy and small modular reactor 
 as member of the welsh affairs committee hear during a visit to the united states in january small modular reactor should play a significant role in transition alongside large scale nuclear project do the minister agree that while north west wales have excellent scope for large scale project part of north east wales would be outstanding prospect for an smr site as well as capitalise on the region ’s amazing manufacturing and engineering capability to drive that part of the energy mix forward 
 the government recognise the support for nuclear power across north wales great british nuclear will work with the government on access to potential site for new nuclear project to achieve our long term ambition as a step towards the development of the new national policy statement for nuclear we will consult later this year on a propose way forward for determine how new nuclear development include smr might be locate 
 the minister will know that this country have be produce small nuclear reactor for our submarine for more than year do the minister understand that while he be dither around with his time waste international competition those international competitor be out there in the market get the order and selling back to the hilt by their own government be this go to be yet another great british development create by our scientist engineer and skilled trade but allow to slip away by blinker civil servant and weak ministers who can not make a decision 
 rolls royce be a great british company which be why we previously make up to £ available from the advanced nuclear fund to rolls royce smr ltd to support the development of its small modular reactor design great british nuclear will launch the stage selection process for small modular reactor   which be expect to attract the good design from domestic and international vendor which will be great for this country by the way we be go time fast than any comparable country on this project 
 what plan he have to support household with energy cost in winter 
 the government be commit to cheap energy for all last winter we cover half a typical energy bill through the combined support of the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme since october with a typical household save around £ by the end of june 
 there be a huge gulf between the reality and the practice of the government the public accounts committee have warn this tory government about their lack of planning on support for consumer with the cost of energy this winter lack of preparedness seem a serious ailment within this government give that sense research have find that more than of disabled people be cut back on their use of medical equipment when will we get a proper plan from this government instead of the profiteer off the back of the most vulnerable as we see from so many energy company 
 we be of course make plan and i do not accept that we be not plan we be also talk to stakeholder and ensure that we be give the good support we can to all those who will be vulnerable in winter 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 next week will mark the day anniversary since putin launch his invasion of ukraine and begin try to blackmail the world on energy as ever britain stand strong in the face of tyranny and i be pleased to report that from saturday just past energy bill be fall by an average of for household we be committed to power britain from britain despite some alarming energy surrender plan come from the opposition 
 the climate change committee ’s report publish last week find that of the policy and consultation that be the responsibility of the secretary of state ’s department no less than be overdue he can not blame anyone else will he now own up to the government ’s appalling failure 
 the actual data argue the opposite way we have meet all our carbon budget to date the climate change committee last week say that the chance of reach carbon budget be slightly increase we be confident of meet it and we have    set out our plan for carbon budget and i have to say that give that this country have the good record in the world among develop nation for get carbon under control it be surprising to hear the opposition ’s view 
 our domestic nuclear sector and our military be struggle to recruit and retain enough nuclear engineer what discussion be the minister have with the sector and the department for education to create a long term workforce plan to solve the issue 
 since day the skill challenge that we face have be a top priority for i which be why my department be work closely with the ministry of defence the dfe and the sector to tackle they with the employer lead nuclear skills strategy group we have deploy a joint plan of skill action to support the civil and defence programme but i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 day ago the climate change committee deliver its most scathing assessment in its history on the government ’s record say that they be off track on out of key target it say that we have go markedly backwards in the past year on the secretary of state ’s watch who do he blame for this failure 
 as have be discuss more than once in these question and answer we have take this country from have only renewable energy to over we have decarbonise fast than any other g7 nation and we be on track for carbon budget have already overdelivere on carbon budget and base on our record to date we be do a pretty good job 
 that answer be total complacency from a secretary of state who have just be prove to be fail on every major aspect of his agenda that be why lord goldsmith resign lord deben have say he be fail and   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may   have say that we be lose the global race be not the truth now that even the tories do not trust the tories on the climate crisis 
 this be of the problem with not be prepared to follow the datum which show we overdelivering on the commitment of carbon budget and and that we be more likely to meet carbon budget than we be a year ago if the right hon gentleman want to ignore all that and still roll out his pre write question that be how we get to his conclusion the truth be that the government be deliver on the issue of climate change while protect every single household in the country from putin ’s tyranny i be afraid that have already be surrender by the right hon gentleman who subscribe to the just stop oil approach

 lord deben have urge the government to 
 find the courage to place climate change once again at the heart of its leadership 
 do the minister share concern that the prime minister and therefore this government be just too weak to stand up to their back benchers and really grasp the opportunity and necessity

 at a time when the cost of generate electricity be fall thank to the increase use of renewable my constituent do not understand why the price of electricity remain link to the price of gas i know that the government be undertake a review of electricity market arrangement when might they expect to see a change 
 my hon friend be quite right to ask that question we would all like to see gas set the price of electricity less frequently that be why we be    accelerate the take up of renewable which be so pitifully low in quantity when labour be in power we need a conservative government to keep up progress and low bill right across the country 
 the secretary of state outline the progress be make on small modular nuclear reactor can he provide an estimate of how many there might be within year

 as i say we be work with the sector and parliamentarian to find a way forward to far support community energy project as part of that i would be delighted to meet the hon gentleman to discuss it far 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the violence in the west bank 
 the accelerate cycle of violence in the west bank risk another round of bloodshed and the government be do everything possible to urge the de escalation of the situation the late operation by the israel defence forces in the jenin refugee camp in the northern west bank on monday be the late episode in a conflict that have become more worrying as the year have progress while the uk firmly support israel ’s right to defend itself and its citizen against terrorism we urge the israel defence forces to demonstrate restraint adhere to the principle of international humanitarian law and prioritise the protection of civilian 
 while the security situation today remain fragile the uk welcome israeli and palestinian engagement at meeting in aqaba on   february   and sharm el sheik on   march we be clear eyed that those meeting have not be a silver bullet but they be an open meaningful channel of communication between senior israelis and palestinians at time of strife this be important in assist de escalation and reduce violence we have consistently engage with both the israelis and the palestinians to urge they to de escalate tension and to support effort towards renew negotiation 
 my right hon friend the foreign secretary speak to the israeli foreign minister eli cohen on   june when they discuss the security situation in the west bank have speak to the palestinian prime minister mohammad shtayyeh on   june i can confirm that the minister for the middle east lord ahmad will be discuss the evolve situation with the israeli ambassador later today far to discussion in recent day he also speak to the palestinian foreign minister riyad al maliki on   may our ambassador in tel aviv and jerusalem regularly speak to both the israeli government and the palestinian authority to urge de escalation and to make clear our expectation that all side avoid unilateral step that move the party far away from dialogue 
 let i finally draw the house ’s attention to the statement that the foreign secretary make jointly with his canadian and australian counterpart last friday the uk oppose israel ’s announce proposal to expand settlement across the west bank and we ask israel to halt and reverse its policy of support settlement expansion settlement be not the only obstacle to peace but they be an important and our concern about these recent step be clear the life lose in this wide conflict be tragic there be an urgent need for all party to avoid further escalation in the west bank and gaza now and in the day ahead 
 the past hour have see a horrifying military assault by the israel defence forces on the overcrowded refugee camp in jenin the un refugee agency say that about people live in less than half a square kilometre in the camp yet we have all witness on our screen the israel defence forces   launch air attack include attack from drone and they have send in hundred if not thousand of ground troop in the large military action in the west bank for year news agency be report death of palestinians include child and palestinians injure while the palestinian red crescent say that it have evacuate people the un ’s vanessa huguenin have say 
 we be alarmed at the scale of air and ground operation that be take place in jenin 
 the world health organisation have say 
 responder have be prevent from enter the refugee camp 
 meanwhile the palestinian authority leadership have resolve to 
 immediately petition the un security council to implement resolution and the relevant resolution on provide international protection to the palestinian people stop unilateral measure and impose sanction on the occupy power 
 the uk currently hold the presidency of the un security council and be therefore responsible for guide its response to request make by the palestinian authority may i therefore ask the following question what be the uk government do in their capacity as president of the un security council how have they respond at the un to the palestinian authority ’s call for international protection what have the foreign office say to its israeli counterpart about the israel defence forces prevent medical staff from access the jenin refugee camp or fire tear gas into hospital shelter child and elderly resident 
 finally what step will the foreign secretary take to review whether the idf have make any use of uk arm sell to israel in this attack will he immediately suspend all arm sale include surveillance technology and will he ban collaboration between the uk and israel ’s armed force and military industry as a result of this horrific attack on civilian 
 i thank the hon lady for bring the urgent question to the house this be a matter of deep concern to we all we will continue to urge the israel defence forces to demonstrate restraint in this operation so that all party can try to avoid further escalation in the west bank and gaza as i have say while the uk will always support israel ’s right to self defence the protection of civilian particularly child must always be prioritise and we expect the armed force conduct always to be in line with international humanitarian law we therefore call on israel to adhere to those principle of necessity and proportionality while defend its legitimate security interest 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 we stand on the precipice of the gaza crisis of and the intifada yesterday an israeli military incursion into the jenin refugee camp result in the death of more than refugee hundred be injure and as   the hon member for cynon valley beth winter   say the ensue gun battle have prevent civilian from get the aid and medical care they need today israeli civilian be kill in a terrorist car ram and a stabbing and we be in an endless cycle of violence we need a return to the diplomatic table jordan and egypt   have be try to facilitate that and stand ready to continue to do so but they must see meaningful effort to stand up for the agreement reach at previous meeting such as the in aqaba 
 i therefore call on the government to try to secure the following the israelis must stop the expansion of illegal settlement we be see that continue and it must stop they agree to do that at aqaba we must see hamas end its terror attack on israel they be wrong they be terror attack and although we have no influence over hamas we must use our voice to make it clear that it must immediately stop as the uk can we urge our israeli friend to show restraint can we appoint a middle east peace process envoy who can be task with spend their entire time work with our ally around the region to de escalate the situation our voice be unique and will be hear and we have a role to play in the peace process finally will we use our un security council presidency through that role we can shed light on what be take place 
 i thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her salient and wise comment as always may i reiterate that on friday the foreign secretary make a joint statement with the canadians and australians to set out very clearly our opposition to israel ’s announcement of the expansion of settlement across the west bank we be ask israel to halt and reverse that policy of settlement expansion with immediate effect 
 more widely of course we recognise the very real security challenge face israel and the palestinian authority and condemn all terrorist group plan and carry out attack but we mourn the loss of innocent life indeed the injury to civilian and particularly child be deeply concern we will continue to speak and our colleague be speak to our israeli team today about the urgent need for all party to de escalate and prevent the further loss of civilian life 
 we must all be extremely concerned about the situation in the refugee camp in the city of jenin as well as the ongoing deteriorate situation in the conflict as a whole israel have the right to defend itself against militant group but that right must be exercise proportionately and in line with international law i be therefore very concerned that report suggest there be significant civilian casualty in jenin i be also aware that statement from the spokesman for the united nations secretary general suggest that this military operation have not be conduct within the parameter of humanitarian law the secretary general be say to be deeply concern about the situation on the ground 
 likewise i be extremely concerned about the break news of a suspect car ram in tel aviv where late report suggest that at least people be injure can the minister provide an urgent update on the situation we will always condemn act of terrorism which only make peace hard to achieve 
 on jenin i be concern about report that emergency health team have be prevent from enter jenin to treat the injured and to help people in general and that hospital have be damage the world health organisation have report that child   have recently be kill i be sure that everyone in the house will agree that it be truly appal that child palestinian and israeli continue to be the innocent victim in this conflict do the minister agree that all civilian death must be thoroughly and impartially investigate and that there must be meaningful accountability 
 let i be clear that the opposition will continue to be strong and consistent advocate of justice human right and international law in this conflict we also condemn the unacceptable use of violence against civilian in all circumstance in our view there will be a last peace only when there be a negotiate diplomatic settlement to the israeli palestinian conflict the only real solution will be a settlement base on state a safe and secure israel alongside a viable and independent palestinian state we strongly oppose action that make this state solution hard to achieve so my fundamental question be what of substance be the minister and the government do to bring this immediate conflict to an end and to lay the foundation for a state solution 
 i do not have the late information on the tel aviv attack but i understand that hamas be claim it as of theirs we absolutely condemn hamas ’s use of indiscriminate violence and attack of this nature there can never be any justification for such act of violence and we will continue to call on hamas and other terrorist group to permanently end their incitement against israel importantly ministers and our ambassador will continue to work very closely today and in the day ahead to urge the de escalation of the present situation in jenin 
 understand that this come in the context of for year israel building settlement that block the route to a settlement of this dispute and understanding that israel be fail to show restraint fail to follow international humanitarian law and fail to protect civilian what be the government actually go to do 
 as i say the statement that the foreign secretary put out with his canadian and australian counterpart last week set out a clear message to the israelis about stop the settlement expansion we will continue to work with our friend and ally to make that message clearly hear 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 violence on all side must be condemn however contrary to what the minister say illegal settlement be a barrier to peace yet the uk government continue to fail to take any meaningful action towards prevent that this violence represent a serious escalation of tension on the west bank as we have hear palestinians and israelis have lose their life what assessment have be make of the potential chain reaction of violence that this could unleash 
 it have be confirm that thousand of people have be displace from the camp what discussion have the minister have with international colleague on how to minimise the suffering of those refugee civilian who have now be displace twice this morning un aid agency voice alarm at the scale of israel ’s military operation in jenin report that water and energy   supply have be damage so will the uk government commit to work with partner to provide additional humanitarian funding to restore these vital supply for people there 
 the uk ’s position be clear settlement be illegal under international law and they call into question israel ’s commitment to the state solution so we have urge israel to halt that settlement expansion which be threaten the physical viability of a palestinian state to the hon gentleman ’s point we be work with our partner the united states france germany and italy to strongly oppose these unilateral step 
 i be afraid that i do not have the late information on humanitarian funding but our team work very closely through the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration and other humanitarian organisation i would be happy to ask the relevant minister to update the house later on what the late commitment be 
 clearly this morning ’s car ramming be only the most recent of the terrorist attack that have emanate from the city of jenin so far operation house and garden have result in the destruction of lab hundred of improvise explosive device and thousand of grenade underneath the mosque there be tunnel with hundred of weapon and people have be arrest clearly the terrorist activity be go to be severely limited behind all this be the islamic revolutionary guard corps hamas and the jenin battalion do my right hon friend agree with i that this be a proportionate attempt to reduce terrorism against the state of israel 
 as i say while the uk remain absolutely resolute in its commitment to israel ’s security and we condemn absolutely the use of indiscriminate force by hamas and other terrorist group we call on all party to maintain a proportionate balance so that we can de escalate the exist situation and ensure that civilian be not catch up in this any more 
 with water and electricity service in the jenin refugee camp damage as a result of the violence camp resident be unable to move from their home many be in urgent need of food drink water and medical support but the ambulance have be prevent from reach the wounded will the secretary of state raise with the israeli authority the issue of access for ambulance and medical team to the jenin camp 
 the fcdo minister for the middle east lord ahmad will be listen to the debate and will be able to give an update in the other place later today about his ongoing discussion with israeli counterpart 
 let we be clear any loss of innocent civilian life be too many but let we also be clear that the palestinian authority have lose control over jenin and it have become a safe haven for terrorist terror group have fortify the area with ied and last week they fire rocket   towards israel from inside the camp iran have also boast about arm training and fund the palestinian terror group that operate there do the minister agree that it be in the interest of both the palestinians and the israelis that terror group cease these operation which only far destabilise the palestinian authority and the region with innocent people die as a consequence 
 we recognise the real security concern face israel and the palestinian authority while they try to deal with those terrorist group and we condemn absolutely terrorist group plan and carry out attack to my hon friend ’s point on the loss of innocent life every loss be too many and there will also be a serious number of injury to civilian we continue to be deeply concerned by the cycle of violence in the west bank the urgent need for all party to de escalate to prevent that loss of life remain critical 
 unless and until we acknowledge our own role in this develop tragedy anything the minister say at the dispatch box be essentially go to be meaningless the increase in violence by the idf and the expansion of settlement in the west bank happen because we and other country in the west do nothing to hold israel to account so could the minister tell we now will she commit to support an international criminal court investigation into what be happen there will the government here now set a timetable for the recognition of the palestinian state 
 this government and members on both side of the house do not waver from the state solution that we all wish to see as i have say settlement be illegal under international law and we will continue alongside ally and partner to make that point clear as for the ongoing activity today i hope that lord ahmad will be able to pick up on that later today as progress be make with our counterpart in israel 
 but have n’t our strategic partnership with israel announce in this house afford we any leverage over israeli policy in the west bank 
 our strategic relationship with israel be a strong and long stand we work with israel in many area from security to trade it be an important partner that do not negate the fact that we want to see a de escalation of the current situation and to ensure that the loss of civilian life be minimise 
 i share the distress of other at the loss of civilian life islamic jihad have already claim several of the dead as islamic jihad fighter and as we have hear the israelis say that the camp be use as a hub for terrorist operation do the minister think any more can be do to prevent terrorist from embed themselves among civilian particularly in place such as refugee camp 
 we recognise the security challenge that be face and will continue to be face not only by israel and the palestinian authority in this case but elsewhere in the world where innocent live   in refugee camp be use as a cover for terrorist wish to cause harm we all have to continue to tackle that not only in the west bank but around the world importantly in this situation we will all continue to urge de escalation to reduce the risk of any further civilian casualty or loss of life 
 this year have see more palestinians kill than in any other year more settlement start announce than in any other year more demolition in east jerusalem than in any other year and more violence in general we be on the precipice of another intifada at the minute it look to i as though israel be act with impunity and this be an all out assault on palestinian life so what action will the government undertake not just conversation to bring this dreadful escalation in violence to an end 
 we be absolutely committed to work with all party on the challenge associate with demolition so that people remain calm and avoid provocation but we be clear that in all but the most exceptional of circumstance demolition and forced eviction be contrary to international humanitarian law the practice cause unnecessary suffering to palestinians and be harmful to effort to promote peace in particular we be monitor development at masafer yatta closely and we have make our view clear to the israeli government on that matter 
 constituent have write to i about their grave concern for the welfare of civilian and health worker in the jenin camp they like i know that the israeli army enjoy a climate of impunity because the international community never hold israel to account for its action israel continue to breach international law include the geneva convention as we have hear already today settlement be war crime under the rome statute so my question for the minister be what specific action will the government take to ensure that israel adhere to international law and that its leader be hold accountable for its war crime 
 as i say we have be clear on this my colleague in the other place will speak with the israeli ambassador later today to ensure that we put forward the uk view that de escalation be urgently require in this difficult situation and that we continue to tackle the question associate with illegal settlement which be contrary to humanitarian law 
 when the russians have bomb predominantly civilian area result in the death of civilian we have rightly condemn it as a war crime why have the government not condemn these action which be result in the loss of civilian life as a war crime have the government call in the israeli ambassador to remind she in the strong term possible of the legal responsibility that israel have to protect civilian 
 the uk support israel ’s right to defend itself and its citizen against terrorist activity but we be clearly urge the idf to demonstrate restraint   in order to prioritise the protection of civilian as i say lord ahmad will be speak with the israeli ambassador later today 
 we all condemn attack on civilian regardless of which community they be from the action of the idf in jenin be indefensible and have result in be of the most lethal year for palestinians the uk have long claim to support a state solution endorse un security council resolution and recognise that settlement be illegal under international law so after yesterday ’s appalling move to block action by citizen and public body to stop illegal occupation and settlement have uk government policy change 
 as i say this government will continue to stress the importance of the adherence to the principle of necessity and proportionality when israel defend its legitimate security interest as well as the importance of continue to provide appropriate protection to the palestinian civilian population particularly child 
 at around am yesterday year old majdi younis saud ararawi sustain a gunshot wound to the chest and nouruddin husam yousef marshoud who be just be shoot in the head by israeli occupation force their name join a list of more than palestinian child kill by the israeli regime since the beginning of the ultimate cause of those senseless killing be israel ’s brutal and illegal occupation of palestine which have go on for over half a century 
 give that last night the government vote for legislation ban peaceful mean of protest against this abomination and give britain ’s humanitarian and historic responsibility to the palestinian people what action have the government take the minister have duck the question so far but i will give she another chance to answer what action will the government take to ensure that israel adhere to international law and its leader be hold to account 
 as i have say we be engage both with the israelis and the palestinians to urge they to de escalate those tension lord ahmad will be speak to the israeli ambassador later highlight and demand that under international law access to medical care and staff be allow so that those who be injure in the jenin refugee camp be able to receive the medical care that they require 
 the use of aerial bombardment and armoured assault by thousand of troop in a refugee camp familiar to the people of gaza be now extend to the west bank alongside settlement expansion it be part of the annexation of the occupied palestinian territories by israel ’s far right government occupation be the cause and context of these late war crime will the government acknowledge that and respond by recognise the state of palestine 
 as i say across this house we continue our long stand position of a state solution we will continue to work with partner across the world to find a solution that allow that to happen in the   meantime we be deeply trouble by the level of violence and we continue to call on israel while defend itself and its citizen to demonstrate the restraint require to ease the situation in jenin today 
 my thought go out to the people affect by the horrific attack on the jenin refugee camp we must be clear that this be a violation of international law and that the occupy force in particular have a responsibility to end the violence i will give a clear suggestion of a possible action will the uk government send a clear message of condemnation by bring to an end the importation into the uk of good that be produce in those israeli settlement that be deem illegal under international law 
 as i say we will continue to make call on israel—[interruption good make in the settlement be not allow to be import and that continue to be the case we continue to grow the work that we do on trade with israel the palestinian authority and the opt and i know the department for business and trade be focus on that development work.[official report   july vol c. 4mc 
 i do not think the minister understand the power of office today we have hear comment and some warm word but we have see no action the uk currently have the power of hold the presidency of the united nations security council so will she call the security council together to act now on the atrocity that we have see in jenin what other measure will she take to stop further atrocity occur 
 as i say we continue to work on the peaceful state solution later today lord ahmad will provide an update in the other place on our continue activity 
 this year have already be the deadly for violence in the west bank since what assessment have the minister make of the impact of rise israeli violence against palestinian civilian i will give she another chance do she not agree that civilian death should lead to investigation and accountability 
 as i say we continue to be deeply trouble by the high number of palestinian civilian who have be kill and injure as the hon lady highlight while israel have a legitimate right to defend itself it be important that israeli force exercise maximum restraint especially in the use of live fire when protect that legitimate security interest 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 peace be a word we often hear in relation to israel and palestine but how can peace be achieve when palestinians be subject to systematic and deliberate oppression and discrimination by israeli authority the people in the jenin refugee camp have already flee their home and they have be displace yet again can the minister set out what be be do by the international community to help those who have now be displace twice will   she condemn the denial to access medical care for palestinians in jenin and will she join i in call out israel ’s behaviour for what it be as state in a report by amnesty international israel be commit the crime of apartheid against palestinians 
 as i say lord ahmad will be speak to the israeli ambassador later and will be make clear that we want to ensure that medical supply be able to get into refugee camp to provide the care that be need to those who be injure as a result of the violence of the past few day 
 report from jenin be shocking particularly report that medical team be unable to get access to civilian in need i support what the chair of the foreign affairs committee   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns say about have step towards a solution and an ending of israeli settlement the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs report there have be at least attack by settler against palestinians in the west bank this year which be an average of attack a day what be the minister do in discussion with her counterpart on tackle israeli settler violence as well as on the issue face because of new palestinian militant group action be need now to de escalate the situation as well as look again at the international funding for the united nations relief and works agency which be vital to support palestinian refugee 
 as i say we condemn settler violence in the strong possible term and we urge the israeli authority to do what they can the foreign secretary ’s statement publish with australia and canada at the end of last week highlight the very clear demand that the government of israel reverse their decision to approve over new settlement unit in the west bank and change the settlement approval process we will continue to work with ally to achieve that 
 the escalation of violence in the west bank over the past year and the killing of innocent civilian include child in recent day be devastating the state solution which many of we hope will bring peace and stability to the region seem far away than ever what be the government actively do to stop the killing of innocent people and to ensure that a state settlement be still a diplomatic reality 
 as i have say we continue to work with partner and ally on the state solution indeed we call on all those catch up in the violence today to show restraint and to de escalate the situation so that the violence can come to a halt and we can ensure that those casualty be able to receive treatment 
 my good and hon friend   the member for cynon valley beth winter   be absolutely correct in her remark and i thank she for secure this urgent question i visit the refugee camp at jenin in and see some of the clinic and school to say that the condition be grim be an understatement what we have see over the past day or be an attack by israeli security force on a refugee camp use missile against child parent the elderly   and the vulnerable this be not about israel defend itself even the white house have state that it be tyranny when will the uk government intervene not just with word to condemn those action but with something in practical term to support the palestinian people undergo such appalling oppression 
 the uk ’s position on the middle east peace process be clear and we will continue to support a negotiate settlement which lead to a safe and secure israel live side by side with a viable and sovereign palestinian state base on the border in the short term we be call very firmly as be all partner around the world on israeli defence force to show the require level of restraint to ensure that the violence cease in jenin refugee camp as soon as possible 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for cynon valley beth winter   for secure this urgent question it have be report that medical team have be prevent from enter jenin will the minister condemn that now from the dispatch box will she express to her counterpart that palestinians must have medical aid and can she then return to the house to update mps on the medical situation 
 as i have say international humanitarian law require access to be make available for medical team to treat those in need of care so we be urge israel to allow that as soon as possible i know that my colleague the minister for the middle east will be raise that particularly urgently with the israeli ambassador when he speak to she this afternoon i will ensure that an update be provide by the department in due course 
 the last time that we see tension rise like this we experience a month of hate with incident of antisemitism rise to an all time high and horror trope on the street of london do the minister agree that while discussion be take place to de escalate the situation we all have a duty to temper our language to make sure that jewish resident such as my constituent do not live in fear of abuse graffiti racist convoy and ultimately violence we all have a duty to try to tackle this behaviour on the street when we see it 
 we all have a duty to ensure that antisemitic voice be not allow to cause distress or violence we will continue to ensure that those who feel anxious get the support they need we provide a great deal of support and be very proud of the work that the home office do in support of many of our jewish community 
 this year we have see a record number of settlement unit approve the israeli finance minister have instruct ministry to prepare for an additional settler on the west bank we have see palestinian child kill while the government urge restraint and we get the same weak answer time and again from the dispatch box israel be act with impunity i think the minister say it slightly wrong early on but it seem that she be say that trade with illegal settlement be now deem illegal by the uk government be that the case 
 let i reiterate again that the uk position on settlement be absolutely clear those settlement be illegal under international law and indeed they call into question that commitment to the state solution to which the uk be commit we will continue to urge israel to halt that and ensure that the trade relationship that we have with israel and the occupied palestinian territories can progress as they need to 
 many of my luton south constituent have be in touch to say how distressed and angry they be about the increase in violence on the west bank many have set out that the access to supply clean water and powdered milk for child be at risk so beyond conversation can the minister confirm that there will be additional support for healthcare and medical organisation on the ground so that they can help civilian 
 once my noble friend lord ahmad have have discussion with the israeli ambassador i will ensure that further information on how we will continue to support unrwa and other humanitarian group focus in particular on this incident i be afraid that i do not have more information to hand at the moment 
 eye witness in an interview with cnn have compare the impact of the incursion with a natural disaster in term of the destruction of infrastructure such as road water system and electricity what role can the british government play in help reconstruction to reduce further humanitarian suffering be it the policy of the british government that the state of israel should pay reparation for damage to civilian infrastructure in the occupy territory as a result of military activity 
 as i have say we have see the violent activity today on our tv and we call on the israeli defence forces and the israeli government to demonstrate the restraint that be require to prioritise the protection of civilian and ensure that we can see both medical support get into the jenin camp and de escalation of the violence as soon as possible 
 i wish to pass on my thank to my hon friend   the member for cynon valley beth winter   for raise this issue today i will give the minister more chance before we end this urgent question can she set out with far far great clarity than she have do so far what action the government will take as president of the un security council to ensure that israel adhere to international law and that its leader be hold accountable 
 as i set out early this week the foreign secretary speak to the israeli foreign minister eli cohen on   june   and to palestinian prime minister shtayyeh on   june such conversation be go on day after day lord ahmad will be able to give an update on his conversation later on in the day in the other place 
 israel be clearly in breach of international humanitarian law as well as multiple un security council resolution the minister have duck the very specific question on the   security council on multiple occasion as president of the security council the uk have a particular power to convene the security council and indeed the responsibility to do so can the minister give we a very clearcut answer will the uk government convene the security council on this issue yes or no 
 as i have say the government continue not only to have close discussion with the israelis to try to ensure a de escalation of the violence that we be see today but to work closely with our ally and partner to ensure that we continue to support and give the clear direction of international partner on the question of the state solution 
 i thank the minister of state for her measured and careful answer to the urgent question it be important that her interest in this matter be put on the record will she outline what discussion have take place with our israeli ally to renew peace talk to allow both state to co exist beside each other without the tit for tat action that have become normalise and yet be truly horrific and heartbreaking for all those who be lose love one in this conflict 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he be right that when this violence occur the great tragedy be that civilian be catch up in it especially where the israeli defence forces be legitimately try to defend themselves and indeed palestinians from the terrorist threat the foreign secretary continue to have a strong focus on this and we be work with leader and our ally around the world to try to find a solution
