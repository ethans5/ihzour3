i start by pay tribute to the family who be in the gallery and to those who be not as   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   say i have some personal experience in these matter and i know just how painful it be to have a love detain overseas often for long period and with great uncertainty about next step i have meet many of those who be in the public gallery they be a tribute to their family and i be endlessly in awe of the bravery commitment and determination that they show 
 as the right hon gentleman mention many of these case have be go on for some time i will start by provide context on the general situation several member have make comment about trend line i will offer datum on the foreign office ’s response as have be request i will set out labour ’s position and then i will turn briefly to some of the case that have be raise however as be say by the liberal democrat spokesperson   the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller many family do not wish to have their case name in this house and many of they be not represent in the public gallery that do not make they any less of a priority for i the rest of the ministerial team or the foreign office 
 i join the shadow minister the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and many other right hon and hon member in pay tribute to consular team for their work   the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis   say that many foreign office staff be the good and bright and that be certainly true for consular team who i be very happy to represent as the consular minister and to visit everywhere i go the week before last i be in pakistan where our staff deal with some of the most complex consular case as the house will know they work to ensure that people have what be often their only contact with the outside world once they have be detain as many member have say 
 i would not claim to be of the good or bright but i be what the right hon member for new forest east would probably call a specialist unit give that during my time in the foreign office i deal with many such case indeed i work with other nation as many member have encourage the government to do it be of course desirable to look at other country system my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry   mention the speha system with which i work extensively i can assure she that i talk to my american counterpart include the special envoy who i will see this weekend 
 member seek consistency in our response to consular case they will recognise that what govern our ability to provide consular assistance be the vienna convention which mandate that we can not interfere in foreign legal system we can only ensure that proper consular assistance be offer many member have rightly highlight the   difficulty in identify whether british national have have proper recourse to due process and their full right the foreign office remain focused on that question 
 we be assist british national overseas some of those case be more straightforward some be considerably more complex we provide assistance both directly and through a partnership with prisoners abroad a highly value charity with which many member will be familiar it work to ensure not only that british national overseas be visit by the foreign office but that they have access to essential such as food and medication prisoner abroad also support the family of those detain abroad a vital service that we will continue to support we have long run partnership with non governmental organisation such as reprieve and the death penalty project which provide expertise in complex case 
 i know that right hon and hon member be familiar with the foreign office arrangement so i will not dwell on they too much but let i be clear about what a labour government will do differently and why we will introduce a special envoy for complex consular case in part because we have hear from family include those in the public gallery about their experience of seek foreign office support we will introduce that envoy so that there be as many member have request a part of the foreign office with a particular focus on complex consular case we will also introduce a new right to consular assistance i hope to return to the house shortly to set out more detail on both provision 
 the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale   rightly highlight that we should be uneasy about the increase global trend of try to use british and other foreign national as diplomatic leverage it be important to repeat that we will never accept british national be use as pawn or diplomatic leverage we take a strong position on that and will continue to do so we will not haggle for british national but will ensure that they have their proper right in accordance with the vienna convention and will do everything we can to support their family 
 i turn briefly to some of the case that have be raise i reiterate that i will not mention every case there be many name that be burn into my mind as member would expect and case that we work on regularly that i will not mention now but i will address those on which i have be particularly press for answer i begin with the case of mr cornelius and mr ridley the family be above i in the gallery we will continue to provide support to they but i reassure the house that i have now raise with the ruler of dubai the request for clemency and outline the british government ’s support for mr cornelius pardon application the previous foreign secretary do so as be allude to by the shadow minister i think it be important to provide clarification on that i recognise that there have be unwelcome news in this case i will not go into further detail about that in this place but we will continue to work on the case i meet mr cornelius ’s family recently and i reassure the house that i have commit to continue to meet they for as long as the case remain ongoing 
 mr lai ’s case which be also raise remain a priority for the british government we be closely monitor his trial and i can reassure the house that diplomat from our consulate general will continue to attend his court proceeding as this house be aware the prime   minister raise the matter of mr lai with president xi at the g20 summit and the foreign secretary have raise it with his equivalent the minister for the indo pacific have also raise this case with both the chinese and hong kong authority we continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release mr lai 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend the members for wolverhampton west warinder juss and for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister for raise the case of mr johal we continue to press the government of india for fast progress to resolve this matter i recognise the diligent effort of his brother who i understand be in the gallery and the deep and profound frustration about this case it must be resolve and that resolution must include an investigation into mr johal ’s allegation of torture 
 i will return to this house later today to talk far about mr el fattah ’s case that case remain at the front of my mind and that of the foreign secretary he meet the family who i understand be behind i in the gallery last week the prime minister have raise the case with president sisi the foreign secretary and i have both raise it with the egyptian foreign minister and my right hon friend the minister for development raise it just this week again with the egyptian foreign minister mr el fattah ’s case be tragic i be very mindful of the hunger strike of his mother who i have meet and whose effort have be mention by many hon member we will continue to focus on mr el fattah and i look forward to return to the house this afternoon to discuss his case far 
 on emily damari a hostage hold by hamas and a british national she and all the other uk national and people with uk link hold by hamas be very much on our mind we continue to press for their immediate release for humanitarian access to they and for the medical assistance that we be sure they will require i meet their family this week and they will remain a steadfast focus i would also like to comment briefly on the case of dr ibadoghlu we have indeed raise this case with the authority include recently at the end of october 
 as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green suggest these be not easy case many of they have be go on for some time and the appointment of an envoy be important but i reassure this house that i be the minister responsible for consular affair it be not for official to own these case as the shadow minister have make clear that be for ministers that be very much the view that i and the foreign secretary take i look forward to return to the house to discuss some of these case in more detail and to tell member about the measure that we will take i regret that in our few month in government we have not yet see positive progress on all these case and i note that many member have refer to the negative trend in some of these area i reassure the house that we will continue to focus on this issue above all as be say by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for bicester and woodstock the duty of government be to look after their people there be no high responsibility for i than serve british national whatever corner of the world they be in 
 i be delighted to be call to give my maiden speech and i do so with a sense of trepidation and excitement   which i imagine that many a new mp feel it have strike i that maiden speech be a little like bus you wait age and then of they turn up at once i beg your indulgence madam deputy speaker to listen to more as we near the end of this journey 
 as hon member will know the excellent house of commons library helpfully provide we with the maiden speech of our last predecessor to give we a feel for this place and to acknowledge the work of those who come before we mr selous serve for a whopping year and i pay tribute to his work as an assiduous constituency representative who stand up for what he believe in i discover in his maiden speech that he in turn refer to his predecessor who serve for year who in turn hark back to the member who come before he the last labour mp for the area who be elect back in clearly be a year that be rather good for team in red albeit follow by rather too many year of hurt 
 history show we how rarely change come for these community yet change be desperately need on shop- lifting i have meet worker who have be spat at threaten with needle and even a gun the lack of healthcare facility include in houghton regis and leighton linslade sewage pollute our waterway and transport i be delighted to be a member of the transport committee and transport be the subject of the debate which i congratulate   the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke   on securing 
 my constituency have a long history of transport innovation it have britain ’s old road date back to prehistoric time the icknield way which run through the constituency it have the grand union canal the freight superhighway of its day leighton buzzard railway once transport sand from quarry and be now a much love tourism attraction go full steam ahead more recently we have of the long guide busway in europe which i hope day can be extend that bring i neatly to the topic of bus and encourage more people to switch on to they which be so vital in this time of climate emergency 
 i welcome the bsip investment announce recently by the government and i look forward to hear more from the minister about plan to allow more local area to have a smoother path to franchising i be keen for the minister to look carefully at transport governance london and greater manchester which have franchising already have also historically have alignment of transport power resource and capacity all in centralised place passenger transport executive and their equivalent can accelerate the delivery of transport plan and play a crucial role in unlock regional economic growth for year such structure have benefit from much high level of control and co ordination of bus they also benefit from run over a much more logical functional economic geography 
 outside such area transport power be hold in many different place and they require a number of organisation to independently agree reform to enact change that can mean for example that bus stop which be surely the window to the soul of bus can be own by an organisation with no say in how the bus service itself be run in many place in the country highway and transport power be split we perhaps   need more passenger transport executive although the urban transport group advise that the last passenger transport executive be establish so long ago not quite so long ago as when a labour mp last represent dunstable and leighton buzzard that the mechanic around establish a new be unclear 
 in any case we need governance that be fit for the century with the right delegate function be grant to a passenger transport executive or equivalent and the establishment of an executive function to speed up decision making and delivery that make the difference it need to be base on a geography that reflect travel pattern as well as wide social and economic geography and which give a large enough base to raise farebox income 
 on geography i argue that there need to be possibility to franchise in area large than local transport authority give that franchising be not entirely a silver bullet i urge the minister to look at the geography of enhance partnership as well it be only bus but the f70 which travel from luton to milton keynes via dunstable and leighton buzzard go through separate enhance partnership area 
 finally i thank grant palmer arriva and which have invite i aboard their bus recently and dawsongroup for bring a double decker bus just outside parliament for catch the bus month which many hon member from across the house come to support it be my belief really that every month should be catch the bus month i urge all hon member to get on board and back our local bus all year round

 how will the prime minister ’s mission board learn from the clear lack of join up between the treasury and the department for environment food and rural affairs over the family farm tax and the family business tax to ensure that they do not become mission silo 
 the hon lady be right to say that of the benefit of mission be to work across departmental boundary that have be try many time and be difficult to do but i believe that farmer and people in rural area will benefit from great energy security from low waiting list in the nhs from rise living standard and from the other thing that be at the heart of our mission 
 too many child face barrier to opportunity their life chance be be hold back by ration access to mental health support and diminish by a system that do not do enough to support those with special educational need and disability what action can be take on a cross government basis to increase the availability of mental health support to cover of school so that we can achieve our vital mission to break down barrier to opportunity 
 my hon friend be right to raise this matter he will be aware that we have announce extra funding for special educational need that issue be rise up the agenda and be cause a lot of anxiety for parent throughout the country at the heart of our mission be make sure that a great proportion of young child be ready to start school because if that be not the case it can hold back their opportunity for the rest of their life 
 with gb energy headquarter in scotland and the methil yard in my constituency a fantastic facility to build the renewable infrastructure we will need how be my right hon friend ensure collaboration across government and with the scottish government to deliver the mission for growth through investment in renewable 
 as my hon friend say we have make good progress in set up great british energy a publicly own energy company include announce that its headquarters will be in aberdeen this transition to clean power offer huge economic opportunity for the whole uk i be glad to report to the house that co operation between the scottish government and the uk on this matter have be good and this be at the heart of our clean energy mission 
 can the minister give we some indication on the timeline for gb energy when do he expect it to be up and run at full capacity do he think there be any opportunity to incorporate green skill to support new job in area such as north east lincolnshire grimsby and cleethorpes 
 in just month the government have make progress in set up great british energy we have announce £ to establish the company with a furth £ of capital funding to spend in the next financial year we have announce the partnership with the crown estate and select the chair juergen maier as i say a moment ago we have choose aberdeen as the location for the headquarters 
 as for the next step more information on great british energy ’s early priority will come in the new year from the secretary of state for energy security and net that will support skill development   across the country include in the humber which be at the absolute forefront of the uk ’s net ambition and be home i be pleased to say to several groundbreake renewable energy project which we support 
 a recent report by the social mobility foundation show that on average people from working class background be pay an incredible £ less than their privileged peer do my right hon friend agree that labour ’s opportunity mission will be critical to end that damn statistic and finally smash the class ceiling that enable it 
 we firmly believe that whoever someone be and wherever they come from britain should be a country where hard work mean they can get on in life and that their circumstance of birth should never dictate their future the reality for too many child in britain today be that that can be the case that opportunity can be limit and our opportunity mission be aim at break that link we will roll out government fund childcare to support improved access deliver on the fund hour expansion and on the government ’s manifesto commitment to create more school base nursery increase the availability of childcare place where they be need most as i say we want to get a great proportion of child ready to start school when they walk into primary school for the time 
 stepping hill hospital in hazel grove be report to have a repair backlog of £ the people on waiting list which have be elongate by this repair backlog be police officer teacher and nurse thereby make it more difficult for the government to deliver on any of their other mission can the right hon gentleman assure the house that due weight be be give to reduce nhs waiting list so that all the other mission can be achieve 
 we announce an extra £ for the nhs over the next couple of year in the recent budget i can certainly assure the hon lady that reduce wait time be at the heart of our mission because current waiting time be bad for people ’s health and bad for our economy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be a pleasure to face the right hon gentleman across the dispatch box for what i believe be the time i be pleased to see member of the cabinet on the front bench it be quite right that the cabinet office should be so well reflect 
 the day after he enter downing street the prime minister pledge to personally chair each mission delivery board to drive through change we now hear that he be not chair each mission delivery board why have the prime minister break his pledge 
 let i begin by welcome the hon gentleman to his position i look forward to our exchange he be also the shadow secretary of state for northern ireland so i hope his party leader will be give he a christmas bonus for productivity and hard work he will certainly deserve it 
 the prime minister be very engaged in the delivery of these mission and meet for mission stocktake regularly with the secretaries of state in charge that be the benefit of have this kind of programme the prime minister can personally hold secretaries of state to account and ensure they be all focused on delivery of the government ’s priority 
 the right hon gentleman be right as the holder of shadow portfolio i get double the money laughter i be sorry not to hear an explanation for why the prime minister have go back on his word there be grow concern that the mission delivery board be not be take seriously those concern be feel by member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee yesterday when the right hon gentleman ’s very capable permanent secretary say that 
 the governance and the wiring of how we do this might not be immediately observable 
 which be a masterful piece of civil service phraseology if ever there be 
 these board be not cabinet sub committees which mean they be not authorise to make policy the prime minister be not there so his authority be absent the government will not reveal who be on they what they discuss or when they meet they be start to sound like figment of the government ’s imagination a litter of schrödinger ’s cat will the right hon gentleman at least commit to regular publish update on what each of the board be do who sit on they what decision they make what work they be undertake and what achievement they have achieve 
 the hon gentleman be go to get a publish update in a couple of hour when he will receive a very full account of what the board have be do how they have be prioritise their work and what the next step be he be a former cabinet office minister so he will know that of the wonderful thing about the cabinet office be that it do a great deal of work under the bonnet sometimes not in the full gaze of publicity and that that be the privilege of all of we who have serve in the cabinet office that be true of this work however we be publish a very important update later this morning 
 what step his department be take to help reduce trade barrier with the eu 
 the prime minister and the president of the european commission meet on   october   in brussels and agree to strengthen the relationship between the uk and the eu maroš šefčovič on behalf of the european union and i on behalf of the uk government will now take forward that important work we be committed to reduce barrier to trade include negotiate a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement to reduce check on food and put food on people ’s table more cheaply 
 we be very proud that uk agriculture have some of the high animal welfare standard in the world it be for this reason that the production of foie gra be ban in as it be consider to be too cruel while we be desperate to reduce trade barrier with the eu be there any step to ban product like foie gra to ensure that all animal product sell in the uk be produce to at least the same animal welfare standard as those in the uk 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the issue of very high standard of animal welfare in food production this government will prioritise that in trade policy unlike the conservatives who when they be in government negotiate free trade agreement that consistently undermine agriculture in the uk 
 we all support effort to remove unnecessary trade barrier but we must also be clear with our european partner on what we can not accept what be the paymaster general prepare to say be off the table dynamic alignment british fishing right or maybe asylum burden sharing 
 the labour party manifesto set out our red line in this negotiation we will not go back to the battle of the past we will not return to the single market we will not return to the custom union we will not return to freedom of movement what we will do be negotiate with the european union to make the british people safe and more secure so we have close law enforcement co operation we will negotiate to reduce trade barrier to make the british people more prosperous 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats be glad that the government have commit to reset our relationship with the eu and that the prime minister and the foreign secretary be actively engage to rebuild trust and our relationship with our european neighbour through meeting with the european commission and the foreign affairs council 
 establish a uk eu youth mobility scheme would mirror exist cap arrangement that the uk already have with country include australia new zealand and canada deliver such a scheme would provide a return on investment in the form of soft power that be never seemingly factor into the approach of the previous conservative government will the minister confirm that he will have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of a youth mobility scheme between the united kingdom and the european union 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the importance of the foreign secretary ’s attendance at the foreign affairs council it be hugely important that we work together with our european partner on security particularly in the dangerous world environment we find ourselves in at the moment on youth mobility we have of course listen to what the eu have to say but we have no plan for a youth mobility scheme and we will not return to freedom of movement 
 what step he be take to reform public procurement 
 what step he be take to reform public procurement 
 what step he be take to reform public procurement 
 i spend the last few week meet small and medium sized enterprise voluntary and community sector organisation wide business and contract authority to discuss how we ensure that the approximately £ that be spend each year on public sector procurement deliver for our community with this government procurement will deliver value for money well public service and our national mission the procurement act commence in february create a simple more flexible procurement system under- pin by a new mission lead national procurement policy statement to ensure that public procurement deliver on the government ’s mission 
 small business be a crucial part of the economy in cumbernauld and kirkintilloch there be huge opportunity to help they far and way of do that be to work across the public sector and with local authority in my case north lanarkshire and east dunbartonshire council with contract as big as the redevelopment of cumbernauld town centre will the minister work with local authority and the scottish government to help more small business to bid successfully for contract 
 it be critical that we open up public procurement to small business as i have say £ be a huge amount of public money and the opportunity to ensure that small and medium sized enterprise have access to that be also critical as my hon friend say sme be root in our community and provide local often good quality job 
 we be take action now to crack down on late payment that hit the cash flow of small business the chancellor announce recently that company bid for large government contract would be exclude from the procurement process if they do not pay their own supplier within an average of day 
 the last government promise to give more contract through procurement to small business but fail to do so for year instead they choose to use government contracting to support their mate through covid will the minister confirm that this government will use the power of government spending to contract directly with small business to support local company and economy across the country in stark contrast to the conservative party ’s enrichment of their mate 
 as i have say we will work hard to ensure that public contract be support small business i have spend a lot of time talk to they about how we   can do that through the new public procurement policy and the measure in the policy statement this week the chancellor announce the appointment of a new covid corruption commissioner who will be take action to recover public money 
 the resident of falkirk want a government who work day in day out to deliver value for money for the taxpayer never have that be so true as now give the break public finance leave by the tories and year of waste and inaction from the scottish national party up the road do the minister agree that the billion we spend on public procurement must deliver value for the taxpayer and can she tell i what step the government be take to ensure that that be the case 
 when our public service be face so much strain and desperately need rebuilding it be critical that we cut waste and deliver value for money under the last government the procurement system too often fail to drive that efficiency as be show by the shocking level of fraud and waste during the pandemic we will bring new transparency to public sector procurement along with a relentless focus on fraud 
 gross spending on public procurement be £ last year what be the government ’s precise target for deliver great saving from that budget 
 that £ be an enormous amount of money and we need to ensure that it be go into growth deliver for our community and sme and deliver on our mission we be determined to act on procurement and reduce inefficiency and we will provide further information about that in february we can not take lesson from the conservative party about cut waste inefficiency give that they oversaw gross mismanagement lord agnew himself refer to schoolboy errors”—in the delivery of procurement for this country 
 the focus on public procurement will be welcome by sme in the cyber security sector in my constituency cynam have thousand of member and when i talk to its sme they tell i that there be a real risk of our lose talent in the start up community to city abroad such as lisbon and toronto can the minister confirm that the step be take by the government be good news for sme and cynam 
 as i have say i firmly believe that we need to support sme and i should be more than happy to speak to those in the hon member ’s constituency and discuss the opportunity that be available there be so much innovation and talent in this country we need to ensure that public sector money be support our growth mission and support good business in community such as those in his constituency 
 i thank the minister for her answer i have a very simple question what step have be take to ensure that we have well procurement measure domestically in the united kingdom and the devolved nation particularly northern ireland as oppose to rely on international partner to provide or deliver good 
 through our procurement regime we be determined to support small business which be often locally rooted we will continue to do that while take account of our trade obligation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be delighted to meet the minister across the dispatch box i have also be meet many sme in the aftermath of the budget the impact of the government ’s decision to raise national insurance on many indirect provider of public service such as gps and hospice appear not to have be fully factor into the government ’s working at the time of the budget now that the government have have over a month to do the figure what will be the impact of the national insurance job tax on the cost of public procurement to the near say £ 
 i welcome the hon member to their place and look forward to meet they across the dispatch box unfortunately the last government leave this country in a terrible place with public service in crisis i be previously a council leader and every single day i see the absolute strain on our public service people be wait up to hour for ambulance which sometimes do not turn up we have have to take action to invest in our public service in order to deliver growth through our procurement regime we be already take action to support sme to ensure that money be not lose and to ensure that supplier be pay quickly i will set out more to the house in february 
 order we have to get through the list give i a chance to get through it we be only on question 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on the potential merit of designate genomic database as critical national infrastructure 
 genomics be a great british success story and our genomic database be vital for world lead life science and health research the organisation that have such database have to provide data protection and security training and have to make sure that researcher can access datum only for approve purpose the opportunity come with risk which be why the government will always try to minimise the risk of biological datum to protect our bio economy we be work on this issue across government departments and through our national security structure 
 i take it that genomics database will not be designate as critical national infrastructure then which be the question as the government seek to reset the relationship with china will ministers be mindful of the old maxim that you need a long handle spoon to sup with the devil and of the fact that chinese genomics company such as bgi do not behave as normal commercial competitor will the secretary of state ensure that the interest of british genomic be not leave vulnerable as a consequence of any reset relationship 
 the right hon member ask a very important question about the twin interest of national security and economic growth in this territory we work with uk organisation that hold genomic datum to make sure that they have robust data protection system in place and our security service give they advice on these matter on a regular basis so that our pursuit of growth do not conflict with our very important national security objective 
 what step he be take to increase national resilience 
 what recent progress his department have make on strengthen national resilience 
 the government ’s responsibility be to keep the public safe which be why national resilience be a top priority for we in july i announce that i would lead a review of resilience and work have be progress across government we have engage at all level with the public private and voluntary sector and this work be oversee by the dedicated resilience sub committee of the national security council which i chair it be also closely link to our consideration of the covid inquiry module report to which the government will respond next month within the month timeframe set out by the chair of the inquiry 
 the module report recommend resilience and preparedness and particularly 
 bring in external expertise from outside government and the civil service to guard against groupthink 
 how be the minister plan to bring in that external expertise would he consider issue a brochure to british citizen on preparation for crisis as the swedish government have just do 
 the hon member raise an important point the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend   the member for erith and thamesmead ms oppong asare have do a great deal of work on consult people outside government external expert across business the voluntary sector local government and so on it be really important that as part of this we hear voice not just from whitehall but from beyond too 
 the module report of the uk covid-19 inquiry have find that the impact be most acutely feel by the most vulnerable the elderly those with pre exist health condition people live in overcrowded housing and those on low income as the government undertake their review can the minister assure the house that they will work to deliver resilience for everyone not just some of we 
 this be such an important point if resilience be to mean anything it have to be for we all not just for some my hon friend be right to say that of the lesson of past tragedy whether it be covid-19 grenfell tower or other be that it be often the most vulnerable in our society who be hard hit that be   why it be so important that we learn the lesson of the past and have support for the most vulnerable at the heart of our work 
 the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend the member for erith and thamesmead recently meet senior representative from a range of organisation that support people who be disproportionately impact by emergency and crisis to make sure that resilience be indeed for all and not just for some 
 what recent progress his department have make on strengthen cyber security 
 as i set out in my speech to the nato cyber defence conference last week we be work to strengthen the uk ’s cyber resilience but there be of course still more to do in the king ’s speech we announce that the government will bring forward a cyber security and resilience bill which will help to strengthen the uk ’s cyber defence and our work with industry to help to make the uk a safe place to live and work online 
 i stress to the house that this be an ongoing effort it can never be perfect but we be constantly work to make sure we have the strong cyber defence possible 
 the college in ebbw vale have a brilliant cyber security course train young people for job in this grow sector however the national cyber security chief say there be a widen gap between the uk ’s defence and the threat pose by hostile nation so can the minister confirm what be be do to scale up the workforce to defend our crucial infrastructure 
 i congratulate the college in ebbw vale on its brilliant cyber security course 
 my hon friend be right to point out the threat which be why i speak at the nato cyber defence conference last week state and non state actor be constantly probe our defence it be a constant effort to keep those defence strong and we be determined to work not only with education but with business and our critical national infrastructure to make sure we be as well protect as we can be against the threat we face security be no long just about hard military power it be also about cyber security which be why that have to be a real priority for the government 
 what job vacancy in the prime minister 's office be be advertise 
 there be currently vacancy in the prime minister ’s office that be be advertise these role be all advertise across the civil service or externally the house will also have see that the prime minister announce the appointment of sir chris wormald as the new cabinet secretary early this week i be sure the whole house will join i in congratulate he on his appointment 
 i personally would be delighted to welcome the new cabinet secretary to his role i thank the minister for her answer but in her list i do not hear she say whether the cabinet office be hire a new prime minister ’s envoy to the nation and region to carry out the vital work that be about to be do by sue gray when she decide not to take the job be the cabinet office hire another person to undertake that role 
 the hon gentleman seem to have a curious interest in job at no if he be consider a career change i would be very happy to have a private word with he 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 as a former council leader i have see at hand the crisis in public service with people fall between the crack of system that be under extreme strain to reform that we need to get out of whitehall and support worker across the public sector to do thing differently from intervene early to support family a white paper overhaul employment support and an ambitious programme of reform of the nhs this government be determined to reform public service to deliver for citizen 
 under the conservative party too much taxpayer money be waste on project and scheme that simply do not work do the minister agree with i that in order to improve healthcare service include mental health service educational opportunity and social service as well as transport provision and public safety in my constituency of wolverhampton west it be vital that the government continue their test and refine their policy to ensure they be effective and continue to be effective

 i be surprised to hear a member on the conservative benches express concern about money that be desperately need go into our nhs when people be wait for gp appointment and in ambulance under the conservative party police officer would spend hour sit with people with mental health concern be that productivity the secretary of state have set out an incredibly ambitious reform agenda for the nhs move resource into prevention and take account of the amazing opportunity in digital technology to give people more control over their own health labour be the party that back the nhs and fix the mess leave by the previous government

 the government be commit to transparency around lobbying that be why we will have regular transparency update the approach that we take will frankly be in stark contrast with that of the government who precede we

 i think that the hon member be go to give i a christmas greeting but i be still wait in the absence of any envoy he will have to put up with i instead as the minister for intergovernmental relation it be a part of my job that i take very seriously for perhaps obvious reason i enjoy my conversation yesterday with the minister of scotland the minister of wales and the minister and deputy minister of northern ireland i will keep have such conversation

 in relation to my hon friend ’s point it be right that the church of england look very carefully now at its procedure in the light of what have happen and be bring forward in relation to the duty of candour i have no idea why the opposition front benchers be laugh about that it be a hugely important reform that we be bring forward and it will make a significant difference across public service we will have public servant put the public interest above their own personal reputation and above the reputation of institution i hope the opposition front benchers will come to support and help with the leadership require for that step change that culture change across public service 
 the golden valley development adjacent to gchq in cheltenham will pay a vital role in our nation ’s cyber security the recent confirmation of £ from the government for that development be welcome but will the secretary of state confirm that the project will continue to feature in future iteration of the national cyber strategy 
 the good thing to do when it come to a specific place be for i to look into the exact situation and come back to the hon member i assure he as i have say several time during this session that cyber security be extremely important to the government it be not just the government ’s job cyber security have to be take seriously by business and the whole of society that be why we have the national cyber security centre give advice to body of all kind to ensure that they be defend as well as possible

 it be great to see that christmas have come to the palace of westminster i hope mr speaker that you enjoy the christmas fayre yesterday and that you load up on good from frank ’s luxury biscuits from herefordshire just as heavily as i do 
 i be wonder who eat all the biscuit 
 and just in time for small business saturday too 
 i understand that the prime minister will deliver a speech later today set out his plan for change i must say i be delighted i be sure we all be to hear that the government be at last adopt a plan and be try to change as we have so often note at business question the government ’s month   have be a festival no a carnival a supermarket sweep a fill your boot all you can eat blunder f of delay and incompetence 
 you mr speaker more than any member of this house will be aware that the effective functioning of parliament rest on its ability to hold ministers to account that have be true since its origin in the century and arguably since even before that as you will know the practice of seek reason and explanation for official action be they the passage of bills or the raising of taxation be not some useful add on or afterthought it be absolutely foundational to the whole idea of parliament as a deliberative assembly so i be sure that you will understand my disappointment that the leader of the house have be so persistently unwilling to answer or even address the simple question that i have put to she in recent week 
 on   november i draw attention to the government ’s incompetence in combine at the same time measure on national insurance and the minimum wage in a way that drastically raise the cost of hire entry level staff and i ask for an assessment of the total impact of those measure i be afraid that the leader of the house ’s response be to blame the previous government and to talk about employer who will pay no additional national insurance a completely different group quite irrelevant to the question ask on   november i again highlight this problem and get the same response blame the last government and change the subject i also extend my concern about the government ’s incompetence to include their decision to bring the clean energy commitment forward from to and highlight a vast array of public and official worry about whether this be either achievable or financially viable in response i be sorry to say the leader of the house again do not engage with either question instead accuse i of political opportunism 
 last week we see the same thing once more for the time i raise the question of labour ’s triple whammy in combine change to national insurance rate and threshold with change to the minimum wage this time the leader of the house do not simply duck the question and change the subject she also give i the benefit of a little homily on the duty of the opposition it be true that the duty of the opposition be a topic on which unlike the duty of government she have build up considerable expertise over more than a decade but the real point be this for a month now i have be put to the leader of the house basic question about the incompetence of this government many different response be open to she she could have say i agree with you she could have say i do n’t know i will look into it i will reply to you i will ask a ministerial colleague to investigate and respond or i will come back to the house with a proper account but on no occasion have she bother to give any kind of proper answer at all 
 instead and i fear the same will be true this week the leader of the house ’s approach have be to change the subject and attack the previous government rather than defend the record of her government which be the whole point of these exchange let we see what she say when she stand up shortly if the government have make a decent start of course she might want to talk about that but the truth be that the government have make a dreadful start they have be beset by petty   scandal from the beginning they have destroy business confidence through a budget that be visibly unravel before our eye and only this week they have lose a cabinet minister to new revelation about a criminal conviction for fraud it be little wonder that the prime minister want a reset 
 the leader of the house ’s unwillingness to engage and to recognise and respond to question be arguably more important than any aspect of policy because it strike at the heart of the very idea of our parliamentary democracy it be a discourtesy indeed possibly even an insult to you mr speaker to all our colleague and their constituent and to this house it be make bad because the leader of the house be responsible for parliamentary business and procedure and should might think set an example of openness it be bad still for further reason because she herself have so often call for transparency from ministers and because a failure to be accountable be itself a breach of the rule of this house of the nolan principle and of the ministerial code of conduct that be quite a combination so i ask she whether she plan to continue as she have do or whether she will change this unfortunate habit and start to engage with the serious question that i have be ask 
 i put on record that tuesday be international day of persons with disability and note that the house of commons now have more disabled member than ever before i commend their contribution and look forward to work with they through the modernisation committee and with you mr speaker to make sure that this place and our politic be as accessible as they can be as have be mention this saturday be small business saturday when we celebrate the heart of all our high street in these session i like to hear about many of our constituent great cafés and in particular their bar especially when an invitation for i to visit follow 
 i also put on record my thank to you mr speaker for the way proceeding be handle last friday and to all of those who take part in the debate on assist dying or be in the chamber for it that debate be respectful consider and thoughtful whatever view we each take it be a moment when huge attention be on we and i think our democracy and our parliament show itself at its good 
 member will see that there be lot of important issue and much important business in the run up to christmas third of the bills that we announce in our king ’s speech be now make their way through parliament the rail franchising bill have receive royal assent the renters rights bill have complete committee and our important budget measure will soon be pass we be fix the foundation and get on with the job as have be note copy of the plan for change will be available in the vote office shortly ahead of the statement later today 
 it be another week and another misjudged and confused contribution from the shadow leader of the house he really do need to work out what the conservative strategy for opposition be be it to tell people across the country that they never have it so good as when the conservatives be in office or to learn from defeat and accept that they get thing wrong i gently advise they to listen to the voter because act as if they do nothing wrong and accept no responsibility will not   do they any good at all if the right hon gentleman do not want to take my advice perhaps he should listen to his own because he say that the conservative suffer from 
 many disastrous recent failure of policy and leadership 
 and i agree he say we inherit a struggle economy and anaemic growth i agree with that too i also agree with he when he be a champion of net and when he be financial secretary to the treasury he be right to care about economic stability i agree with he do he still agree with he i be not quite sure 
 the right hon gentleman ask about scrutiny of legislation and debate but i gently remind he that we have have many debate on the finance bill on the budget and the on the national insurance contribution bill which be come back to the house next week and before christmas i must remind he yet again i be afraid that he be financial secretary to the treasury when the national insurance contribution be raise not just on business but on worker he say that be a thoroughly conservative thing to do he be also a treasury minister when the minimum wage be raise he have have plenty of time to come to this house and explain why he think that be okay then but not okay now 
 the right hon gentleman raise the topic of the economy but he fail to mention of the big economic forecast out this week from the oecd which show that the uk be now forecast to be the fast grow european economy in the g7 over the next year he do not mention that when he be talk about the economy we have always be clear that growth only matter when ordinary people right around the country feel well off and see public service improve that be the difference between our economic plan and his 
 we have a plan for change the conservatives have yet to change they be yet to learn their own lesson we be lay out today how we will deliver our clear outcome the right hon gentleman might not like they because the conservatives fail on all their measure which be why they lose the election while he and the rest of his party shout from the sideline and try to rewrite history we be deliver the real change that the public vote for 
 my right hon friend know that on occasion this house can come to agreement about key piece of legislation in the last parliament such piece of legislation be the football governance bill will she give an update on its progress in this parliament and consider grant time for a debate on the sustainability of football 
 i be really pleased and proud that this government have bring back a strengthened football governance bill it be be consider in the house of lords the conservatives support it when they be in government but i have to say that the behaviour of conservative peer in the house of lords do not suggest that the conservatives be still in favour of it because they have table hundred of amendment to slow down progress of that important bill if they still care about put fan back at the heart of our football and make sure that we have a sustainable football industry in the future perhaps they should tell their colleague in the other place to pipe down 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 sadly it be difficult to deny that there have be many time in recent year when debate in this house have not be of the high quality when member have not show the public their good side and when dare i say some have perhaps lose a little of their sense of perspective as could be see in the way they conduct themselves but as the leader of the house have say the debate on the private member ’s bill last friday be entirely different it be measure respectful and consider member listen carefully intervene with important and pertinent point and show british democracy at its good in short it be something to be extremely proud of regardless of whether we agree with the outcome or not 
 party politic be largely keep out of that debate as mps be rightly give a free vote a vote of conscience on a consequential topic free vote should surely be grant when we be debate issue that transcend party political boundary and surely there can be no issue more important than ensure that our planet be still able to support human life 
 the climate and nature bill be a crucial cross party bill promote by my hon friend   the member for south cotswolds dr savage   with support from parliamentarian include labour mp and sponsor by mp from of the party that sit in the house indeed the bill be champion in the last parliament by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and for sheffield hallam olivia blake and even i understand by   the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband will the leader of the house ask the government to commit to a free vote on that crucial bill ’s reading on   january 
 i wholeheartedly agree with the hon member ’s representation of the house last friday and how we really do show ourselves at our very good i welcome the opportunity to work with she on the modernisation committee thing we be look at be how to ensure that back benchers can come together more often in the interest of what our constituent want we to be talk about and in the public interest 
 the hon member ask about the bill that will come before we early next year i be not quite sure of its status but i reassure she that the government be absolutely committed to be a clean energy superpower by many in the conservative party now want to change the target but we be committed to they and to the benefit they will bring not just to tackle climate change but to create the job of the future and make sure that we have low bill and energy security for the long run 
 in a cross party spirit i will say at this juncture that i see that the leader of the liberal democrats christmas song i be sure everyone will want to download it be rid high in the chart this week i hope that it will not be the same as his paddle boarding which get off to a great start and then fall flat on its face 
 rise 
 order can i say to the house that hopefully with quick question and short answer we can get through i want to make sure that we time the statement which be important to the house with the prime minister i be aim for about past or quarter past let we have a good example from jayne kirkham
