 i will look at all proposal but i think the hon gentleman know that underground cable cost to time more that be why the last government do not agree to they if part of our challenge be to cut bill for people that be not a sustainable solution for the future i be sympathetic to all mp who raise issue on behalf of their constituent but i gently say again to he that if we want to avoid a repeat of the cost of living crisis if we want to tackle the climate crisis and if we want energy security we will have to build the grid in our country 
 i wish to make it clear that i be once again waive the provision of the sub judice resolution in relation to this matter to allow member to be able to discuss fully these issue of national importance 
 urgent question i congratulate you on your re election mr speaker and thank you for grant this urgent question which be to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if he will make a statement on financial redress for sub postmaster and outstanding issue relate to the post office horizon scandal 
 i congratulate the shadow secretary of state on his new position and on secure the urgent question of this parliament 
 member will know that the government make a key manifesto commitment to ensure that justice and compensation be deliver as swiftly as possible for every postmaster catch up in the horizon scandal the secretary of state have already meet sir alan bates kevan jones and the chair of the post office nigel railton to discuss the progress be make and what more can be do the government intend to make a significant announcement on the new redress scheme before the summer recess this scheme will apply to postmaster whose conviction have be overturn by the post office horizon system offences act pass in the last parliament 
 i welcome the minister to his role i say in all sincerity that i wish he the very good of luck we on the opposition benches in the national interest wish the government to succeed it be vital that his department succeed in its brief when british business do well we all do well 
 i hope this urgent question on a matter on which the house have be in agreement will set we off on the right foot in work together in the national interest that matter be of course compensation for sub postmaster affect by the horizon scandal i be the previous post office minister and the house will know of my commitment and my party ’s commitment to the individual whose life have be tear apart by this scandal 
 it be right that the post office horizon system offences act receive royal assent during wash up to quash the conviction of hundred of affected postmaster but the minister will know that the act itself do not   provide compensation which be why alongside that legislation we announce plan for a new horizon conviction redress scheme this scheme will make compensation payment to those who have have conviction quash by the act 
 in government we ensure that royal assent be achieve as soon as possible so that there be no gap in the availability of compensation it be only right that postmaster have access to swift and fair compensation that be why we overturn those conviction those with overturn conviction have the option of immediately take a fixed and final offer of £ it be also why in government we change the rule for those in the horizon shortfall scheme so that they be entitle to a £ fix sum award bypass the assessment process so that all full and final settlement below that figure would be automatically top up and so that an appeal process for those in the hss be also consider 
 although i be pleased that as of   may approximately £ have be pay to over claimant across the scheme i must push the government for more detail on when the redress payment set out by the horizon conviction redress scheme can be expect we be tell that it would be by july i also note that the department for business and trade have say that it continue to work on the new horizon conviction redress scheme 
 i ask the minister—[interruption]—when will the scheme be up and run when do he expect the £ top up and the hss appeal process to be implement and the victim to be contact to that effect when will he open the scheme will he announce a date for full compensation under the horizon conviction redress scheme 
 order i gently say to the chamber that it be a new beginning and we want to start on the right foot not the wrong foot it be difficult to go from government to opposition but there be a minute limit for the opposition and a minute limit for the large party please let ’s stick to the rule and start as we mean to go on 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the shadow secretary of state set out the intent he have in government which we intend to carry on we also believe there be absolutely no reason why we should not continue to work on a cross party basis as we agree with he on the importance of deliver fast and fair compensation which be at the heart of all we be try to achieve we will be make a statement by the end of july before the summer recess as the shadow secretary of state have already note we have commit to do that we be work at pace with official victim and those who have be affect by the scandal to work up the detail and an announcement will be make in due course 
 it be good to see you back in your place mr speaker the new minister will recall the old saying that a new broom sweep clean and i be sure he will make progress very quickly indeed it seem to i that the post office scandal reveal a wide problem in british society whether it be orgreave grenfell contaminate blood or the problem at hillsborough the british establishment   seem incapable of listen to the voice of ordinary people will he raise that matter with other ministers and see whether there be a way for this government to ensure that be not repeat 
 my hon friend raise an interesting point in recent year we as member have reflect on the question of political accountability for decision that have be take and action that have take place over many year we will be reflect on how good to ensure there be genuine political accountability in the system 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i also welcome you back to your place mr speaker it be a genuine pleasure for i as the liberal democrat spokesperson to be address the house on behalf of the large political grouping my party will use the privilege of that position to hold the government and ministers to account we will not be use it simply to stoke division and manufacture grievance that be what the people of the united kingdom and scotland in particular vote for 
 at the heart of the horizon scandal be the culture at the centre of the organisation that fail to respect the work that be be do by sub postmaster at the frontline the minister and the secretary of state will meet with the chief executive of the post office what evidence have they see that that culture have actually change 
 i do not know if the right hon gentleman be aware that the current chief executive officer have step aside for a brief period to concentrate on the inquiry over the come month we will be reflect on the important question that the right hon gentleman raise particularly when the outcome of the inquiry be know 
 refer to the point raise by my hon friend   the member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett what role do the minister think this government can find for party organisation such as whistleblowersuk or those organisation that work with people to highlight such scandal as my hon friend point out this be a systematic failure across government and society and we simply can not allow it to happen again 
 my understanding be that the last government undertake a consultation on whistleblowing we be reflect on the outcome of that and on the important point my hon friend raise across a whole range of body in this country whistleblower have not be hear we need to consider whether the current legislation give they sufficient confidence to speak out and whether their action and concern be be address 
 many congratulation on your re election mr speaker i congratulate the minister on his appointment i know he be genuinely committed to   promote british business at home and abroad but be he aware of a serious issue flow from the horizon scandal that be now affect current postmaster in order to express their disgust at what have happen in relation to horizon some member of the public be not use the post office in the way they do previously will he and the government commit to promote the view that the post office be safe to use because the scandal have be resolve and because use post office be good for the community 
 i be concerned to hear about such incident it should go without say that the postmaster be not the one who should take the opprobrium of the public on this matter they be do a fantastic job they hold community together and provide a public service we should celebrate that and encourage people to use their facility as much as possible if the right hon gentleman have specific example of postmaster receive abuse or people be discourage to use their service because of the scandal i would be interested to hear about they 
 it be a delight to see you back in the chair mr speaker there be many sub postmaster and mistress who be not convict but who be seriously out of pocket due to the shortfall that they themselves make up and deeply traumatise by the experience that they go through can the minister provide reassurance that the department will seek to ensure that they be support and that the compensation scheme be swift effective but also very straightforward for they 
 i thank the right hon member for her question those be the principle that we want to address and carry on with from the previous government the system should be fair swift and simple we know that postmaster have already go through an incredibly difficult time we do not want to make it even hard by have a convoluted system we absolutely agree that justice should be fair quick complete and straightforward for people 
 beyond compensation of the most important thing that campaigner be look for be consequence for those people who play a part in the creation of this scandal the prime minister have make much about the integrity and accountability of his government presumably that be retrospective what consequence do the minister envisage for those current serve government ministers who be deem by the inquiry to have be negligent in their conduct in ministerial office in the past 
 that be a very important question it would be premature of we to draw conclusion before the inquiry have be complete but absolutely we should be look very carefully at all those individual whose behaviour unfortunately lead to the scandal happen and to it take far too long to address that be a matter for the inquiry to make recommendation on and certainly we will be look to follow those up 
 i welcome the minister to his place i know that he be vociferous on this issue when he be on the opposition back benches so i have absolutely no doubt that he will deliver on it 
 some postmaster implicate in the scandal in northern ireland be worried and concerned it be imperative that all postmaster feel that they can have an open and frank discussion with no fear of repercussion in the upcoming investigation and there can be no far unwarranted delay can the minister confirm that as a priority he will make sure that postmaster have access at every level to ensure that their concern be address and that he will make every effort to take step in the right direction thank you so much mr speaker 
 i do not see why that point should have come last laughter 
 what a surprise to see the hon member in his place today i be sure that this will not be last time that we have an exchange across the dispatch box but he do raise an important point we absolutely agree that we need to make it as easy as possible for postmaster to raise their concern and to get the justice that they have so long wait for 
 i congratulate you mr speaker on your return to your place and the minister on take up his appointment 
 compensation be part of this but what victim of this scandal such as betty whom i meet want to see be truth and accountability i be refer not just to ministers to whom my right hon friend   the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse   refer but to those involve in the scandal what can the minister say to people in the post office and to betty who want to see those responsible in the post office properly hold to account as well as the compensation for their suffering

 i congratulate you mr speaker on your unanimous re election to the chair and your triumphant victory in chorley with of the vote clearly we can all learn a great deal from you about how to win election i look forward to work with you and i hope learn from your very long experience of this house congratulation to all colleague elect on   july include those opposition members who have to work so hard to survive what be an electoral tsunami of biblical proportion i especially congratulate those on both side of the house who be elect for the time it be a huge honour to serve in this house 
 my particular congratulation go to   the right hon member for manchester central lucy powell   on her appointment as leader of the house i hope that she have have the opportunity to practise wield a sword for   several hour and wear an embroider cape with panache her predecessor penny mordaunt be an expert at do both thing when look at the hansard of previous exchange i notice that in the final business question of the last parliament the shadow leader of the house as she be then pay tribute to penny ’s renowne formidable blow dry haircut i can only apologise to the house for my own short back and side be nothing in comparison i know colleague on both side of the house will miss penny wish she well and hope she return here before too long i thank the house staff and clerks for their work welcome new member and the leader of the house for the collegiate approach she have take in our private discussion so far 
 however of course these exchange be an opportunity to raise question about house business and the associated conduct of government although the new government be less than week old there be already some question i would like to raise 
 the government have announce with no reference at all to parliament that the rwanda scheme enable by bills that this house pass have be scrap the scheme have be due to start next week and would have provide a deterrent to illegal immigration across the channel we have see deterrent of that kind work elsewhere since this government come into office more than people have illegally and dangerously cross the channel with tragically die these crossing be unnecessary france be safe when will the government come to the house to explain the change of policy and will there be any vote on it 
 move on accord to press report the energy secretary decide last week to cancel all new application for oil and gas licence in the north sea if true that will increase energy price and make we more dependent on potentially unreliable foreign gas import why do the government not come to the house to explain the new policy and will there be a vote on it 
 the chancellor give a speech last week on housing and planning during which the housing secretary and deputy prime minister simply sit and listen in rather uncharacteristic silence the chancellor announce that green belt protection will be scrap or as she euphemistically put it the green belt will be rebrande as the grey belt rename whole swathe of green belt as grey belt be a piece of shameless spin that would make even peter mandelson blush when will the government come to the house to explain their plan for the removal of green belt protection 
 the chancellor also make some outlandish claim about the economy and public finance the economy be in fact in fantastic condition inflation—[interruption yes it be member should listen inflation be down to low than in the eurozone and the united states wage growth in contrast be much high at unemployment be low at half the level leave behind by the previous labour government and the uk ’s economic growth so far this year be the high in the g7 
 i understand that the chancellor might make a statement at some point to the house on these topic will the leader of the house confirm that any claim about public finance make in this house will be accompany by a full office for budget responsibility    forecast so we can be sure that any such claim be not simply be concoct by the chancellor as a pretext for tax rise 
 mr speaker i have list several major policy announcement make in the past day with no reference to parliament at all you quite rightly say to the previous government on many occasion that major policy announcement should be make when parliament be sit and to the house i would welcome your assistance in ensure that the new government adhere to those principle finally then i ask the leader of the house to make a commitment now that all major policy announcement will be make only when the house be sit as the speaker previously request and to this house of commons where elect member from all party can ask question include the or so newly elect labour members who i be sure want to ask question as well i would be very grateful if she would confirm that 
 order i think the problem be that people ’s comment ought to reflect their previous job as well maybe that comment be from knowledge about make statement outside the house i do not know i do not make any judgment the right hon gentleman be absolutely correct that when the house be not sit of course statement will be make by the government but when the house be sit i expect they to be make in the house that have be a very clear message and the leader of the house and i be both work to ensure that statement be hear here i certainly take the point on board but i do not want to be draw into what we should or should not be do in the future i welcome the ability to clarify the position 
 thank you very much mr speaker 
 i start by thank his majesty the king for yesterday ’s speech and join colleague in wish her majesty the queen a happy birthday for yesterday i also thank the staff and security service who have work so hard both to get parliament ready for the king ’s speech and on the huge task of transition from the last parliament to this with so many new member and so many leaving 
 the election see worrying incident include harassment and the sharing of misinformation and disinformation it be unacceptable that some feel unable to go out campaigning and our democracy depend on our come together to say so but we also see the good of our democracy the rapid changeover of power when people choose change 
 may i thank you mr speaker for your leadership on mps security i know that that be your top and most urgent priority may i also congratulate you on your re election you be always fair and consider and always put member interest today might be the big test of whether you know the name of all the new member 
 no test please 
 we both share a strong commitment to uphold the role of parliament and as we have just discuss to restore respect that include ministers make major announcement in the house when it be sit rest assure i will be robust on that and i expect to see ministers and secretaries of state at the   dispatch box over the come day as we play catch up on the period in which the house be not sit thank you for your forbearance on that mr speaker 
 i welcome all new and return member to this parliament it be a parliament to be proud of and that reflect our country well than ever before there be more woman than ever more member from ethnic minority background and more member from the lgbt community it have be a real pleasure to see the excitement and possibility of new member over half the house be new as they find their way around this often baffle maze of a place i see that have describe it as be like fresher week meet hogwarts and buckingham palace let we hope that they do not all drop down with fresher flu 
 we lose some good colleague from all side at the election i pay tribute to my predecessor penny mordaunt who be always a worthy opponent across the dispatch box she bring a fresh approach not only to this role but as the female defence secretary i always think that she be an underused asset for the conservative party and she will be miss especially by the parliamentary hairdresser 
 i welcome the shadow leader of the house   the right hon member for croydon south chris philp to his new role i know that he have always be keen after hold very many ministerial role i congratulate he on finally make it as a full member of the cabinet albeit with the word shadow before his title i hope that the role live up to his ambition debate about leak roof broken toilet and the price of a bacon butty in the members dining room all await his close attention i be keen to work with he and we have already have constructive discussion i be clear that i want to take the whole house with we on the change that we need to make 
 however we need to turn the page recent year have be plague by scandal bad behaviour disrespect poor standard and poor legislation that be what next week ’s motion on a modernisation committee and on job be about for the house to work together to drive up standard improve work practice and find reform to make parliament more effective let we be clear it be not about change the tradition and custom of this place i know that you will be pleased to hear that mr speaker but the country vote for change we will be a government of service and begin that journey of restore trust in politic and parliament action not word that be why we have hit the ground run by establish the national wealth fund resetting relation with junior doctor and dentist launch the border security command end the ban on new onshore wind take immediate action on the prison crisis restore house building target and start to tackle the water crisis the list go on 
 the shadow leader of the house ask about the economic record house building and the rwanda plan i gently say to he that after such a resounding conservative defeat at the ballot box i do not think that his good advice be to start say that their record be actually great all along or that their policy be the good one for we to follow on the economic record the truth be that living standard fall over the last parliament for the time on record he be chief secretary to the treasury when former prime minister liz truss crash the economy send mortgage rate   soar since we have come into government we have discover that thing be even bad than we think interruption the conservatives do not like it but i be afraid it be true the country—[interruption 
 order leader of the house 
 the country vote resoundingly for change because it be bad off so the conservative party would be well advise to look deeply at why it lose rather than claim that people never have it so good 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the rwanda plan the record speak for itself volunteer be all that scheme achieve and far from stop the boat or act as a deterrent the government preside over the high number of small boat crossing on record it be an expensive gimmick that will not work and the home secretary will update the house on that matter in the usual way very soon the energy secretary will update the house today on his plan for a clean energy superpower 
 the right hon gentleman also ask about house building and planning we make no apology we be unashamedly pro house building we have already restore the target that his government take away and will be bring in planning reform to make sure that the country get the new home it need 
 the king ’s speech show that the government be get on with the job with of the most ambitious programme ever of an incoming government follow through on commitment on thing like the hillsborough law and martyn ’s law which the last government fail to do and put rocket booster under growth the guide light will be deliver on our mission yesterday be an historic moment the legislative programme from a labour government in year we have a mandate for change the journey towards that change have begin and i look forward to work with member across the house to get on with that job

 another issue that must be urgently address be our commitment to reach net the report publish today by the climate change committee make clear that the day of u turn on climate commitment and dilute environmental target must come to an end only a of the emission reduction require to achieve our target be currently cover by credible plan the liberal democrats be commit to the bold urgent action need to tackle climate change cut energy bill and create hundred of thousand of secure well pay job the conservative lack of ambition relinquish our place as a global environmental leader with cop29 nearing the uk have a golden opportunity to turbocharge global climate change policy

 i know that part of the liberal democrat mandate at the election be about clean up our politic and turn the page and this election certainly demand action on that so i hope we can realise some of that together i work closely with the hon lady ’s colleague   the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain   on risk base exclusion in the last parliament and i look forward to have a constructive relationship with she on those issue as well 
 the hon lady raise a few issue we absolutely share the liberal democrats concern about the social care crisis in this country and we be determined to get a grip on that we know that care be not always available or of the quality that people deserve and we be determined that everybody should have access to dignified independent support in life in the king ’s speech we announce action in the employment bill on establish a fair pay agreement in the adult social care sector and we look forward to work together on some of those issue

 i welcome the hon lady she to her place and congratulate she on survive the tsunami that i be afraid take out some of her colleague she raise a very important matter department for environment food and rural affairs oral have not yet be timetable so the subject would make a good candidate for an adjournment debate application should she want to do that in the meantime i will get she a response on the government ’s plan for flood defence

 public library be a vital hub for community across the nation provide important space for drop in session internet connectivity read book and so much more yet in my local authority of stockport borough the local liberal democrat council be reduce staff hour in our library a move that threaten to leave many adult and child isolate and without access to critical service as such will the leader of the house allow a debate in government time on our treasured public library 
 i thank my hon friend for his good wish and for that important question library and access to they play a vital role in our community support local people and child with their education i be afraid that the previous government hollow out local government funding over their year in office they promise level up but in fact we get year and year of cut i will make sure that the culture secretary have hear my hon friend ’s question and supply he with a reply 
 mr speaker congratulation on your re election i welcome the leader of the house most sincerely to her position i always think business question be the most illuminating and refreshing part of the week ’s business 
 of the most pressing piece of business that we consider prior to the general election be of course the compensation scheme for those infect and impact by the infected blood scandal can we have an urgent statement to detail the government ’s progress in ensure that the compensation scheme be put in place and their progress towards the creation of the infected blood compensation authority victim be still die weekly and i be certain that the leader of the house will want to do everything possible to ensure that these matter be address as quickly as possible 
 i thank the hon member for that question he and i both know after sit through these session in the last parliament that the infected blood scandal be probably the single big issue raise in business question it be absolutely important that we take action and follow through on the commitment that have be give i assure he that there will be an update to the   house at the early possible opportunity on the government ’s progress in deal with the compensation scheme 
 i welcome the leader of the house to her place will she join i in congratulate the business lead group which be celebrate the many positive of work in grimsby and cleethorpes could we have time to debate the importance of our town centre and the ongoing need for high street regeneration and to recognise the dire impact on local economy of delay repair to infrastructure such as corporation bridge in my constituency

 the last conservative government provide £ of funding for the western link road to complete the orbital route around norwich but during the election campaign i be concerned to hear rumour that labour might axe it can the leader of the house provide a statement quickly to give reassurance to the people of broadland and fakenham and norfolk more widely that this much need infrastructure will continue 
 i be sure this be an important matter for the hon member ’s constituent i do not have the answer today but i note that transport oral will be come at some point soon i will therefore get he a response from the transport secretary and if that be not forthcoming i be sure he will apply for a debate in the usual way 
 congratulation on your re election mr speaker some of child in my liverpool riverside constituency be live in poverty nearly in and i be sure that the leader of the house agree that that be unacceptable while i welcome the prime minister ’s announcement yesterday of the taskforce it do not mention the removal of the child cap will the leader of the house grant parliamentary time to discuss the removal of the child cap and deal with child poverty 
 i know the issue be close to my hon friend ’s heart as an incoming labour government we be absolutely committed to tackle child poverty and all the root cause of child poverty that be why the prime minister announce the government taskforce look at these matter yesterday we be clear in our manifesto that the economic circumstance do not currently allow for we to abolish the cap economic stability be the single big thing we can do to ensure that child do not fall into poverty because when the economy crash it be the poor in society who pay the heavy price i think my hon friend have table some amendment to   the loyal address and i sure she will have ample opportunity to debate they over the come day of the king ’s speech debate 
 my local council in south staffordshire and dudley work hard on local plan to provide the new housing that my constituent will need over the come decade in the light of the alarming government briefing on their planning reform can we have a debate in government time on how we can make sure that democratically draw up local plan be respect and that the green belt safeguard by those local plan remain protect 
 i think the hon member may misunderstand the policy in this area this government have make it clear that we be unashamedly pro house building we have to tackle the housing crisis in this country and meet the target of new home over the course of this parliament and i think that his party also pledge to deliver that target in the election campaign as he know the conservatives in government withdraw the house building target which then reduce figure what we be not propose here be a developer free for all this be about good sensible clear local plan be draw together and then expedite with thing move more quickly i can reassure he on that but frankly we will take no lecture from the opposition on deal with the housing crisis 
 when it come to child with special educational need child who have experience trauma in their childhood or child with anxiety local authority carry all the risk but do not have the resource our academy system be out of control and our health service be insufficient can we have a debate on child who experience such challenge in their early year to ensure that we address this issue early on in this government 
 may i welcome my hon friend back to her place she be always vocal and commit in the last parliament and i have no doubt she will be so again in this parliament as she rightly point out our education and care system be not meet the need of child with special educational need often leave they without the support they need to thrive that be of the issue be tackle in our child ’s wellbee bill announce by his majesty the king yesterday as she will have hear this morning there will be a debate on education in the business next week 
 immediately prior to dissolution the excellent backbench business committee have grant a debate in the chamber to discuss the performance of southern water i know that the right hon lady will want to respond about sewage but in fact the debate be to be about its failure to deliver clean water to significant part of my constituency in addition to its failure on sewage will she please reassure i that in the absence of the backbench business committee and the petitions committee the government will find time for back benchers to bring forward important issue that we wish to debate in the chamber 
 the right hon lady be a fantastic strong voice in the chamber i welcome she and the naughty corner back to their place albeit on the other side of the house she make an important point about an important debate which i shall certainly pass on in the absence of backbench business debate we have and will continue to table general debate and there will be availability for westminster hall debate in the usual way as well 
 this week the new minister of state for education visit my constituency to look at the excellent work be do by the london ambulance service in its education centre and in particular the apprenticeship that it offer which have open up opportunity to people who would not normally have access to that route include military veteran will the leader of the house look to find time to debate apprenticeship particularly with an eye to scheme like this and how might broaden opportunity 
 i welcome my hon friend to his place with his election as the member for west ham and beckton i be sure that he will be a strong mp for that new constituency he raise an important point deal with apprenticeship and apprenticeship reform i hope that the announcement yesterday in the king ’s speech of the new skills england body send a signal of how important this issue be for the government in deliver on our mission for growth and deliver opportunity for all he will have notice that we have an education debate timetable for next week where he can raise the matter 
 throughout my time in the house i have campaign for improved transport connection to serve my constituency which at that time be cleethorpes such campaign be the restoration of the train service from cleethorpes through grimsby and lincoln to kings cross the previous transport secretary have approve that service and i understand that it be now with network rail and lner to complete the necessary arrangement may we have a statement from the new transport secretary confirm that that service will indeed begin in the winter timetable 
 the hon member raise a good point he and i have discuss transport issue and i support his call for great transport infrastructure investment across our region and especially in the north which i be afraid be distinctly lack under the previous government i will raise that matter with the transport secretary and i have no doubt that she will come before the house in due course as i say in the business statement she will bring forward a bill the week after next and he could raise those issue then if he have not hear from she before 
 may i congratulate you mr speaker on your re election my constituency have a large number of village and a rural contingent while i welcome the announcement yesterday in the king ’s speech i wonder whether there be further information about how we will deal with flooding and in particular the flood resilience taskforce although we be in the summer we will fast approach the winter
