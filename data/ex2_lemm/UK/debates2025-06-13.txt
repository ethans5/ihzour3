object 
 the deputy speaker interrupt the business standing order no 11(2 
 bill to be far consider on   friday june 
 i rise to speak in favour of new clause which clarify that an assisted death would not be classify as an unnatural death and that a full coroner ’s inquest would not normally be require 
 my constituent antony shackleton live with motor neurone disease for long year as his condition worsen his option narrow until there be only choice that preserve his dignity autonomy and peace to travel to dignitas in switzerland and end his suffering on his own term louise as his wife of year and someone who have know he since the age of do what any love partner would do she stand by he she help he on to that plane and hold his hand through the most difficult decision of their life and now for that act of love she be under police investigation 
 that be precisely why we need new clause if the bill be pass assist dying would be a legal strictly regulate and monitor choice make by the individual concern 
 i rise to support a number of new clause and amendment to the bill the common thread run through all of they be a need to address some of the gap in the safeguard and oversight should the bill pass i at least want to ensure that we improve its protection and remove some of the risk that it contain 
 new clause require the chief medical officer to monitor the operation of the legislation rather than depend solely on the assist die commissioner alongside the requirement for a high court judge oversight by the cmo be remove during the committee stage this mean that essentially the assist die commissioner would mark their own homework new clause return the safeguard of independent oversight which be sensible give the significant concern express by many expert and organisation which be often neutral on the principle but concerned about the bill they include the royal college of psychiatrists the association for palliative medicine the british geriatrics society the royal college of physicians and many expert such as professor james monckton smith a lead criminologist baroness finlay parliament ’s lead expert on palliative care sir david haslam former head of the british medical association and of the national institute for health and care excellence my previous employer and many more all have express concern even when neutral on the principle of the adequacy of the bill 
 hence new clause require an annual report to include 
 information about the application of the act in relation to 
 person who have protect characteristic and 
 any other description of person specify in regulation make by the secretary of state 
 i fervently hope that that include domestic violence victim 
 amendment very sensibly add the requirement that the commissioner appointment be not the sole remit of the prime minister at the time by require the consent of the health and social care committee this provide a safeguard against ideological and politically motivated appointment and i would be very critical of anyone who would want to prevent that 
 amendment address the significant concern about the involvement of private for profit provider of assist dying there be concern that when there be a commercial relationship between provider there will be a gaming of the system that risk compromise the relationship between the co ordinating doctor and the independent doctor likewise the existence of such provider do not allay concern about doctor shopping as be raise in the previous debate hence amendment will require private provider to be transparent and provide report on service member service number cost and revenue 
 in previous debate and in the public discourse i have find it very disconcert that in response to legitimate concern all that we have be offer as we have see today be some promise unspecified future regulation that will fix the gap—[hon member hear hear 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private

 it be a privilege to open today ’s debate and to present to the house the amendment table in my name a number of which relate to issue that i promise to return to when they be raise in committee all amendment in my name have be draft with technical advice and expertise from civil servant from the department of health and social care and the ministry of justice along with the brilliant government legal department and the office of the parliamentary counsel in order to make the bill workable and to give coherence to the statute book as confirm by the minister for care my hon friend   the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock and the minister for courts and legal services my hon and learn friend   the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman in their recent letter to mps some be technical and draft amendment and all be there to strengthen the bill so i hope that colleague will be able to support they wherever they stand on the principle of assist dying 
 i know that many colleague wish to speak today so i will endeavour to speak with brevity i will speak to the new clause that stand in my name start with new clause this important new clause and the related amendment would create a regulatory framework and safeguard around the approve substance refer to in the bill by impose a duty to make regulation about those substance and a power to make regulation about device for use in connection with their self administration 
 amendment provide that the regulation relate to approve substance would be subject to the affirmative procedure mean that they must be lay before parliament and approve by resolution of both houses provide important parliamentary oversight these measure ensure that the substance use in assist dying be subject to a specific and appropriate regulatory regime 
 i be genuinely look for clarification as a former cabinet minister in the scottish government i jealously guard the devolution settlement i wonder how the extension of some of these clause to include scotland will be interpret what conversation have take place between my hon friend scotland ’s lord advocate and the scottish government 
 i have take legal advice from government official to ensure that devolution be respect at every stage in proceeding where legislation that affect other jurisdiction need to be amend those conversation have already start and will continue 
 will the hon lady give way 
 no i be go to make some progress if that be okay 
 the substance that would be use would not be new substance as we know assist dying be available in many other jurisdiction and there be substance that have be use safely and in some case for many year their safety and efficacy have be prove around the world but they do need to be treat differently which be the purpose of new clause 
 will the hon lady give way 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be go to make some progress 
 however it be most likely that these product be already license for other purpose they could well be regulate through the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and within the human medicines regulations for the purpose of the bill but it be important that time be give 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will 
 as an operating department practitioner with more than year of experience i emphasise that control and administer drug be already a key part of every healthcare professional ’s practice medicine    management be at the front and centre of everything we do when handle drug do my hon friend agree that the safeguard add to this bill along with the exist framework be more than adequate to deal with this 
 i thank my hon friend for share her expertise along with other colleague with medical background who have work with i on this amendment 
 rise 
 give what you have say mr speaker i will make some progress interruption a lot of members wish to speak today 
 i now turn to new clause and amendment the new clause impose a duty to make regulation prohibit advertising of service relate to voluntary assist dying this issue be discuss in committee follow an amendment table by   the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin it be propose that there should be no advertising of assist die service i agree and there be a consensus on that in the committee there be some issue with the previous amendment ’s workability so i give a commitment to return to the matter on report hence the inclusion of this new clause amendment provide that regulation under new clause would be subject to the affirmative procedure provide parliamentary oversight 
 on the evidential basis on page of today ’s edition of the times there be a story about a gentleman who be bear in south africa and live in australia he have come to london this week for this particular bill in order to give his story he be diagnose with pancreatic cancer and tell he have only week to live he live for year and month and he be still live there be a grow evidential basis he say that he be never afraid to die but he say that he be afraid of the process of dying and the hon lady be the initiator of that will she acknowledge the evidential basis and the importance of this subject do she realise that the evidential basis against this bill be grow 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the intervention although i be not sure that it be relevant to the banning of advertising for assisted die service which i will try to stay focused on 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be afraid that i be go to have to make some progress base on the number of member who wish to speak today 
 i thank   the hon member for west worcestershire and the hon member for reigate rebecca paul   for work with i on amendment and i be very pleased that they support it 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will not sorry 
 new clause and amendment make change to the coroners and justice act that the bill would necessitate they would insert a new clause into the act to provide that death that occur in accordance with the bill will be certify by an attend practitioner and medical examiner and will not be subject to a coronial investigation 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be afraid not 
 coroner investigate suspicious or violent death or situation in which the cause of death be unknown assisted death would not fall into these category and there would therefore be no need for a default coronial investigation this will ensure that any unnecessary delay and distress for bereaved family be avoid these be not unexpected death sadly they be inevitable 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will not i be afraid 
 it be the manner and timing of their death about which the patient will make a legal inform choice have be thoroughly assess as professor aneez esmail have say i can not think of any death that would be the subject of great scrutiny in advance of the person die than an assisted death the process far exceed the level of safeguarding that be in place for many of the death that be at present routinely review by medical examiner and not refer to a coroner of course anyone can report a death include an assisted death to the coroner or indeed to the police if they have any concern that it be not carry out in accordance with the act and if any offence have be commit they will be investigate 
 subsection of new clause require that the medical certificate of cause of death must state the death as an assisted death but it must also record the illness or disease that cause the person to be terminally ill and enable they to receive assistance under the act this be really important for datum collection and monitoring in jurisdiction with similar legislation around of patient have some form of cancer and the new clause would ensure that datum be collect not only in relation to how many people access assisted dying but in relation to the terminal illness that make they eligible 
 i now turn to new clause which relate to the guidance about the operation of the act include with respect to devolution put simply new clause ensure that the right rule and responsibility sit with the right people it place the obligation to issue guidance with the secretary of state secondly it enable welsh ministers to issue guidance on devolved matter the secretary of state must consult the chief medical officer in order to have the benefit of their expertise which be also really important new clause also add a provision that ensure that the secretary of state must consult people with learn disability and people with protect characteristic which include disability race religion and belief 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be go to make some progress i be afraid 
 the secretary of state must also consult provider of health and care service include palliative and end of life care i be really pleased that hospice uk be support this amendment it be very important that those voice be hear the secretary of state can also consult anyone else they feel to be appropriate create a flexible and holistic approach 
 turn to devolution this long overdue reform would apply to england and wales which share a criminal justice system health be a devolved matter of course and i have recognise from the outset that the legislation must respect devolution i be fully commit to observe the same convention that the government would if this be a government bill i have work with uk government official to ensure that the right step be take at the right time by the right people i have engage with colleague in the welsh government i meet the welsh health minister in cardiff and there have be ongoing detailed discussion between the team of government official to ensure the workability of the legislation in both jurisdiction in line with the devolution settlement 
 amendment to also ensure that the devolution settlement be respect and adhere to i thank   the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts   and   the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green not only for their diligent work on the bill committee but for work with i on the amendment in relation to wales and i thank the welsh government for their guidance and support i hope that colleague across the house can support these new clause and amendment 
 i now turn to new clause which make specific provision about the use of the welsh language the conversation that happen at the end of a person ’s life be extremely personal and should be handle with the utmost sensitivity it be very important that they be conduct in the good interest of the patient and a big part of that be use clear communication in this respect language matter so if a patient in wales have welsh as their or preferred language all effort should be make to ensure they can communicate with voluntary assist die service in welsh i commit to this in committee and have make good on that commitment 
 turn to amendment and as with any bill it be important that the amend legislation secure overall coherence with the statute book as such the clause relate to medicine advertising and employment protection amend or confer power to amend other legislation that currently extend to part of the uk of course this do not mean the provision of assist dying but for example they extend the prohibition on advertising to the whole of the uk and apply the employment protection in the bill to scotland that be in line with the guidance i have receive from legal expert and as such i hope all colleague can support these amendment if the bill pass i will if necessary work with other devolved administration in the same way as i have work with the welsh government to ensure that devolution be respect 
 that conclude the explanation of the amendment table in my name many colleague be keen to speak so i be not go to comment on all the amendment in the group i will just make comment about amendment that be not in my name and allow other people plenty of time to speak 
 amendment table by my hon friend   the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee would not only try to remove the backstop for the provision of assist dying in england but create a number of other issue in relation to commencement if parliament choose to give this choice to terminally ill people there can not be a clause in the bill that would prevent that from be available as soon as it be safe and practicable but the amendment would remove the year backstop it would also prevent the appointment of the voluntary assist die commissioner and create a potential commencement gap between england and wales give that i have be strongly advise that the amendment would create serious workability issue i urge colleague who want an operable bill to join i in reject the amendment 
 to finish i be pleased to support amendment table by   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson i thank she for her engagement with the bill and the amendment which would require the secretary of state to prepare and publish an assessment of the availability quality and distribution of palliative and end of life care as part of the report on the implementation of the act mirror the assessment already require as part of the year review 
 although the bill seek to address what in some respect be a very specific issue in term of the failing of the current law it have become part of a much need broad conversation about death die and end of life care we all have our own experience of death loss and grief and we do not talk about they enough i be really pleased that the bill have lead to many conversation up and down the country whatever our view that have to be a positive thing 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i have nearly finish 
 i have have many such conversation over recent month with those who support the amendment include with palliative care doctor nurse hospice staff gps hospice uk and marie curie i thank they all for their constructive engagement with the bill i can not imagine that anyone in this place be not truly grateful for the outstanding work do every day by the wonderful people work in palliative and end of life care in every of our constituency many of we if not most of we will have personal experience of the kindness and compassion that those people have show to our own family and friend 
 but this be not an either or conversation palliative and end of life care and assist dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patient the care and choice that they deserve in their final day just as there should not be an either or for die people there should also not be an either or for we as legislator in have to choose between support assist dying or other end of life choice that be why i be support amendment    to ensure that in this place we channel our energy into support all option available to terminally ill people something that i have always commit to do 
 it be a privilege to be call at this stage in the debate my principal reason for vote against the bill on reading be my concern that vulnerable people would be put at risk i agree to serve on the bill committee to do what i could to allay my concern about that issue and address some of the issue raise by other i do not think that the revised version of the bill properly or completely reflect the concern express on a multitude of different occasion consequently it do not fully mitigate the risk to vulnerable group 
 we all recognise that decision making of any kind do not take place in a vacuum and that in all part of life we live in a particular context the equality act recognise that many people face discrimination or unfair treatment as a result of particular characteristic and that reasonable step should be take to eliminate that it be very clear from the oral evidence session that particular care have to be take to assess the context within which people be make the decision to seek an assisted death if they suffer from a mental illness or eat disorder if they be from a low income or ethnic minority background if they suffer from a disability or if they be in an abusive relationship those factor be likely to lead to an increase risk that someone will seek an assisted death that they would not have seek if those factor be not present 
 in committee i and other make the point that it would have be desirable to have receive an equality impact assessment before the detailed work of committee scrutiny have begin so that committee member have a sense of how the propose legislation would impact group that we know can suffer disproportionate level of disadvantage 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will not if that be okay 
 we be tell that it be not practical to produce such an assessment until after committee stage as it would be necessary to assess the impact of amendment make in committee 
 the equality impact assessment be finally publish week ago i have to say that i be pretty astounded it do not recognise that certain group in this country may have their life prematurely shorten as a result of this legislation instead it concern itself with the barrier that vulnerable people may face when try to access assist dying i find that astonishing do the people who draft the assessment not hear the speech of   the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi   on reading she speak with passion about how the underlie inequality in access to healthcare experience by those from black and minority ethnic background would be exacerbate if the bill pass unamended do they not listen to the oral evidence that dr jamilla hussain give to the bill committee she talk about her experience of work    with racialise community in bradford and their fear of be push disproportionately towards an assist die pathway do they not listen to the testimony of dr miro griffiths on the experience and concern   of disabled people testimony that have be echo   by baroness tanni grey thompson and the actress   liz carr 
 i find it inexplicable that the framing of the impact on vulnerable people should be the removal of barrier to access assist dying and not as it should be the increase risk to their health and wellbee that the bill present i be concerned that we be think about the impact on vulnerable people solely with reference to those who be suffer a terminal illness with less than month to live we be not think about the impact on wide society of introduce a concept of life not be worth live and how that might disproportionately affect our more vulnerable community 
 my new clause and consequential new schedule and amendment seek to ensure that a comprehensive range of statistic be collect about those who seek and receive an assisted death so that proper and complete monitoring of request can be carry out it be imperative that we get the most detailed possible picture of who be request an assisted death so that any pattern of disproportionality can be properly detect and address 
 what assurance do the bill give to the family of people with a disability or those with mental health issue and those who be anorexic i do not see any do the hon lady see any assurance for those who want to end their life but suffer from those ailment 
 i welcome that intervention i speak extensively about the bill ’s impact on anorexic people and i be not satisfied that those concern have be address 
 i be pleased to support amendment table by my good friend colleague and constituency neighbour my hon friend   the member for twickenham munira wilson which have attract support from across the house it would require the secretary of state to report on the impact that the act have have on the healthcare available to those with palliative and end of life care need i be really pleased that   the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater   have agree to accept the amendment 
 i be also pleased to support amendment and in the name of my other constituency neighbour my hon friend   the member for wimbledon mr kohler they seek to make all statutory instrument make under the act subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure as it stand the act will come into force in year time with no further scrutiny by mp yet a whole host of issue that have be delegate to the secretary of state or have not even be consider will need to be legislate for after royal assent as the bill stand the only way for parliament to scrutinise those power will be to call for a minute debate on a motion that can not be amend and will be vote on only if the leader of the opposition call for a vote make statutory instrument subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure would mean that the secretary of state whoever that be can exercise the power delegate to they only with the    approval of parliament for an issue as sensitive and profound as assist dying i believe that to be an appropriate level of scrutiny 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i be sorry but i will make some progress 
 in a similar vein i plan to support the amendment in the name of   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat which seek to remove all henry viii power from the bill and from the amendment introduce by the hon member for spen valley i will support the right hon member ’s amendment if they be select for a vote as i do not believe that the use of henry viii power be appropriate or necessary 
 i want to speak against amendment in the name of the hon member for spen valley it appear to be innocuous but in reality it would reverse the effect of an amendment that i have accept in committee the bill as originally draft would create an enormous constitutional minefield it seek to amend the criminal law of england and wales which be a reserved matter for the uk parliament and simultaneously to make provision for healthcare which be a matter devolve to the senedd in wales the senedd debate a motion call on the welsh government to support the principle of assist dying but it be defeat by vote to the motion be non binding but the bill give the uk parliament the power to impose on the senedd in wales a measure that it have expressly say it do not want the bill as amend in committee would give the senedd the power to decide for itself when it be ready to bring the bill into force 
 amendment would reverse that provision and deprive the senedd of the right to exercise its legitimate power it be not just that the amendment would restore the constitutional loophole that the committee have close it threaten to create real problem and risk for welsh citizen if the senedd be force to implement the bill before its devolve healthcare system be ready i urge fellow member to have regard to the committee ’s decision and vote against amendment 
 i will briefly speak in favour of a couple of other amendment i remain highly concerned at the idea of a future secretary of state have the power to change the national health service act specifically section which set out the purpose for which the nhs exist by use regulation instead of an act parliament once that power exist it can be use not once but at any time to make fundamental change to what our nhs be for i be dismay to see a change of this magnitude make to the bill in committee and i will vote for amendment in the name of   the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh to reverse it 
 amendment in the name of   the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee seek to remove the automatic commencement of this bill after year for the vast majority of act of parliament the secretary of state decide when to bring the key provision into force rather than it happen automatically the effect of the provision of this bill be that even if we have a covid pandemic or the secretary of state realise   that the adequate training have not yet be complete it will still come into force come what may after year that be not safe it be unusual and reckless and for that reason i support amendment 
 amendment in the name of   the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson would require the appointment of the new voluntary assisted die commissioner to be approve by the health and social care committee the commissioner a role create from scratch will be a high profile influential and important position add a layer of approval would add more rigour to the appointment process and provide transparency in the event of any problem that arise it be vital that member of this house have the opportunity to scrutinise and debate that new role which be not include in the bill on reading 
 thank you mr speaker for allow i to rise to speak to new clause which propose a special representative for ethnic minority i be not white as some member may have notice the fact that my presence in this house be unremarkable be in and of itself remarkable that do not happen by chance it happen because of those who come before i 
 the mother of the house my right hon friend    the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott have spoke powerfully in this debate and i know that my unremarkable presence here be due to her remarkable achievement we may not always hold the same opinion but we have always share the same labour value she will never know how grateful we all be to she i may be part of the last generation of mp who can say this to she while she be in the house thank you 
 my hon friend   the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi   have speak powerfully in this debate and my right hon friend   the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz   have table new clause i know i stand on their shoulder too and i do not doubt their good intention but this bill have nothing to do with the colour of my skin new clause propose a special representative for ethnic minority i disagree with the new clause because the colour of my skin have no bearing here and no special place in this debate equality datum will be report through the equality and human rights commission as set out in clause and the secretary of state can already consult community representative for every person of every skin colour this bill give those already die a choice to end their suffering 
 order we need to make sure that contribution be tie to the amendment we be not debate the general point of the bill we have go past that the hon gentleman be make more of a reading speech which he might want to save 
 it be to the point of where we be 
 order i will make that decision please do not challenge the chair 
 i do apologise mr speaker 
 what i mean to say be that new clause would introduce a special representative for ethnic minority and i be try to explore why we do not need a duty to consult be already include in clause 
 this be a very sensitive issue there be datum to support the fact that people from minoritise ethnic group be less likely to trust their health professional the figure be among the general public but as high as among those group do my hon friend not think it be necessary to make sure there be additional protection for those who face additional barrier such as people from minoritise ethnic group 
 my hon friend make a powerful point and other hon member have also speak powerfully about the impact that the bill could have on ethnic minority do any hon member know how many ethnic minority access assist dying in other nation i will give way on this point   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney   raise it early 
 the hon member call i to speak if we do not know it be probably because those other nation be not collect the datum my position be that we should be collect the datum which be why hon member should vote for my new clause 
 we do know ethnic minority be less likely to access assist dying in jurisdiction where it be in place in oregon of those access assist die be ethnic minority but they make up of the population in california ethnic minority make up of people access the option but of the population however that be not the point the point of the bill be to give people the choice to end their life regardless of the colour of their skin there be no special quality about the colour of my skin that affect my access or the need for a special representative in this case which be cover by the echr and by the secretary of state 
 i be quite perplexed by my hon friend ’s speech but i would like to understand whether he have datum relate to the demographic of those jurisdiction compare with the uk if he do could he present it to the house to support his argument 
 i have spend a lot of time around datum but i be not sure that i understand the question 
 will the hon member give way 
 i will make a bit more progress 
 this have be a heated debate and hon member on both side of the house feel strongly about it i be grateful to members who come before i who make my place here possible and who have speak so powerfully and movingly in this debate but i believe and the evidence show that the colour of my skin do not belong in discussion of the bill 
 i rise to speak to amendment a to new clause table in my name which i hope hon member will support although it may seem technical it be in fact a simple amendment   with a significant impact it will ensure that there be genuine protection against abuse proper detection of coercion and effective scrutiny of how the law work in practice simply put it will ensure that death from assist dying under the bill will still fall within the coroner ’s duty to investigate death under section of the coroners and justice act i will explain why that be important 
 like many hon member i have be deeply concerned from the outset about how the bill be draft its workability and its impact on the nhs and on the life of vulnerable people up and down the country to be clear my view be that unintended death as a result of the bill become law be too many i humbly ask hon member who be still consider their position or who be minded to support the bill to consider this point about my amendment carefully what be an acceptable error rate 
 base on the figure in the government ’s impact assessment which i think underestimate the impact even a error rate would see a minimum of wrongful death in year with per year by year a error rate would see death in year and in year a error rate would see death in year and in year as i say i think those be low ball estimate but they be nevertheless chill if this law be pass it will be exceptionally difficult to say whether there have be error or instance of abuse or at the very least any error pick up will be but a fraction of the true picture as tragically those who would testify to the fact will already be dead my amendment a to new clause directly address that issue 
 in england and wales a coroner will investigate a death when certain legal condition be meet this duty be primarily govern by section of the coroners and justice act judge thomas teague kc who serve until as the chief coroner of england and wales note 
 any death arise as a consequence of the ingestion or administration of a lethal substance constitute an unnatural death which the local coroner be under a statutory duty to investigate 
 clearly assist die meet that definition and it be right that such death be afford the well possible posthumous judicial scrutiny 
 do the hon lady not feel that the provision in the bill already have safeguard also and most importantly do she not feel that put a family through a coronial process when the death be expect be unfair unjust and completely beyond the bound of what coroner be mean to do 
 on the point i do not believe that the bill be strong enough as it stand on the point we be already deal with the fact that family be not even guarantee knowledge of their love have an assisted death so i do not think the hon lady ’s point be entirely to be consider 
 as it stand the bill would disapply the duty of the coroner to investigate in the case of an assist death that have be carry out in accordance with the bill ’s provision new clause specifically would amend the coroners and justice act to clarify that assist death do not constitute unnatural death for the purpose of the act i think it take an extraordinary   leap of imagination not to conceive of deliberately self administer lethal drug as anything but an unnatural death 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for give way i want to support she in what she be say we be go through a process as we consider the appalling situation of coercive control in domestic abuse case where a person who be a victim may not realise they have be a victim until year later obviously a person who have go through an assisted death will have no year later be the amendment not a way of make sure that we guard against the evil of coercive control 
 i thank the hon member for his intervention and i completely agree with he these be the sort of safeguard that even the promoter of the bill be say should be there i do not think that they be in the bill and my amendment to new clause would make they much strong 
 my hon friend be right in what she say those of we who be oppose to the death penalty for example be against it because we do not believe in the infallibility of the state the state can get thing wrong professional can get thing wrong and when they do there should be a prove clear path as to how that wrongdoing can be identify to try to ensure that it do not occur again 
 i thank my hon friend the statistic i quote early be pretty clear on the point he make let i make some progress 
 the work undertake by the coroner be not a box tick exercise or a bureaucratic hurdle in the context of assist dying it be an extremely powerful deterrent against abuse and malpractice again to quote judge thomas teague kc in a letter to the times on   may   this year he say that the removal of 
 any realistic prospect of an effective inquest would magnify rather than diminish the obvious risk of deception and undue influence 
 i thank the hon member she be make a very powerful speech do she share my concern about the removal of the coroner as state clearly by the royal college of pathologists which speak to her amendment 
 i thank the hon member and i will come to that point very soon i will now make some progress i will not take any further intervention 
 i struggle to see how remove automatic oversight of assist death square with a commitment to enact legislation with the strong safeguard in the world by do so the bill set a low bar for scrutiny and review and create an information deficit put another way we simply do not know what we do not know implement a novel piece of legislation such as this without ensure the most robust possible scrutiny of death take place under the act be astonishing under the bill assist death would be the outlier as any other intentionally procure death would automatically be review by a coroner why should death under this legislation be any different 
 require automatic scrutiny from a coroner for assisted death should not be view as an add on at the end of the process or perhaps just a safety net although it be that 
 will the hon lady give way 
 no i have already say that i be not go take any further intervention i have be very generous with my time 
 it be imperative to consider the whole picture particularly regard malpractice or coercion whether that be on the part of medical professional family or party in write evidence to the committee dr rees johnson a legal expert from essex law school highlight that in some culture 
 decision making be a collective process involve family and community member 
 this approach combine with the bill ’s provision for sign by proxy in clause potentially create opportunity for coercion or abuse particularly where family member have conflict financial social or emotional burden 
 without a coroner ’s inquest dr johnson note that 
 we would lose the ability to fully and properly investigate the possibility of where coercion or abuse take place 
 in such culturally sensitive situation investigation of assist death by coroner be not a luxury it be a vital safeguard without which people will fall through the crack 
 will the hon lady give way 
 no 
 beyond coercion automatic inquest provide vital opportunity to identify other critical issue that may not otherwise be pick up without a coroner ’s inquest there would be no post mortem examination this be not merely an academic point study have show that autopsy reveal that in case have be misdiagnose without this oversight as his honour judge thomas teague kc the former chief coroner note there be 
 no certain mean of know whether the approve substance have lead to a quick and painless death or a linger and distress or even whether it have fail to cause death altogether and the deceased have be dispatch by manual asphyxiation or some other unlawful mean 
 i be not sure whether that could be more clear the view of expert in this area both the royal college of pathologists and the former chief coroner of england and wales be that this bill ’s proposal as draft be not fit for purpose i strongly urge hon member to support my amendment a to new clause 
 rise 
 may i informally suggest that we aim for speech of around minute i call paul waugh to provide a good example 
 i rise to speak in support of the amendment in my name which seek to strengthen new clause table by my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater why do   we want to restrict advertising about assist dying it be not just because such advert could appear crass or insensitive or because we worry that private company could profiteer from death but because advertiser know that they influence choice the issue of choice whether it be inform choice skewed choice self coercion or coercive control as have already be mention be in many way at the heart of the bill and whether its safeguard be sufficient 
 my brother work in advertising and he know its power it be why company spend billion of pound   on it why google be the giant that it be why we see   lot of advert at westminster tube station try to   influence every single of we and why x be full of ad advertising work because we human being be suggestible and prone to message visual cue and hint old people be bombard with advert for everything from stairlift to care home person ’s advert though be another person ’s public information campaign it be not impossible to imagine a future secretary of state who passionately believe in the merit of assist dying authorise such a campaign it could be a government approve plotline in a soap opera or an ad read out by a podcaster that ever so subtly sound like a news item or even their own opinion many in this house rightly try to protect teenager from online harm but the online harm of an ad for a website about assist dying share on tiktok could be a reality without the tight safeguard in my amendment
