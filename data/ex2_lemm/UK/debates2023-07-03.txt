i be pleased to see those service go into scunthorpe that underscore the investment we be make now while prepare for the long term through the large ever expansion in workforce training in the nhs ’s history my hon friend be right about the importance of tie in let i explain why that matter in particular for dentist around third of dentist do not go on to do nhs work that be why the plan have look at tie in for dentistry which we will explore in the week and month ahead 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to reduce net migration 
 what step she be take to reduce net migration 
 net migration be too high and this government be determined to bring it down indeed that be of the reason why i vote and campaign to leave the european union in last month i announce measure to reduce the number of student dependant come to the uk which have soar by and to stop people transfer from student visa to work visa we expect net migration to return to sustainable level over time and immigration policy be under constant review 
 the labour plaid coalition in cardiff have declare wales a sanctuary for all the world be welcome however its ukrainian super sponsor scheme fall apart due to a lack of accommodation and planning with family still cram into single room what discussion have the secretary of state have with the welsh labour government about the collapse of their super sponsor scheme do she know how many family be still inappropriately place 
 we be very proud of this country ’s track record on provide sanctuary to people in need and i be very proud of the support that the government have give to ukrainians flee putin ’s barbaric war but when it come to broad accommodation cost relate to asylum seeker it be clear that we be spend far too much—£6 a day or £ a year on housing asylum seeker in hotel 
 my hon friend raise a very important point she speak frankly to labour ’s abject failure to offer any viable plan for support labour be naive about the problem and it be unrealistic about the solution labour have no idea and no plan and it be let wales down 
 do the government have any plan to amend the minimum salary requirement for the skilled worker visa scheme 
 we always keep the salary threshold under review but as i say net migration be too high and we need to get overall number down how do we do that well employer need to recruit more people who be already here rather than advertising abroad so much we also need to get more people off welfare and back into economic activity and our welfare reform will help with that objective we can not ignore the pressure that record level of people come to the uk put on housing supply public service and community relation that be why we need to focus on lower net migration 
 of course net emigration be the problem in some part of the uk will the home secretary pay attention to the plight of our economy in the lake and dale where almost third of business be fail to meet demand because of a lack of workforce i have be speak to the minister for immigration about a youth mobility visa scheme negotiate bilaterally with other country in europe to solve our economic need so that our hospitality and tourism industry can survive how be the home secretary get on with those discussion 
 migration be a very complex issue and of course we have to balance the need of the labour market that be why we be very pleased to support well craft youth mobility scheme there be with india and i have just come back from new zealand where we have expand our youth mobility scheme they be great scheme that allow the exchange of young people who can come here to serve and work in our economy 
 it be very clear that the issue of migration must be settle and sort out at the same time it be important to note that those who have come from eastern europe the middle east and africa be contribute to the economy of my strangford constituency i think the secretary of state be commit to ensure that continue but what discussion have she have with the northern ireland assembly to ensure that we continue to have the worker we need 
 no single measure can control net migration but as the prime minister have be clear net migration be too high that be why i recently announce a series of measure aim at reduce the number of student dependant which have rise exponentially over the past few year and ensure that student come here in a more proportionate and balanced way 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 will the home secretary wish the deputy chairman of the conservative party   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson a speedy recovery from the terrible bug that i understand have this morning prevent he from launch an entirely different conservative immigration policy from the policy of the conservative home secretary do she agree with he that social care visa should be cancel yes or no 
 the sorry fact of the matter be that labour want open border and unlimited migration there be a malaise descend upon the labour party and it do not even know what it think labour ’s sadiq khan have say that he want more migration labour ’s party chairman have confirm that number could rise under a labour government when the shadow home secretary be ask whether she want net migration to rise or fall she in the characteristic style we have come to know and love could not even answer the question that be what we always get with labour 
 order may i just say that you have no responsibility for the labour party and in fairness this be home office question 
 the home secretary could not answer the question do she support her own social care visa or not she spend all weekend briefing that she agree with her back benchers but today she can not even answer the basic question make up stuff about the labour party will not help she when her party have be in power for year and when work visa have double exactly because the government have fail to tackle skill shortage or issue in the labour market 
 this be total chaos we have a rwanda policy that be not remove anyone an impact assessment that say her policy will not work and will cost much more a drop in removal of foreign criminal the inspector say this be because the home office can not even identify who can be remove a record number of people in hotel a record high asylum backlog and back benchers write the home secretary ’s immigration policy because they do not think she be up to the job it have be a humiliating few week for the home secretary 
 order sorry but you be not go to take advantage of i in that way that be totally unfair i can not pull side up and allow the other to take advantage of it i expect all the back benchers to be able to get their question in today this be about everybody have the same opportunity to get involve so please do not do that again 
 thank you mr speaker we all know that only the conservative party and this prime minister have a serious plan to stop the boat and stop illegal migration and that labour stand for only thing open border and unlimited migration labour members would rather spend their time campaign to block the deportation of foreign criminal than back our illegal migration bill they be on the side of the criminal gang not on the side of the british people 
 whether her department have have recent discussion with the industrial hemp industry on licensing 
 the hon gentleman will recall that the of we meet just a few week ago on   may together with industry representative to discuss hemp licensing i thank he for take the time and trouble to organise that meeting as he know there be a light touch process for license industrial hemp since the number of hemp licence have increase from to 
 i recollect the conversation well we have an opportunity within the uk to grow hemp on an industrial scale and so feed many grow industry that use hemp to produce environmentally friendly product the growth of these industry have be hamper by overly complicated regulation and a poor application process meanwhile foreign company be race ahead in this arena to protect uk farmer and encourage uk industry will the minister consider give the licensing process over to the department for environment food and rural affairs and make the process farmer friendly 
 it be of course important to make sure that uk industry can compete globally and a light touch regulatory framework be important in that we should be aware that some part of the plant contain high level of thc tetrahydrocannabinol and do need regulation which be the home office ’s concern i will be meet defra colleague in the near future to make sure that our approach to regulation be as light touch as possible because like he i want to see our domestic industry flourish and i do not want any excessive regulation 
 what recent progress her department have make on review the police funding formula 
 the government have say they will be review the police funding formula and i hope to have news for the house in the relatively near future about initiate the consultation process the formula be quite out of date and it need overhaul and we be work on that 
 the record number of police officer in bedfordshire and the recent £ special grant be both very welcome indeed but do the minister recognise that it be simply not fair or right to go on fund a force with a series of off special grant that really need to be part of core funding 
 my hon friend make a good point i should take this opportunity to pay tribute to the bedfordshire police and crime commissioner festus akinbusoye who have do a fantastic job for the people of bedfordshire he advocate for more funding via the special grant and be successful he be a great representative for the people of bedfordshire and i be pleased that he have deliver record police number in bedfordshire just as the government have deliver record number of police across the whole of england and wales 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the chief constable of west yorkshire police john robins qpm recently tell the bbc that his force do not have the resource that it need to deliver the service that the public expect cut through the spin he say that the force be down staff and £ since he say his force could deal with major incident and crime but only at a cost to neighbourhood policing this come from a force that be rat outstanding in planning and the use of resource in its late inspection by his majesty ’s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and   rescue service which bit of policing do the minister think should not be do because force simply do not have the resource 
 the shadow minister will know that in the police funding settlement for this year there be around about £ extra in fact it be slightly over £ for police force up and down the country that have enable we to deliver a record number of officer ever there be officer about more than there be under the last labour government in west yorkshire which the shadow minister ask about neighbourhood crime be down by since and overall crime exclude fraud and computer misuse which come into the figure only recently be down by since i be still wait for the shadow home secretary to apologise for be a member of a government who preside over crime level that be double those we have today 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce the backlog of asylum application 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce the backlog of asylum application 
 we be make good progress and the late home office statistic show that asylum decision be up with a increase since last year in the number make productivity have increase and we be on track to have decision maker by september which represent a quadrupling of the number of case worker 
 like many member from all party i be constantly contact by refugee who be desperate to know what be happen to their asylum claim after year of waiting so i ask the home office how many refugee in newcastle have be wait for and year the answer come back that the home office do not know it do not even record the datum instead of indulge in unworkable unethical illegal and unaffordable flight of rwandan fantasy why do the home secretary not focus on her day job and fix the asylum backlog 
 as i just say we be make good progress on reduce the asylum backlog important though the reduce the backlog be however it can not be the totality of a plan this be the point that the labour party do not seem to understand we have to stop the boat come in the place that be the only sustainable way to tackle the issue even if we grant our way out of this problem as the shadow home secretary seem to propose the pressure on the state still remain they be simply transfer to local authority and the benefit system and the british taxpayer continue to pick up the bill 
 the minister have an interesting definition of be on track do the number of decision maker not fall between january and may this year from to 
 a constituent recently pass on to i a letter from a firm of local solicitor that say 
 all possible avenue have be consider to avoid this situation but regrettably the home office ’s long term failure to progress asylum claim and current government immigration policy have make it financially unsustainable for 
 these solicitor 
 to continue legally aid work 
 how do it help we as mps on both side of the house in our constituency office and how do it help with the backlog that the home office say it want to reduce to make sure that people do not have the legal representation they need to unblock the system and allow progress in asylum case 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that the problem with our asylum system be not a lack of lawyer there be plenty of legal representative around we have have strong overall progress on the backlog and i be pleased to say that the early datum that i have receive suggest that last week see the good performance in year 
 i know how seriously the minister take deal with the legacy backlog but as the home secretary show at the recent home affairs committee in order to deal with that backlog in the timeframe that the government have set themselves it would require at least a quadrupling of the number of case be deal with as from   june even with the extra staff appoint at stoke that will be challenging will the minister give i an assurance that if we have not manage to clear the backlog before the end of the year it will not be do by a blanket amnesty 
 my hon friend make an important point the home secretary the prime minister and i explicitly choose not to pursue the blanket amnesty approach that the previous labour government pursue instead we put in the hard yard to improve productivity by streamline process reduce unnecessary bureaucracy ensure that where appropriate interview be conduct in a timely fashion and recruit more decision maker since my right hon friend the home secretary appear before the committee i be pleased to say that the datum come out of our caseworke team be very strong we be see significant progress as i just say early indication suggest that last week be the good for over year 
 i be a bit mystified give that of these application be successful be it not the case that if we speed up the process and make it easy and easy more and more people will come be not the only solution to detain people and to deport they offshore they those who suggest anything else be live in cloud cuckoo land and every single county will face what we face in lincolnshire with thousand of illegal migrant have to be house in unsuitable place let we have an answer for once 
 the approach that the home secretary and i have take have be both to ensure that where there be high grant rate nationality case be pursue swiftly and where there be low grant rate nationality such as albanians individual from a safe european   country who can and should be return as quickly as possible we do just that at this point last year of those arrive on small boat be come from albania today it be less than that arrangement be clearly make good progress none the less my right hon friend make an important point those who suggest that we can simply grant our way out of this problem be i be afraid hopelessly naive the idea that the individual come across on small boat will in most case make a significant net contribution to our economy be wrong the cost to the taxpayer be very significant the ongoing cost of education access to welfare and community cohesion be very significant which be why we need to stop the boat in the place 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s destruction of their own asylum system can well be describe as an act of arson and their plan to fix it be utterly farcical they have send more home secretaries than asylum seeker to rwanda they send the prime minister on a victory lap in dover apparently fail to notice that the weather improve over the summer and the boat number increase and they be in such a flap about lose vote on their big backlog bill that they resort to drag lord lebedev of siberia into the division lobby now the court of appeal ruling have reveal that rwanda be able to process only claim per year around of those who arrive on small boat last year can the minister tell i what he be plan to do with the remain and do he therefore agree that the prospect of the rwanda plan actually deter any migrant from cross the channel be close to 
 i use to say that the labour party do not have a plan but the truth be that it do have a plan but it be a plan that would make thing significantly bad it be a plan that would ensure more granting of case more safe and legal route so even more individual would come here more hotel and more cost to the british taxpayer what be so disgraceful be the level of hypocrisy we only have to look at the record of welsh labour to see that in wales the welsh minister for social justice declare on occasion in the senedd that labour run wales be a nation of sanctuary but across the same period labour run wales accommodate few asylum seeker in fact the late publish data show that labour run wales have take just half the number of people that it should per capita 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the devolved administration on the illegal migration bill 
 i have engage regularly with the devolved administration on the illegal migration bill since its introduction in march in addition to my periodic meeting with my ministerial counterpart on a variety of immigration issue most recently i meet the scottish minister for equalities migration and refugees in may look ahead the bill be on the agenda for the inter ministerial   group for safety security and migration which my right hon and learn friend the home secretary will chair later this month 
 the bill will place restriction on the power of scottish ministers remove the entitlement for victim of human trafficking and exploitation to access scottish government fund support service and will undermine the scottish government ’s ability to deliver on their trafficking and exploitation strategy we know what route the government ’s damage ideology be drag they down but why should scotland ’s elect parliament and the devolved administrations be drag down the same route when it be abundantly clear that we want no part of the hostile environment ideology 
 if the scottish government care so deeply about this issue they would accommodate more asylum seeker the snp government be accommodate just of the total asylum population be accommodate in the uk when scotland make up of the uk population i take the time to look at some of the statistic for those local authority in scotland where the snp be the large party clackmannanshire asylum seeker dundee asylum seeker east ayrshire east dunbartonshire midlothian north ayrshire want to take a guess mr speaker north lanarkshire 
 order no no no you be go to get my drift we can not read out phone number this be not the yellow pages advert or statistic be fine but when we get to i really do worry let we have the snp spokesperson 
 the minister clearly think that that be a very clever line but he know well that glasgow take more refugee per head of population than any other local authority in the united kingdom the line he be trot out be simply wrong and it be insulting to all those in scotland who have open their home to ukrainians the community across the country who have welcome syrians and the volunteer in the big city who work with asylum seeker every day help they to overcome trauma if he want scotland to do more to welcome refugee when be he go to devolve the power and the financial lever that would allow we to do so 
 for good reason immigration be a reserved matter but the statistic i have just read out make the point as clear as can be the snp try its very good to undermine the government ’s work to stop the boat but it refuse to accommodate these people when they arrive and the cost of its fake humanitarianism be bear by everyone but itself that be not just hypocrisy it be deeply irresponsible and the public have have enough 
 it be not the scottish government ’s policy towards immigration refugee and asylum seeker that have be rule unlawful by the court of appeal if the minister want the system to work and he want the scottish government to do their part he must take more action to clear the backlog as we have hear there must be proper safe and legal right for people to arrive and they must be give the right to work when they get here because then they can pay for their own accommodation and they will not cost the taxpayer money 
 just the other day the home office suggest to the scottish government that a vessel that have be use to house ukrainian refugee in leith could be use for other who be asylum seeker the same vessel the same port the same provider the same package what do the snp say no 
 what recent assessment she have make of the compatibility of the illegal migration bill with the un refugee convention 
 while i be pleased that the court of appeal find that the government be not in breach of our obligation under the refugee convention i fundamentally disagree with the judgment that rwanda be not a safe place for refugee and we be seek permission to appeal the government take our international obligation very seriously and we be satisfied that the provision in the illegal migration bill comply with the refugee convention the fundamental principle remain however that those in need of protection should claim asylum at the early opportunity and in the safe country that they reach 
 the home secretary and the government website say that they be satisfied that the provision of the illegal migration bill comply with the un refugee convention i be look for clarity from the home secretary what exactly be it about persecute the most vulnerable group create a hostile environment and strip people of their right to seek safety that comply so well with the un refugee convention 
 as i have make clear we take our international obligation very seriously and we be satisfied that the bill comply with the refugee convention with respect to the hon lady i will not take lecture from the snp on this matter snp members be as my right hon friend   the member for newark robert jenrick   say the phoney humanitarian in this debate they be happy to support asylum seeker as long as they be nowhere near scotland when they stop oppose the vessel in leith which will house more asylum seeker then we can have a serious conversation 
 the un refugee agency have its own asylum seeker relocation programme it fly asylum seeker from libya to rwanda in a scheme part fund by the european union how on earth can rwanda be deem not to be a safe country if the un refugee agency itself be use it as a safe haven 
 as always my hon friend make a powerful point and i could not agree with he more the united nations high commissioner for refugees run an extensive scheme in rwanda and support the resettlement of many thousand of migrant i meet some of they in my recent visit to rwanda they be happy and grateful for the generosity and welcome that rwanda have offer they which have allow they to restart their life i be frankly very disappointed by the constant smear and assumption which be base on   outdated and ignorant view denigrate our ally in rwanda i be nothing but grateful to our partner in rwanda for the continued co operation 
 what step she be take to tackle street crime by young people 
 i be pleased to report that accord to the crime survey violence be down by and criminal damage be down by since but we would like to do more that be why we now have record number of police and why we be invest in the safe street fund £ in the youth endowment fund and £ in violence reduction unit we have also launch our antisocial behaviour strategy about which the home secretary will speak in a moment 
 now be a good time to put on the record an intervention make by mr speaker in his capacity as the member of parliament for chorley thank to his recent intervention with i and the chief constable chorley town centre be of the area that will receive antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol and i be sure that the people of chorley be very grateful to mr speaker for the intervention that he make on their behalf 
 well do mr speaker 
 i thank the minister for his reply some young people who be arrest because they be guilty of antisocial behaviour or so call low level crime be release without charge because there be a reluctance to criminalise they too often those youngster go on to commit further multiple crime and be arrest and release without charge each time what step will my right hon friend take to end this roundabout of unpunished crime and ensure that young people who repeatedly break the law be not release without charge but be treat as what they be criminal 
 we want to see tough action on thing such as antisocial behaviour and public drug use we should have tolerance for any of those thing as part of the asb strategy we be launch instant justice whereby people who perpetrate act of antisocial behaviour will rapidly ideally within hour be make to do clean up and those kind of thing in their local area to pay back visibly publicly rapidly and with enforcement we be trialle that in police force area start this month and it will be roll out to every police force in the country with funding by april next year i completely agree with everything my hon friend say 
 the minister may not be aware that i be chair of the cross party youth violence commission we publish an interim report in and a final in our recommendation be for the government to adopt a public health approach to tackle violence through regional violence reduction unit and long term strategy what action be the minister take to ensure that violence reduction unit have the long term funding that they need to achieve the good possible outcome 
 i agree with the approach that the hon lady set out and we have already take action she ask about long term plan she will be aware that the youth endowment fund of £ be a year programme and that violence reduction unit call violence reduction partnership in some place have so far receive £ and receive fund each and every year include an allocation this year the kind of thing that we find work include diversionary activity for young people in fact when i ask the chief executive of the yef what the most effective intervention be he say that it be cognitive behavioural therapy which get use as well i repeat statistic that i mention early since violence be down by and criminal damage by 
 a report today find that nearly half of woman who experience or witness a crime in the past year choose not to report it because they do not believe that the police would treat it seriously his majesty ’s inspector in his late state of policing report say that the police be experience of their big crisis in live memory there be widespread systematic failing and they be simply not get the basic right 
 have push our british model of police by consent to the very brink do the government take responsibility do they agree with the inspector that substantial reform be essential and will they back labour ’s plan to restore neighbourhood policing halve serious violence and raise confidence in every force or be the minister happy to keep twiddle his thumb while the criminal get away with it 
 i must say in the gentle term that my constituency neighbour have a bit of cheek to talk about reduce crime give that accord to the crime survey crime level under the last labour government be around double what they be today interruption she shake her head but that be from the office for national statistics and it be the only statistically recognise long term measure of crime if she do not like the ons figure she can go and argue with it she might not like they but those be the figure 
 in relation to the hon lady ’s serious question about rasso rape and serious sexual offence particularly on woman the proportion be report be much high than it be a few year ago which be welcome there be a lot more to do which be why there be a rape review and a rape action plan my right hon and learn friend the home secretary and the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for derbyshire dales miss dines be work hard on that operation soteria bluestone be fully roll out at the end of june just a few day ago and we have see a significant increase in the number of relevant charge they be still too low and they need to be high which be why we have invest in more rasso specialist officer and that work be continue 
 what step her department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour 
 whether her department plan to increase police resource to help tackle antisocial behaviour 
 early in the year i launch the antisocial behaviour action plan which include increase funding for police and crime commissioner by over £ deliver strong and swifter punishment increase police visibility in response and ban nitrous oxide antisocial behaviour be not a low level crime it blight community and that be why the government be commit to tackle it effectively 
 today to coincide with anti social behaviour awareness week the all party parliamentary group on antisocial behaviour have publish a report with the charity resolve asb which demonstrate among other thing that people a day experience antisocial behaviour some believe that the government be not do enough will the home secretary meet member of the all party parliamentary group and i to look at the recommendation in that report 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his work on the all party parliamentary group and i be sure that the policing minister and/or i will meet he to learn more about the vital work that he have lead may i take the opportunity to applaud the officer of cheshire police force in the hon gentleman ’s area i have have the pleasure of meet the excellent chief constable mark roberts i applaud the conservative police and crime commissioner john dwyer who have roll out a scheme on antisocial behaviour that provide more cctv and increase the responder response there be a record number of police officer in cheshire and the force have receive over £ worth of safe street funding the result be a fall in neighbourhood crime and a fall in drug offence in cheshire that be common sense policing thank to the police officer and government support 
 hampshire and isle of wight constabulary be of the lowest fund police force in the uk and with a decade of cut to youth service antisocial behaviour have be leave to thrive under this government we have see the consequence at south parade pier the camber and many other place in portsmouth neighbourhood policing be vital in crack down on asb which ruin so many life therefore what explanation can the home secretary provide for halve the number of police community support officer over the past year 
 the hon gentleman and i represent constituency that be serve by the same police force and i be really proud of the track record in hampshire i be really proud of how the new chief constable scott chilton have assume his role with a real focus on back to basic policing i be really proud of how the conservative police and crime commissioner donna jones have lead initiative so that every community in hampshire will have name dedicated police officer and pcso serve they bolster neighbourhood police and building confidence and i be really proud of the fact that hampshire have see a fall in neighbourhood crime since common sense policing serve the community 
 do my right hon and learn friend agree that some of the principal victim of antisocial behaviour be young people the government be absolutely right to bring forward new measure to tackle antisocial behaviour to make our street park and public space safe for the vast majority of young people who do not engage in those negative behaviour 
 my right hon friend be absolutely correct there be such a need for great diversion and great support for young people so that they do not spend their time loitering in shopping centre cause a nuisance in car park or harass member of the community that be why our antisocial behaviour action plan commit considerable funding over £ of new funding include for an increase police presence in asb hotspot area and to support the roll out of diversionary resource to support young people so that they do not fall into crime and antisocial behaviour 
 youth zone be exceptional especially the chorley inspire 
 yet again in ilkley and marley in my constituency travellers have set up camp cause damage and intimidate resident which just last weekend result in ilkley pool have to close temporarily when they have go they leave a complete mess which all have to be clean up at taxpayer expense will the home secretary meet i to discuss what additional support west yorkshire police and our local council can get to address this ongoing issue 
 my hon friend raise a really important point about illegal encampment and travellers who blight community by cause a nuisance and who in some case threaten community it be unacceptable behaviour that be why we legislate in the police crime sentencing and courts act to toughen up the power and measure available to the police so that they can take more robust step in relation to this issue but i be very happy to speak to my hon friend about what more can be do locally 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce the use of hotel as contingency asylum accommodation 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce the use of hotel as contingency asylum accommodation 
 the home office seek to end the use of hotel and to move asylum seeker to less expensive more suitable accommodation to support that we be bring into use large disuse military site and vessel which will provide adequate safe secure non detained accommodation for asylum seeker and also reduce the pull factor to the united kingdom 
 i recently receive an email from the home office that say that the use of hotel to house asylum seeker be inappropriate and that reliance on they must be reduce in the same email the home office inform i that it plan to increase the use of hotel accommodation for asylum seeker in my constituency of erdington by 159%—the single big increase in the whole of birmingham how on earth can the minister expect the country to trust he when he can not even keep his policy consistent within the same email 
 the policy that we have adopt be of maximise the capacity of the hotel that we have for as long as we have they that be save the taxpayer at least a quarter of a pound and reduce reliance on hotel elsewhere in the country i do appreciate that there be pressure on the hon lady ’s local authority and i also appreciate that some labour local authority such as westminster city council say that asylum seeker must be house in individual ensuite bedroom we do not agree with that it be a gross waste of taxpayer money that would make the uk a soft touch 
 in my constituency i have have the same experience as my hon friend   the member for birmingham erdington mrs hamilton but the question i want to ask be about unaccompanied asylum seek child the home office still have not explain how it be go to find the child miss from asylum accommodation so will it set out the plan to do that and find these vulnerable people 
 we have be very clear that we and the police take extremely seriously any young person who go missing from a hotel or any other form of accommodation local police force and home office personnel treat that exactly as they would any other child go miss and they conduct a full miss person inquiry however the only sustainable answer to young people live in hotel be to stop the boat in the place do nothing be not an option do nothing will lead to more young people live in those hotel and be expose to human trafficker 
 while i do very much welcome the minister ’s determination to move away from hotel and towards other accommodation will he give particular attention to the wiltshire hotel and golf club in my constituency the number there have go up there be now people there and they be all cram into very small accommodation it be not only bad from the point of view of the golf club member and neighbour long term resident with they in housing next door but it be an extremely bad place from the point of view of the asylum seeker they have nowhere to go and nothing to do they have no education facility and no religious facility they be stick in the middle of the countryside with no transport and it be quite the wrong place for they to be will the minister please give particular attention to the wiltshire hotel 
 i be familiar with the hotel in my hon friend ’s constituency and the concern he have raise i will take a look at that but as i have say previously the answer to this challenge be to stop the boat come   in the place that be why we all need to support the illegal migration bill those who want more hotel would oppose it the labour party ’s policy will see more hotel and the shadow home secretary will end up with more hotel to her name than paris hilton 
 i do not know how to follow that mr speaker 
 all members would like to see a reduction in the number of hotel use for asylum accommodation i be sure that be true but will the minister spend a moment to congratulate the community of sharnbrook and in particular rev. paolo di leo and councillor doug mcmurdo on provide a welcoming environment for people who be put in such accommodation i think there be sign across the country that community do come together in these difficult circumstance to achieve an outcome that be beneficial for everyone 
 i would be very happy to put on record my view of the good work be do by my hon friend ’s constituent he be right to say that there be voluntary and community group charity and church right across the country that support asylum seeker while they be in this form of accommodation and we and our provider facilitate that wherever possible 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be go to make a short topical statement the information that meta and other tech company give to uk law enforcement help to protect around child and lead to over arrest of suspect child abuser every month however meta plan to roll out end to end encryption soon without safeguard and it will no long proactively detect and alert authority to child grooming and abuse material on facebook messenger and instagram direct this will be a huge boon to anyone who want to hurt a child the online safety bill will hold tech firm to account but indifference to abuse be intolerable i have write to mark zuckerberg together with my right hon friend the minister for security   the right hon member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat child ’s charity and campaign group to outline our profound concern last week i be in new zealand at the eyes security conference where there be widespread support for work together to ensure that social medium company put child safety 
 follow recent knife crime incident in my constituency and in the medway town will my right hon friend meet i and our kent police and crime commissioner matthew scott to discuss funding and how the home office can far support kent police with the increase challenge we be face in kent due to our proximity to london 
 i very much appreciate the particular challenge in kent relate to knife crime that be why i be glad that since kent have receive £ in core violence reduction unit grant funding and £   in additional support for targeted youth intervention i have meet the police and crime commissioner and chief constable tim smith they be both excellent at lead their force and there be now a record number of police officer in kent i be sure the minister for crime policing and fire my right hon friend   the member for croydon south chris philp will meet my right hon friend to discuss that issue we have make a lot of progress but we can do well 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 the home secretary will be aware of the documentary last week on the relationship between boris johnson and other and former kgb officer alexander lebedev and about the meeting in an italian villa the ignoring of security advice on lords appointment and the decision not to sanction alexander lebedev give the importance of national security will she tell the house whether she have any concern about those report will she set up an independent investigation into what happen into who know what and into how far the security risk spread 
 at the home office the minister for security and i take seriously the threat pose by hostile state actor that be why the minister for security be chair the defending democracy taskforce bring together agency and departments in a cross whitehall approach to tackle the serious threat that we all face as parliamentarian and face those in public office i gently remind the right hon lady that of her own parliamentary colleague have a very dubious track record when it come to work with the chinese communist party 
 what step be my right hon friend take to ensure that police funding reflect rurality and the huge uplift in population experience in remote coastal location during the summer tourist season 
 as i say in response to an early question the government intend to consult in due course on a new police funding formula and part of that consultation will involve look at the factor that should be take into account those might include thing such as population and crime level but thing such as rurality sparsity and seasonality particularly seasonal tourism be likely to form part of the new formula i encourage member across the house to engage closely with that consultation when it come forward to ensure that those factor be properly account for 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests in recent week the medium have carry story of patient who be receive medical cannabis on private prescription and who be now have their prescription pay for by the nhs on the surface that be a great leap forward but parent of child with intractable epilepsy who have be ask for such thing for year be still be ignore will the home office consider reopen the licensing scheme to enable those child who be already be privately prescribe medical cannabis to have access to it via their nhs gp 
 many cannabis base compound be move wholesale to schedule a few year ago enable they to be prescribe the question that the hon gentleman ask about nhs prescription be perfectly reasonable and fair but prescription on the nhs be a matter for the department of health and social care and for the nhs include the nhs in scotland i would be happy to pass on his inquiry to they 
 may i assure my right hon friend the home secretary that the majority of my constituent in sittingbourne and sheppey understand that send illegal migrant to rwanda for processing be key to stop small boat crossing in the channel will she assure they that despite concert opposition from the labour party she will deliver her plan 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question we be disappoint by the judgment of the court of appeal but we be determined to follow through he be right to say that we have to add deterrence to the system as it be only by break the business model of the people smuggler that we will stop the boat 
 my constituent want community police kim mcguinness the police and crime commissioner for northumbria have put in place a redeployment programme to get an extra officer into neighbourhood but that will not make up for the officer and the £ that we have lose due to budget cut and before the minister mention plan that will still leave we officer short why have the tories fail so badly to get police officer on to the beat 
 as i mention in early answer across england and wales we now have record police number of the previous peak be in so we have more officer than we have ever have before across england and wales in northumbria the number have go up by since of course many of the power sit with the pcc include power over the precept it be entirely open to police and crime commissioner to use those power 
 today operation centurion have start across lancashire utilise £ from the government to put more police officer on our street tackle antisocial behaviour in my constituency that mean almost extra hour of police patrol in padiham it will have a major impact but we can do more can i ask the home secretary whether the safe street fund will have another round so that we can make physical change as well as get more officer on the street 
 i be delighted with the progress be make to tackle antisocial behaviour in burnley and padiham as my hon friend will know we have allocate almost £ to roll out pilot of asb hotspot response in a new round of safe street will be announce soon i take this opportunity to thank lancashire police which have launch an asb problem solve unit it run operation propulsion which involve more officer patrol location deal with motor nuisance and boy racer and it have have a real good   crackdown on residential burglary thank to operation defender neighbourhood crime have fall by in lancashire tribute must be pay to chief constable chris rowley and the police and crime commissioner andrew snowden 
 give the exchange early i be oblige to ask the home secretary whether she understand the difference between use a cruise ship for the temporary accommodation of ukrainian refugee with a share language and experience and who have the right to work and be be actively relocate in the community and use it essentially as a prison ship for the indefinite long term detention of asylum seeker who have no right to leave no right to work no right to benefit and no recourse to public fund do the department appreciate the difference 
 i be disappoint by the hon gentleman ’s remark he know perfectly well that the proposition be not a prison ship this be a ship that will be use in exactly the same way as the snp government do in scotland and in exactly the same way as the belgian and the dutch government be do in their respective area if i may say in edinburgh today there be asylum seeker that be disgraceful if the snp care about this issue it would step up support asylum seeker and back our bill 
 people in southend west want to see a tough but just policy on illegal immigration that stop people unfairly jump the queue that stop evil people smuggler and above all stop vulnerable people drown in the channel will my right hon friend therefore agree that we must continue to send a strong signal that it be this government not unelected lawyer or criminal gang who will decide who come to this country 
 at the core of this question be who decide who come to this country be it for the government and parliament or be it for people smuggler and human trafficker those of we on the government benches know exactly which side of the debate we be on we want to stop the boat and we want to secure our border 
 the family of my constituent who flee sudan have be stick in egypt for more than month await a spousal visa of the group of have uk passport can the minister tell we how long he would expect people to be wait in this kind of situation when they have suffer such distress and anxiety 
 i would be happy to look into the case for the hon gentleman but i can say to he that we be process application in country within service standard we have close the visa application centre in khartoum for obvious reason to protect the security of our staff and contractor but we have team in egypt saudi arabia and in other close country who be there to support applicant such as his constituent 
 give this morning ’s u turn by the mayor of london on sell off uxbridge police station do the minister believe that the mayor should also act to save barnet police station if he do not the mayor ’s decision on uxbridge look like cynical political gameplaying and interference in a by election 
 i and many other londoners be concern when i think in sadiq khan announce plan to close police station thank to the resolute campaigning of local councillor steve tuckwell in hillingdon sadiq khan have execute a last minute handbrake u turn under pressure which i be sure be entirely unconnected with the upcoming by election my right hon friend be absolutely right that if sadiq khan be to have any credibility at all with londoner he currently have pretty much none he should reverse not just that police station closure plan but all his police station closure plan 
 use the maximum police precept on council tax have to tap into half a pound of reserve and yet again rely on grant funding show that the bedfordshire police and crime commissioner have fail to secure the long term funding that our force desperately need now he be off pursue his personal ambition as the next tory candidate for mid beds the review of police funding be welcome but when will the house see it will it be before the summer recess 
 i can not set out a precise timeframe it be be actively work on but i point out that festus the police and crime commissioner for bedfordshire be do a fantastic job for the people of that county it be thank to his active energetic persuasive and eloquent intervention that bedfordshire have receive these special grant its base budget have also go up by £ this year thank to his fantastic work 
 last week nigel farage publicise the cancellation of his bank account under the politically expose person regulation but he be only the late of a number of people to have have their life wreck by that regulation recently lords in the other place try to correct the policy but with only partial success because i understand of pushback from the home office and the security service will the minister explain why that be and what he will do about it 
 i be delighted to be ask a question yesterday the treasury and the home office come together and agree various thing that be announce in the house of lords the peps agreement such a closure on political ground if that be indeed what have happen after all we have only the allegation of it at this point should therefore be completely unacceptable pep be there to prevent the corrupt use of banking facility by politician in corrupt regime it be not there to silence individual who may hold view with which we may or may not agree 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 in the chief inspector of border and immigration ’s late report on the home office system to remove foreign national offender he say 
 the home office do not have a firm grip on its caseworke operation 
 and 
 this be no way to run a government department 
 he also say 
 i find the home office ’s inability to provide reliable or consistent datum and management information of particular concern 
 give that will the minister explain how the department will cope with the increase in casework detention and removal plan under the illegal immigration offences bill 
 we take that report as we do all other very seriously the right hon lady be right to say that there be lesson to be learn however return be increase as a result of deal such as the we have do with albania as a result of reform such as those we have make to the national referral mechanism and as a result of the increase in illegal working visit that we have secure this year alone 
 despite repeat assurance from the dispatch box and it be nearly month since i raise the issue with the minister the home office continue to operate wholly inappropriate accommodation centre in my constituency put an unbearable strain on public service will my right hon friend expedite a clear timetable to close the centre permanently and restore the hotel to their intend purpose 
 my hon friend and i have discuss this on many occasion she have doggedly campaign for the closure of these centre as well as support the step that we be take as a government to stop the boat in the place i will be happy to have further conversation with she but she have my assurance that we be work as fast as possible to clear all hotel include those in her constituency 
 last week the government reject a number of recommendation from the inquest into the tragic mass shooting in plymouth in which have cause serious concern among some of the family of the victim will the minister explain why he reject the coroner ’s recommendation and whether all those on which he be consult will be implement by the end of this calendar year 
 i thank the hon gentleman for our meeting with the family a few week ago as i say to he on the phone last week whenever he and the family be ready to have further discussion with home office official they will be ready the timing of that will be guide by the hon gentleman on the substance of the government ’s reply we have commit to do some thing straight away for example the national police chiefs council have be fund to set up an accredited training programme for firearm officer that be of the recommendation in due course that will become mandatory 
 the inspectorate will conduct a thematic inspection of all firearm license next year as i say to the house a few month ago i ask it specifically to reinspect devon and cornwall ’s firearm licensing it be do that and it should report back by the end of july the vast majority of the recommendation make by the coroner the independent office for police conduct and the scottish affairs committee in connection with the isle of skye shooting be be openly and neutrally consult on 
 the government do not have a position they will consult openly and respond once we have reply to the consultation there be recommendation that the hon gentleman refer to that the government do not feel be appropriate for the reason set out in the document but the vast majority be be openly consult on we have take action on some of they already i thank he again for his campaigning on this issue which i know the family be grateful for 
 i recently visit uxbridge police station to hear about the valuable work its officer do to serve my constituent as well as those in uxbridge and south ruislip when the mayor announce its closure in hillingdon council offer to buy the site at market rate and provide a £ revenue contribution and leaseback arrangement so that those valuable service could continue to be available the mayor say that that be completely impossible other than the relentless campaigning of hillingdon conservatives and councillor steve tuckwell could my right hon friend suggest any reason why the mayor decide to keep it 
 order mr simmonds i think you need an adjournment debate not a topical question see if you can pick the bone out of that minister 
 i thank my hon friend for his excellent question the answer be no i can not think of anything other than the campaigning by councillor steve tuckwell and other which force the mayor into a last minute self interested screech u turn i would like the mayor to do a u turn on all the other police station he be threaten with closure 
 you be go to be here a while yet 
 be the home secretary concern by recent revelation about the investigation into the stephen lawrence murder and what happen in the brink’s mat aftermath be she concerned about some of the out of work organisation that our police belong to 
 the recent report on the stephen lawrence case be an operational matter for the police which i can not get involve in nor should i. that be a judgment for the police on operational and casework decision within which we do not interfere we have a good track record on the met turn around performance mark rowley ’s turnaround plan and leadership effort to restore confidence and rebuild trust with london be work we need to back he to get the good result possible in london 
 there be a tweet go around regard a man who identify as a trans woman the tweet read that the trans identified man who 
 appear in an @itvnew report about mother have post an image breastfeed a baby do you think it ’ ok to mock woman like this 
 i think that be a valid question but i be also extremely concerned for the welfare of the child will the home secretary ’s department look into that for i please 
 while we respect all the right of those in the trans community it be clear that biological man can not breastfeed it be remarkable that we be in a position where the labour party leader can not define a woman i think he say something like of woman do not have a penis on that basis we can not rule he out from run to be labour ’s female prime minister 
 my constituent sarah have be wait more than month for a biometric resident ’s permit during which time she can not work access free healthcare or leave the country will someone do something to get she the status she deserve so that she can go on with her life 
 i would be happy to look into the case for the hon gentleman 
 the number of foreign national offender eligible for deportation have now reach a record almost almost of those leave prison more than year ago and even those volunteering for deportation be still here will the minister get a grip on the deportation department within the home office and make sure those people be chuck out of our country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we want those individual to leave the country as swiftly as possible the published figure show that fno return increase follow the pandemic by in the late month period end december compare with the previous month period but quite clearly there be more work to be do 
 liverpool be a city of sanctuary currently we have afghan family who have be languish in a hotel for year the council must rehouse the family by   august can the minister say what will happen if we be unable to find suitable accommodation will they be make homeless and throw out on the street 
 the minister for veterans affairs my right hon friend   the member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer   and i launch a programme that provide significant support to council like liverpool to help individual find alternative accommodation that might be in the private rental sector or it might be in social housing but i think we can all agree on the principle that it be not right for individual or family to live in hotel accommodation for over year we need to help those people out of the hotel this summer 
 the immigration minister ’s early claim will come as news to the labour and conservative coalition which run north lanarkshire council and a surprise to a director of mears who confirm to i that north lanarkshire council house not just asylum seeker but refugee the immigration minister have now give factually wrong information to this house time when will he apologise to the house and will he come back to it to give proper information 
 i do not think i have give factually wrong information they may not be the fact the hon gentleman want to hear but they be the fact i do   not mention north lanarkshire but there be asylum seeker there i think the hon gentleman would agree that there be more to be do 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will make a statement on road fuel price 
 from rural hamlet to coastal community it be a properly function market that ensure fair price for motorist but for that market to function customer need transparent datum to find the good price on that basis when we see fuel price rise last summer we ask the competition and markets authority to investigate whether the market be work for customer as it should today the cma publish its final market study report and i be shock by its finding rise fuel retail margin and clear evidence of a rocket upwards and a feather downwards in the pricing pattern for diesel 
 it be completely unacceptable that consumer have be pay more the financial impact of the 6p per litre increase just in the fuel margin from to cost customer of the supermarket fuel retailer £ last year alone asda ’s fuel margin target be time high for this year than in and morrisons double over the same period it be wrong that in a cost of live crisis driver do not get a fair deal on fuel and end up be overcharge 
 motorist should not be use as cash cow by the fuel industry the government will not stand for it and i know this house will not stand for it therefore we accept the cma ’s recommendation in full we will create a statutory open datum scheme for retail fuel price and an ongoing road fuel price monitor function for the uk market we will consult on the design of the open data scheme and monitoring function as soon as possible this autumn but that be not enough i have ask the cma to have a voluntary scheme up and run by next month and i fully expect fuel retailer to share accurate up to date road fuel price the cma will also continue to monitor fuel price 
 i demand that fuel retail boss stop rip off consumer by make price available so that the market can operate as it should transparency be vital for competition and to keep price down 
 i be extremely grateful to the minister for energy security and net and be delighted to see he but i be disappointed not to see the chancellor of the exchequer i would have think that this be something that he care about 
 the problem be that the government have stand for this over the past year this morning right under the government ’s nose greedy petrol retailer impose an additional cost of more than £ on people fill up their car retailer swiftly pass on price increase in the wholesale market to driver and the price rocket yet when the wholesale price drop price be lower only very slowly i think we could all see that for ourselves the rac call this 
 nothing short of astounding in a cost of living crisis 
 which confirm that 
 supermarket have n’t be treat driver fairly at the pump 
 this affect not just the cost of drive high road fuel price have a knock on effect on inflation across the economy push up price in every sector of our country 
 the cma make it clear that rural area still face the high price where supermarket pump be few and far between such as in cumbria and somerset fuel retailer be likely to have cost that be high still the cma find that fuel price in rural place such as my own in westmorland and lonsdale and in somerton and frome be on average 1.2p per litre high than those in urban area of course in rural community with poor public transport link people have no choice but to drive and the distance to travel be so much great affect in particular people who work in the care sector once again rural community feel take for grant by this government 
 solution should be to expand the 5p per litre fuel duty relief scheme to those many isolated part of cumbria that be not currently cover by it so that family in cumbria be not leave at the mercy of the most expensive fuel price 
 why do the government fail to stop greedy retailer hit family with an almost £ excess fuel bill in the place will the chancellor and the prime minister summon those company boss to downing street and press they to return those unfair profit by lower their price will the government expand the rural fuel duty relief scheme to more area to support community such as mine that be struggle with the high petrol price 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he and the rac be right to highlight the particular issue in rural community such as those that he and indeed i represent and the particular pressure on consumer there he will understand that rural fuel duty relief be a matter for the chancellor and that what we need be a properly function market that be why we be implement the finding of the cma in full and put in place an interim regime start next month 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 towards the end of last year the local radio station in milton keynes mkfm publish research show that although there be considerable competition in milton keynes petrol and diesel price be substantially high across the board than those in equivalent urban area i very much welcome the proposal for a real time fuel price comparator but will my right hon friend assure i that the government will keep an eye on price differential between different urban area and intervene if necessary 
 as ever my hon friend champion his constituency in this house i completely agree that be why the monitoring function be so important in tandem with transparency we have to make sure that people can see the price we know that consumer be prepared to travel but if they do not know that there be a cheap price available or mile down the road they will not access it that be something that we aim to put right 
 i call the shadow minister 
 people across britain be face the high mortgage cost in europe the high inflation among advanced economy and the high tax burden in year they be pay the price for year of conservative failure 
 in that context it be more important than ever for the competition and markets authority to do all it can to help to bring down price effective competition in the interest of consumer must be at the heart of our economy that be why we firmly support the cma ’s proposal to help to bring down the cost of fuel 
 fill up the tank at supermarket be an essential part of everyday life for family and small business across the country so the fact that the average annual supermarket margin on fuel increase by 6p per litre between and be deeply worrying 
 i be pleased to see that the secretary of state have accept the recommendation from the cma to stop retailer artificially inflate petrol price during a cost of living crisis as he say transparency be very important however give that the then business secretary write to fuel retailer and the cma more than a year ago to highlight apparent unfairness in fuel price why have it take so long for the government to take action on this issue motorist do not need a report to tell they that they be be fleece by fuel retailer they see it every time they fill up at the pump why do the government need to wait for the cma to tell they what everyone else know before they take action 
 in northern ireland the consumer council publish a fuel price checker in september which have help to keep fuel cost below those in england why have the government take almost year to agree to do the same in england once again it be too little too late from a government who have again sit on their hand i note what the minister say about an interim voluntary scheme and about consult as soon as possible but can he give a clear indication of when the government will introduce the change in the law that be need to make this permanent 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the cost of live crisis and the level of taxis that of course be why her party get into power would be such a disaster for ordinary consumer and motorist throughout the country we have come through the pandemic and make sure we have keep the country afloat for instance the government support pay nearly half of everyone ’s energy bill through the last winter a labour government would be a threat to market such as this which we need to function properly not in the way they would under labour 
 as for why this have take so long the hon lady ought to know have see the disaster of her £ energy borrowing package which dematerialise it be a great announcement but it do not survive contact with reality 
 rise 
 order i think we need to help the minister the subject of the urgent question be road fuel price and i think we should stick to that i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 when the chancellor announce that he be cut fuel duty by 5p a litre which cost the exchequer billion of pound little do he expect that as outline so persuasively today by the cma it would feed through immediately into the profit of fuel retailer although cynical british motorist may not be surprised because they observe it themselves on a day to day basis i welcome the step that the minister have announce and urge he to act with great speed in implement they but be he as surprised as i be that he have be ask this urgent question by the liberal democrats who vote at their conference to hike fuel duty sharply 
 i would like to say i be shocked or surprised but i be not because as everyone in the house know except the tiny number who sit on the liberal democrat bench hypocrisy be their main method of behaviour the initial government cut in fuel duty of 5p per litre represent saving for consumer worth about £ we on the conservative benches be on the side of the motorist we be go to make sure that the market work and motorist be properly serve by it 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the minister say he will not stand for motorist be rip off but that be exactly what minister have do the government have be complacent the whole time follow the 5p fuel duty cut 
 why have it take the cma so long to establish that motorist be be gouge by 6p per litre compare with it report that diesel price be an astonishing 13p per litre higher this year alone than they should have be that be symptomatic of the cost of greed crisis asda receive a fine for not comply with the cma investigation that show an astonishing level of arrogance on the part of supermarket that be rip off their own customer it be estimate that we be pay nearly £ l a year in additional fuel cost due to the lack of competition how do impose an initial fine of £ on asda work as a deterrent when it be make so much money 
 i be all for an open datum fuel finder scheme but really be that it i already use an app to shop around for cheap fuel price so this open datum will not necessarily bring competition in all area of the uk and reliance on an app obviously will not help those who be digitally exclude what be the government ’s actual plan to ensure competition and reduce fuel price especially at motorway service station which be between 20p to 30p per litre more expensive when will we see these fuel price come down 
 that be the close i have ever see the hon gentleman come to welcome a government response so i shall take that with i i do not mean to try your patience any more than i already do mr speaker but as i say to   the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy whether it be major energy package or shipbuilding we find that do the work lead to well long term outcome 
 give corporation tax carbon taxis the windfall tax fuel duty and vat be not the bulk of the price at the pump and of other fuel now tax base will my right hon friend remind we of how much be tax and urge the chancellor to reduce some of those taxis to cut the cost of living 
 i thank my right hon friend for champion the consumer as he always do as he will be well aware tax be a matter for the chancellor but the whole house will have hear his passionate call to make sure that taxis be hold down to the low amount they possibly can be that be more reason why we can not have the labour party take control of the country 
 in march the rac reveal that retailer be make a time big margin on diesel than they be at the beginning of last year and motorist be see absolutely no benefit from the chancellor ’s fuel duty cut give the government ’s dither and delay on take any sort of action how do the minister feel when the government ’s flagship policy to help motorist be have little to no impact 
 we be furious that these price cut have not be pass on to consumer that be why we ask the cma to investigate and to get far into the detail and it be why we will implement its finding in full 
 as my right hon friend be aware i have be campaign on the issue of fuel price in west berkshire for about a year and a half thing that have be particularly disappointing be the fact that fuel price in every single neighbouring constituency be to low i write to the cma and i be pretty disappointed to read its response today which tell we a lot 
 i welcome the introduction of a real time fuel price comparator but such a tool already exist albeit in a slightly clunky form i draw the minister ’s attention to the fact that it be not enough just to tell people what the price be at different pump in their local area it must be transparent to consumer whether they be in a general area that have high or low price so that their mp can make representation on what the supermarket may be do in that area and the cma can intervene properly 
 my hon friend have be assiduous and as she have show with her question focus and detail in try to rectify a problem that the cma have fully display today it be an unusual way round but i would be happy to meet she to discuss the matter far to make sure we put in place all the right element so that this transparency genuinely get through to the consumer 
 there be no doubt that fuel cost be drive up inflation especially in rural area i think the fuel price checker have have a dampening effect in northern ireland because the supermarket be always aware that that they be be look on however do the minister accept that his government also have a responsibility net policy with all their associate taxis whether it be the emission   trading scheme green levy or fuel duty drive up price too the government have a role to play in reduce inflation as well as in transparency on supermarket price 
 the right hon gentleman be draw the wrong conclusion from the sky high price of the past year or it be sky high international fossil fuel price that cause the enormous squeeze the fast we can move to clean and cheap source of energy the soon we can ensure that our constituent save money and contribute to deal with what be an ever more serious threat 
 have bring a minute rule motion on this subject some year ago i be delighted that patience have finally pay off issue i be raise at that time be the inequality between the price in town and those on motorway which the scottish national party spokesman have mention be my right hon friend confident that the measure be bring in today will reduce those 15p or 20p premium on road fuel price at motorway service station compare with normal area 
 as so often my hon friend have be ahead of i the issue he raise be part of the picture like he i have observe that the captive market along motorway be subject to high price than elsewhere i hope that can be part of our consideration to make sure we have a system that work at its good for everybody 
 may i respectfully point out to the minister that this be not a town versus country or urban versus rural issue the rac have identify that some retailer be grossly profiteer take a time big margin than they be at the beginning of last year particularly on diesel sale for the avoidance of doubt will he confirm that the government scheme he have outline today will apply to all fuel retailer not just those at supermarket 
 i will write to the hon gentleman with the precise detail of everybody who will be include he be right to highlight that this be not just an issue in urban area however in those area there tend to be more competition and easy transparency than there can be in rural and coastal area 
 a couple of week ago i draw the house ’s attention to the fact that the same supermarket tanker would unload fuel at 10p a litre cheap in place than it would if it come to mile up the road to my constituency if today ’s report do not fix that it will not have be good enough and the government will have more work to do i hope that my right hon friend will give i some reassurance on that point 
 we have to make sure the market work transparency be our big single weapon and we need to be do this in a way that reach people be they digitally enable or not we be wrestle with those detail let we look at the alternative to a market base system other country have try it as it be a populist measure it do not work it lead to a shortage of supply and it end up create the very dominance that we seek to ensure be not exploit in system such as we have see in this cma report 
 the hon member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous   ask a good and apposite question in february i write to all the major supermarket that have outlet in chesterfield ask they why they be retail petrol for 10p more a litre there than they be sell it for just mile up the road in sheffield they be very transparent and honest about this say it ’ a market where we think we can make more money out of chesterfield resident than we do out of sheffield resident that ’s why we charge you more that be despite the fact that there be no additional cost to get the fuel there although i welcome the great transparency make it easy for consumer what they will see in chesterfield be that they be pay more than they would up the road in sheffield be there anything in what the minister be announce today that will empower people in chesterfield to bring their price down 
 transparency 
 the good people of bridport and dorchester in west dorset have have to pay up to 20p a litre more than those in town not far away the liberal democrats have be silent about that throughout the entire duration so it be somewhat hypocritical of they to bring this matter to the house today particularly give that they vote to increase the price per litre although i welcome what the cma have have to say in its report today it do not really deal with the issue we be see of rigorous yield management by supermarket with their petrol price that be not a matter of competition that be where they believe they can get more money out of a particular group people or community i would be very pleased if the minister would meet i to look at how we can take this forward and grasp that issue 
 i would be delighted to do so 
 now that we know that competition on fuel price have weaken in recent year and that that have lead to inflated price particularly in my constituency where despite a campaign for fair price lead by stuart mcmillan msp we have be pay over the odd for year may i seek a guarantee that supermarket food price be not follow the same pattern 
 follow this report the cma have decide to look into the supermarket and will report back as soon as next month 
 i thank the cma for its report and the government for accept the recommendation although i think we be put too much faith in price transparency to solve the market problem i be interested to see in the trend profit margin for supermarket retailer and non supermarket retailer that supermarket be consistently increase their margin while non supermarket retailer be not will the minister follow up with retailer in the light of this report to make sure that we check that the margin come down next year and in the following year 
 i thank my hon friend for his typically penetrate question as i say of the recommendation be to maintain a monitoring function which will help to give we the market intelligence so that if further intervention be require we will have the datum on which to base it 
 patchy public transport contribute to high cost for rural household as many people have no choice but to use their car for essential journey despite this the rural fuel duty relief scheme do not apply to a single area in wales will the minister commit to press the treasury to reconsider the scheme to take into account access to local public transport network as well as provide a guarantee of inclusion for welsh area 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question and will ensure that his majesty ’s treasury be aware of it 
 the good people of scunthorpe spot this issue some time ago so i thank my right hon friend for his work on it and the measure he be recommend have the similar open data scheme that have be trialle in germany result in a boost in competitiveness if so when do my right hon friend think we will start to see the result at the pump here 
 i hope from as soon as next month under a voluntary scheme my hon friend give i the perfect opportunity to repeat how determined i be to see the company provide the datum so that we have something far less clunky as it have be call and far more comprehensive than what we have today and so that that can lead to the benefit that have be find elsewhere 
 i be not certain that the seriousness of the situation that face rural constituency be be take appropriately into account my angus constituent live in town and landward area that be mile away from supermarket fuel they pay the high price for fuel they have no public transport to speak of so have to use their car and vehicle they pay the high delivery price and they be often on the low wage if the minister think that great transparency over fuel price be go to help he be stretch the point my constituent in angus know how expensive their fuel be and they know how far they have to travel to get cheap fuel this announcement will not fix the situation we need the treasury to get its act together and intervene in what be essentially critical national infrastructure which be what road fuel be 
 i will take that as a further representation to his majesty ’s treasury 
 motorist in and around kettering have long suspect that petrol and diesel forecourt retailer have be inflate price well above where they should be price go up far too quickly and come down far too slowly give the fact that the petrol and diesel forecourt retailer effectively ignore the letter from the business secretary in may will the minister assure my constituent that the competition and markets authority will continue to monitor the market closely to ensure that do not happen again 
 my hon friend be quite right urge they to behave properly be not enough which be why we will not only put in place a mandatory system to ensure that the data be there but ensure ongoing monitoring so that as i say to our hon friend   the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller we have the datum on which to base further intervention should that be require 
 this be a very welcome announcement especially in respect of the information on fuel price competition that will allow driver to look for fuel at petrol station that be close and have well price thereby enable they to save money on any potential fuel fund offer there be an old generation i be probably of they who perhaps do not use app and therefore do not understand how they work what step will the minister take to ensure that they have access to information on fuel funding that be accessible for they and easily understand so that they too can take advantage of what be on offer 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i would not want to finish without mention that as of   monday june unleaded petrol be 143.43p per litre and that have reduce on average by 47.5p from june last year and diesel be 145.6p per litre and that have reduce by 53.3p per litre on the previous year i will write to the hon gentleman to make sure that i can properly inform he in answer to his question 
 this report clearly show that resident in burnley and padiham and our village have be overcharge for their fuel for too long do my right hon friend think that the competition and markets authority now need to relook at the ownership change at asda 
 as the minister for energy security and net that perhaps stretch slightly beyond my brief but as those on treasury bench will have hear my hon friend ’s question i be sure that he will be able follow up with other who have direct responsibility 
 i wish to thank the secretary of state for health and social care for come to the chamber to make his statement it be a pity that the prime minister do not do so on friday when the world hear what he have to say before we do the prime minister be a member of parliament he be answerable to the members of parliament from all political party i have to say that his behaviour be not acceptable he may be the prime minister but the members of parliament should hear i be very pleased that the secretary of state be do it the right way
