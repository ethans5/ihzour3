 thank you chairman of ways and means that be very effective may i say i would expect nothing less 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what progress her department have make on ensure equality of school funding through the national funding formula 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of core school funding for the academic year 
 the government introduce fairness into school funding under labour we get disproportionately inflate school budget in place such as london while constituency such as mine be underfunde for over a decade it be the conservatives who introduce the national funding formula which fund school fairly objectively and most importantly base on the need of pupil not political ideology not only that this year school budget be up by over £ and next year school will be fund at their high level in history at £ 
 my right hon friend will be aware that worcestershire county council languish among the weak local authority for funding per pupil as a result a lot of pressure have be put on other budget include the high need and special educational need and disability budget worcestershire now face a deficit of more than £ in those budget can she do something to help county such as worcestershire to meet those important demand for our young people 
 i be conscious of the pressure that many local authority have face on their high need budget nationally high need funding be set to increase by between and next year worcestershire will receive more than £ for its high need budget the department be also support individual local authority to tackle financial sustainability through programme the safety valve programme for those with the high deficit and deliver better value in send which will help local authority include worcestershire to develop plan to reform their system to reach a sustainable footing 
 the recent accounting error by the secretary of state ’s department will mean a cut of more than £ for school in bristol that money could have be spend on breakfast club send provision mental health support or even such basic as pay the energy bill the prime minister say in this conference speech that his main funding priority in every spending review from now on will be education but he be cut school budget now do the secretary of state not realise the impact that will have on school whose budget have already be cut to the bone 
 i take the error in the july notional national funding formula figure very seriously but it be important to note that school do not receive notification of their actual budget until february march the department act quickly to correct the error well before school set their final budget there be no cut £ which i have talk about many time from this dispatch box be the number that school will be fund at next year at my direction peter wyman the chair of the institute of chartered accountants will lead a rigorous independent external review of the department ’s quality assurance process 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 i be grateful to the permanent secretary for write to the committee as soon as that recent funding error be identify and for her apology for the concern that it cause although no actual money be lose to school as a result it reflect the complexity of the current system we have promise a fair formula for funding which will flow directly to school when do minister expect to be able to legislate to put that in place 
 it be our intention to legislate but i can not give a date for that at the dispatch box i will keep my hon friend inform 
 despite north west leicestershire deliver consistently the high economic growth in the country with the result tax revenue benefit to the treasury my constituent have be blight by very low per pupil funding for a long time as leicestershire have bump along the bottom of the funding table for decade do the secretary of state have any word of comfort for my constituent 
 the introduction of the nff will direct resource accord to need that have mean that funding have be redistribute to catch up with these change those with the high number of pupil with additional need will also be target via the nff 
 what step she be take to help support student with the cost of living 
 what step she be take to help support student with the cost of living 
 this year and last year the government have provide £ of cost of live support in england in education more than a of child get free school meal university tuition fee have be freeze and we have provide £ of student premium to help the most disadvantaged students.[official report   october vol c. 5mc 
 during my late meeting with student leader in canterbury they tell i that often new student will visit the food bank the campus pantry before they have even unpack their bag or settle in in the academic year student visit by that number have rise to a rise in regular food bank user they expect a similar rise this   academic year what will the government do to help all those include student and staff on campus who be force to turn to food bank 
 i know the hon lady care deeply about the welfare of her student we be do everything we can to help student with the cost of living i mention the £ of her university canterbury christ church university provide a £ bursary to student every family have receive from the government on average £ for energy bill and other support we be try to be fair to the taxpayer but fair to student and ensure the most disadvantaged be help 
 while the cost of food heating and rent have rocket the value of the student maintenance loan have fall by £ in real term since recent research by the university of nottingham students union reveal that the cost of living crisis be affect student education and their physical and mental health it find that almost in student have a weekly budget of £ or less after rent and in have a weekly budget of £ or less after rent and bill per cent have consider leave university because of the difficulty they face pay for essential do the minister think that these be acceptable condition for student to be struggle under 
 it be precisely because of the figure the hon lady set out that we be help student with £ to try to ensure we help the most disadvantaged student her own university she mention nottingham university give a £ bursary to disadvantaged student we be also give up to £ of extra help to disadvantaged family we have freeze tuition fee and we look at loan repayment if family income fall below so we be do everything possible to support the most disadvantaged to get high education.[official report   october vol c. 6mc 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we have hear this be a very serious issue recent research from the national union of students show that almost in full time student work more than hour per week alongside their study they be work even more than in previous year and of student say that work be have a negative impact on their study student be clearly struggle with the conservatives cost of living crisis how do the minister expect student to balance their study and employment to pay their bill do he acknowledge that this be now force many student out of high education 
 actually the opposite be true we have a record number of student go to university disadvantaged student be more likely to go to university now than they be in we have a huge package of support i have mention the £ for disadvantaged student we be do everything we can to help disadvantaged student the hon gentleman criticise the money we be give but do not come up with a figure of his own warm word butter no parsnip 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the minister mention some thing that be maybe try to help these student but recent higher education policy institute analysis show that student who previously receive free school meal be less likely to complete their degree and those who do be less likely to get a or a 2:1 support can not stop once they get to university will he detail what support he be give those student at every stage of their journey to make sure they really do have the same opportunity as those from more privileged background 
 many university offer bursary to student i highlight example to previous questioner and we be do everything possible to ensure that student who do course get good skill and good job at the end that be the purpose of our high education reform which as i understand it the snp oppose 
 what step she be take to increase the number of primary school child meeting expect standard in math 
 since we have reform the math curriculum reflect international good practice and introduce a network of math hub to boost the quality of teaching in primary pupil achieve their high ever score in the late timss trend in international mathematic and science study international survey and ofsted recently find a resounding positive shift in primary math education 
 when will the government learn that early year matter in child leave primary school without core math skill and never catch up do the minister agree that instead of force everyone to study math to we should focus on early year and encourage a more positive attitude to learn math rather than leave it hang over pupil 
 in fact we be focus on both we have reform the early year foundation stage to ensure that there be more interaction between adult and pupil in that stage with a focus on numeracy and english as well in we take the singapore primary curriculum as the basis of our primary math and we introduce the multiplication table check for year pupil an increase number of pupil be now fluent in their time table in a way that generation of child in the past have not be 
 the hon member for ealing southall mr sharma   and the minister be both right to stress the importance of math but what be vital to all good teaching be proper school place plan on the isle of wight councillor be prove unwilling to deliver or incapable of deliver a school place plan despite their legal duty will the minister work with i to ensure that the isle of wight council act to fulfil its legal duty soon 
 order the hon member must try to keep to the main question he really be drift he must return to the subject of primary education 
 will you allow i to raise this subject during topical question instead mr speaker 
 no 
 okay i be sorry sir thank you 
 will the minister work with i to ensure that the isle of wight council act to fulfil its legal obligation at present it be let down parent pupil and teacher 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue we be aware that the isle of wight be experience a decline in the number of primary school child which be create surplus place the department be monitor the situation closely and the south east regional director will be meet the local authority next month to discuss this and other concern that we have about the isle of wight 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of pupil persistently absent from school 
 improve attendance be of my top priority our attendance hub now support school benefit more than pupil of school subscribe to our attendance datum tool to spot at risk pupil and we have specialist programme help some of the most vulnerable include child with social worker child with special educational need and young people face particular issue such as mental ill health our approach be start to turn the tide recent datum show that few child be persistently not at school last year but absence level be still too high and that remain my no priority 
 as the secretary of state have say progress in reduce persistent absence be not as fast as anyone would like and in place such as blackpool the attendance monitor pilot will be crucial however accord to the charity school home support which have be work in blackpool for month there be a need to focus on more than just individual pupil and the whole family support model be also crucial will the secretary of state meet i along with representative of school home support to hear about the pertinent lesson that they have learn in blackpool which contain the most deprived neighbourhood in the country if we can not get it right in blackpool where else be we go to get it right 
 i entirely agree with my hon friend school home support do incredible work in blackpool the government ’s support family programme back by £ focus on attendance by support the whole family blackpool be also of our priority education investment area with family support worker help school to improve attendance i be   sure that my right hon friend the minister for schools would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these issue far 
 it be not uncommon for kid who have have a brain injury particularly a significant brain injury to receive plenty of care and support at school immediately after the event but some to month later to suffer real cognitive problem they may suffer from depression or anxiety they may sometimes be unable to inhibit themselves and they may stop turn up for school and start get into trouble can the secretary of state commission a specific piece of work on provide protection and support for those child and their family who desperately need it 
 as the hon gentleman know he and i both work on this topic when i have a different role of course we want all child to be help to get into school because they can only benefit from this fantastic education if they be there and of course school should make adjustment if child need they i be sure that my right hon friend the minister for schools will be happy to meet he as well in order to understand far what more we can do in this regard 
 what step her department be take to improve provision for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step her department be take to improve provision for child with special educational need and disability

 local authority have spend nearly a quarter of a pound fight parent at send tribunal since yet they have a failure rate of over what step be the department take to overhaul that process which have cause send parent in northampton south unnecessary distress 
 my hon friend be right to say that tribunal be costly and stressful but it be important to say that most education health and care need assessment   and plan be conclude without a tribunal hearing we will be introduce new national standard strengthen mediation and great system wide accountability to give family the support they need early and reduce the number of tribunal 
 i be of mp from across the chamber who sign the f40 letter to my right hon friend the chancellor urge significant investment in sen will my hon friend behind the scene at least endorse that campaign and also look at how we can reduce the reliance on education health and care plan which be a barrier to so many young people get the education they need 
 it be probably worth say that i be an f40 mp myself and i meet the group just last week to hear its concern on my hon friend ’s point about ehcp through the reform plan we be work to get parent the support they need for their child at an early stage so that they do not always need an ehcp to get that support 
 there be a crisis in funding for send in walsall south in old church primary pupil have special need which be of the school total how can the minister target the funding to the school that really need it do he agree that when ofsted inspect it should take into account child with special need in school such as old church so that these be mitigate factor 
 the right hon lady make an important point about the role of ofsted and ensure that it assess that provision it be worth say that there will have be a per head increase in walsall between and but i would be happy to meet she to discuss the issue far 
 thank to government support local conservative in the london borough of bexley have secure an incredible £ to expand and improve send provision in our borough do my hon friend agree that it be vital that local authority charity school and family work closely together to maximise the educational impact of this government back funding 
 my hon friend make an important point and i pay tribute to his campaigning on this issue and to the work of bexley council it be absolutely the case that people should be engage not just with school and family but with local charity which be often well place to understand the need of family and their child 
 family in selby and ainsty have be wait nearly half a decade for spade in the ground at a new send school for the selby area will the minister meet i to ensure that there be no further delay to this vital project 
 the hon gentleman and i have exchange letter about this matter we remain absolutely committed to the school and i would be happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 the send crisis extend to devon and my postbag be full of correspondence from parent try to get their child the educational provision they need it have get so bad that in some case child be be teach in school cupboard and devon have appoint a send champion to its cabinet what step be the department take to help boost send service in rural area such as mine 
 there have be a increase in the per head funding to school in devon for their special educational need provision and the whole thrust of our reform plan be to make the system work well for parent and family and get the support for their child at the stage when they need it.[official report   october vol c. 6mc 
 we now come to the shadow minister 
 lose lose lose cost a fortune and not provide the right service those be not my word but those of the secretary of state describe the send system over which her government have be preside for the last year will the minister tell the house when he expect the plan that the government have announce for send to make a difference to the long waiting time and lack of support experience by so many family across the country 
 we have already begin the reform programme and have just launch the change partnership which be already start to make a difference to the provision i would just say to the hon lady that this be yet another area where the labour party have absolutely no policy whatsoever.[official report   october vol c. 7mc 
 what step her department be take to promote the uptake of high technical qualification 
 we be revolutionise our skill offer by introduce high technical qualification at more than provider at level and this include £ for provider and £ for institute of technology i note that the opposition want to rebadge institute of technology as technical college of excellence in our view all our college be place of technical excellence 
 i welcome the government ’s plan to introduce a new advanced british standard to help to remove the artificial divide between technical and academic qualification give that the need for technical skill exist right across the united kingdom can my right hon friend confirm that this new qualification will live up to its name and be truly british like the t level before it and therefore be available to education setting in scotland that choose it 
 my hon friend be a champion of science technology engineering math and skill and he will know that education be devolve the devolved administration be responsible for their education system   but the department for education be work with the government of the uk we engage at both official and ministerial level when the advanced british standard be announce we look forward to continue engagement as it be hopefully adopt across the united kingdom 
 i thank the minister for his response and his positivity i echo the request of   the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid   to ensure that all the benefit of high education be present not only here on the mainland but across the whole united kingdom i know that be the minister ’s wish but can he confirm that when it come to high technical qualification girl and lady will have the same opportunity as young fella and young man 
 i thank my hon friend he be my hon friend for his question we be absolutely committed to make sure that woman take up high technical qualification and we be do everything we can to support they with career advice to ensure that more take up stem subject in particular 
 i call the shadow minister 
 increase the take up of high technical qualification be desperately need with low take up lead to persistent skill gap and hold back economic growth college which we be proud to celebrate during love our colleges week tell we of issue affect take up include a lack of quality career advice challenge with stable staffing and late course approval with the uk see only of adult whose high qualification be between level and level the low rate in the g7 should not the government address their cut to career advice as labour will so that young people do not miss out because they hear about opportunity far too late 
 i congratulate the hon lady on her new position but i genuinely do not know what planet she have be live on these past few year we introduce high technical qualification and be transform qualification across the country we introduce t level and spend £ to transform career advice per cent of school be in a career hub and we have the national careers service we be do a lot of work to support career and we be spend something like £ to ensure that apprenticeship and skill be teach in school up and down the country more than school and pupil we be do huge amount on career and we be the people who transform skill in our country 
 i think we ’ve get the story the extra chapter be fine 
 what assessment her department have make of the adequacy of the provision of music education in school 
 i congratulate the hon lady on her appointment as shadow minister for music and tourism 
 the government expect every school to teach music for at least an hour a week support by our music hub network include the greater manchester hub lead by the bolton music service and back by £ of capital for instrument and a new £ bursary for trainee music teacher 
 last month ofsted report 
 there remain a divide between the opportunity for child and young people whose family can afford to pay for music tuition and for those who come from low socio economic background 
 it also say that 
 half the primary school visit do not offer any instrumental or vocal lesson 
 and that what lesson exist be be teach by non specialist teacher in third of primary school this be a damn reflection of the substantial decline in the provision of music education in england over which conservative lead government have preside what urgent action will the government take in response to these finding 
 from september next year every music hub will be require to support music tuition for disadvantaged pupil we be invest £ in a music progression programme in education investment area to support up to pupil to learn an instrument from to between and of all hour teach in music be teach by a teacher with a relevant post a level qualification there be now full time music teacher in our secondary school which be up from last year 
 xyz music academy teach over child across buckinghamshire on a weekly basis employ tutor its online primary school music curriculum xyz primary help primary school with small budget to deliver music provision to a high standard adhere to the model music curriculum and ofsted requirement will my right hon friend visit xyz to learn more from this innovative small business that could be adopt more widely across the country 
 i would be delighted to visit xyz music in school be a personal passion for i i want to see more of it and a well quality of it in we publish the model music curriculum which be design to help primary and secondary school to improve their music education it take year to produce and be write by a panel of music education practitioner include ed watkins head of music at the west london free school and julian lloyd webber the panel be chair by baroness fleet i would love to discuss that curriculum and learn more about xyz 
 what step she be take to improve school building 
 well maintain school building be a priority for this government and we will spend whatever it take to keep child and staff safe we have allocate £ in 24—£15   since to improve the condition of school building and we be work to address reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete we be transform hundred of school across the country through our school rebuilding programme 
 the excellent lakes school at troutbeck bridge serve the community of windermere and ambleside and those far afield with to-18 education but it be widely acknowledge that the school need a full rebuild because the building be well beyond their sell by date because of the unique history of the site on which i be happy to brief the minister separately it be very likely that we will have significant charitable and private fund to help towards a rebuild as long as there be some government support as well will he agree to meet i and the school leader to talk about how we can make sure that a brilliant school have a bright future 
 absolutely i will be delighted to meet the hon gentleman we want all our school include excellent school such as the lakes school in the lake district to have the good quality school building that be our priority and i will be delighted to meet he and teacher at the school to discuss how to make it happen in his constituency 
 this conservative government will fund a new school to replace the flood prone tipton st john primary school however that can happen only once a suitable alternative site be find will my right hon friend do everything possible to speed up the process so that pupil have a safe new school as soon as possible 
 we be work actively with the diocese of exeter and with devon county council to identify suitable site for the school site appraisal be due to be complete by the end of this year once a site be identify we will work with the diocese and the council to expedite the acquisition of the site i fully understand and share my hon friend ’s desire for urgency in this matter 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last week the government add another school and college to the raac list bring the total to the education secretary claim that child prefer to learn in portacabin but it be far from a joke when some be still wait for temporary classroom study from home or in cramp sport hall and dining room can the minister confirm the total number of pupil who be already impact and be expect to be impact by this chaos when will all child receive undisrupted face to face learn surely that be the minimum that a parent can expect for their child 
 i congratulate the hon lady on her education question and her appointment as shadow schools minister although this be not our exchange since her appointment she be right there be school and college with confirm raac which be an increase from the we announce in september of those school the pupil at or be in full time face to face education and school or college be   offer hybrid face to face and remote education our objective and our focus be to ensure that school be support to put in place immediate measure to enable face to face education to continue 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the effectiveness of the holiday activity and food programme 
 the holiday activity and food programme introduce by this government be hugely important to family up and down the country and support child last summer we know the positive impact that these programme be have on a range of issue such as by improve attendance child in stoke who attend a haf programme run by the kingsland ce academy increase their school attendance by and be no long consider to be persistently absent that be just example of the wonderful work that haf programme do and there be also strong evidence that they improve health behaviour and confidence in child 
 i have see at hand just how brilliant the government back holiday activity and food programme be for child and young people and their family in eastbourne in magical piece of feedback a little girl at the art house café sidle up to i and say day i will own a place just like this and i have see the same energy across the piece give that we be hop that there be a connection between attendance and haf uptake what more can we do to provide and promote opportunity for child and young people with send and also for the plus and early teen 
 when it launch haf be the summer camp for hundred of thousand of children—70 have never experience a holiday club before and this summer child benefit in east sussex haf be open to child from age to local authority should meet the need of all cohort include by offer programme for old child and those with special educational need i urge all hon member to visit their local haf over the christmas recess they really be heart warming 
 i have visit my local haf in washington over the last few summer and i certainly will if there be at christmas do the minister have any plan to extend the scheme far there be obviously a lot more need than the current haf scheme can meet especially with the cost of living crisis 
 as i mention child be help just this summer our independent evaluation find that around third of the child attend overall live in some of the most deprive area across the country so we believe we be get the target right we be very proud of this programme which we think be a brilliant addition to the landscape and we want to ensure that it benefit as many people as possible 
 whether her department have conduct a review of the effectiveness of provider access legislation 
 we be hugely strengthen technical and provider access in school we have legislate for pupil to have encounter with apprentice organisation and technical college ofsted be look closely at career guidance and the apprentice support and knowledge network be go into over school support pupil and encourage they to take up apprenticeship or other skill offering 
 college in southport have raise concern about career advice opportunity for student with send specifically about the suitability of the oversight and the suppose add value of these session will my right hon friend detail what step the government be take to ensure that these session be personalise well to support send student in their transition into employment 
 my hon friend be a champion for special need pupil and he be absolutely right we need to ensure that special need pupil have employment opportunity along with everybody else we be invest over £ over the next year in support internship scheme for high special need to-19 pupil we have a mentor scheme for disabled apprentice the careers enterprise company have put in send support to ensure high quality career guidance and training and of send school be now part of career hub 
 as supportive as i be of this scheme i do not think that up to session really cut it will the minister consider a scheme similar to aimhigher which be introduce by the previous labour government to encourage young people into high education and down the vocational route this would give young people mentor who have be through apprenticeship scheme and really get they hooked on the opportunity that vocational education can bring 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s question my speech in the house of commons be about that very subject the encounter that i mention be the minimum obviously many school do more only last week i attend oasis school in bristol and watch student be encourage to take up apprenticeship and to hold an apprenticeship career fair we be do huge amount i mention the apprenticeship skill and knowledge network which be go around school and encourage pupil to take up apprenticeship that involve more than school and pupil we need to do as much as possible to educate student about apprenticeship and to ensure that they have the encounter that he rightly talk about 
 what step her department be take to increase access to childcare for work parent 
 this conservative government be invest more in childcare than at any other point in our country ’s history ensure that parent do not have to choose between have a family or have a career with hour of free childcare on offer from the end of parental leave to the start of school the under secretary of state my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston i welcome he to his place be work hard to expand the capacity through new capital investment more avenue into the workforce and increase childcare rate 
 at a westminster hall debate on childcare early this year before the secretary of state ’s propose change be announce i express concern that low income family be face high childcare cost that might make it sub economic to return to work will she tell i how the change that she have be make will help prevent that 
 i thank my hon friend for his question just to remind everybody under labour parent get just hour for and year old less than an hour of free childcare per year in office we will be spend more than £ a year by to fund hour of free childcare for work parent of child age month to the start of primary school and give every parent access to wraparound childcare between am and pm meanwhile labour still do not have a policy for parent 
 a nursery owner in my constituency tell i how the government ’s funding for so call free hour cover only about half of their cost and even with the recently announce uplift for and year old the rate simply do not meet their need the early years alliance find that a of childcare provider suggest that they may close within a year due to rise cost what will the secretary of state do to ensure that all these parent who be be tell that they be now eligible for free childcare be actually able to access some 
 specifically i will deliver free childcare for all parent of month old until they start school we have work with business to make sure that we get this right we be support the development of new place by increase the rate by up to £ this year and £ next year we also have a huge programme of work we will be consider all option to make sure that we be increase the capacity in the system and that there be enough money in the system to deliver on our policy 
 whether her department be take step to increase the number of multi disciplinary subject teach to student before university 
 i share my hon friend ’s view about the importance of a broad curriculum which be why the english baccalaureate combination of core gcse be so important english math at least science a humanity and a foreign language be a key preparation for the advanced british standard at age to the proportion of pupil enter for the ebacc have increase from in to in 
 when i be a student and a bit of a surfer dude at the university of southern california i be strike by the fact that americans when they go to university do not have to make the choice when they be or between art and science will the initiative announce by the secretary of state in manchester mean that in future british student will not have to make that early choice 
 increase the number of subject under the advanced british standard mean that student will have the benefit of the great breadth of study that my hon friend reference from his own experience as a surfing dude the intention be that major will have comparable depth and rigour to a level so that they can support progression include to university 
 what step her department be take to support people age to in education 
 we be invest an additional £ over the course of the parliament to strengthen post-16 education and training and we will boost to-19 funding by £ compare with we have launch our t level programme and of apprenticeship start in provisionally be by young people under 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer do the department have any jurisdiction over an academy refuse to offer a form place to a high perform pupil with special educational need who have more than meet the academic requirement for 
 i be really sorry to hear about the difficult experience of my hon friend ’s constituent i be disturb to hear what have go on i know that my hon friend have raise the matter in correspondence with the department which the under secretary of state my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston recently address i hope that her constituent be now safely settle in at her new college but the schools minister and i will absolutely look at this again 
 i call emma hardy not here 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the number of apprenticeship start in the academic year 
 there be more than start in the academic year and more people undertake high level apprenticeship with start at level and above increase by those be provisional figure further figure will be set out in november we be increase investment in apprenticeship to £ by 
 i thank the minister for that answer but give the decline in level and apprenticeship start might it be an idea to consider the view of lead industry expert who be call for the ringfencing of apprenticeship for to year old 
 i say to the hon gentleman whom i respect enormously that of apprentice be at level or i hop that he would be get up to celebrate the apprenticeship start in birmingham selly oak since may 
 what step she be take to help ensure the availability of high quality childcare 
 we be invest over £ to expand the current free childcare entitlement offer to eligible work parent of child age to month we be also increase the hourly rate for childcare provider for the exist entitlement and funding rate will be confirm in the autumn 
 the government ’s proposal will lead to thousand more family expect to access childcare so we might expect to see more childcare opening however in the past year some nursery have already close and in my constituency of walthamstow there be now child chase every childcare place why do the minister think that be the case what will he do about it and how will we ensure that in april parent who be not already access childcare can do so 
 part of the reason why we be stagger the entitlement be to ensure that we have the staff in place to deliver it in the next few week we will announce change to the process for recruit people we will launch a big campaign of recruitment in the new year to increase the workforce and i have every confidence that we will meet the commitment 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of funding for special need education 
 higher need funding for child and young people with complex need be increase by a further £ next year bring the total high need budget to £ in 25—60 high than it be in 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response and i hear the early response but there be a shortage of place in special need school special school for child who need those place will he carry out a national assessment of the number of place that be available in special school against the number of place that be need because it be result in some child have to attend mainstream school when actually they should be in special school 
 my hon friend make an important point we have approve the opening of special school and this year we collect new datum from local authority on their capacity and demand forecast for special school that will help we to support they more effectively to fulfil their duty to provide sufficient place 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 mr speaker i stand with this house in condemn the barbaric terrorist attack on israel the brutal action of hamas have send shockwave that have reverberate all the way to our shore my ministerial team and i recently meet leader from the jewish education community i be deeply move by the experience that they share but horrify by the rise in antisemitism that they face that be totally unacceptable all student deserve to learn without fear or harassment 
 disturbingly i have also see evidence of student and academic appear to support hamas let i be crystal clear hamas be a terrorist organisation and support it be a criminal act the government will take action against those who do with my ministers i have write to school college and university remind they of their duty under prevent and that incident of antisemitism will not be tolerate we teach our child the british value of liberty mutual respect and tolerance this government will always stand by those value 
 i join my right hon friend in the comment that she have just make 
 strike action in school have cause significant disruption to child and parent in my constituency and result in the loss of some school day across the country i welcome the part that my right hon friend play in bring the dispute to an end with the large pay award for teacher in year however what further step be she take to protect child from the impact of future strike action 
 my right hon friend be correct it be unacceptable that the disruption cause over day of strike action see million of school day lose that be why the government be introduce minimum service level in school and college to protect child and parent from the damaging impact of future strike action we must find a balance between teacher right to strike and protect child ’s education in the instance we have ask union to work with we on a voluntary agreement 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i join the secretary of state in recognise the impact of the conflict in the middle east on our education system here and the importance of every child be able to attend school safely 
 rate of persistent absence be now double what they be year ago labour ’s plan start with reset the relationship between family and school deliver new mental health hub and have counsellor in every secondary school and breakfast club for every primary school child the prime minister ’s step be to say that he have maxe out on support our child and now the secretary of state be blame parent for keep child at home with a cold when be minister go to get a grip on this serious problem 
 we do take this issue extremely seriously as i say it be my no priority the attendance action alliance include the children ’s commissioner department of health and social care representative social worker and many other work together the letter be send to help parent because we have notice that in some case there have be a change in attendance as a result of parent not be clear about whether they should send their child to school with minor ailment chris whitty take it upon himself to write and we very much support his action 
 persistent absence be a symptom of a wide breakdown of trust right across our school system it be no surprise give that the conservatives reopen pub before they reopen school that they have leave school to crumble and that they have allow disruptive strike action to drag on for month labour ’s priority will be to rebuild that relationship between school family and government do the secretary of state not believe that parent and child deserve a lot well than the sorry mess she be preside over today 
 the hon lady talk about responsibility and accountability when labour be warn about raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in and they do nothing when labour spend money on school rebuilding they ignore school condition altogether interruption the hon lady need to listen to this they even rebuild school and leave raac within the building a school even collapse in what do they do in wales absolutely nothing we make the tough decision labour can not even make a single decision 
 in the wake of the massacre that occur in israel the great loss of life since the holocaust case of antisemitism in this country have rise by and jewish student on our campus feel very unsafe glorification of this massacre have be carry out at warwick university bristol university university college london and the school of oriental and african studies it be unacceptable for university to tolerate such activity so will my right hon friend join i in condemn antisemitism and state what she will do to ensure that jewish student   feel safe on campus and can study like every other british citizen 
 sadly there be a number of hamas ’s useful idiot a column across some of our university the secretary of state have say that she will not stand for it the home secretary will not stand for it we have write to university this be absolutely unacceptable we expect our university to be safe place for all jewish student 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 if the pay offer for teacher in england have match the award for teacher in scotland the secretary of state would have avert the current strike action paul whiteman the general secretary of the national association of head teachers have say that minimum service level for teacher be 
 nothing short of an overtly hostile act from the government and an attack on the basic democratic freedom of school leader and teacher 
 will the secretary of state explain how she expect to tackle the staffing crisis in teaching when she go out of her way to alienate the profession 
 we have a record number of teacher in school in england that be more teacher today than in we accept the recommendation of the school teachers review body for a pay rise the high in year for teacher and headteacher in our school system 
 like all county council staffordshire county council be struggle with the rise demand for special educational need and disability support in school and with lengthy delay in issue education health and care plan that be leave child and family with a lack of vital support and appropriate education for their need what step be the government take to tackle the shortage of educational psychologist and to ensure that child receive the education that they need to achieve good outcome 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of educational psychologist we be invest £ to train more educational psychologist build on the £ already announce to train more than from this term 
 the department for education have state that 
 where responsible body discover lead piping they must take action 
 will the secretary of state confirm whether those body be ask to look proactively for lead piping what action be they ask to take if any be find 
 school must have suitable drinking water facility where responsible body such as local authority or academy trust discover lead piping in a school they must take action work as appropriate with water company capital funding allocate to school each year can be use to fund the removal of pipe work if require but when a school have a particular concern it can contact the department for assistance 
 i welcome the idea of the advanced british standard assessment although the name be unwieldy acronym be use elsewhere and difficult to export that aside have there be any more exploration of what the curriculum would look like and of how many year young people would need to study for the qualification do it mean the end of gcse 
 no it do not the advanced british standard will offer a broad balanced and knowledge rich curriculum that build on reform of the last decade its curriculum will form a core part of the formal consultation in the coming month gcse remain important rigorous and highly regarded qualification provide preparation for the new advanced british standard 
 when do the minister anticipate that it might be possible to deliver at least half of all education health and care plan for send child within the government ’s own legal timeframe 
 we be undertake a significant programme of reform to ensure not only that ehcp be deliver in the right timeframe but that child get the support they need at an early stage without need 
 will my right hon friend outline the support provide to the metropolitan borough of bury by the government to enhance educational provision for child with special educational need 
 the metropolitan borough of bury be get significant support in addition to the funding increase we have appoint a send adviser to work with the borough to improve service the council for disabled children be support it to strengthen ehcp special free school have be approve and bury be also of area in our safety valve programme 
 in recent week we have see report instance of antisemitism rise by and islamophobia by with jewish kid afraid to go to school and muslim kid ask whose side be you on what be the government do to ensure that child be teach sensitively but robustly about the wrong of such intolerance and do ofsted have a role in ensure consistency of approach in all school 
 the hon member be absolutely right antisemitism have no place in education it be an honour to join the secretary of state ’s visit to menorah high school last week together with the whole ministerial team stand in solidarity with that school and with the jewish community we have write to all school and college urge a swift response to hate relate incident and active reassurance for their student   and staff and we continue to work with faith leader school and ofste to monitor the response to those concern 
 far to the question ask by my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman since hamas ’s attack jewish student on campus report that they have have a year ’s worth of antisemitic incident in only week some have be target the attack itself be celebrate and some have receive death threat as such do the minister agree that university should work with the union of jewish students to publicise the welfare hotline that it have establish avail themselves of the training that the ujs offer and work to implement the recommendation of the recent report of the taskforce on antisemitism in high education 
 i have make it clear that we will not tolerate antisemitism on campus we be work closely with the union of jewish students and the high education jewish chaplaincy service as well as the community security trust i welcome the taskforce ’s report and its recommendation and we absolutely urge university to prioritise the implementation of that report 
 have recently visit a local nursery in birdwell i know that its staff be very concerned about their ability to plan for provision for child in the year when will the government give they certainty on hourly rate 
 we will be set out the funding rate very shortly 
 day after hamas ’s brutal massacre in israel a student at the university of manchester speak of be full of pride and joy at a once in a lifetime experience not only a disgusting comment but that point to possible extremism in our university campus far too many think that there be no consequence for spread such hate in our educational setting so will my right hon friend set out what the real consequence be 
 i mention previously that unfortunately we have some of hamas ’s useful idiot across our campus and we will not stand for it they represent a column support terrorism we be do everything possible the prevent duty require high education provider to have due regard to the need to prevent people from be draw into terrorism and we will work with the university to ensure that they take any extremist activity very seriously 
 james a year old lad from my constituency have be pass from pillar to post by school that simply can not deal with his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism will the minister meet i on that specific case 
 i would be delighted to meet with the hon gentleman 
 mr speaker last week i visit the middle east bring a message of solidarity with the region against terror and against the further spread of conflict i meet with the leader of israel saudi arabia qatar egypt and the palestinian authority to co ordinate our response to the crisis before we but also to renew the well vision of the future that hamas be try to destroy 
 i travel to israel it be a nation in mourning but it be also a nation under attack the violence against israel do not end on   october hundred of rocket be launch at its town and city every day and hamas still hold around hostage include british citizen in jerusalem i meet some of the relative who be suffer unbearable torment their pain will stay with i for the rest of my day i be do everything in my power and work with all our partner to get their love one home in my meeting with prime minister netanyahu and president herzog i tell they once again that we stand resolutely with israel in defend itself against terror and i stress again the need to act in line with international humanitarian law and take every possible step to avoid harm civilian it be a message deliver by a close friend and ally i say it again we stand with israel 
 i recognise that the palestinian people be suffer terribly over palestinians have be kill in this conflict they be also the victim of hamas who embe themselves in the civilian population too many life have already be lose and the humanitarian crisis be grow i go to the region to address these issue directly in riyadh and then cairo i meet individually with crown prince mohammed bin salman from saudi arabia the amir of qatar sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani president sisi in egypt and president abbas of the palestinian authority these be further to my meeting with the king of jordan last week and call with other leader and my right hon friend the foreign secretary ’s extensive travel in the region 
 there be abide message from all these conversation we must continue work together to get more humanitarian support into gaza the whole house will welcome the limited opening of the rafah crossing it be important progress and testament to the power of diplomacy but it be not enough we need a constant stream of aid pour in bring the water food medicine and fuel that be so desperately need so we will keep up the diplomatic pressure we have already commit £ of extra support to help civilian in gaza and i can announce today that we be go far we be provide an additional £ of humanitarian aid to civilian in gaza more than double our previous support to the palestinian people there be major logistical and political challenge to deliver this aid which i discuss with president sisi my right hon friend the development minister be lead an effort to ensure the maximum amount of aid be pre positioned with uk support ready to deliver we be also work intensively to ensure that british national trap in gaza be able to leave through the rafah crossing when it properly reopen 
 secondly this be not a time for hyperbole and simplistic solution it be a time for quiet and dogged diplomacy that recognise the hard reality on the ground and deliver help now and we have an important role to play in all my meeting people be clear that they value britain ’s engagement the uk ’s voice matter we have deep tie across the region tie of defence trade and investment but also of history president abbas point to that history not the british mandate in palestine or the balfour declaration but the uk ’s effort over decade to support the state solution 
 thirdly grow attack by hezbollah on israel ’s northern border rise tension on the west bank and missile and drone launch from yemen show that some be seek escalation so we need to invest more deeply in regional stability and in the state solution last night i speak to the leader of the united states germany france italy and canada we be all determined to prevent escalation that be why i be deploy raf and royal navy asset monitor threat to regional security and support humanitarian effort our support for a state solution be highly value across the region but it can not just be a clichéd talking point to roll out at time like this the truth be that in recent year energy have move into other avenue such as the abraham accord and normalisation talk with saudi arabia we support those step absolutely and believe that they can bolster wide effort but we must never lose sight of how essential the state solution be we will work with our international partner to bring renew energy and creativity to that effort it will rely on establish more effective governance for palestinian territory in gaza and the west bank it will also mean challenging action that undercut legitimate aspiration for palestinian statehood 
 mr speaker hamas care more about their paymaster in iran than the child they hide behind so let i be clear there be no scenario where hamas can be allow to control gaza or any part of the palestinian territory hamas be a threat not only to israel but to many other across the region all the leader i meet agree that this be a watershed moment it be time to set the region on a well path 
 i also want to say a word about the tone of the debate when thing be so delicate we all have a responsibility to take additional care in the language we use and to operate on the basis of fact alone the reaction to the horrific explosion at the al ahli arab hospital be a case in point as i indicate last week we have take care to look at all the evidence currently available and i can now share our assessment with the house on the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapon expert the british government judge that the explosion be likely cause by a missile or part of that be launch from within gaza towards israel the misreporting of that incident have a negative effect in the region include on a vital us diplomatic effort and on tension here at home we need to learn the lesson and ensure that in future there be no rush to judgment 
 we have see hate on our street again this weekend we all stand in solidarity with the palestinian people that be the message i bring to president abbas but we will never tolerate antisemitism in our country call for jihad on our street be a threat not only to the jewish   community but to our democratic value and we expect the police to take all necessary action to tackle extremism head on 
 this a moment for great care and caution but also for moral clarity hope and humanity must win out against the scourge of terrorism and aggression the   october   attack be drive by hatred but it be also drive by hamas ’s fear that a new equilibrium might be emerge in the middle east that would leave old division behind and offer hope of a well more secure more prosperous way forward it be the same motivation that drive putin ’s war in ukraine the fear of ukraine ’s emergence as a modern thrive democracy and the desire to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past putin will fail and so will hamas we must keep alive that vision of a well future against those who seek to destroy it together with our partner that be what we will do and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 thank you mr speaker and i thank the prime minister for the advance copy of his statement 
 the brutal attack in israel just over week ago be the dark day in jewish history since the holocaust week of grief for the innocent people who lose brother sister child week of torture for the family whose love one be take hostage by hamas there be a small glimmer of light this weekend with the release of american hostage natalie and judith raanan i meet member of their family last week and i know that they will be overcome with relief but hamas still hold hundred more son daughter mum dad be still miss they be innocent people who could if hamas will it be release immediately but they remain hostage because hamas want the chaos of war hamas want jews to suffer hamas want the palestinian people to share in the pain because the palestinian people be not their cause and peace be not their aim the dignity of human life jew or muslim mean absolutely nothing to they in light of their barbarism israel have the right to defend herself yes to get her hostage home but also to defeat hamas so that nobody need suffer like this again and so that we might once more see a road to a last peace with a palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel 
 this operation can and must be do within international law we democracy know that all human life be equal innocent life must be protect those be the principle that differentiate we from the terrorist who target israel there must now be clear humanitarian corridor within gaza for those escape violence civilian must not be target where palestinians be force to flee they must not be permanently displace from their home international law be clear it also mean that basic service include water electricity and the fuel need for it can not be deny hamas might not care for the safety and security of the palestinian people but we do we can not and will not close our eye to their suffering gaza be now a humanitarian emergency there be not enough food clean water be run out hospital be go without medicine and electricity people be starve reduce to drink contaminate filth baby be lie in incubator that could switch off at any moment 
 the deal strike by the united states to get a flow of truck through the rafah crossing be an important step there be on saturday and on sunday but it be nowhere near enough gaza be not a small town face a few shortage it have a population the size of greater manchester it be a place where even before this devastation life be a struggle gaza need aid and it need to be rapid safe unhindered and regular 
 country able to provide support must step up include the united kingdom so i welcome the increase funding for humanitarian aid that the prime minister have announce this afternoon the eu have promise to treble humanitarian aid and the us have appoint a special co ordinator for international aid to gaza i ask whether the prime minister can commit to the same because britain must stand ready to ensure that aid get to the right place to deploy british expert and medical support team and to work with international partner to give un agency the resource they need for the long term because there be a long term even as we stand by israel in her fight against hamas our eye must also look to the future a future where israeli citizen live free from the fear of terrorist attack and a future for the palestinian people where they and their child enjoy the freedom and opportunity that we take for grant 
 for too long we have talk about a state solution and the dignity and justice of a palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel without a serious path or will to make it happen for too long we have allow welcome progress in improve relation between israel and her neighbour to sit without any progress on the future for palestine and its people that must change we stand with israel and her right to defend herself against the terrorist of hamas we stand for international law the protection of innocent life and humanitarian support for the palestinians we do so because we stand for a political path to a state solution and a well future these be dark day but the light must never go out we must not let it 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for his constructive comment and his support just to recap on humanitarian aid by announce an additional £ today we will be double our aid to the region where we be already of the lead contributor of any country in the world the development minister my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell will remind i but i think that about of the un mission in the region be fund by uk contribution most of our aid be funnel through that it be also worth bear in mind that president sisi specifically commend the effort of the uk alongside the us in ensure that the rafah crossing could be open and function that be testament to the work of the development minister the foreign secretary and our team on the ground 
 in response to the leader of the opposition ’s question with regard to the un the development minister be in close contact on an almost daily basis with martin griffiths the head of the un ’s humanitarian relief effort to ensure that the uk can play a lead role in support what be happen on the ground there be considerable logistical challenge in get aid to the people who need it and there be area where we can make a difference particularly around el arish the   logistical hub that supply be move to i confirm that tomorrow the development minister will lay a write ministerial statement set out further detail of the increase in humanitarian aid that we have announce today 
 in closing i concur with what the leader of the opposition say there be absolutely a future available to we that be more prosperous and more stable for people live in the region where people can live with dignity with security and with opportunity that be the future that hamas be try to destroy we should stand united to stop that happen 
 do my right hon friend get any impression from his discussion with arab leader that they understand the purpose of hamas terrorism to derail their effort to find a well way of live in the middle east be he satisfied that they be sufficiently aware of the benefit that russia hop to derive from all this and the need to deter iran from further escalation 
 i can tell my right hon friend from all my conversation across the region with arab leader that there be absolutely no love or affection for hamas indeed it be the opposite as the palestinian president say with i when he condemn in no uncertain term the terrorist atrocity that they have perpetrate all leader see hamas as a destabilising influence in the region and want to work with we and other to prevent the situation from escalate and to limit hamas ’s ability to carry out attack like this in the future 
 i call the leader of the snp 
 i say last week that history would judge we base on our response not just to the abhorrent terrorist attack in israel but to the humanitarian crisis that be undoubtedly unfold in gaza in our collective unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent attack of   october the house have be and continue to be fully united just as we be unite in our condemnation of any form of antisemitism that rear its head on these isle and in our thought and prayer for all the hostage who need to be return safely to their family 
 however in respect of the humanitarian crisis in gaza while i welcome the prime minister ’s announcement i believe that we must go far here be why turn off electricity and water to gaza be collective punishment limit the free access of food and medicine to gaza be collective punishment prevent people include british citizen from flee gaza be collective punishment drop leaflet in northern gaza tell people to flee or they will be deem partner of hamas be a precursor to further collective punishment all of we in the chamber know that collective punishment be prohibit by international law i ask the prime minister to use his office to do some good on the humanitarian side of the conflict in gaza and to answer the question i ask last week give the severity of this appalling situation will he now agree that a ceasefire be require in the region 
 i would characterise the situation differently from the hon gentleman with the great of respect israel have suffer an appalling act of terror it have the right to defend itself and ensure that something like it do not happen again he talk about people move from the north to south of gaza it be absolutely right that israel take every precaution to avoid harm civilian in my conversation with the president he confirm that israel intend to act within international humanitarian law but hamas be prevent people from move keep they in harm ’s way the hon gentleman do not mention that in his question but he would do well to recognise that that be hamas ’s policy embed themselves in civilian population use civilian as human shield and prevent they from leave when they have be give advance notice 
 where i agree and have be very clear be that we must do everything we can to support humanitarian effort in gaza i refer the hon gentleman to my previous comment i raise all those issue with the israeli prime minister and we will continue to do everything we can again i point out that it be not just a function of money but about the logistic of get very considerable amount of aid into the region the uk have capability and expertise that we be very willing to bring to bear and we be have active discussion about how good to do so 
 let i start by thank the chelmsford muslim community for host a meeting that bring together jewish muslim and christian leader on friday all be deeply shock by the event of   october there be no place for hate but there be great concern about the loss of civilian life since then and the risk of contagion and of the situation escalate even far i thank our prime minister for say that in defend itself from terror israel also need to act within international law how be that be monitor if there be breach how would any perpetrator be hold to account 
 my right hon friend will know that there be establish mechanism for that but i be reassure by what the israeli president have say very publicly and in our conversation that israel intend to act within humanitarian law and be take every precaution to avoid harm civilian 
 we all condemn the attack by hamas on innocent civilian but since then thousand of innocent palestinians include child have be kill by the israeli army ’s bombardment which i also condemn over a palestinians have be displace and many more be suffer without access to food water electricity fuel and medicine which be inhumane and against international law will the prime minister join i in call for a ceasefire today to end this collective punishment 
 again israel have the right the defend itself in line with international and humanitarian law and it have our support in do that 
 rise 
 order the statement will run until o’clock so let we help another to get everyone in 
 how can member of the british jewish community feel safe when people be allow to chant on the street of britain in favour of jihad call for the raising of religious army to go and fight israel call for the mobilisation of the intifada and walk down our street hold sign that display despicable ancient antisemitic trope those be march not for peace but for hate they glorify the bad murder of jews since the holocaust and they have to stop 
 hateful extremism have no place in our society call for jihad and for muslim army to rise up be a threat not only to the jewish community but to our democratic value the police be operationally independent but the home secretary have a role in hold police force to account as member will know she raise this matter with the met police commissioner at their meeting early today anyone who commit a crime whether incite racial hatred glorify terrorism or violate public order should expect to face the full force of the law 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement i agree with he and the leader of the opposition that the humanitarian crisis in gaza be truly horrifying to prevent a catastrophe it be essential that far more aid reach the people who need it and it be vital that the hostage be unconditionally release hamas ’s evil attack have claim far too many innocent life already israel unquestionably have the right to protect its citizen and target these brutal terrorist in line with international law just as we all have a duty to prevent more needless civilian death do the prime minister agree with many of we include the archbishop of canterbury that the uk should be lead diplomatic effort to secure a pause in hostility with a temporary humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the hostage to be release and to get aid into gaza 
 let i just say exactly what i have be try to do over the past week ensure that we can diplomatically engage with partner in the region as indeed the foreign secretary have be do that have result in humanitarian aid come into gaza more need to come but that be a sign of progress in all our conversation particularly with the emir of qatar we be focus on release hostage of all nationality but we be particularly concerned about the british hostage we will continue to have that engagement with our partner to do everything in our power to secure the release of the hostage 
 my right hon friend know that i be of the member of this house who take the most satisfaction in the fact that it be he who be prime minister of this great democratic country with all the power of analysis that he bring to his role we be all in this nation accountable before the law perhaps the only who be not have to act on my right hon friend ’s advice anyway and he be accountable before the law like everyone else i welcome the prime minister ’s statement but we do not quite get to the conclusion this be a watershed moment we be either go to build a future that be base on a kill field in gaza or we be go to have a ceasefire and the opportunity to bring the necessary aid there for all the people who be   suffer now so appallingly my right hon friend know that we must operate within the law the law be clear and it require a ceasefire to be implement now 
 it be difficult to tell israel to have a ceasefire when it be still face rocket fire on an almost daily basis and when its citizen be still be hold hostage it have suffer an appalling terrorist attack and have a right to defend itself but as i have say it be important that that be do in accordance with international law and it be important that israel take every possible precaution to avoid harm civilian base on all my conversation that be something we will continue to expect and continue to impress on the israeli government 
 nobody be argue about whether israel have a right to defend itself but my constituent want to know what have already be ask by member from the prime minister ’s own side what happen if international law be not follow can the prime minister give some assurance to the country and to people in my constituency that if israel breach international law in its endeavour to defend itself he will stand at that dispatch box and say so 
 as the hon lady well know there be establish process and mechanism to take account of international law but again we can not lose sight just a week or later of the fact that hamas an absolutely evil terrorist organisation have perpetrate a horrific attack on over people in israel and israel have the right to defend itself and ensure that that do not happen again 
 i commend my right hon friend for his recent attempt in the middle east and for his reminder that the uk regardless of political party have be behind the state solution from the word go it be also become very clear as he reference that iran ’s hand be behind all the genocidal murdering and kidnapping of jewish israeli people i therefore ask a simple question if we know all this and we now know it be abroad in the uk create useful idiot to go out and promote its propaganda be it not time that we review again the role of the islamic revolutionary guard corps with a view to ban its activity and the role of iranian bank here in the uk in the city of london why be they still here get money and put it towards terrorist activity 
 we have already take strong action such as sanction more than iranian individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety furthermore the national security act implement new measure to protect the british public include new offence of espionage and foreign interference as my right hon friend know we do not comment on specific organisation and whether they be be consider for proscription but he can rest assure that we discus iran and how good to contain it with all our ally on a regular basis 
 indiscriminate bombing and obliterate entire neighbourhood be a war crime collective punishment and starve a population   of necessity be a war crime order people to leave their home and forcibly displace they be a war crime as well i absolutely condemn hamas ’s killing of israeli civilian and i echo the call for the release of hostage but that do not excuse war crime and merely say that international law should be follow when it be clearly not be follow be an insult let i ask the prime minister this how many more palestinians must die before he condemn israel for violate international law and call for an immediate ceasefire 
 as i have make very clear we support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too we mourn the loss of every innocent life we mourn the loss of civilian of every faith and every nationality who have be kill in this conflict however i simply disagree with the hon lady ’s characterisation of what be go on there be a significant difference between a terrorist organisation that deliberately and specifically target the killing mutilation and murder of innocent civilian include child and woman and baby a couple of week ago and israel ’s lawful right to defend itself and go after those perpetrator 
 i thank the prime minister for all the effort that he and his team be make at this time during the important discussion that he be have with leader in the region at the end of last week about get more humanitarian assistance into gaza and that be exactly right be he able to obtain any new information about the welfare of hostage who have be take by hamas into gaza they include many elderly people toddler with medical need and disabled people be it not important for we to make sure that they be not forget and that the supply go into gaza reach the hostage as well 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise an excellent point it be difficult to ascertain that information precisely but i give he the reassurance that we be talk extensively to our partner i have a very constructive conversation with the emir of qatar about this issue to put pressure on those hold the hostage to release they unconditionally and to ensure their wellbeing in the meantime 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement give that hizb ut tahrir be a fundamentalist organisation that be ban in country and across most of the arab world why be its member allow to parade on the street of london and call for the destruction of the state of israel 
 as i have say we do of course keep the list of proscribe organisation under review but we do not routinely comment on whether an organisation be or be not under consideration for proscription i refer the hon gentleman to my early comment hateful extremism of the type that we see this weekend have no place in our society and it should be meet with the full force of the law 
 a group of journalist from around the world have just be show some indescribable raw footage of the   hamas attack in a private screening accord to a bbc journalist it feature a father and son age roughly and see run into a shelter in their underwear a terrorist throw a grenade into the shelter kill the father and badly injure the boy who run back into the house cover in blood the child be scream for their father and say that they be go to die the terrorist be see calmly drink water from the family ’s fridge that be just of the video that have be show to journalist from around the world in the last couple of hour will the prime minister confirm that any person in the united kingdom support this vicious terrorism will be subject to the full force of the law 
 i see much of the same footage myself on my visit to israel last week and i can tell the house that it be absolutely horrifying to watch when we hear in this house about israel ’s action it be important to have those image in our mind what happen to its citizen be unforgivable and it have every right to defend itself against that i can also provide my right hon and learn friend with the reassurance that as he well know under the terrorism act of and the glorification of terrorism support for proscribe organisation and the encouraging of terrorism be all offence and will be meet with the full force of law 
 the prime minister say in his statement that this be a moment for moral clarity and i agree with he the humanitarian situation in gaza be dire at the moment truck have go in set against a normal backdrop of hundred go in every day we be on a precipice with people include woman and child in hospital die because of shortage of power water and food i welcome the money for aid but if it can not get in it be not help what can the prime minister do to get that aid in in the quantity that will prevent avoidable death in gaza 
 last week president sisi himself commend the united kingdom for our diplomatic effort to ensure the access of humanitarian aid into gaza and i thank my right hon friend the foreign secretary and the development minister for their effort in that regard we in this house should be proud of the uk ’s effort to ensure that that access be now open of course we need more and that be why the logistical support that we can provide to ensure that high volume of aid can flow freely to the people who need it be imperative the development minister be extensively engage with the un on that topic 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement my constituency have be the location for major solidarity with palestine protest over the past saturdays and i suspect that there will be more to come the jewish community in westminster have highlight to i that these protest start just a few minute walk from synagogue and that they coincide with the end of shabbat service do the prime minister agree that if further such protest go ahead the timing and location of their start should be consider to take into account that member of the jewish community be still worried about their safety and that the protest coincide with their shabbat 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue there be no place on british street for demonstration convoy or flag wave that not only glorify terrorism but harass the jewish community there be no place for antisemitism on our street which be why we have also increase funding for the community security trust to protect british jews from these type of incident the decision that she refer to be typically operational decision for the police and local community but i will very much bear in mind what she have say in our further engagement with those entity and individual 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement and for his calmness in the face of the barbarity that the world have witness i also welcome the comment from the leader of the opposition and agree with the solidarity that have be express hopefully profoundly across the house i want to draw the prime minister ’s attention to the murder by the terrorist of kim damti a year old irish israeli woman i have search this city long and hard for a book of condolence for she but unfortunately none be to be find in the irish embassy or anywhere else so i want to put her name on record so that she too be immortalise and remember forever
