the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on increase in the cost of food production 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on increase in the cost of food production 
 what step her department be take to help mitigate the impact of increase food production cost on a consumer and b business 
 putin ’s illegal war in ukraine have place pressure on global import and energy cost we have take significant action to support british grower and to safeguard our food security build on the work to invest in fertiliser supply and slurry storage energy infrastructure and cost the prime minister recently host the ever uk farm to fork summit on productivity and sustainability as part of maintain the £ budget for farming each year 
 last month the prime minister say that weekly shopping bill have 
 go up far too much in the past few month 
 that must be the understatement of the year food inflation be at a record year high farmer and grower be face high business cost across the board and consumer be bear the brunt with their weekly shop what discussion have the minister have with the prime minister to find out what they can do now for farmer grower and producer and to protect beleaguered shopper what be the plan because what the government be do now ai not work 
 i think the hon gentleman will be aware that we be not responsible for russia ’s invasion of ukraine which have have a significant impact on global energy price the good news be that those global   energy price be come back to a level and that be start to feed back into our food supply chain that be why we be help and support farmer invest in new technology and investing in their business to make they more sustainable and more profitable go forwards so that they can continue to deliver great quality british food at a reasonable price 
 the war in ukraine have not cause the labour shortage that be cause scottish crop to be plough back into the field the war in ukraine have not cause custom barrier and tariff that mean that scottish seafood be be leave in the sea brexit have cause those thing that be why food inflation be high in the uk than elsewhere when will the government accept that 
 unfortunately the hon gentleman be misinformed food price be high in germany and france if brexit be the issue clearly that would not be the case that be why we be invest in those farmer we be support they by increase the number of visa that be available in the seasonal agricultural worker scheme we be support those farmer to continue to produce great quality food 
 business as   the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady   have say be suffer because of the absence of labour in fishing and indeed in farming in east lothian give that this have be bring about by brexit and that the previous route of labour have be sell off be it not time that the scottish government have control over some migration visa even of a limited timescale as apply in south australia and quebec 
 we have issue possible visa on the seasonal agriculture worker scheme and we be currently nowhere near that level there be an extra visa available should the industry require they we have not see the necessity to trigger those extra at this moment in time which be because there be adequate visa available to support farmer and fisherman 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 the price of wheat peak at £ a tonne it have subsequently fall to below £ a tonne not much more than it be before the invasion of ukraine why have the price of bread in our supermarket not fall too 
 i declare my interest in these matter 
 i recognise the fact that global wheat price have now come back down we work closely with retailer processer and the hospitality sector to make sure that there be not extra profiteer in the marketplace we will continue to have discussion with those representative and will work with the sector to make sure that food be reasonably price for our constituent 
 the farming minister will know that in north northamptonshire we have some of the good farmer in the country who be   face these challenge like every other farm up and down the land would he be kind enough to visit kettering to meet a large group of local farmer perhaps in early september in between harvesting and drilling 
 that be a very kind invitation it be always a pleasure to visit northamptonshire and if my diary allow i will of course meet my hon friend and his farmer 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the minister have talk a lot about support for farmer but in reality there be a severe lack of profitability for those produce chicken that be cause a sharp reduction in the number of bird rear in england while in scotland production have change significantly as retailer resist demand to pay a fair price for chicken will the minister commit to extend the examination of food supply chain to poultry meat as request by the national farmers union scotland as the threat of empty shelf loom will he also engage with retailer to ensure that poultry farmer be fairly compensate 
 i be on a poultry farm yesterday talk to poultry producer the snp can not have it both way it can not ask question about suppress price for consumer and another about increase the price for farmer those thing be diametrically opposed what we be do as a department be support those farmer through the £ worth of subsidy help they to invest in new technology and talk to retailer and producer to make sure we get fairness in the supply chain so everybody get a fair return for their hard work 
 what step she be take to bring forward legislative proposal to improve animal welfare 
 the government be commit to continue to deliver on our manifesto commitment and the work we have undertake through the action plan for animal welfare from so far we have deliver measure through primary legislation and through secondary legislation we have also support private member bills of which the shark fins act ban the import of detach shark fin receive royal assent last week as the minister update the house on   may we will be support the delivery of the measure from our manifesto during the remainder of the parliament and we have already start with a consultation on ban primate as pet through secondary legislation 
 we have have secretaries of state and day have pass since the animal welfare kept animals bill be introduce in this house and we be no far forward today on ban animal fur import or on tackle illegal puppy and kitten smuggling or on ban foie gra the former defra secretary   the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice say the bill do not go ahead due to 
 a lack of resolve to take it through 
 how long must animal suffer the consequence of this tory psychodrama and when will animal welfare finally be prioritise in this place 
 the hon gentleman must be live in a parallel universe there be no doubt that many measure have be undertake to improve animal welfare thing i would say be that there have not be any live export of animal since and we still have legislation ready to go we have already set out our approach of course he will be aware that it be already illegal to smuggle pet and some of the legislation we be work on be to try to make it more challenging for criminal who abuse pet as well 
 the secretary of state be right that progress on animal welfare can be make by specific and target measure i would add to the one she mention the adoption by the government of my own private member ’s hare coursing bill however we do need a clear programme of further progress can she tell i the progress on specific change the ban on the import of dog with cropped ear and the ban on keep primate as pet 
 as my hon friend point out he have already undertake significant work regard hare coursing it be of the top priority for rural police and crime commissioner and they continue to do good work on that recognise that much of it be connect to organise crime on the measure he refer to because we be introduce secondary legislation to stop people keep primate as pet we have to consult formally and then the legislation will be prepare alongside that in term of the mutilation element when my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries speak to the house on   may he say that we would be take forward measure on individual issue i intend that to happen in the next session of parliament 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last friday lord goldsmith resign from the government and his letter to the prime minister be absolutely devastating if i may paraphrase it it say that before take office the prime minister assure party member via lord goldsmith that he the prime minister would continue to implement the action plan include the animal welfare kept animals bill and measure such as end the live export of animal for slaughter ban keep primate as pet and prevent the import of shark fin and hunt trophy from vulnerable specie lord goldsmith have be horrify as bit by bit the government have abandon those commitment domestically and on the world stage the animal welfare kept animals bill have be ditch despite the prime minister ’s promise effort on a wide range of domestic environmental issue have simply grind to a standstill and more worryingly the united kingdom have visibly step off the world stage lord goldsmith and the secretary of state serve as defra ministers in the last parliament do she agree with his devastating critique of the prime minister and her department 
 of course not i be very sad that the noble lord choose to leave government i pay tribute to he for a lot of what he have do in term of international   nature the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend   the member for sherwood mark spencer set out to the house on   may   the approach that we be take and why we be get on with the legislation on keep primate as pet and we be prepare single issue bills interruption   the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner who be chuntere from a sedentary position clearly do not know a lot about government i understand that because he have never be in it—[interruption i be respond to the chuntering from the hon gentleman the point be that when we introduce secondary legislation the formality be that we have to consult that be why we be do a short consultation which we launch last week we will get on with the secondary legislation when we return after the recess 
 what recent discussion she have have with relevant stakeholder on monitor coastal and marine biodiversity 
 my hon friend and i share a feature in that the coast and the sea be a key part of our constituency we have just bring into effect our highly protect marine area we engage regularly with various stakeholder on a variety of issue relate to the monitoring and protection of coastal and marine biodiversity we will continue to do that around our shore but we also do extensive work around the world with our knowledge and expertise to ensure that we preserve marine biodiversity much more strongly right across the globe 
 i recently meet applied genomics ltd a marine scientific business in my north norfolk constituency it specialise in environmental dna acquisition and processing and have develop an effective technique to measure a broad biodiversity profile from fish stock and invasive specie to microbial pollution the uk do not currently have an all encompass nationwide programme to monitor our coastal marine environment so will the minister consider launch a consistent low cost and accurate programme and will she meet i to discuss it 
 my hon friend will be aware that we monitor marine and coastal wildlife and habitat through the uk marine monitoring and assessment strategy evidence group indeed the £ natural capital and ecosystem assessment programme be an important example of how we be try to do these thing in a smart and more timely way i be delighted to say that applied genomics the company to which he refer whose work i think be interesting and valuable have deliver some of that work 
 when will the secretary of state join i in a campaign to try to clean up our sea and ocean around our country there be report of marine life die when will she wake up to the fact that tyre be not just make of rubber but contain chemical some of they poisonous and relate to cancer and all that wear go into the gully gutter stream river and ocean and it be poison marine life when will she do something about it 
 i know that the hon gentleman be try to launch a campaign on that the department and the government be aware of the impact of the particulate matter that come off tyre and brake that be increasingly of the challenge for heavy electric vehicle and the department for transport in particular be work with the industry on that on the other aspect he mention we have the £ blue planet fund and we invest right around the world and on our shore in improve marine biodiversity that be why we be sponsor activity on coral reef for example and on get plastic out of our ocean it be why the uk play a critical role in secure the un biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty on try to improve marine biodiversity this government have do more for the ocean and make they a central part of tackle climate change than any other country in the world and we will continue to do so 
 what step she be take to increase tree planting 
 i be pleased that the england tree action plan have set out more than action to help we meet our target in increase tree planting since its publication we have roll out the england woodland creation offer grant scheme we have add new community forest bring that to a total of we have invest in nursery capacity and we have launch a new training and apprenticeship scheme to boost skill and workforce in the forestry sector 
 since january tree have be plant in the west midland an estimated tonne of air pollution have be remove as a result in the black country alone more than of those tree have now be register with the west midlands combined authority ’s virtual forest will the secretary of state join i in thank our wonderful mayor andy street for spearhead that massive effort and will she outline how the government plan to help the west midland to plant even more tree 
 it be fantastic to hear about these success and the innovation of virtual forest i thank mayor andy street and the people of the west midland for plant more tree we will continue to support tree plant through our national forest in the midland we will work closely with the forestry commission on the nature for climate fund grant scheme include the local authority treescape fund this be yet another example of fantastic conservative mayors deliver for their resident clean air and greener and more beautiful space as we regularly say vote blue go green 
 i recently visit the woodland trust ’s snaizeholme tree planting project which be in the prime minister ’s yorkshire constituency it have huge potential for nature recovery and carbon capture but along with other site it face a financial cliff edge when the nature for climate fund come to an end will the government commit to long term funding that provide certainty for that vital work 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have extensive funding and he will also know that the cycle of funding go with something call the spending review which be until we will continue to invest in forestry and we be do it through our environmental land management scheme as well i plant the tree in the northern forest with my hon friend   the member for bolton west chris green we need to keep it go 
 i be there 
 he do it 
 no he do n’t the more tree that be plant the well so let we all take credit for planting tree it be good for wellbee and it be good for the planet

 a summary of response to the call for evidence on the fur market set out the result and any next step in this policy space will be publish soon 
 the department for environment food and rural affairs call for evidence on ban the import and sale of fur back in but year on we have yet to hear what the public think about such an important and timely issue will the department commit to a date when it will release the result of the consultation on the fur market in great britain 
 as i say we be consider those response and will publish our response very soon 
 what mechanism exist to supply safe drinking water to home without access to main water 
 private drinking water supply be regulate by local authority which receive scientific and technical advice from the drinking water inspectorate local authority sample and identify water quality risk can serve notice to correct any issue identify and have remedial power if those responsible for the supply do not comply with the notice private water supply compliance be steadily improve in of private supply be compliant up from in 
 the home of aysdalegate near charltons do not have access to main water over the last decade redcar and cleveland borough council have perform drinking water check time and on all occasion the supply have be judge unsatisfactory owe to bacterial contamination include e.coli and enterococci a regulation notice which specify that the water require boil before drinking have be in   place permanently since december and resident report to i find tadpole and other life in their drinking water this be a dickensian scandal in but northumbrian water have advise that it will cost these low income home over £ each simply to give they a quote for main water connection that be obviously unacceptable will my hon friend agree to meet i urgently so that we can discuss how to help my constituent 
 i be sorry to hear about this issue which my right hon friend have already bring to my attention our legislation do allow for those on a private supply to request a connection to the main supply but it be right that the legislation allow a water company to charge for the cost of make a new connection because otherwise it would impact on all customer bill the local authority can give advice and i urge he to keep contact it but if there be anything more we can discuss usefully i would be happy to do so 
 like yourself mr speaker i be of a generation that can well remember when water come from the well and it be pure and clean time have move on and we have realise that such water be not available to everyone as   the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke   say i ask the minister this question ever mindful of the discussion that she will have have have there be any discussion between the government and the devolved administration in northern ireland to ensure that grant be available for people who need to go on to main water and that their water be pure as it be many year ago but be not always today 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i too have a well but it do not supply our drinking water i think a lot of people have well on their property or locally on their road or wherever the issue he have raise be a matter for the northern ireland administration but here the drinking water inspectorate have commission research into the impact of future private water supply as well as the whole regulatory model and legislative framework 
 what step she be take to support farmer 
 we be back british farmer with £ of investment every year we have recently update our new scheme base on the feedback that farmer have give we make they easy to apply for we be provide tailor business advice to all farmer we have cut red tape bring in fair enforcement regime and help the sector access the seasonal labour it need we be look closely at the shropshire review that we commission to see how we can go far we be review supply chain fairness in the sector and try to unlock opportunity for genetic technology i could keep go but i will leave it there for now 
 upland farmer across burnley and padiham and indeed right across lancashire play a huge role in keep we feed and enhance the local   environment that be why it be so important that we support they can my right hon friend say how recent announcement will improve support for upland farmer specifically and will he reaffirm the commitment make in may by my right hon friend the secretary of state that we will move beyond income foregone calculation when design support scheme 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to lancashire farmer and the effort they make to keep we all well feed we be committed to ensure that payment rate mean that as many farmer as possible can benefit from our offer and have recently increase payment rate for upland farmer through countryside stewardship plus we will pay farmer extra for co ordinate their action and work with neighbouring farm and landowner to tackle climate change as well as support nature gain and keep we all well feed 
 when she plan to bring forward regulation to introduce delinked payment from 
 the government plan to bring forward regulation to delink payment later this year as the parliamentary timetable allow those regulation will introduce delinked payment in as plan information about delinked payment can be find on gov.uk 
 delinke the legacy basic payment scheme payment from the need to have land area entitlement could be a really powerful catalyst for change it would free the rural payments agency and farmer from the bureaucracy of the legacy scheme remove a very difficult distortion from the land market and crucially free farmer up to make decision about what to do with their land in future since farmer be make decision about next year ’s land use now will my right hon friend take this opportunity to confirm from the dispatch box that the delinked payment will happen next year and that there will be no reversal of that plan 
 i be happy to confirm that and i pay tribute to my right hon friend for all the work he do to get we to this point of course we will be bring forward the legislation to delink those payment next year 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of uk food security 
 the uk food security report which we introduce in the agriculture act be publish in the next be due in the f4 group comprise the british retail consortium the national farmers union the food and drink federation and ukhospitality meet regularly and report directly to ministers we recently meet representative from the whole supply chain at the uk farm to fork summit in downing street 
 i have raise access to food before with the minister and in particular how surplus food and food near its use by date can be use by organisation such as fareshare there be still a huge problem right across the country whereby constituent can not afford to buy food in supermarket and be therefore rely on food pantry and food bank for their main shop to have food security people must be able to afford food what more can the minister do to resolve those issue and ensure that people be not literally starve or in a position where they can not afford to buy basic foodstuff 
 the hon gentleman will be aware of the huge package of support the chancellor of the exchequer have introduce to help family with the cost of living challenge they face on average every household receive over £ of support with their energy and food bill but i be sure we can do more to help and support primary food producer processer and retailer to make sure that we drive as much efficiency as possible into the system in order to maintain low food price and help family up and down the country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last week past failure catch up with the defra ministerial team the climate change committee castigate they for lack of progress on agriculture and land use and then the report they have commission from john shropshire and his team detail the crop loss and lose productivity and production cause by their failure to address labour supply issue this week could the minister tell the house if he know whether the uk be more or less food secure than this time last year and will he explain how he have reach that conclusion 
 we have extensive conversation with the food supply market we be bless in the uk with very robust food supply chain which be some of the most secure anywhere in the world of course i acknowledge that the shropshire review have indicate some area in which we can improve and assist but we have deliver the visa that be available through the seasonal agricultural worker scheme not all of those visa have be take up and an extra be available if require but nobody have ask for that to be trigger 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 it have be a particularly busy week for defra in a number of different way with not only the launch of the designate highly protect marine area but the house of commons vote to support the legislation to introduce the ban on plastic which be another way to improve the environment 
 of course there have also be significant speculation about the water industry i think it be important to put it on record that the government have confidence in the financial resilience of the water sector industry we will continue to have discussion which be important and i think it be critical to be aware that people who do not know a lot about the water industry frankly be out of   their depth in make some comment and speculation we need to make sure that we treat this situation very carefully because it be critical to make sure that we have ongoing investment in the water industry which everybody here rely on 
 thankfully my dog sidney pickles come from a great home although could complain to trading standard that his former home fail to describe he as a naughty cocker spaniel or a fox poo roll little tinker seriously however there have be much misinformation about the government ’s action on puppy farming from the opposition do my right hon friend agree that this government have in fact be take firm action to stop the unscrupulous selling of puppy by deceitful seller 
 indeed and i want to thank my hon friend i have meet her dog sidney pickles who be delightful as she say it be purchase from a great breeder thing we need to continue to focus on be improve the law on dog breeding to crack down on unscrupulous breeder regulation do require commercial dog breeder to hold a valid licence from their local authority and it be important that people check for that licence the regulation also prohibit the party sale of puppy and kitten 
 order we be on topical folk i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the tories be sink the water industry since tory privatisation water company have rack up debt of over £ every day we see sewage dump and lose over litre of water in leak and what be the big leak of all the £ pay out to shareholder now thames water be on the edge as the money dry up can the secretary of state tell the house if she believe that this be an isolated case yes or no 
 i have already say to the house that the government have full confidence in the financial resilience of the water sector i will point out that of course the gearing for thames water shoot up in when labour be in government it be fair to say that when a previous secretary of state issue a strategic policy statement to ofwat of the key focus be about reduce the gearing and that have not happen with thames water ofwat be still responsible and i be still hold it to account on how that go forward however it be very important that we do not have speculation and misinformed comment it be critical that we get water company through certain stage and i be confident the government will do that 
 like the industry itself that response do not hold water people know that thames water be not an isolated case company be rat as be of concern by the government ’s own financial regulator last weekend i write to the environment secretary set out key test to safeguard bill payer worker and taxpayer from pay the price of a fail water industry will she finally act to protect the national interest and commit to those test and will she rule out customer have to pay twice for boardroom failure yes or no 
 i have not yet see the hon gentleman ’s letter but i will of course respond to it before the recess over £ have be invest into our water industry since privatisation through a long stand combination of equity and debt investment by water company speculation around such an important utility do not help the situation and a measured approach be critical to get through this difficulty he mention other water company and that be why ofwat have act and why new equity have come into many water company it be critical that we continue to have that confidence 
 hundred of animal lover across the west midland have suffer the dreadful crime of pet theft in recent year what be minister do to prevent such crime 
 steal a pet be already a criminal offence and we know the devastating impact that pet theft can have we legislate to require the microchipping of cat in addition to dog because that can act as an effective deterrent the pet theft taskforce report that dog be mostly steal from garden and outbuilding and highlight the need for owner to ensure security at home for their treasured pet 
 bear in mind the escalate number of dangerous dog attack include the death of a dog sula in milngavie in east dunbartonshire whose owner feel that their life would have be at risk have they intervene will the secretary of state review the government ’s decision to drop the animal welfare kept animals bill if not will she explain to the house how she plan to deliver its measure by different mean 
 my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries set out on   may   how we intend to take through our manifesto commitment we also have a taskforce work on this situation and i expect a report with some recommendation later this year 
 a couple of week ago i visit yorkshire water ’s sewer improvement project this £ scheme under the a65 in ilkley be only happen as a result of a huge campaign by the ilkley clean river group and our pass the environment act which the opposition vote against at every stage do the minister therefore agree that the government be purely focus on clean up the water quality of our river 
 i could just say yes but i will add a bit more my hon friend be absolutely right that it be this government who have get water quality on the radar we be clean up our river and our bathing water of which be class as good or excellent our plan for water will ensure that we provide the clean and plentiful water we need for generation 
 gateshead food bank and feeding families both of which operate in my constituency have see huge increase in the demand for food parcel over recent year with food inflation run at   the situation will only get bad what will the minister do to tackle food inflation so that people do not have to rely on those organisation 
 that be why we be invest in our farmer to help they produce food more efficiently and increase productivity it be also why the government have put forward a huge £ support package over £ per household and provide £ of support to charity work in the sector 
 the use of storm overflow be of huge concern to my resident in southend on sea due to this government ’s action anglian water be suppose to have its plan for mitigate the use of overflow on the secretary of state ’s desk last friday be it there and when will my resident be able to see it 
 every water company be ask to put a plan for every storm overflow on the secretary of state ’s desk i can tell my hon friend that all the plan have arrive and be be analyse 
 what should i say to my twin grandson who be here today about their future give that they live in cambridge where air quality be poison young people pregnant woman and many other what will the secretary of state really do about clean up the environment for that generation 
 i recommend that they vote for a conservative mp 
 what assurance can the farming minister give my ynys môn farmer that this government be do all they can to ensure that food labelling be accurate will the minister accept my invitation to the anglesey show on and   august   to discuss the matter with my farmer in person

 the ministry of justice ’s early legal advice pilot scheme have just report it run for month cost £ and support a sum total of just people instead of the attorney general and the government try to reinvent the wheel by make it square why do they not deliver well access to justice by support more people through legal aid 
 in term of access to justice for victim i mention the victim transformation programme which be vital in support victim it will transform how the cps communicate with victim and ensure that those with specific need have enhance support 
 the victim right to review make it easy for victim to seek a review of a cps decision not to bring charge will the minister congratulate cps east midlands on have the victim right to review prominent on the front page of its website be he satisfied that the scheme be be roll out satisfactorily across the country 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue he will be pleased to know that on the law tour the attorney general and i see cps east midlands for ourselves and he be right it be also right to acknowledge that the vast majority of case be perform correctly and accurately of those that be not it be right to say that decision be find to be incorrect and be review last year 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the compatibility of the illegal migration bill with the european convention on human right 
 as the hon gentleman know i be bind by the law officer convention not only to not talk about advice that i give to cabinet colleague but to not even reveal whether such advice have be give 
 the united nations high commissioner for refugees give evidence to the court of appeal advise the court on matter concern international   refugee law that ultimately contribute to the bill be find unlawful the recommendation include co operation with eu neighbour and fair and fast asylum procedure that be more humane efficient and cost effective will the attorney general ensure that the cabinet listen and enact those recommendation 
 the government be disappoint by the recent outcome of the case before the court of appeal and will seek permission to appeal to the supreme court the court of appeal do say that the policy of removal to a safe country could be compatible and it do not disturb the finding of the high court that rwanda be safe though the majority be concern about the possibility of onward removal from rwanda the government will make robust argument before the supreme court and will be apply for permission later today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the former lord chancellor   the right hon member for esher and walton dominic raab when tell of the demise of his bill of rights say 
 all the wrong people will celebrate 
 be the attorney general celebrate the defeat of that attack on our european convention right will she now stand up to other of her cabinet colleague who repeatedly transgress international law they do it with the northern ireland protocol with the united kingdom internal market act with the illegal migration bill and again this week with the economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill she be the attorney general so if she will not stand up for the rule of law who will 
 i absolutely can and do stand up for the rule of law the government be commit to the rule of law domestically and commit to maintain and uphold our obligation under international law that be make quite clear to all ministers 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the rwanda asylum plan be declare so poor that it threaten the right of asylum seeker not to be torture or subject to inhumane treatment and it be find incompatible with a host of international convention those be the finding of the court of appeal and the supreme court will inevitably reach the same conclusion how much taxpayer money do the attorney general estimate the government will spend appeal this illegal plan 
 i absolutely do not accept the premise of the hon lady ’s question the divisional court be a strong win for the government at the court of appeal the majority find against we but we also have a strong judgment from the lord chief justice we believe that the assurance we have have from rwanda regard asylum protection there be robust and we intend to make those argument strongly in the supreme court 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 work be go on across the criminal justice system to drive up prosecution level in the gower charge of adult rape suspect have increase dramatically in the past year the solicitor general and i recently visit cps south wales to discuss its future plan 
 the jade ’s law campaign be gather more supporter with each pass day unite in our belief that a man such as russell marsh should have no say over the future of his child whose mother he so viciously murder will the attorney general engage in a serious and sympathetic discussion with her colleague in the ministry of justice about how we can make jade ’s law a reality 
 while i always enjoy my discussion with the hon lady i be afraid that i be not a minister in the ministry of justice i be happy to pass on her point to those ministers the attorney general ’s office stay completely separate and independent of the ministry of justice and it be important that we maintain that 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i be sure the attorney general will agree that the investigation and prosecution of rape and serious sexual offence require particular skill in both investigation and handling in court will she therefore welcome the increase in prosecution counsel fee to an equal level with those for the defence so that we get the most competent people do these case will she also accept that more investment must continue to go in so that the crown prosecution service as the director of public prosecutions point out to our committee on tuesday can continue to recruit sufficient experienced rape prosecutor and have the digital technology to deal with thing such as mobile phone evidence in these case 
 my hon friend know well that i do not hold the budget that he be seek to influence but he be of the good campaigner in the house and as ever he make his point extremely clearly i watch with interest his committee ’s proceeding early this week and note what be say 
 i call the shadow attorney general 
 almost day ago in the joint inspectorate ’s report on the post charge handling of rape case it recommend that immediately”—i stress that word 
 the police and the cps should work to ensure that bad character be consider in all rape case and progress wherever it be applicable 
 that mean apply to enter into evidence relevant element of a suspect ’s history include past conviction and a record of violence but when i recently ask the   ministry of justice about the issue it could not even tell i how many bad character application have be make or allow in the last year let alone what progress have be make in meet the immediate recommendation from last year ’s report do the attorney general know what progress have be make if not will she make immediate inquiry 
 i be always interested in the right hon lady ’s inquiry into the way that datum be produce she have make some valid point in the past and i be always keen to engage with she on how good we can provide transparency i be happy to take her point forward with ministry of justice colleague i have see much close work between the cps and the police that be work particularly well in the area of rape and serious sexual offence which be why we have prioritise that work i would be happy to look into her question 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential establishment of a special tribunal on crime of aggression against ukraine 
 i be confident that russia will be hold accountable for its appalling action in ukraine we have be at the forefront of international effort we have refer russia to the international criminal court we will intervene on behalf of ukraine before the international court of justice later this year and we be part of the core group of state work to establish a special tribunal for the crime of aggression 
 the attorney general will appreciate that the international criminal court do not have jurisdiction over crime of aggression in effect the deliberate violent and unprovoked military incursion into the sovereign territory of another recognise state karim khan a prosecutor at the icc have point out that none of the other war crime commit by russia in ukraine could have happen have it not be for that initial crime of aggression will the attorney general assure we that step be be take to set up a special tribunal as quickly as possible so that putin and his fellow criminal can be bring to justice before they get the chance to destroy the evidence 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his interest in this matter there be broad strand to our work on accountability we have provide expert assistance to ukrainian investigator secondly alongside the international community we will continue to provide the icc with funding people and expertise though i accept that the crime of aggression can not be prosecute there thirdly we be explore other option to hold russia accountable for the crime of aggression 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to increase support for victim of rape and serious sexual offence 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to increase support for victim of rape and serious sexual offence 
 we know that increase support for victim mean that they be more likely to stick with the case until trial we be work together across the criminal justice system to achieve that independent sexual violence adviser be really effective the new intervention be the revise victim code which will put a duty on the cps team to meet the victim 
 in constituency surgery i have hear some of the most horrendous gut wrench child sexual exploitation story some of which have involve multiple instance of rape of young child that have profound lifelong implication not only for the victim but for their family as the case move through the court the experience can be terrible and traumatic which be far exacerbate if the trial be delay will the attorney general assure i that in those case the whole family include the victim be support not only during the trial but before and after with mental health and wellbeing support 
 i have speak to my hon friend about the specific case in his constituency the government be make it easy for all victim include child to access support i speak early about isva we also have child and young person independent sexual violence adviser who be specially train to work with child the solicitor general and i see some great work in manchester where a large number of child victim be support 
 some of those who groom and rap child in rotherham during the child sexual exploitation scandal and be put away be now start to be release some have serve less than half their sentence that be cause immense psychological damage to the victim who live know that their rapist walk free what can we do to protect those vulnerable people and make sure that child rapist serve their proper sentence behind bar 
 public protection be our top priority we want serious offender to serve the time in prison that reflect the seriousness of their crime last year we abolish automatic halfway release for serious sexual and violent offender who be serve more than year 
 i thank the attorney general very much for her answer thing that concern i and everyone in this house but in particular family be the delay for those who have be sexually abuse over a number of year and be wait for a trial to happen what have be do to support family and individual through that because the timescale erode their willingness and confidence to have justice 
 the hon gentleman be quite right to raise the concern that with delay come victim attrition the answer lie in support the isva that i mention early be invaluable in ensure that victim be willing to continue their case to trial 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the level of prosecution rate of serious violent crime in the west midland and if she will make a statement 
 on our recent law tour the attorney general and i see at hand the work of the crown prosecution service west midland serious violence unit as my hon friend would expect the cps prosecute violent crime robustly 
 as the attorney general will know from intimate knowledge serious violent crime be thankfully not something that lichfield suffer very much from at all but that be not the case in the broad west midland what can the cps do to demonstrate to people in the west midland that it will have a tolerance attitude and take action against serious violent crime 
 the sale and use of drug be drive serious and violent crime last year for drug offence the cps in the west midland have a conviction rate of over i agree with my hon friend ’s tolerance approach 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the unduly lenient sentence scheme 
 the unduly lenient sentence scheme remain an important tool ensure appropriate sentence for the most serious crime last year we refer case to the court of appeal and the sentence be increase in just under of those case 
 i thank the solicitor general for his response he will recall that i contact he on behalf of a number of my constituent about a child sex offender in my constituency our local newspaper the stoke sentinel report the sentencing of that offender beneath the headline pervert walks free from court my constituent be rightly concerned that such serious offender can receive a non custodial sentence give that my right hon and learn friend have be unable to intervene will he review the way in which such offending be evaluate so that such case can be consider 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for his question and for raise this case he be a great champion for stoke on trent he will understand    that i can not comment on individual case but it be right to say that the threshold or test for undue leniency be a high in the vast majority of case the crown court judge get the sentence right and the court of appeal will grant permission only in exceptional circumstance 
 whether she have take recent step to support ukraine ’s judiciary in its conduct of war crime trial 
 we have send our most experienced international judge sir howard morrison to train more than ukrainian judge i meet some of they early this year in kyiv with he next week we have a delegation of ukrainian official in the uk for prosecutorial training 
 the international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression be launch in the hague this week with the backing of the eu the us and the international criminal court collect datum interview victim and build evidence file to assist both international and national prosecutor to bring criminal to justice for the invasion of ukraine in addition to what the attorney general have already say what further practical step will she take to support the centre and assist and support international effort to gather evidence of war crime commit in ukraine 
 i thank the hon lady for her question i would be delighted to pick this up with she outside the chamber if she would like more detail on the work we be do i work very closely with the ukrainian prosecutor general andriy kostin his team be currently investigate and prosecute open war crime case during a conflict something that be unprecedented we be provide help at every level include prosecutorial and evidence gather help we be a keen part of the atrocity crime advisory group we have be training judge we be keen to help with the wide accountability question on the international stage as well at all level we be absolutely determined to help our friend in ukraine 
 could the attorney general keep go for another second 
 i could keep go on ukraine almost forever mr speaker what else shall i talk about what a delight i could talk about ukraine all day 
 there be another large piece of work on compensation that we be undertake with our international partner 
 well do 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state if he will make a statement on plan to close rail ticket office 
 i be answer the urgent question on behalf of the secretary of state who be currently involve in this process so it be appropriate for i to respond 
 there have be a huge shift in the way in which passenger purchase ticket at railway station with about in every transaction take place in ticket office in that be down from in a decade early and equate to of rail revenue despite this our station have hardly change in the past year which mean that staff be constrain to work in ticket office although they could serve passenger well on station platform and concourse i be pleased that the rail industry have launch consultation on the future of ticket office under the ticketing and settlement agreement process which will give the public an opportunity to scrutinise the train operate company proposal to ensure that they work in the good possible way for passenger 
 these change be about modernise the passenger experience by move staff out of ticket office to be more visible and accessible around the station crucially no currently staff station will be unstaffe as a result of this reform staff will still be there to provide assistance and additional support for those who need and want it and the new approach will take into consideration the potential impact on individual with protect characteristic it be of course vital that our railway be accessible to all and i have engage directly with accessibility group and will continue to do so 
 this be an industry process so i encourage member and their constituent to engage with their local train operator to find out more about the proposal for their local station if passenger want to raise any view they can contact the relevant passenger body i believe that the industry ’s propose reform could enable staff to provide a more flexible agile and personal service create the modern experience that people expect 
 yesterday the rail delivery group confirm plan to close hundred of rail ticket office across the country but this morning as be usual when difficult decision be make the secretary of state be nowhere to be see this announcement drive every inch of the way by his department not the industry as the minister claim have cause huge anxiety to vulnerable and disabled passenger and rail staff up and down the country and how long have people be give to respond to these hugely consequential plan just day this be a massive change to the network affect more than rail journey a year and hit elderly and disabled passenger the hard and they have be give only week to have their say why do the minister not just admit that this consultation have nothing to do with take on board their concern it be a rubber stamp for a decision that he have already make with the most vulnerable cut out altogether 
 can the minister give any reassurance to vulnerable passenger who rely on staff in railway station to help they to purchase ticket and board train why have he not publish equality impact assessment alongside these consultation give that he claim the solution be modernisation and digital ticketing do he know how many station do not currently have tap in or barcode capability what assessment have he make of the impact on revenue for our rail industry will he admit that this process be merely a prelude to job loss that will mean far few staff to serve the travel public and the continue manage decline of our railway 
 we know what this be really about it be not about reform our railway the government have already ditch plan for great british railways it be not about modernisation the department have already confirm that the contactless ticket roll out be limit to london and the south east this be about thing and thing only the conservatives crash the economy and now they be ask for more self defeat cut on our decline railway 
 on the minister ’s watch our rail service be already be run into the ground with cancellation at record high basic service such as wi fi be take away and legislation to reform the network on the scrapheap will he simply acknowledge that the conservatives can not fix the railway because they break they in the place 
 let i give a little more detail on the secretary of state ’s role in the ticketing and settlement agreement which have be in place not just under conservative administrations but under the last labour administration the secretary of state be require to make a determination where the train operator and the passenger group can not reach an agreement that make it entirely right for he not to be here to respond to the urgent question 
 the hon lady mention job loss and foremost this be all about take expert ticketing staff into the part of the station where currently they be not see if only of ticket be sell across the ticket counter crudely that mean that of passenger be not access that member of staff the idea be to take the member of staff on to the platform to help passenger to purchase ticket via a ticketing machine or online per cent of ticket can be purchase in that manner so there be no reason why this will not be an improvement 
 in the event that there be some staff who do not wish to make the transition of course the train operator will need to look at that the sad reality be that there be an offer on the table that would guarantee no compulsory redundancy up to december but the union leader refuse to put that offer to their member if there be any concern about the impact on job the national union of rail maritime and transport workers and those it back financially might wish to take some responsibility for that 
 the hon lady talk about pay as you go be roll out only to the south east the devolution deal that have be announce will enable the roll out of pilot by the mayors of the west midlands and manchester by the end of this year she also talk about wi fi be take away but that be not the case either we be look for each train operator to do research to show how much the wi fi be use how helpful it be and what more can be do 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the transport committee be conduct an inquiry into accessible transport we have receive alarming evidence that the quality and range of assistance to vulnerable passenger have decline markedly since the pandemic if the redeployment of staff be to be meaningful it be essential that the new role and training be design with the support of campaign group for vulnerable people will my hon friend assure i that that will happen 
 my hon friend make an excellent point the very discussion i have with any group about these change be with those group that represent passenger with accessibility and mobility issue on the railway i tell they that i be keen to work with they to help to ensure that these proposal be design such that they work for each group with different characteristic i will be look to meet they again to ensure that that occur 
 at am the office of rail and road issue its rail passenger assistance booking update for the late year which show that passenger assist increase by compare with the previous year that demonstrate that more help be need at station for people with accessibility need again by free people who be currently under utilise in the ticket office and put they on to the platform to give help and guidance we will help those who need it the most that be at the forefront of everything that the train operator be look to do with these proposal 
 in may there be a partial collapse at northwich station it be the ticket office it be be rebuild as we speak and there be an investigation into the collapse i be now tell by the minister and the secretary of state that it be incredibly likely it seem a foregone conclusion that the ticket office will never reopen disabled and elderly people already struggle access the station but they will struggle even more without staff this be a folly the minister need to think again 
 it be not the ticket office but the expert people in it who assist passenger with these proposal the train operator be look to free up people from behind the glass often in part of the station that passenger do not access to help they to use their skill to get ticket sell at ticket machine and to advise people on how to purchase online so they can do that in future and thereafter to help they with the entire passenger journey experience give they information and make they feel more reassured 
 these roll out have occur across other part of the network london underground do this some year ago and i do not believe the current labour mayor of london have any plan to turn it round because it actually work it give a well passenger experience people can either live in the past or look towards the future the way in which passenger transact across a whole range of service be exactly the same and we be keen to see the railway modernise and thrive 
 many of my constituent write to i about overcrowding on an almost daily basis particularly on chiltern railways no have   ever write to i about ticket office provision sympathetic as i be to the argument for ensure staff come out from behind the counter to assist people directly on platform and around the station how will this solve the demand of passenger which we be probably all see in our inboxe on a day to day basis in relation to rush hour capacity and weekend capacity 
 chiltern railways for example be look to expand coverage at high wycombe by redeploy staff it can get more staff on to the platform this be an example of where my hon friend ’s passenger will benefit because train operator can flex staff to provide more coverage which make people feel more reassure again as hon and right hon member look at the detail and engage with the consultation they may find their constituent be get a wide range of service over a wide range of hour than they currently receive 
 as a booking and ticket clerk on the underground back in the 1970 trust i i know ticketing be now easy i still use the bus and the underground every day so i be familiar with the scene at station in the morning and evening however more screen and more opportunity for thing to go wrong be not the answer to every problem do the minister know how many ticket machine fail every day these machine will make it hard not easy to buy ticket it will be hard not easy to secure refund it will be hard not easy to apply for rail card who use book office clerk disabled people the elderly and people with language problem or difficulty understand how to use the ticket machine will he give the green light for the rdg to change track and scrap this train wreck of a proposal 
 there be regulate operate station but of all station currently do not have any ticket office facility at all and people be still able to use those station to access train per cent of transaction can be complete either online or via a machine in the event that a machine be not work and there be no staff a lot of station like my own be staff for only half the day a ticket to ride can be acquire and then a ticket can be purchase at the end of a journey again these process be already in place for those station with no ticket office we have those block to build on 
 i do not think the minister should plug the beatles in that way 
 many people use station such as stoke on trent station be infrequent traveller and many be vulnerable or elderly and need support to buy a ticket can the minister assure i that there will always be someone at stoke on trent station to provide a paper ticket to those without digital skill 
 there be no plan to replace paper ticket through the train operator process again the aim be to ensure that ticket office staff be free up and on the platform to sell the ticket and help passenger to purchase they at the machine or online the hope be that thereafter those passenger will be able to book   for themselves with confidence without need to use that service those staff will also be available at stoke on trent to provide other service and information more customer service this be the exact way in which our rail passenger transact across the retail and financial space which be why it be the right approach for the railway 
 my constituent who use cross gates station and people across the country will be worried about this proposal because close ticket office be yet another example of private profit be put before the public good in our railway this move be really about gutte railway of station staff who have a big impact on passenger accessibility and safety especially for old and disabled people do the minister really believe that this will make the railway more welcoming for people or do that not matter 
 if we like see station staff when we access our journey and like the fact that we will be see more of they because they will be free up then i absolutely agree with the hon gentleman rather than gutte the railway this government and indeed the taxpayer have provide £ of support since the pandemic that do not sound like gutte the railway to i i truly believe that we will end up with a well station experience that well reflect modern usage which be why we be happy to support the train operator with these proposal as i say of transaction be purchase across the ticket office counter—10 year ago it be in the railway be adapt to the manner in which consumer have change their habit 
 disabled elderly and other vulnerable passenger have be trouble by today ’s announcement but do the minister share my weary exasperation at the fact that people do not understand that the good way to help disabled and elderly passenger be for staff to come out from behind their screen to assist they in use a ticket machine to help they on and off train and to help they to move around the station do he agree that for more than a decade minister have seek to improve service for passenger on the station but have be block at every turn do he not see an opportunity to improve accessibility on our rail network here it should be welcome not reject 
 my hon friend speak with experience have do this role himself and he be absolutely right in what he say i find it patronise to be tell constantly that those who have disability or those who be elderly can not access thing online and can not do this that   be not the case at all at the moment we do not have enough product online and as part of this process i have be push to ensure that we have more online it will mean that people do not have to go to the station beforehand to pick up a travelcard because they need a photo that they have to take the idea be that this move should make thing well for those who have accessibility and mobility challenge not just in put more ticket online and into a place where they can buy they from the comfort of their own home and phone but in make sure they have more help at the station so i thank he for the point he make he speak with expertise 
 the government have oversee the large increase in rail fee my constituent must deal with frequent delay and cancellation and now people in bath and across somerset face lose their ticket office bath be a world heritage site that have a large number of visitor foreign visitor in particular find get through app and ticket machine bewilder they depend on the ticket office it more important than ever now to attract people on to public transport so will the minister explain why my constituent and the many visitor to bath who would otherwise come by coach should feel confident that train journey will be more reliable cheap and more attractive than drive 
 it be because we want to give that well customer experience so that more passenger be see more staff at the station to help they with information make they feel more secure and welcome help they purchase a ticket and do so in a manner where those passenger be use to transact across the space i very much hope the hon lady will see a well staff experience as a result and therefore even more people will be attract on to rail 
 my hon friend be a good minister and a good friend but i think even he know he have a tough gig this morning to use his beatles analogy can he not just let it be i queue up at my ticket office every monday morning there be always a queue of people want route advice people with disability who can not use the machine and people want refund i have to queue because i have an open flexible ticket as many member do that i can not get from the machine will rove member of staff be subject to statutory regulation at the moment ticket office staff be the only staff subject to statutory regulation so i might not even be able to find a roving member of staff to take i to the machine to request a ticket that the machine will not give i it be not go to work be it 
 the beatles analogy rather fly past i i be afraid let i repeat the statistic to my hon friend of all ticket can be purchase from a ticket machine or online in term of the we need to work on i have ask the industry and official to speed up the process so that more ticket can be purchase in that manner and ticket machine can be change so that that can occur i seek to work with my hon friend to convince he that that be the right approach 
 as the former chair of the transport committee and have spend all my time on transport since i become a member i would not be make this statement if i do not believe this be the right thing for the railway and for passenger that matter to i hugely i be not a stooge i do this because i think this be the right thing to do it will create a well passenger experience and it guarantee our future in rail 
 the minister speak of modernise passenger experience of railway have visit he will know that luton station be not fit for purpose and that the ticket office be integral to the upper level walk through from the town centre to high town any closure of the ticket office will pose risk to the security and safety of staff and passenger crucially   can the minister assure i that the propose closure of ticket office will not be use as a reason to delay decrease or halt refurbishment of station that be in need of renovation in the future such as luton station 
 i have stand at the dispatch box and assure the hon lady that the maintenance improvement for luton station will start in august and will be deliver by the beginning of next year i can give she that assurance this programme be completely separate and do not have any knock on effect regard the access for all programme through which station will have be give step free access by next year 
 as part of the process for the programme passenger will have a week period during which they can provide their view on individual station so they can give their view on luton station there will then be a day period during which passenger group will assess what they have see and they can work with train operator on issue with which they be uncomfortable perhaps for reason of meet accessibility need finally the secretary of state will determine matter if the party can not agree so there be a process in place to ensure that every station meet its requirement which they must do from an accessibility perspective none of that change through this mechanism 
 per cent of ticket sale be still an awful lot of ticket sale in this process i hope that people who choose or need to buy their ticket from a ticket office will not suffer from the tyranny of the majority who choose not to and that their interest will be properly protect throughout will the minister assure i that those people who want to pay for their ticket use cash will still be able to do so to i ban people from use cash to buy ticket would be completely unacceptable 
 i think i see the beatles analogy because there be a ticket to ride process—[interruption okay that be it that process be available to anybody who wish to pay cash for example if my hon friend look at the northern train website he will see that there be a whole feature explain how cash can still be use the machine should take cash in the event that they do not there be a process for passenger to purchase a ticket on the train without fear of a penalty so yes cash can still be use in the machine 
 the minister be clearly on southeastern time that be why he be late get the analogy he say that just of ticket be sell over the counter but that do not explain who be use the ticket office and what alternative arrangement he be go to make for they southeastern have announce ticket office closure of which be in south east london that be in south east london that be an outrage in my constituency have close but all the one around my constituency be close as well what will he do to ensure that these people not only keep their job once they be move out from behind the glass but be not move from be redeploy to redundancy and what will he do about the who rely on ticket office 
 i say respectfully to the hon member that southeastern have have its good performance in year he stand in this place in january rightly say that change in the december timetable have lead to high cancellation rate those rate have go down from to southeastern be of the good operator in term of performance that be all down to the staff but never have he stand up to thank the staff for turn thing around and work so hard he should not think they be his friend when they have to listen to he go on and give misinformation about the situation he have also get southeastern ’s consultation wrong southeastern be do its part in stage the part be on the metro so it be london travelwatch that will deal with the response it will then roll out the change to the rest of the network he know that because it be on an email send to he 
 i pay tribute to and thank people such as vinnie at chislehurst station who be actually very busy when i come through this morning to get my rather late run southeastern train but we will leave that on side do the minister accept that day be a very short period for such an important consultation secondly of the station name sundridge park do not have step free access to both platform it be staff currently in the ticket office who help people get on the train they put up the ramp and help passenger to negotiate the step will he give an undertaking that no staff will be remove until cast iron arrangement be in place for somebody to be in attendance on those station to assist people throughout all the hour that a station be operate 
 the change mean that some staff may be well deploy on the platform because that be where they be see most of the passenger and some of they need their help there may be other situation where it make more sense for that member of staff to be near where they be currently position because of the design of the station the idea be that each station be look at so that when a member of the public decide to fill in the consultation they will get a dropdown which will locate the station in which they be interested and then they can provide their comment the passenger group will then look to see whether what be propose will work if it do not that be a different matter i can give my hon friend the assurance that the train operator and the passenger group will make their determination on a case by case basis where thing do not make sense those change will not just be put through to make for a bad experience 
 the announced closure of railway ticket office across greater manchester include at levenshulme and gorton station will be to the detriment of my constituent who depend on they just when we should be encourage travel by rail to reduce our carbon footprint this measure will push people away from our great british railway we should be try to make train travel easy cheap and more accessible so why be the government act against the interest of the public 
 i re emphasise that the aim of these measure be to redeploy staff who be currently underutilise and who be not see the passenger that they use to   because passenger habit have change those staff will be free up to work in other area where they can not only sell the ticket to the passenger but also help they with information and cater for any particular accessibility need on the platform this be all about make for a well passenger experience all i can say to the hon member be that he have the consultation and he should complete it he will find that thing such as this happen in all walk of life and in train station as well manchester have look at use ticketless travel tyne wear metro have just do this and london underground have do it for year it actually work and it give a well passenger experience and that be what i be determined to see the train operator deliver through this change 
 i have huge concern about these plan as the minister know my hard press constituent try to get to work college or university from marsden or slaithwaite station and transit through huddersfield still face huge disruption on the transpennine route when the computer say no do he not agree that the good way for they to get advice on ticketing refund alternative route and when the next train be come be by speak to fully train staff in ticket office 
 if i give my station as an example we have member of staff who be in a ticket office most people already have their ticket for the reason i have give only in buy they from the ticket office they access the platform through a gate and do not see any member of staff if there be delay and problem it be well for passenger to be alongside the member of staff on the platform to get that information rather than try to find they behind glass 
 there be a problem with the minister ’s point about look to the future back in transport for the north of which i be a board member at the time be force to abandon its integrate smart ticketing programme after the government pull the funding i be sure the minister will remember that from his time on the select committee that work would have help to digitise transport and create multi modal multi operator pay as you go travel on rail light rail and bus we think it be a deeply flawed decision at the time and recent event have show that to be the case will he work with tfn and other to see whether any of that work can be reinstate 
 i have the great respect for the hon member and i will certainly look at what more can be do we be keen to roll out more pay as you go there will be station by the end of the year that will have pay as you go in place where people can tap in and out that tend to be the future as we see with london underground those pilot be in place for the end of the year in the west midland and manchester i recognise that do not cover the area he mention and i be happy to work with he to see what more can be do 
 come back to london underground this system have be in place for some year london underground do not have staff behind ticket office counter and i believe it work well it have free those staff to come out into the station area as a whole where they can give much well advice and understanding to passenger it work really well and that be why i believe no labour mayor have ask for it to be reinstate 
 resident in swindon have a taste of thing to come yesterday when the ticket office be close and people be queue out of the door to use the wholly inadequate machine at the station the wi fi be unreliable as well if we be to proceed with this significant change the technology available to customer must be significantly well and we need to avoid a situation where elderly customer who come to pick up an advance ticket have nobody to help they will the minister do everything he can work with the rail authority to ensure that resident do not face to quote the beatles again a magical mystery tour when they come to swindon station 
 i will certainly do so with my right hon and learn friend and i will share a bit of experience that lead i to want more in this direction i need to get a weekly travel card but i could not get it online because it be not available i go to the station but do not have a photo with i i ask why be it the case that we still need a photo when that weekly travel card be less than an avanti single i be tell that ’ the way it have be on the railway for year that ’s why we do it that be not good enough i have mobility so i can walk up to charing cross to make that transaction or not make it and then leave but for other who do not it do not work for they at all i can give he the assurance that alongside this programme be a strong exercise to make all product accessible from machine and online be already accessible but we need to get the full suite of product so that people do not have to queue in the manner he have just describe 
 although these station office closure be in england they have implication for scottish passenger many in my constituency myself include never mind those in the borders and elsewhere in southern scotland access service through station in northern england in berwick and elsewhere that be not just a matter of choice but often a matter of necessity it be require because of the pan uk service timetable from lner tpe or crosscountry all of which be sign off by the dft what discussion be take place with the scottish government or with scottish passenger representative to ensure that the right of those north of the border who be impact by this change will be protect 
 i will be look to speak to the scottish executive in scotland similar proposal have as i understand it be roll out to a number of ticket station by scotrail i want to assess whether that be a mandate from the executive i will certainly be have a chat with they to see what lesson can be learn give that scotland appear to have go before england in that regard 
 may i take this opportunity to welcome the extension of contactless payment to berkhamsted and tring in south west hertfordshire i declare an interest as a local commuter from of those station although this initiative on rail ticket office will in my eye help more traveller can my hon friend reassure the house that additional support will remain for those who require help such as the elderly and the disabled 
 yes i can i thank my hon friend for his point i know that he have busy station and will want to ensure that his constituent be look after the very meeting that i have when we be look at the train operator proposal be with disability and access group and age concern group i want to work with they i still do to find out what individual characteristic of the design may work for some but not for other i can give he the assurance that we will continue to support those who have the great vulnerability i firmly believe that take people out from behind glass and put they into area where they can be well access will mean that they will be able to give passenger the great help make for a well rail experience 
 the minister say that he have engage with relevant disabled people ’s organisation but there have be widespread opposition to ticket office closure from such organisation include disability rights uk the national federation of the blind transport for all royal national institute of blind people royal national institute for deaf people guide dogs and scope the minister think that take expert staff out of station ticket office and put they on the platform will help people but how will people know which member of staff to go to for the help they need a ticket office mean that people know where to go to get that help if those staff be to be redeploy there will not be a single redundancy will there minister i have a funny feeling that these proposal will go down not like a yellow submarine but like a lead balloon 
 i have state the position with regard to redundancy a deal be on the table but the rmt will not give it to its member to make a determination it include a commitment to no compulsory redundancy until december it be for the rmt to decide whether it wish to get that protection in place i will say the same thing to the hon member that i have say previously i have work with those group they be the i meet and be at the forefront of my mind in ensure that this work from a passenger perspective if they want to reach out to a member of staff for any reason they will do so and member of staff will because they be great member of staff signpost they to somebody else all member of staff must have the requisite training and they do i have great faith in our railway workforce to continue look after passenger i believe that these change will bring more benefit in that regard 
 i thank the minister for meet i yesterday to discuss the propose closure of darlington ’s booking office i also meet david horne yesterday afternoon to discuss that issue i remain deeply concerned that our mainline station which be currently receive £ of expansion investment will be leave without a booking office the elderly disabled and vulnerable rely on help from our ticket office and if a station have barrier that help need to be in front of those barrier not behind they ticket machine and app have cut off time make purchase impossible in the minute run up to a train leaving will my hon friend look into that problem will he assure the house that there be proper consultation and that some ticket office can be save will he make it clear that representation can be make by letter and not just by email 
 yes the way in which the ticketing and settlement agreement process work mean that anyone can access it online but they can also write detail will be available at station and indeed online explain how people can write through to make their point about their station 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for meet i and for do so in a constructive manner whereby he be able to give i example of his concern include ticket not be available within minute of travel i have take that point away because it form part of the catalogue of change that i want to see the remain of ticket that can not be purchase for that reason should be reduce towards i invite all right hon and hon member who can give other example to get in contact with i as well because i will take those problem away and look at get they fix 
 the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   be right sometimes it be just too complicated to purchase a ticket without use a ticket office i recently have that experience and buy my ticket from the ticket office be £ cheap than if i have purchase it from the machine i be afraid that the beatles analogy he start be right he ’s get a ticket to ride and he do n’t care 
 i be not even aware that i have start a beatles analogy actually this be more important than joke about music this be about reassure passenger that we can deliver a well experience but also an experience that they be very familiar with in term of the other transaction they make across the retail space more and more people be do that online and they start do it online by be teach how to do it the idea be that ticket staff who be currently behind glass not see those passenger will help to deliver that and ensure that those passenger have a well experience and do not need to queue up next time because they can do it in a seamless manner where that operation do not exist because of the machine we be look to upgrade i will take any example he have to ensure that passenger get the good price but can do it online or via a machine 
 staff at kettering railway station be superb they be friendly polite efficient and dedicate to simply outstanding customer service give that kettering be of the station potentially affect will the rail minister encourage rail passenger in kettering to take part in the public consultation promote by east midlands railway can he confirm that if the change go through a passenger who turn up at kettering railway station with cash to buy a ticket will be able to do so 
 yes i can give my hon friend the assurance that cash purchase would remain across the network if there be a machine that be not work for cash passenger can enter the train safe in the knowledge that they can then purchase their ticket on the train or at the end of their journey there be a number of station that be not part of the current consultation and they will tend to be the end point where passenger will find a busy station i can absolutely give he that assurance 
 my hon friend mention the staff we be look at the ticket office as a place that people be not access any more but the ticketing staff be brilliant all we want to do be utilise they more so that they can see more people and use their expertise passenger want their ticket office staff to be more accessible so that they can gain that expertise and that be exactly why we want to put they in the place where the passenger be 
 i be a bit worried the minister keep say that staff be not utilise and that people be not access ticket office i can tell he that in hull last year nearly ticket be sell from the ticket office that be ticket every minute we have go through year of bad management with transpennine at hull paragon station this look like another downgrading of facility for passenger we have hear about the effect it will have on the elderly the disabled and the vulnerable can the minister just for once put the travel public 
 i be put the travel public when i make these point what the right hon lady and other can not deny despite say it can not be believe be that year ago in ticket be sell across the ticket office counter because people be not purchase as much online or through machine now it be that demonstrate that ticket office staff be not be utilise fully we want to utilise they in a well manner redeploying staff where they be not as busy as they be and could be well utilise and have a more rewarding job be what happen across the retail sector the railway should be no different 
 anyone who have experience the long queue from the machine and the ticket office at my local train station of leigh on sea sometimes it go out of the office and around the block on a monday morning and sometimes on a saturday will know why i have be campaign for contactless ticketing to be extend to leigh on sea and chalkwell station ever since i arrive in this place as such i be personally delighted however innovation must never be use as an excuse to exclude any of my constituent or deliver a bad service the blind and partially sight such as the wonderful jill allen king obe can not access the touchscreen ticket machine and need a person to help they buy that ticket but that person do not need to be behind glass can the minister assure i that there will always be somebody available at leigh on sea and chalkwell ticket station to help the blind and partially sight the elderly and anyone else who need help 
 yes any currently staff station will not become unstaffed as a result of these change as i have say of station do not have ticket office staff but if the station that my hon friend have mention be currently staff they will not become unstaffed
