i start by thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan and for sheffield hallam olivia blake i know the hon member for sheffield hallam could not be here this afternoon but she have do a huge amount of work over the last month since the last debate i also thank my hon friend   the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory who be the co chair this be a fantastic example of cross party work on such an important issue to woman but also to man up and down the country i pay tribute to the work that those on the all party parliamentary group do they be tireless campaigner for improve support for all family who go through the heartbreak of lose a baby 
 this be the baby loss awareness week and the consecutive year that this house have hold a debate to mark it i be proud once again to be able to applaud all campaigner charity and clinician who   mark baby loss awareness week i will use my time this afternoon to provide an update on the progress we have make since the debate last year and on pregnancy loss in particular 
 before i do i want to touch on the comment by my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton who be my constituency neighbour as well i want to apologise because while we have deliver most of the change in his act we still have not publish the consultation on coronial investigation into stillbirth i know from speak to bill kirkup and donna ockenden that they be very supportive of coronial investigation into stillbirth i have meet many parent who have suffer the horrendous experience of lose a baby and who be very supportive of this change i be hop to come to the dispatch box and be able to make a positive announcement unfortunately i can not do so this afternoon but i can assure he that i will personally follow this up after the debate i hope that in a very short period of time we will be able to make a positive announcement for he 
 the loss of a baby be tragically a common outcome we be improve rate stillbirth rate have reduce by and neonatal mortality rate for baby bear over week gestation have reduce by but that be no consolation to those parent who experience baby loss when it do happen we know that too often when baby loss occur the experience of parent and family be not what it should be that be why the independent pregnancy loss review publish its report in july and the government be support the recommendation in that report to make sure that every trust offer a consistent compassionate service the review make it clear that baby loss be too often treat as a clinical event with emotional support fail or fall short in a number of area that be why it be so important that we reintroduce compassion as an element throughout the experience 
 let i take example that be show in the pregnancy loss review i be horrify to read story of woman miscarry at home and store their baby ’s remain in their fridge in a tupperware container because they be wait day for their early pregnancy loss unit to reopen the review put it down in black and white that major improvement be need and that be why we be support the recommendation 
 the review make recommendation for change within the nhs and wide society and we have already start action on many of those the be touch on by the snp spokesperson   the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson the use of baby loss certificate for baby who be bear before week who currently can not be register we announce in july that we would be roll out baby loss certificate they will be retrospective there be no time limit on apply for they they will be voluntary so parent do not have to apply for if they do not feel that they wish to we be go through service user testing with family to ensure that the system we set up work for they follow testing there have be some service specification that we need to improve to ensure that the process run smoothly it will be run on the gov.uk website once we have those safeguard in place for both parent to be able to register on a certificate we will announce the roll out date formally to this place it be important that parent who want to acknowledge the loss of their baby before week be able to do so 
 we also look at the sensitive disposal of a baby after pregnancy loss many instance of which happen at home rather than in hospital or clinical setting it be important that woman have access to proper collection facility so we have take on board the recommendation on create a bespoke receptacle to ensure that foetal remain can be collect and store with due dignity to do that we have be engage with charity woman and healthcare professional and we aim to finalise a specification by february we be also work with the human tissue authority to review and update its guideline by march next year nhs england be also consult on a clear pathway to ensure that woman can always have access to cold storage in nhs facility too 
 we have also hear from woman about the difficulty they often experience in get help during a miscarriage in partnership with nhs england we be explore how and ambulance service can block book appointment with early pregnancy assessment unit so that woman in need can be direct straight to they if necessary rather than go to a&e or other healthcare professional they can go straight to those unit where care can be provide with dignity and privacy the review also propose introduce grade care for woman who suffer or more miscarriage the shadow minister touch on that issue we have take on board those recommendation because currently woman have to suffer miscarriage often before they get help 
 tommy ’s miscarriage centre at the woman ’s hospital in birmingham have launch a month pilot of that grade model so that after miscarriage assessment can be deliver i have be to the unit to see the amazing work it do and i be look forward to its result it will look at that grade model and be able to present to we the difference that that will make to woman experience baby loss that will help to prevent further pregnancy loss in future 
 another recommendation make by the pregnancy loss review concern the fact that family be often force to grieve in public space i want to be clear about this very often the pregnancy facility be inadequate my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth talk about the daisy centre that be available in her area it be not available when she tragically have to go through her experience in many place clinic unit and building be not able to meet woman ’s need therefore nhs england be survey pregnancy facility and will report back by the spring to ensure we can invest in those facility to improve the outcome and experience for woman and their family we also need to improve bereavement support for both woman and their family that be another key area we be look at 
 member touch on the number of midwife there be i be pleased that in cornwall there be a waiting list for training but across england there have be an increase in the number of midwife there be more than in we be engage in a number of route into midwifery we have the degree apprenticeship now but we also have the nurse conversion course which be popular with nurse who perhaps want to work in midwifery instead of nursing those route be not just get more midwife into practice but retain they that be a key element to be able to deliver all the ask in the pregnancy loss review 
 we be also look at how we support people in the workplace it be important that woman and family who experience baby loss be able to take the time off that they need as a step the department have sign the miscarriage association pregnancy loss pledge and we encourage other organisation to do so 
 we could cover a number of issue that be raise in the debate i just want to be clear with the house about all the issue that have be raise with the ongoing maternity inquiry we have set up a national oversight board so that we can pull together all the recommendation and finding whether from donna ockenden bill kirkup or other inquiry that have happen in the past and make sure that every single maternity unit across england be respond to they whether they be relevant to their unit experience or not we want consistent good maternity care across the board whether that be the birthrate plus model for make sure there be more midwife on unit make sure the capital framework of the unit be able to help support woman who lose their baby or ensure that the culture of change that bill kirkup touch on so much in his review be roll out so that woman have a compassionate experience when they go through the devastating loss of a baby 
 it be our duty to support family who experience the devastating loss of a baby and this government remain committed to implement all the independent pregnancy loss review ’s recommendation at the debate next year i hope that my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham will have a more positive comment to make and we will have address his concern in detail but also that we will have take a step forward on many of the issue raise today and on some of the work we have start with the pregnancy loss review 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with the canal river trust on its funding 
 we have have many discussion with the canal river trust over the past year on the review of its funding and we be provide it with more than £ of additional funding between and when the trust be create in the department for environment food and rural affairs and the trust sign a memorandum of understanding agree that the trust would have to move increasingly towards alternative source of funding 
 in ellesmere port we be proud that the canal river trust have make its headquarters there but we be concerned about the implication of the funding decision which amount to a £ cut in real term over the next decade clearly that will cause the trust real problem so i urge the minister to think again about these decision and to engage with the trust about how that gap can be bridge 
 we all recognise the important work and benefit that the canal river trust bring but the £ cut in funding assert by the trust be not correct because that include adjustment for inflation government funding do not provide for that we should also remember that an investment portfolio of over £ be transfer to the trust and it get the benefit of the investment and the funding that accrue from they 
 i call the member of rosie and jim fame 
 thank you mr speaker as chairman of the all party parliamentary group for the waterway i share concern about the future of our canal network but i be conscious of the fact that year ago when the trust be set up the aim   be for it to be self financing richard parry the chief executive have discuss with i and ministers in the past the possibility of receive a lump sum rather than a sum over year what progress have be make on that 
 i thank my hon friend for all the valuable work he do in that capacity that subject be still under discussion 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on introduce the propose ban on american bully xl dog 
 the prime minister make a decision about introduce the propose ban on american xl bully dog recognise the horrific consequence of recent dog attack and the disproportionate amount of those be undertake by such dog we be work at pace on the legislation and importantly on how it will be put into practice and i hope to say more on that soon 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer as a veterinary surgeon i strongly agree with the prime minister the home secretary and the secretary of state that we need to ban the dangerous american xl bully dog as soon as possible to keep people and other animal safe do my right hon friend agree that in parallel to this necessary urgent action we need to undertake important work with the public on responsible dog breeding responsible dog ownership and well training and socialising of dog as part of a holistic long term solution to dog attack 
 my hon friend have great credibility in this field give his professional experience as a vet i understand that many owner of xl bully dog be passionate about their animal their pet that be why we be work at pace but take our time to get right the definition and the transition period that we anticipate it be important that all dog owner work to make sure that their dog behave and have appropriate training that be why we establish a taskforce that include dog welfare charity we expect it to respond to we by the end of the year and we will potentially take forward some of its recommendation 
 as someone who have have a pet dog all my life and still do i be conscious that some of those who own american xl bully dog think that their dog be integral and safe but many in the general public see they as a danger and have fear be the secretary of state ’s intention as this process go forward in westminster to engage with the northern ireland assembly and the police in particular to ensure that the law and the recommendation that come out of this place can be share with they 
 the hon gentleman be right to recognise owner concern where they believe that they have very good dog that be to some extent accommodate already in the legislation that have evolve since on work   with other nation the law the primary legislation will apply in both england and wales by default but we be work with the scottish government and the northern ireland administration on potential move to make this a uk wide approach 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i listen carefully to the answer the secretary of state give to both hon member but i be still not reassure that she have the plan legislation in place to ban xl bully dog effectively be she satisfied that we have the kennel space across the uk enough vet to make assessment and clear rule and legislation in place to make the ban effective 
 the hon lady ask a fair question the legislation have evolve since with amendment make to the primary legislation in and in the dangerous dogs exemption schemes england and wales order in that there be a combination of work with the police in particular and with local council and of course the judicial system we have be work closely with my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire to take the matter forward i want to ensure that the legislation be right i be expect to present statutory instrument to make it effective with bring the ban into effect and the other provide the transition element and some of the fine detail that still need to be complete 
 whether she plan to publish a new timeline for key milestone on a extend producer responsibility for packaging and b other measure in the resource and waste strategy for england 
 in july we announce the deferral of the producer payment under the extend producer responsibility scheme move they to october i must say that that be at the request of industry which ask for more time so that it could prepare we remain fully committed to deliver the programme to the timeline the government continue to deliver obligation set out in the resource and waste strategy and we recently publish maximising resources minimising waste which be england ’s waste prevention programme on   october we also expand our ban on certain single use plastic item 
 i be grateful for that comprehensive answer no should underestimate the critical role of recycling but as i be tell by the green alliance it be critical that it be economically viable for the industry which be worried about the increase cost of waste separation in the government ’s proposal i accept what the minister say but will she confirm whether her department ’s upcoming simple recycling proposal   will retain commitment for recycle to be separate   at home 
 detail of the simple recycling system will be announce shortly but i can tell the house that it will mean that all local authority will collect the same material of course as we have always say food waste will have to be collect separately it will also be flexible this have all be discuss with local authority 
 what step she be take to support a healthy and sustainable food system 
 the government ’s food strategy set out long term measure to support a resilient healthy and more sustainable food and farming system in may the prime minister ’s farm to fork summit build on that with a focus on how we can work together to support a thriving uk food and farming industry the summit focus on innovation skill and labour and on roll out the new farming scheme to ensure fairness across the supply chain to boost export and support energy and water security as well as to reduce red tape 
 every year post farm gate tonne of food that could have provide more than perfectly edible meal be waste that also have a massive carbon footprint give that defra ’s impact assessment conclude that mandatory food waste reporting would result in 
 financial benefit to business and significant environmental benefit 
 and be back by many retailer include tesco why have the government drop their plan 
 we be work closely with retailer to try to reduce food waste and will continue to do that the hon member will recognise that a vast amount of food waste occur within the domestic home and we can do more to help and support consumer to make the most of the food they purchase we will continue to work with primary producer retailer and consumer to reduce food waste wherever we can 
 sustainability be top of our agenda in the new forest and the national park authority be keen to discuss opportunity for it with the minister i have send he an invitation will he come 
 i be excited to have an opportunity to visit the new forest as soon as my diary allow i will hot foot it down there to meet my right hon friend 
 i call the shadow minister 
 to maintain that healthy sustainable food system farmer need a level playing field so when   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg   make his recent comment about the benefit of import hormone inject beef it send a shudder through the industry this time last year he be at the very top of government alongside the secretary of state give the minister ’s long experience in government can he tell we how many other at the top of his government privately harbour that view 
 the gentleman at the top of government the prime minister have be absolutely clear and explicit that we will not accept hormone produce beef at any point in the future nor will we accept chlorinated chicken he have the backing and support of british farmer and he will do everything he can to help and support they 
 what step her department be take to require water company to help reduce water pollution and unsatisfactory overflow 
 i be pleased that my hon friend have ask that question because no government in history have take a more comprehensive approach to tackle water pollution this conservative government be deliver more investment strong regulation and tough enforcement to tackle every source of water pollution under our storm overflow discharge reduction plan £ be target at clean up storm sewage overflow thank to our monitoring we know what be happen and we be able to take action let i remind member that there be virtually no monitoring under the labour government this government be set the record straight 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that answer the liberal democrats pretend that we can fix storm overflow in hour and labour have an undeliverable sewage plan so it be unsurprise that sewage be discharge more often in socialist run wales can my hon friend confirm that it be only the conservative plan for water that be credible costed and comprehensive 
 as ever my hon friend be right on the button we be the only party with a costed credible plan to tackle this issue and we uncover it if labour have a plan it would be use it in wales we have just hear how serious the illegal sewage discharge be in wales we have discover that not only have natural resources wales not carry out any enforcement but it have not issue any fine at all on this subject nothing and the liberals do not have any plan 
 order we will get through these question i have to get to a certain number and i have not yet call the chair of the select committee and you be not help i 
 like many of my constituent over the summer i take advantage of the relatively warm temperature in the north sea to enjoy swim off our coast should my constituent and i worry about the quality of the water due to the practice of water company be it not time for labour ’s plan for automatic fine for discharge 
 per cent of bathing water around our coast be good or excellent it be a tremendous record 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 scarborough ’s south bay be include in the of bathing water without a blue flag north yorkshire council recently convene a taskforce of local politician the environment agency yorkshire water and other include academic from durham university to look at the problem it become clear that it be not as simple as many people think discharge come from further north around the bay and pathogen be pick up not only from human effluent but from sea bird dog and ruminant will the minister take a personal interest in that work because lesson learn in scarborough may well apply around the country 
 my right hon friend highlight that the issue be not as simple as people think that be why our plan for water take a holistic approach to tackle all source of water pollution it be also why we launch our £ slurry fund to help farmer reduce the pollution that they may inadvertently put into watercourse 
 i have never hear such codswallop in all my time in the house i be bear by the thames and i love the river and i have to say to the minister that i have see no government in history who have put more sewage into our stream river and ocean than her since the privatisation of water 
 i have a meeting about the thames tideway tunnel yesterday that amazing project have already increase wildlife so extraordinarily at the end by the lee tunnel that there be kingfisher otter and all kind of other creature there when the tunnel be finish it will be the big single mean of clean up the thames that have ever be put in place it be this government through a special tool of private public funding who be enable that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last year this government oversaw record level of illegal sewage discharge into our river and waterway after they cut enforcement and then they let the water boss reward themselves for that failure with nearly £ in bonus while hike bill for consumer labour believe that the polluter and not the consumer should pay will the government adopt labour ’s plan and give the regulator the power it need to block water boss bonus if they keep illegally pump toxic filth into our river 
 i have already say that labour have not cost its plan which have no credibility whatsoever we have already change regulation and the tool that ofwat and the ea can use no dividend or bonus can be pay out at all if there be any environmental damage and there be more fine than ever before there be no fine under the labour government indeed they be take to court by the european commission for pollute water and they do nothing about it this government introduce the monitoring and that be why we know what be happen and why we have the big criminal investigation in the history of water under way 
 what step she be take to support fishing community 
 the government be support community by open new fishery for spurdog and bluefin tuna accelerate action to protect valuable non quota stock through the fishery management plan and protect stock by well control fly seiner and we have bring about increase benefit through reform of the economic link 
 off the coast of beautiful hastings and rye fisherman be suffer the impact on their fishing of a grow seal colony due to the nature of the fishing small boat leave their net in the water sound system to deter seal be not appropriate what step be the minister take to ensure that the presence of seal do not result in the decimation of our fishing community let alone the fish 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who be a tenacious campaigner for her fishing community we be work alongside the marine management organisation to assess non lethal seal deterrent option to keep seal away from fishing catch and we will publish an evidence report on target acoustic startle technology later this year we be also consider the next step include for net fishery under our clean catch programme the special committee on seal provide formal scientific advice to the government on behalf of the natural environment research council on the management of seal population under the conservation of seals act and the marine scotland act its report include seal population datum base on extensive regional survey and form the foundation for monitor our uk marine strategy 
 i wonder whether the minister have see the video footage that be do the round of the recent incident involve the spanish longliner antonio maria try to ram the shetland whitefish boat defiant in fact it put out a rope to foul its propeller the footage be truly shocking but the real scandal be that this be not the time it have happen it be at least the document incident in recent time this will keep happen unless something be do to stop it so will the minister speak to his colleague in the department for transport and the foreign office to make sure that france as the flag state with enforcement power in this case take its responsibility seriously 
 i have see that footage it be truly shocking this be a deliberate act to try to sabotage a uk fishing boat it be outrageous behaviour as the right hon gentleman identifie enforcement be difficult because the incident involve a spanish boat under a french flag but give the seriousness of the event i will most certainly raise it with my ministerial colleague 
 what step her department be take to support community farming project 
 we welcome community farm in england because they give local community a chance to become involved in the countryside like any other farm they may be eligible for a variety of grant enable small farm to be support more fairly we have introduce a sustainable farming incentive management payment and we have also extend the farming in protect landscape fund until march the fund be open to farmer in national park and area of outstanding natural beauty allow they to deliver project to support nature climate people and place 
 figure from a social return on investment study show that every £ invest in a community farm be worth £ of community benefit through food production new skill and community resource in my constituency for instance lauriston farm be invest in a community orchard and garden outdoor learning and a community kitchen to help people pick up new skill and produce affordable food do the minister agree that in a cost of living crisis it be critically important for people to have access to such facility and that more need to be do to help small community project to maximise their potential 
 i pay tribute to those who be involve in that community project as the hon lady will know agriculture be devolve to the scottish government and i hope they will use some of the £ a year that they be give to support scottish farmer i be sure she will be a tenacious campaigner in hold the snp government to account 
 what step her department be take to protect rural community in flood risk area 
 what step her department be take to protect rural community in flood risk area 
 the government ’s year £ flood investment programme benefit both urban and rural community approximately of scheme and of investment be be direct at rural community which have benefit from our frequently flood fund our natural flood management fund and our flood and coastal innovation programme 
 the minister have visit shrewsbury a number of time at my invitation and have hear at hand from the river severn partnership which be try to find a holistic solution to the problem of manage britain ’s long river rather than just create flood barrier which push the problem downstream when can give we more information and an update on the resource be afford to the partnership to support landowner and other who can be part of that solution 
 i thank my hon friend for the great work that he do with the partnership both the secretary of state and i have visit his constituency there be fund available the £ for natural flood   management scheme may be of interest to farmer and the environmental land management scheme include provision for temporary storage capacity on farm 
 in the autumn storm overflow be inevitable and my constituent be hold their breath as they wonder whether their home will be flood once again i understand from speak to resident that it be very unclear whom they should call when that occur so will the minister look again at set up a national flood line that can be call at any time and ensure that it be connect to a local flood centre that will be accountable for a response from local service 
 i have visit my hon friend ’s constituency and i know that she have do a great deal of work on the issue of flooding the environment agency work in partnership with the met office to provide an online check for flood service which be operate today to deal with storm babet member of the public can check the flood risk find advice and guidance on how to prepare for flooding and sign up for warning on the gov.uk site 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i listen carefully to the minister ’s response and i note that she do not mention the national infrastructure council ’s report commission by the government a year ago which state that an extra home be at risk of flooding not because of climate change but because of the government ’s failure to maintain exist flood defence asset when the government can not even get the basic right how can anyone possibly trust they to have the answer to the ever increase flood risk that our country face 
 that be exactly the environment agency ’s duty and it work very hard on the asset management side of our flood asset which be a very large proportion of our £ fund 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the step take by her department to prevent sewage discharge 
 we have go far and fast than any government in history to drive down sewage discharge last month we publish our £ plan which set stringent target to reduce sewage discharge those target will prioritise action at target site what do labour do it do nothing when it be in power 
 water company need stable finance to make improvement in december ofwat outline concern about the financial resilience of several water company what have the minister do to mitigate the risk and what will she be do in future 
 the ofwat report on sewage discharge publish in september be extremely disappointing i have write to all the water company that be highlight as lag and i have write to all the   ceo to say that i want to meet they in person i have also write to the ceo and chair of ofwat to ask how they will hold these water company to account 
 this government introduce monitoring so we now know the state of the problem the water company be now engage and ofwat have power to put financial pressure on they give that only of sewage overflow in scotland be monitor do this not show that we be progress it in the right way and that the nationalisation of water company be not the way to go 
 i agree with my hon friend 
 what recent assessment she have make of the impact of inflation on the affordability of food 
 in september the consumer price index be at down from in july industry analysis expect that food price inflation will continue to decrease over the remainder of the government be provide an average of £ per household to support they with the cost of live this year and next 
 the west lothian food bank in my livingston constituency do an incredible job just like food bank across the uk but the reality be that it should not even have to exist folk be struggle more than ever which be why the snp have call on the uk government to control supermarket price gouging amid record profiteering by introduce a price cap on staple such as bread and milk will the minister help all our constituent by get on with do that 
 if the hon lady compare the price of a shopping basket around europe with the price here in the uk she will see that the free market be do a lot of work to suppress food inflation we have a cheap food basket than they have in france and germany she be in effect advocate communism she should look at how that work around the world control those market do not work 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 prior to the westminster crisis that have be inflict on we all by the tory party a loaf of wholemeal bread cost £ even after a slight drop in food price the price be now high we know the farmer be not benefit from these price increase the price of milk in supermarket today be almost twice what we pay the farmer for their product why will the government and the secretary of state not consider price cap to stop the supermarket profiteer and to help ensure that basic essential be not beyond the reach of many people 
 we have do an enormous amount of work in this area to help to support primary producer and farmer we will legislate in the dairy sector to help to make sure those contract be fair and to make sure   we have fairness across the supply chain the hon gentleman be advocate the control of market price which would have exactly the opposite effect of what he want to achieve it would drive up price across the country and we would end up in a far bad place 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the met office have issue various warning indeed as the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for taunton deane rebecca pow point out we be prepare for potentially significant storm which be why the environment agency have mobilise its emergency operation centre and why temporary defence be be line up in different part of the country we continue to encourage household to register for flood alert and warning and to take action where appropriate 
 ball corporation have invest £ to create europe ’s large and most modern aluminium drink can manufacture plant in burton latimer will the secretary of state be kind enough to meet the company to explore her plan to support drink can producer against potentially unfair market distortion as a result of the decision to exclude glass from the deposit return scheme 
 i decide not to proceed with glass in the drs because of the complication that would bring to its introduction i would have think his local company would benefit from that however i know that the chief executive recently have a constructive and useful meeting with the recycling minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for taunton deane rebecca pow who will take away the comment from that for further consideration as we finalise our policy 
 i have receive a host of email from constituent many with respiratory problem who be rightly complain about poor air quality the smoke in the air be cause by heather burn on the moor which result in a spike in poor air quality to level that be time the legal limit will the government finally do the right thing and bring in an outright ban on these practice which be affect not only my constituent health but the natural environment and the climate 
 the hon lady will be aware of the action that have be take that ministers require sheffield city council to take to accelerate measure to improve air quality on the wide measure that she talk about we be not seek to ban important practice but of course thing continue to evolve air quality be improve and she should be grateful not only to her local council but to the government for make that happen in her constituency 
 dunstable down rotary club be pay for tree to be plant at chute wood on dunstable down will the minister commend this action and commend other organisation to do likewise give the crucial importance of tree plant in combat climate change 
 that be worth the wait i will absolutely commend dunstable down rotary club and the work that this government be undertake because tree be essential they be the larder and the shelter for our wildlife they be vital for our ecosystem they protect we from flooding prevent we from overheat and be at the forefront of this government ’s plan for the environment that be why we be roll out local nature recovery strategy to support more good volunteering in our local authority 
 will the minister give an update on work that be take place to alleviate the impact of avian influenza 
 work be ongoing on avian influenza the hon gentleman will be aware that we have suffer year of catastrophic effect of that disease animal and plant health agency vet be work round the clock with primary producer to protect their flock i do not want to jinx myself but at the moment we be make good progress we will continue to work hard with the sector to protect it and ourselves from that terrible disease 
 as the secretary of state know my constituency be chalk stream central with the headwater of the celebrated river test the bourne rivulet and the river anton which run through andover what can the government tell i to reassure my constituent that the unique ecology of chalk stream be uppermost in their mind as they work to enhance our river across the country 
 as my right hon friend know i know that area well i use to live in whitchurch which have the river test flow through it we be make progress with our chalk stream action plan but he will also be aware of the amendment that the government agree to work with viscount trenchard on and which be now part of the levelling up and regeneration bill which i hope will become an act very soon 
 some of the fine seed potato be grow in the north of scotland right now the seed potato farmer be worried sick because a lot of their crop be below water that also pose a question mark over the supply of seed for next year i know that this matter be devolve but as the minister be a farmer will he put the maximum encouragement in the direction of the scottish government to please help the farmer 
 the hon gentleman have do that with his question i do not diminish the effect that the rain be have on the seed potato crop once seed potato be under water for more than a week it will probably be destroy scottish seed potato be some of the fine   seed produce anywhere in the world and i encourage he to seek contact with the scottish government to get they to help 
 kirklees council be look to invest in its food waste recycling strategy in line with the environment act but it be still wait for full clarification and detail that support that legislation will the minister advise as to when that will be send to council 
 that clarification will be come very soon and within it the new simple recycling approach will include mandatory collection of food waste 
 publicly own scottish water have invest £ since in improvement and commit another half a pound between and that be why scottish water have have its product the water around scotland classify as be in good ecological condition why do english bill payer pay the most and get the manky water 
 the hon gentleman be wrong about that there be a lot of chatter about water we should never undermine the cleanliness of the drinking water that people enjoy the interministerial group be work on different way of measure ecological status across the united kingdom and we be look to see what we might do about that we make the change in which other part of the united kingdom do not and we continue to work together as responsible government i remind the hon gentleman only of storm overflow in scotland be monitor they would be well off get on with that 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of the crown prosecution service ’s write response to complaint 
 although progress have be make the cps acknowledge that there be more to do to ensure that every complaint get a high quality response in a timely manner i will be discuss this very issue with the director of public prosecutions at our next meeting 
 i be sure the solicitor general will be aware that the cps inspectorate recently conduct an investigation into the response to complaint from victim of crime it find that almost half be below standard and only a be adequate do victim of crime not deserve well 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her serious and important question it be of the utmost importance that victim be well support by all part of the justice system improvement need to be make it might be worth point out that in the inspectorate ’s report the complainant be look at from victim defendant witness the police and other there be clearly some way to go but the cps have accept each and every of the recommendation 
 what recent step she have take to establish international accountability for russia ’s action against ukraine and if she will make a statement 
 what recent step she have take to establish international accountability for russia ’s action against ukraine

 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the crown prosecution service in ensure access to justice for victim of crime 
 the government be commit to ensure that victim be treat fairly and compassionately we know that join up work across the criminal justice system work and we know that support victim make a real difference that be why we be spend time as much on victim support as be the case in 
 there be victim of crime in our country who have have to wait year for their case to come to court who have bravely give testimony to ensure that the criminal who rob or attack they be convict and who this week will have to watch those criminal be bail rather than jail because the prison be too full to pass sentence against they what message would the attorney general like to send to those victim 
 the message that i want to send to victim today be that they be very important to this government we want they to come forward and we want to investigate and prosecute the crime of which they be the victim as well and as expeditiously as we can i listen to what the lord chancellor have to say on monday and i be impressed that he be put those prison place in the right part of the system focus on those serve time for long more violent and more worrying offence with those at the other end of the prison system those on that revolving wheel of go in and out of prison be treat in a different way we want and he want it be clear to i that he feel this very strongly to reduce crime and he be make sure that the whole of the criminal justice system and the prison system work to achieve that aim 
 shockingly accord to the late figure more than crown court case have be wait more than year to be hear that be up more than third on last year alone what do the attorney general have to say to the victim who to their despair have find that their life have be put on hold while they be wait for justice and what do she say to those who can no long cope with any more delay even if that mean have to let their case collapse 
 i be happy to say that the hon gentleman and i share a local crown prosecution area in thames and chiltern where the local victim attrition rate be well below the national average it be run at about any attrition be too high and we want to make sure that we support victim to enable they to continue to bring their case that be why we have put in place about independent sexual violence adviser to help those victim feel supported and able to go to trial 
 a couple of week ago we have a series of very distressing break in to small owner manager business in leighton buzzard high street i know that the owner and bedfordshire police be disappoint in the response of the cps would it be possible to get the cps together with those business owner to try to improve thing in the future 
 i be sorry to hear about those distressing case of course either the solicitor general or i would be delighted to meet our hon friend to discuss this far 
 i call the shadow attorney general 
 last month i have the pleasure of host the brilliant women ’s budget group in parliament for the launch of its report on gender gap in access to civil justice across the board from employment and benefit to domestic violence and housing the report find too many woman reach crisis point before they get the help that they need as well as increase number get no help at all and have to represent themselves in court will the attorney general raise those finding with the justice secretary and look at how the government can address the disproportionate impact on woman of our country ’s legal aid desert 
 the right hon lady make an important point i read with interest some of the work that she have be do with other for whom i have enormous respect in this important area i know that she be very capable of raise those matter herself with the justice secretary but i reassure she that the access of everybody to justice be very much at the top of my agenda and his 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 we be committed to tackle violence against woman and girl and have introduce new specific offence to target those crime we be steadily increase the number of rape prosecution we be work on new way to recognise the relationship between rape domestic abuse and stalking close work across the system be the key to effective prosecution 
 at labour ’s recent conference in liverpool my right hon friend the shadow attorney general highlight the shocking statistic that it be time more likely for a woman to be a victim of stalk in this country than it be for her stalker to go to jail do the attorney general agree that it be time that we start treat stalk with the seriousness that it deserve include give victim of online stalk a right to know the identity of their stalker 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that important issue and i reassure he that the government be absolutely committed to help stalk victim to bring their case to prosecution the lord chancellor have make that something of a mission during his time in the house i remember my many year with he on the justice committee when he talk of little else we be work in the cps on new way of ensure that the complicated relationship between rape domestic abuse and stalking be properly consider across the system 
 prosecution rate for violence against woman and girl remain low and that simply be not good enough next month we will mark white ribbon day when man show their commitment to end violence against woman and girl what discussion have the attorney general have with colleague across government about white ribbon day and what more can be do to increase prosecution rate and eradicate violence against woman and girl once and for all 
 a great deal of work be go on across government to tackle violence against woman and girl and i be pleased to tell the hon lady that a great deal of really good work be happen in her area in wales when i visit the cardiff office early this summer we have some very productive discussion about the implementation of the new cps charge model i encourage she to meet jenny hopkins who be the chief crown prosecutor for her specific area to hear more about how that hard work have bring some really positive result 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 just before the recess the then director of public prosecutions give evidence to the justice committee and highlight the specific area of work be do to improve the victim experience in relation to rape and serious sexual offence while there be more to do would the attorney general accept that there have be real progress from the position even say year ago what be the late position in relation to the key target that be set from the end to end rape review 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for remind i that i should pay tribute to the outgoing dpp max hill for his year of excellent work on our behalf prosecute crime i be sure that all of we across the house would like to wish he well in the next stage of his career 
 on my hon friend ’s specific question the rape review set challenging target we have work very hard across government the home office ag and the ministry of justice on of those target in particular and we be exceed they considerably we be in a much well place many more case of rape be be prosecute and rapist be be convict we need to continue to build on that progress we will not rest on our laurel but there have be real improvement if anybody be a victim of rape i encourage they to come forward we will support they and we will prosecute 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for justice on the contribution of solicitor to civil society 
 as my right hon friend the lord chancellor agree solicitor and indeed all legal professional play a vital role in uphold the rule of law as solicitor general i take this opportunity to thank government legal service lawyer for their exceptional work every day often under pressure on some of the most high profile case in the country 
 that be all very well but the justice minister denounce lawyer for parade their politic while the home secretary believe that there be a racket of lefty lawyer undermine the law do the attorney general not agree that instead of deflect blame from the serial ineptitude of a break home office decimate by her colleague she should stand up for the profession as impartial arbiter of the rule of law 
 the attorney general and i often meet legal leader across the profession both to celebrate their achievement and to hear their concern it be right to say that lawyer act in the good interest of their client should never be criticise for so do but it be also right to say as the lord chancellor have also say that it be the strong tradition of lawyer in this country that they simply act for their client without fear or favour and do not necessarily associate themselves with the cause i agree with the lord chancellor 
 what assessment have the solicitor general make of the strength of the legal profession in rural area 
 mr speaker you have hear about the law tour that the attorney general and i recently enter into we meet some lawyer in welshpool and hear from high street solicitor about the importance of their practice not only in wales but on the welsh border my hon friend should look out for more detail about the law tour 
 what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the appointment of the new director of the serious fraud office 
 the attorney general and i meet the new director nick ephgrave yesterday and discuss the sfo ’s priority include continue to deliver its day to day mission and drive forward last improvement to its operation 
 i have be contact by constituent who have be victim of financial scam carry out by large organise criminal gang which often target the more vulnerable in our community what step be the solicitor general take to end the scourge of these fraud and scam and will it be a priority for the new director of the sfo 
 i can tell my hon friend that the sfo announce a criminal investigation just last week into a suspect fraud at safe hands plans a funeral plan provider with plan holder before its collapse last year my hon friend have raise this very point during an early debate and i be grateful to he for that i be sure that he will agree that the announcement of the sfo ’s investigation be a significant and welcome step 
 will the new head of the sfo take the job very seriously and look again at some of the big fraudster and at the penalty will the solicitor general ask the new director why bernie ecclestone do not go to prison for massive fraud against the tax system 
 the hon gentleman give i the opportunity to pay tribute to the new director he be the right candidate for the job he bring a wealth of experience he will listen to what the hon gentleman say and to what we all say in this chamber he have    expertise in lead large complex and multidisciplinary law enforcement organisation and we look forward to support he in his work 
 his majesty ’s crown prosecution service inspectorate inspect not only the cps but the sfo so it be remiss of i early not to pay tribute to the inspectorate and to the chief inspector for his work 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i join the solicitor general in welcome nick ephgrave as he take on of the most difficult job in law enforcement his arrival in post be announce by the sfo abandon the long run and expensive prosecution of rio tinto eurasian natural resources and the alpha and green park group that follow a chain of fail case from g4s and serco to unaoil with permanent staff vacancy of around and a case load that have fall by half in recent year why should the new director think that this lame duck government will make the sfo a hawk in the world of financial crime 
 i will ignore the snide comment at the end but i will address the substance of the hon gentleman ’s question which he be right to ask it be also right to say that it be always disappointing when case be closed but criminal investigation that no long meet the public interest test as he well know simply can not continue that be the code that crown prosecutor take and he will understand why that be the case it be right to trumpet the sfo ’s achievement it be also right to challenge it i know that staff recruitment and retention will be of the priority for the new director 
 on a point of order mr speaker during question time the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs say that air quality in our country be improve there be no evidence for that statement and although i do not believe that she mean to she mislead the house 
 if there be no evidence we will never know whether she do or do not

 may i take a moment to remember our former colleague sir david amess who be brutally murder year ago while carry out his duty his memory and legacy still shine brightly 
 as we continue to witness the horror of the event unfold in israel and gaza and the emotion that they raise here at home hate crime awareness week be a timely reminder that we stand united against hate the whole house speak with voice against antisemitism and islamophobia as member we know that event in the middle east be directly and indirectly impact on our constituent we stand in solidarity 
 we condemn unequivocally the heartless terrorist action of hamas israel have the right to defend itself rescue hostage and protect its border international law must be uphold at all time the life of innocent civilian must be safeguard and every possible assistance must be make available to those who need help there must be immediate humanitarian access to gaza for aid food water medicine fuel and electricity we welcome development today but it be urgent and it need to be sustain hamas be not the palestinian people and the palestinian people be not hamas we will continue to be strong advocate for justice human right and international law and to keep alive the   prospect of peace base on a state solution will the prime minister update the house follow his visit this week 
 i be afraid that i return again to a run theme the disrespect and disregard that the government have for parliament mr speaker i know that we be both appal that the prime minister choose the very day of recess to announce a major shift in government net policy from downing street while the leader of the house sit in the front row and cheer it be no wonder he be duck parliamentary scrutiny with his fiction of bin and meat taxis and his substance be meet with alarm by industry and investor 
 it be not a off but a pattern no matter how many time you pull they up on it mr speaker again this week the justice secretary announce to the press that he be abolish short prison sentence something the ministerial code forbid and of course we have have the great northern train robbery deny for week and finally announce at conservative party conference despite mp have spend hour of legislative time on high speed bills we have have no say on it only this prime minister could cancel major rail infrastructure to manchester while in manchester 
 this shoddy back of the fag packet new transport plan affect many constituency have not withstand exposure to reality most of the new scheme be already announce previously cancel or complete year ago other be simply illustrative euston station remain a pipe dream and network north now reach cornwall it turn out that spreadsheet guy can not even read a spreadsheet it be not so much a relaunch as a crash landing in a private jet of course 
 the contempt that this government have for parliament be a disgrace and we have a leader of the house who clap along parliament need answer what will now happen to the hs2 hybrid bill which be necessary to deliver the central section of northern powerhouse rail and safeguard the land for it when and how be the decision to scrap it make the secretary of state for transport be under the illusion that he make it the day before pull the other one!—yet the video share from their party conference be clearly make day early in downing street when be this take and should a party conference video be make in downing street at all 
 there be another pattern here conservative hq have release video of conservative members and a cabinet minister announce government project can the leader of the house assure we that conservative members be not be give advance notice of government announcement and if they be will she confirm that this breach the ministerial code 
 finally i want to congratulate the leader of the house on achieve meme status for her conference speech it be how can i put this?—a call to arm to stand up and fight well it certainly involve lot of arm anyway so why do she not stand up and fight for parliament stand up and fight for member to hear government policy or for colleague not to be hoodwink when big decision be take why do she not stand up and fight for trust to be restore in politic the truth be that she be more interested in stand up and fight for her own leadership ambition as a fan of boat she should know that a new captain be not save this sink ship it be time for they all to get off 
 i thank the hon lady and join she in remember our late colleague sir david amess his legacy live on not just in city status for southend the many charity and project that he foster be go from strength to strength and they be a daily reminder of the work he do and the effect and impact he have 
 i add my voice to those of many in this chamber who have express their horror sadness and sympathy with all those catch up in the situation in israel and gaza my thought be particularly with those who have lose love one in the most barbaric terrorist attack and with those take hostage and their family who await news of they at time like these we in this place may feel that we can not directly help but we all can we can all make judgment base on fact promote those fact and debunk deliberate disinformation campaign keep informed and wide eyed about the reality of the situation and reassure community here in the uk 
 on behalf of all colleague i thank the armed force the royal fleet auxiliary our diplomat and humanitarian expert and the police for all that they be do to protect and secure people ’s safety in the middle east and at home i join the hon lady in say that all of we in this place be unite against hate she will know that the prime minister and foreign secretary be currently in the region and i be sure that they will want to update the house i be sure that many colleague will want up to date information particularly about some of the situation that have happen in gaza and the fact behind those situation as such i can also tell the hon lady that my office have be in touch with the house of commons library to ensure that what information be available be give in a timely way to member of the house 
 the hon lady criticise i very robustly about my role as this house ’s representative in government i hope to be able to reassure the house of my record on that front i hope that mr speaker would support i in say that i have always follow up any criticism that this house have make of any government department more i think than anyone else who have hold the role my noble friend lord true and i have also introduce training programme for government departments to ensure that they know what their obligation to this house be her complaint against i might have have more effect have the letter she write to i complain about this issue not be receive by myself only after it have be brief to the daily mirror which be where i find out about it 
 i do cheer our announcement on net unlike the labour party whose path to net would include immense burden on work people we have choose a different path to alleviate that burden the hon lady invite i to contrast our party record on infrastructure and particularly rail i remind she that in the year we have be in power we have electrify mile of track in the same time period labour manage just mile i be not go to apologise for stand up and fight for this country even prior to take this role i think my record have be of stand up and fight for this house hon member will know that in the year of the pandemic i spend every single day on the phone to all member of this house in my role as paymaster general update they on what be happen i take my responsibility to this house very seriously indeed 
 i will always stand up and fight for this house and for my country i will not be lie down with just stop oil and damage our energy security i will not be potentially lie down with the liberal democrats i note the hon lady ’s encourage word about proportional representation i will not be lie down with the snp which   the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock   will be pleased to hear and contemplate assist that party on a referendum those be the fact and i can understand why labour do not like they that be perhaps why it have choose to ban some news programming available on freeview to anyone operate in the senedd 
 further business may be announce in the usual way or by his majesty the king on   november 
 i associate myself with the word about our late colleague sir david amess i be privileged to serve with he on the all party parliamentary group on the holy see of which he be a dedicated chairman 
 in consider future business may i draw the leader of the house ’s attention to the collapse of a company in my constituency initiative property management which manage a large number of residential block in my constituency and more widely since the collapse many resident have see building work on their block cease and have be unable to access ten of thousand of pound of their own money in management fee while the matter be now be investigate by dorset police and i do not invite my right hon friend to comment on that may i suggest that there may be a regulatory gap here it appear that management company of this style do not fall under the regulatory framework of the financial conduct authority i invite the leader of the house to make government colleague aware of the fact and perhaps ask they to take a look at it 
 i thank my right hon friend for all the work he be do at what must be a very worrying time for his constituent who be affect he will know that the government be currently consider the recommendation in the final report from my noble friend lord best ’s work group on the regulation of property agent of course the financial conduct authority currently have a limited role and although we be not seek to expand its role we want to ensure that it can be a more innovative assertive and adaptive regulator 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i associate myself with all the remark about sir david 
 the leader of the house have previously comment on how much she enjoy our exchange at business question as do i. it be the weekly forum where i challenge she on our deep and profound difference in policy and priority and there will be plenty of opportunity in the next few week and month to tackle she on her government ’s shortcoming however today like so many people my thought be with the civilian population in gaza and israel people across all nation of the uk share this house ’s revulsion and fear of what we see unfold revulsion at the barbarism of hamas and fear of what the future hold for innocent child woman and man in both gaza and israel a huge   number of mp have constituent who be worried sick about friend or relative who be catch up in these event and of course community across the uk will be anxious about what we be witness and its potential impact as the house will know scotland ’s minister humza yousaf and his wife and family be directly affect in the most terrible way and my thought be also with they today 
 the uk government have several role to fulfil in this crisis and there be an urgent need for action as we all know in the instance they must direct their effort to the enormous humanitarian aid need in southern gaza medical supply water food basic power truck be a start but there be apparently stand by and they must get through however they need to travel safely through so call for an immediate ceasefire to facilitate the provision of aid in gaza and to give evacuee a safe passage out be vital as be the release of all the hostage ’s heart break to think of they and the use of every possible diplomatic effort to stop an escalation into a wide regional conflict the government should join minister humza yousaf in call for a worldwide refugee scheme similar to that establish for syrian afghan and ukrainian refugee in the long term they should use all their power to keep the state solution alive and keep a dialogue for peace open they must rise to many challenge and we wish the prime minister well in his endeavour today will the leader of the house confirm that he will deliver a statement about the outcome on his return 
 of course we will return to the business of scrutinise the government ’s action in the usual way when politic return to some sort of normality hopefully very soon 
 i thank the hon lady for dwell on that particular matter because i think that be the prime concern for all member of the house this weekend i join she as i be sure all colleague will want to in her sentiment about the plight of the minister ’s family and in wish that that have a good outcome 
 the hon lady will know that additional humanitarian support be be provide by the government to the region which be build on many year of provide support we be of the major contributor to the united nations relief and works agency and we have do a huge amount of work in lebanon to support the refugee programme there so we bring not just the financial offer but decade of expertise in work in the region and with our network of course we want hostility to end but i would just say to the hon lady that we be deal with a terrorist organisation and negotiate ceasefire with terrorist organisation be a very difficult thing to do 
 the hon lady be right to highlight the plight of hostage and way we can all help be by keep a focus on those individual and their family in the come day i hope not week and on their return this be another area where the uk have a lot of expertise to offer israel will not have have a lot of expertise in hostage negotiation not just the government but our non governmental organisation have huge experience of work with organisation such as the international committee of the red cross and interlocutor in try to get hostage extract i know that all we can do to help will be on offer she be also right to point to the fact that the barbaric terrorist attack that kick off this   chain of event be in part design to wreck any chance of peace in particular the progress that be be make between israel saudi arabia and other in normalising relation i thank she for the opportunity to send a message from all of we in this house that this be our focus and concern 
 an incredibly impressive stroud constituent call sally anne come to see i last week about the contaminate blood scandal her father be a haemophiliac and be sadly affect by what we now know be a national and international scandal family have spend decade seek answer and compensation sally anne have turn her pain and her worry for her father into action and she be do a phd to look at the wide impact on family and at the mcfarlane trust work i know that the leader of the house be incredibly respect on this issue and she have fight for victim of the infected blood scandal for many year will she clarify how i can well use time in this house to push those issue for the wide family affect and say whether a debate or other action will assist 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work she be do to support her constituent and to ensure that those affect and infect by that appalling scandal get justice swiftly if she secure a debate on this issue it would be most welcome and well attend by many across the house i have say this before but we should recognise that even though we be talk about a small number of individual as a percentage of the population this issue be relevant to everyone in this country what happen to those individual could have happen to anyone in this country and how we respond to that be important that be why i be pleased that this government have set up the inquiry why i set up a compensation study to run concurrently with the inquiry and why we must ensure that we press forward with get those people some recompense for all they have suffer 
 i call the chair of the backbench business committee 
 i be grateful mr speaker may i ask you and the leader of the house to help we by help to facilitate the re establishment of the backbench business committee as soon as possible after the king ’s speech in the new parliamentary session i will be write to the leader of the house with a list of as yet unaired debate from this session which might be hold prior to the re establishment of the committee in the new session we have application for debate in this chamber and in westminster hall on subject such as protection for child with allergy heritage pub float offshore wind generation knife crime and several other 
 i declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group on rail in the north yesterday i have a meeting with the rail industry association ’s northern section and we be reflect on what the chair of the national infrastructure commission say yesterday in urge the government not to sell off too quickly land acquisition for high speed on cancel northern route those land acquisition may well facilitate other scheme in the northern region and we hope that the government would not sell those asset off too quickly 
 finally as part of the crisis in israel palestine and gaza a number of family in my constituency have be affect prior to the horrific hamas attack be the jewish festival of sukkot a number of family from my orthodox haredi jewish community be in israel celebrate sukkot and then become strand and could not get home some have have to pay eye watering sum to travel home by alternative mean because lot of flight be cancel will the leader of the house help i and those who have have to pay out sometimes whole life saving to get their family of or back home from israel 
 i thank the hon gentleman for a helpful advert for future potential business for his committee we have have conversation about this matter before and i be keen to ensure that the committee be re establish quickly so that it can get on with its important work he raise an important point with which i agree that it be important that thing have a proper masterplan so i will write to make sure that the secretaries of state for transport and for levelling up housing and communities have hear what he have say today the hon gentleman will know that in case where people be unable to return because they can not afford to get out of a situation there be scheme in place run by the foreign office under which people may be loan finance many insurance product will not cover terrorist event so i will make sure that the relevant department have hear his concern on that front 
 my right hon friend the leader of the house will be aware that in lancashire we have secure £ at least for a brand new hospital to replace the much love but age royal preston which have cold dark corridor and a flat roof that can occasionally leak with a number of site in south ribble under consideration it be down to the wonderful lancashire teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust lancashire county council and local borough authority to get on with that site selection i hope like i that she would love to see they get on with that with chorley hospital ’s future secure as of only elective surgical hub in the country do my right hon friend agree that this government be commit to deliver a once in a generation investment in healthcare in south ribble can we have a debate in government time about the importance of these investment for local community 
 i congratulate my hon friend and thank she for all the work she have do to secure the £ worth of funding for her hospital and also for manage to secure of those critical elective hub that be an achievement of which she should be proud she be right that we be committed to the big programme in a generation of hospital building we be also prioritise the delivery of community diagnostic centre which be so important to ensure that people be get healthcare in a timely way i be sure if she want to apply for a debate on those topic it would be well attend 
 the warburton toll bridge be a vital route link greater manchester and cheshire across the manchester ship   canal a recent consultation of local community on a propose eightfold increase to the toll charge be meet with unanimous opposition include from partington and carrington in my constituency despite that the secretary of state for transport have approve the associated transport and work order can we have a debate in government time on the step that should be available to member to challenge such decision and importantly how we can strengthen the voice of local community such as partington and carrington to ensure they be hear fully in decision of this nature in the future 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this important matter he will know that i will not be able to comment on particular scheme but i will make sure that the secretary of state for transport have hear about that scheme it be important that local voice be listen to when such matter be put in place i question the relationship between the work order that the secretary of state have sign and the fee but i will certainly look into this matter for the hon gentleman if he would like to give i some further information i will be happy to write on his behalf 
 i wonder whether we could have a debate in government time about liberal democrat council something we could spend hour on the government have very kindly give mid devon £ for new housing and i be grateful to ministers for that but the problem be that it have be give to a council that be inept it have a development that be go wrong now the leader of the council who double up as a perfume pack guy call eau de toilette and be the member who deal with scrutiny be appalling can we please have time to discuss give money to council that be not able to spend it properly we need government control to ensure the money be spend wisely 
 i be sorry to hear of another ongoing concern for my hon friend ’s constituent it be important that when money be distribute it be give to body that will get on and do what be need sometimes local authority be not the good body to do that which be why when i be look after the coastal community fund i always keep open the option for local community group charity and organisation that would qualify to be monitor officer for such fund to administer they i shall ensure that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have hear his concern 
 will the leader of the house consider arrange for a statement or an early debate on the danger of gambling and the gambling industry ’s impact on child and young people there be increase evidence that these big gambling concern be use social medium to get child engage in gambling at an early age as well as many vulnerable people may we have a debate on the power and influence of this massive wealthy industry

 could we have a debate on medium reporting of the conflict between israel and hamas so that we can hold to account those medium outlet that choose to rush to blame israel for the hospital tragedy without a sound evidential basis accurate reporting be crucial fail to deliver that make the situation bad could cost life and could fuel hatred and antisemitism here in the uk 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise that important point there be issue be the ofcom code and certain broadcaster adherence to it the guidance for that code say 
 broadcaster should have regard to the list of proscribe terror group or organisation in the uk 
 which be incredibly important it be also critical that reporter sometimes station in very stressful environment report fact as fact and that those thing that be not fact thing that have not be verify or be line to take from terrorist organisation should not be treat as fact the bbc do focus on these thing to a very large degree but we know that sometimes it do not get thing right as we see recently with its code of conduct surround the gary lineker situation i be sure that it will want to kick the tyre on this and ensure that anyone listen to a bbc outlet be be give the good possible information

 many of my constituent have write to i in dismay about seasonal variation in train fare for example during recess great western be charge £ for a peak return from bath to london on   november for the same journey on   november the cost have shoot up to £ more than double may we have a statement from the rail minister on why such large variation in price be allow and what the government can do to make train price more transparent

 the grimsby telegraph be carry a report of a local man who for the last year have be collect fly tip rubbish from various site around the town after year he have now be tell that he need a licence to take the rubbish to the tip that be just example of so many petty regulation that discourage community minded people from assist in the local area could we have a debate so that member from across the house can identify those petty regulation and sweep they away 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point and for afford we the opportunity to thank his constituent who appear to be provide a much need community service that his local authority be not we want people who want to step up take responsibility and help their community to be able to do so he be right to call out ridiculous behaviour that prevent that from happen i be sure there be other example and if he be to have a debate we could expose some of they 
 could we please have a statement from the paymaster general in the light of sir brian langstaff move his final report on the infected blood inquiry to next march due to the number of individual and organisation that will be criticise in it and in the light of the fact that the government have rightly give £ in compensation to the victim of the horizon scandal without wait for the final report it would be very timely to have a report because we know that the government be work to the november deadline we keep be tell that work be at pace so it should be ready for next month in any event 
 i thank the right hon lady for raise this matter and for all her work through the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood which she have chair for many year it be not lose on anyone that those individual have wait far too long for redress in this appalling situation i know that the paymaster general feel that way too and i will ensure that he have hear her request for he to update the house 
 at its conference this weekend an snp mp say he be sick and tired of scottish conservatives speak in parliament about the a9 the leader of the house will know that that be a crucial road between perth and inverness and up to wick which the snp promise would be fully dualle that be not happen can we have a debate in this house to discuss that crucial infrastructure project perhaps   the hon member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart   will attend and stand up for his constituent rather than sit down and support the snp government ’s failure to dual that road and the a96 through my constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point i happen to see what i would describe as a spittle fleck monologue criticise member of the general public in scotland for dare to voice their disappointment at the quality of the a9 and other road infrastructure my advice to   the hon member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart   be that if he do not want the public to continually complain about thing he might dual those road as that project have be long overdue the public should have decent road for the taxis they pay 
 order i presume that the hon gentleman inform   the hon member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart   of his question 
 yes i do madam deputy speaker and he respond to thank i 
 it be useful for i to know that you have do that 
 when a government announce that they have identify a problem face the public and simultaneously announce that they have identify the only possible solution i be always a little sceptical year ago the labour government announce that diesel vehicle be good for the environment today as we know they be vilify and effectively be tax off the road we be now tell that electric vehicle be our only salvation despite grow concern about their safety and real question about the true environmental cost of manufacturing and dispose of their lithium battery may we have a debate on the cost and benefit of electric vehicle 
 the hon gentleman will know how to apply for a debate in the usual way he have recently apply for debate and i think he have a debate on another topic later this week the house be always happy to facilitate that he be absolutely right we want to ensure that information be take from a wide range of source historically there have be scandal we have the eu emission scandal relate to diesel vehicle it be very important that information be out there and people can scrutinise it i encourage all member to make use of the house of commons library which be a tremendous repository of information but also to take their information from a wide variety of source 
 it be understandable that after suffer the bad terrorist atrocity in its history and the large loss of jewish life since the holocaust the state of israel will now seek to eliminate the threat of hamas and all the other terrorist organisation mr speaker enable a statement on monday and then an urgent question rather than a statement would it not be well for the house to have a debate in government time and on a government motion so that it can express its support for the state of israel and we can come to a ready conclusion to send a strong signal do the leader of the house agree that there can be no equivalence between the hamas terrorist who kill maim and torture civilian and try to eliminate as many jews as they possibly can and the israel defence forces which seek to target terrorist and minimise civilian casualty
