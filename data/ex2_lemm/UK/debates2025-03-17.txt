support young carer be a key priority for this government my hon friend be a real champion on these issue and i be very happy to work with he to ensure that the view of young carer be hear in this place 
 the government have table amendment to the information sharing and consistent identifi duty in clause the wide picture be that child be too often fail by inadequate or patchy information sharing which be not good enough the bill enable we to make the change that child need and the amendment will ensure that we get that right from the outset 
 these amendment will ensure that where those in scope engage other to provide service relate to safeguard or promote the welfare of child such as primary care provider the duty will also extend to the provider of those service this be not intend to cover provider engage by those in scope for other purpose that may incidentally engage with the relevant function for example it service provider or interpreter but do not independently hold information that be not already available to the agency in scope this will be clarify in statutory guidance 
 the government have also table amendment to clause and to ensure that the bill ’s information share power and duty contain standard provision where appropriate these amendment be require to make it clear that datum protection legislation will and must be comply with to ensure that appropriate restriction on the sharing of datum such as a duty of confidence do not prevent the sharing of datum and to ensure draft consistency across the bill 
 the government have also table amendment that allow information about a provider ’s financial risk to be share between the department for education and the care quality commission after year of inaction fail outcome and soar cost it be long past time for the government to make these change to secure both high capacity and more resilience among provider again the amendment before we today will make sure we get those change right there be provider that operate both adult and child ’s social care service some of these be very large and may therefore be subject to both our new child ’s social care financial oversight scheme and the care quality commission ’s market oversight scheme which have be operate for many year in the adult social care market 
 these amendment allow information to be share between the department for education and the care quality commission about a provider 's financial risk particularly in advance of either oversight scheme issue advance warn to local authority this will help the department to form an accurate real time assessment of financial risk 
 the government have also table amendment that will apply the relevant clause to wales follow the welsh government ’s agreement to their application   member of this house especially those represent welsh constituency will already know the difference it make to have labour government in both london and cardiff not only put our child but work together constructively and at pace to deliver the change that child in every part of the united kingdom deserve i pay tribute to lynne neagle ms the cabinet secretary for education in the welsh government for her help in ensure that child in wales as well as in england will benefit from the new protection in this bill 
 the group of amendment in this area will extend the application of the ill treatment and wilful neglect offence in the criminal justice and courts act to child age and in regulated establishment in wales as well as in england the current gap in the legal framework mean it be not possible to prosecute individual for low level abuse of and year old in regulated child ’s social care establishment or youth detention accommodation the current offence in section and apply to both england and wales and an amendment seek to maintain that application in relation to the amend offence 
 secondly an amendment will extend the application of deprivation of liberty order to wales enable welsh local authority to seek authorisation to deprive child of liberty in relevant accommodation in england we recognise the importance of keep child close to home within their safe and loving community where this be possible and in the good interest of the child however in some circumstance where it keep a child safe from harm a cross border placement be the right option 
 this amendment will ensure that where a cross border placement that deprive liberty be in the good interest of the child the child can either be place by welsh local authority in a secure child ’s home as at present or be deprive of their liberty in relevant accommodation in england that may well suit their need in both case the legislative consent motion process be engage as the measure apply to wales and fall within the legislative competence of the senedd cymru we be work closely with the welsh government on this we continue to have conservation with the scottish government on extend the measure to local authority in scotland 
 to conclude the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill be a landmark piece of legislation through which we be deliver the big overhaul to child ’s social care in a generation our action will transform child ’s life keep child safe and ensure opportunity and well life chance for all child i be grateful to all right hon and hon member who have make effort to improve the bill for their scrutiny and for the debate so far 
 i would also like to extend my thank to all the individual and organisation who contribute to the development of the bill and submit evidence include the witness at the bill committee ’s oral evidence session we will continue to work closely with those organisation throughout the passage of the bill i look forward to hear further contribution and debate from member this afternoon on the bill as we continue to work across the house and beyond to break down the barrier to opportunity and give every child the good start in life 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of recent trend in level of disability living allowance case that have be incorrectly reduce to a low rate without an explanation 
 there should be no benefit decision without explanation claim decision should always be set out with the reason if a decision be unclear or if the reason for it be unclear a far detailed verbal or write explanation can be request and will be provide 
 will the minister please outline how this government will support young disabled people to have a positive engagement with the benefit system alongside work 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to press for improvement we want to change how we think about jobcentre and the benefit system our youth work coach talk a lot to disabled young people and be very keen to help more our reform be make that possible by give well help and support and by open up new opportunity for disabled young people up and down the country 
 my staff member alongside i do benefit application appeal and tribunal at least day a week she overturn of application in favour of the applicant which tell i that there be something wrong with the system i be worried sick for my constituent who suffer from mental and physical issue because of our year conflict there must be a system that protect my constituent and the people we all represent 
 again the hon gentleman be right to call for improvement we want to see improvement in assessment and he be probably well aware that we will shortly be publish a green paper with proposal for reform to the health and disability benefit system we will have something to say about this in that document 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in the portsmouth north constituency 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in the cramlington and killingworth constituency 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in milton keynes 
 what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in derby 
 with your permission mr speaker i want to begin by say that there have understandably be a lot of speculation about the government ’s social security reform i assure the house and most importantly the public that we will be come forward with our proposal imminently to ensure that there be trust and fairness in the social security system and that it be there for people who need it now and in the year to come 
 almost young people be not in education employment or training that be terrible for their living standard their future job prospect and their health that be why our new youth guarantee will ensure that every young person be earn or learn our trailblazer back by £ of additional funding will lead the way and will start in area next month 
 each of those people be a real person and i be contact by a young man in my constituency who study an early year education t level and want to enter a desperately understaffed profession but have be struggle ever since to access a starter job be out of work while young can have a scar effect that impact people ’s job prospect for a lifetime will the secretary of state work to identify people at risk of become neet and ensure that my constituent be support to find meaningful work 
 i thank my hon friend for her question her constituent deserve to fulfil his potential and live his hope and dream like everybody else we will be work hard with the department for education to identify those young people who be at risk of become neet to ensure that we put in place the skill train they need to get the job of the future and fulfil their potential as they deserve 
 i suspect there might be quite a spike in the number of geordies not in work today give the cup final at the weekend 
 i recently visit azure a charity in my constituency that provide learning and work opportunity especially for young people with learn disability and hear about the incredible work it do to provide young people with hand on experience in a hospitality base learning environment will the secretary of state detail what more the government can do to support charity such as azure to provide these vital opportunity 
 i congratulate azure on its brilliant work i believe that charity and voluntary organisation have an essential role in get people on the pathway to work and success i know from the support internship programme that have be run in my constituency include through my local hospital that young people with learn difficulty can with the right support get those job and get that work that be what this government want to deliver 
 i be increasingly concern by the rise number of young people in milton keynes who be out of work due to mental health issue which i think be a key factor behind the nearly increase in young people claim unemployment benefit in milton keynes   since can the secretary of state outline what step the government be take to ensure that these young people have the support and opportunity they need to continue to improve their health secure stable employment and live independently with well living standard 
 i share my hon friend ’s concern about the number of young people not in work due to mental health condition which have increase by over in the last year alone the number of young people who be economically inactive due to poor mental health now stand at that be why we be focus on early intervention provide mental health support in every school and recruit an extra more mental health staff and from april we will be launch our youth guarantee and trailblazer to ensure that every young person be earn or learn 
 the derby promise recognise that child and young people be the future of derby by bring together business and organisation across our great city to give child meaningful aspirational experience whether at iconic factory or cultural or sport venue we know however that child already face limit on their future career aspiration by the age of will the minister outline what work her department be undertake to support child in derby and across the uk from an early age to raise their future career aspiration will she also agree to visit derby to see the derby promise in action 
 i or of my team will definitely visit the derby promise i share my hon friend ’s concern that young people be rule out future career at a young age i meet with the careers and enterprise company on friday and they tell i that child be rule out career by their gender at age and by their class by age for the labour party that be not good enough i hope the derby promise will be involve in the youth guarantee in the east midland lead by the mayor claire ward because we have to unlock the potential of every young person if they and this country be to succeed 
 like young people in portsmouth north in cramlington and killingworth and in derby south young people in glastonbury and somerton face barrier to their employment education and training due to poor public transport infrastructure research have show however that a improvement in public transport time could support a reduction in employment deprivation what step be the minister taking alongside cabinet colleague to remove barrier to employment education and training in rural area 
 the hon lady make a really important point and it be that mayor and local leader raise with we regularly as well as family who be struggle and child and young people in poverty that be why we believe it be so important to put mayor and local leader in the drive seat of change so that they can link up transport skill and job opportunity as part of our plan my hon friend the minister for employment and i have be work closely with local leader to ensure that happen because if people have to get work the transport must be in place 
 the minister for social security and disability be kind enough to come to the launch of the what come after education report by national star and the together trust key finding of that report be that young people with disability face particular problem when try to access work the system be set up against they and workplace be set up not to work for they yet many of they want to do whatever they can to find meaningful employment when minister be make decision about upcoming welfare change i hope that report will be on their desk and that it will be properly consider 
 absolutely and the hon gentleman will indeed be hear more about our plan which will include proper employment support to help people on a pathway to success we also have our keep britain working review lead by the former boss of john lewis charlie mayfield which be look precisely at what more employer can do with support from government to create healthy more inclusive workplace and to guarantee that disabled people who can work have the same right and choice to work as everybody else 
 much like the constituency that have be mention my young people in chichester be struggle to find work and that be no more apparent than for those with learn difficulty so will the secretary of state join i in congratulate together our community or toc which provide work experience for young people with learn disability age to to show that they do have something to offer the workforce toc be about to open its own café and centre for these young people will the secretary of state outline what support be available for such charity and join i at its opening next month 
 i join the hon lady in congratulate toc it sound like it be do fantastic work on friday i be talk to the headteacher of a special need school near my constituency who be say we absolutely have to ensure that work experience career advice and work with voluntary group be all part of the package of support we put in place if possible i or of my colleague will certainly come and see the work that toc be do because charity and voluntary group be absolutely critical to this government ’s plan 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 back in the autumn the right hon lady say 
 we will not allow young people not to be in education employment or training 
 how be it possible then that since labour have be in office there be more young people in exactly that situation 
 the hon lady have year to solve the problem and the conservatives record be clear nearly young people not in education employment or training which be in of all our young people and the number of young people with mental health concern who be out of work have now reach that be the legacy of year of conservative government and it be a legacy that this government be determined to change 
 i ask about what have happen since the right hon lady ’s party have be in government it be her chancellor ’s tax on job and economic mismanagement that be cost young people opportunity instead of tax job labour should have be ready with a plan for welfare reform at the time of the budget they have spend month try to cobble together and still we wait why do the right hon lady not make any plan in opposition and do she regret that 
 conservative members have no plan even their own former chancellor admit that the number be make up the only thing they put forward be proposal on the work capability assessment which have recently be rule illegal by the court they have no plan but they have a clear record leave people behind write they off and put they on the scrapheap this labour government will turn that around and get people and our country on the pathway to success 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential merit of remove the child benefit cap 
 the child benefit cap be introduce by the conservative party year ago its period in office see child poverty rise to over and in of our child arrive at primary school not ready to learn as soon as the secretary of state and i be appoint we get to work to establish our child poverty taskforce as promise in labour ’s manifesto and those effort be ongoing 
 a bmj study find that people in food poverty have diet with bad health outcome include more fat sugar and salt so what conversation have the minister have with the health secretary about how lift the child benefit cap could improve diet and reduce cost for the nhs 
 the health secretary and i talk about child poverty many time as we sit on the opposition benches watch the situation for our kid get bad and bad every year the member make a very serious and important point about the wide range consequence of poverty and if i may i would encourage he to submit the evidence he mention to the child poverty taskforce so that we can take full account of it 
 in child in my constituency live in poverty there be a lot of speculation swirl around the excellent child poverty taskforce which i applaud the government for establish include that the cap could be lift for under five which would affect few than household compare with the household which currently be affect by the child benefit cap can the minister reassure the house and the country that the child poverty taskforce be look to support all child in poverty whatever decision it come up with and not just a small segment of they 
 yes i can all child matter we be take account of a considerable range of different policy option carefully work through the impact that they would have but all the child in this country matter 
 whether she have have discussion with the secretary of state for business and trade on the potential impact of the employment rights bill on employment rate 
 i meet regularly with business and trade ministers we be commit to work with business to ensure that policy be pro employer and pro worker boost wage will increase workforce participation help employer fill vacancy and support we to reach our ambition of employment 
 with many labour members claim that they care about young people be employ have the minister ’s department make assessment about the employment impact of the decision to introduce minimum guarantee hour for student and young people who rely on the flexibility of be able to pick and choose their work hour particularly those who be work in the hospitality sector which be be decimate by this government 
 i think the hon gentleman be refer to the ban on exploitative hour contract but if somebody want a flexible hour contract then that be a good thing and nothing in the change prevent that in fact since i have be at the dwp i have find that employer have not have sufficient contact from jobcentre and only in employer think about use they when get young people a proper range of choice and job through the jobcentre not nearly enough work have be do to serve employer well that be what a real growth agenda look like from dwp 
 lá fhéile pádraig sona duit a happy st patrick ’s day to you mr speaker and all your team 
 the disability employment gap stand at and countless disabled worker end up out of work because their employer refuse to make simple change that would help they to do their job do the minister agree that the default right to flexible working in labour ’s employment rights bill will help many disabled worker to keep the job they love what else can the minister ’s department do to help more disabled people to find and keep work 
 may i say how great it be to hear the beautiful language of irish speak in this chamber 
 with the increase in condition that can be variable over time the flexible working right will help people the minister for social security and disability and i be work closely with disabled people ’s organisation charity and other to think about how we can build those pathway into work as we change jobcentre and improve employment support ensure that raise disability employment rate be at the heart of those change 
 what step she plan to take to ensure that disabled people be adequately financially support in her plan reform to benefit entitlement 
 what step she be take through the benefit system to support disabled people 
 we will be reform the current break system of health and disability benefit we will bring forward a green paper with proper plan very soon set out how we will help disabled people who can work to do so while fully support the most severely disabled as well 
 work be good for we it be good for our physical and mental health and for our general wellbeing when someone can work it be essential that they be give all the support to do so that say it be also imperative that those who be sick vulnerable or disabled be always protect do the minister agree that strike the balance between support those who can work and protect those who can not work must be central to any welfare reform 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that balance will be at the heart of the green paper that we be bring forward we will deliver proper employment support for disabled people which have be take away since we will deal with the incentive to inactivity that the current system present of course there will always be people who be unable to work through disability or ill health and we be committed to fully support they too 
 my constituent in eastleigh who support and help to care for disabled family member be desperately concerned about any potential cut to benefit include personal independent payment they include laura whose son be register blind and debbie who help to care for her disabled daughter and be herself disabled can the minister reassure my constituent that disability benefit for people who be unable to work will not be cut 
 i be concern about the level of anxiety and speculation that have be around over recent week i be sad that that have happen and that people have be concern but the current welfare system be fail the very people it be suppose to help the people it be there for our aim be to make the system sustainable so that it will be there for people now and in the future when the hon lady see the proposal i think she will see how we will deliver on that commitment 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 can my right hon friend confirm that there will be an analysis alongside the green paper on the impact it will have on poverty employment and health 
 i can confirm to my hon friend that we will produce a full impact assessment in due course 
 when i be a minister in the department for work and pensions work with my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   on reduce welfare dependency get more people into work each and every day and deliver record number of people into work the labour party oppose we every step of the way can i take it that the government ’s recent conversion to reduce the benefit bill be only about con the office for budget responsibility into think that they will balance the book after their disastrous budget rather than because they really believe in it 
 i remember extremely well when the right hon lady be a minister in the department it be very striking how the disability employment gap which have be fall up until suddenly stop fall and plateaue from that moment on we will deliver a decisive shift to early intervention help people to stay in work and renew fairness and trust in the system we will provide personalised support so that those who can work can get the job that they want 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of incentive to seek employment 
 the introduction of universal credit and the policy choice of the last conservative government seem to have have some effect on people ’s propensity to be in work in january the department for work and pensions publish datum show that of the increase in the incapacity benefit caseload since the universal credit roll out of the rise in claim could be explain by foreseeable demographic change and the effect of the structural alteration to the benefit that leave of the increase that we do not have datum to explain but the office for budget responsibility and other have draw attention to the structure of social security and the change over the past decade on publish the analysis i just mention i tell the house that the previous conservative government take decision on social security that 
 segregate people   away from work and forget about they ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 i stand by those comment 
 the people of spelthorne be very hard work and do not mind their taxis be pay for a safety net for the most vulnerable in our society but they really do get annoy when they see their taxis go to people who be scamme the benefit system what assessment have any of the ministers on the front bench make of so call sickfluencer site social medium platform where people be show how to game the benefit system have any of they look at those site be they a good or bad thing 
 the hon gentleman will know that the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill be go through the house at the moment the issue   that he have raise be at the forefront of the attention of the minister for transformation my hon friend   the member for stretford and urmston andrew western who will take every step he can to deal with issue in that area 
 on friday i visit stansted airport a huge employer for my constituency and find out about the important work it be do with the dwp and the jobcentre to get long term unemployed people back into work what work be the department do with organisation such as stansted airport to promote good practice such as that at stanste and working minds in my constituency 
 through my hon friend i give my thank to everybody at harlow jobcentre because it sound like they have their shoulder to the wheel in get job opportunity for people who need they when we arrive in the department we uncover that there be not nearly a good enough relationship between the department and employer that be why we put a new strategy in place to do the basic well there be a single point of contact and we be make sure that there be on the job training that be tailor to specific employer we will be do more to promote change in that area but i thank everyone in harlow for the effort they be make 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 there continue to be unacceptable delay in process access to work application both for my constituent in torbay and across the country this lead to fear among disabled people that job offer will be withdraw by their would be employer what reassurance can the minister give the chamber that the government have plan afoot to tackle that backlog 
 the hon member make an important point we have a manifesto commitment to try to tackle the backlog we have put more staff in place to deal with that backlog but we have more to do because it be important that disabled people be able to take up job that be offer to they we need to make sure that that be a scheme that work 
 what step her department be take to help increase uptake of pension credit 
 this government have be run the big ever pension credit take up campaign in the late stage we be now write to all pensioner who make a new housing benefit claim and who appear to be entitle to pension credit directly target they and encourage they to apply 
 the rate of take up for pension credit have traditionally be between and if that rate be uplifted it could take people out of income poverty in dorset the number of over-65s have increase by about over the past decade people say   that their big concern be the paperwork they have to complete the application contain up to question purely for pension credit and many pensioner would easily be able to claim for thing like the carer addition through a slight tweak in the paperwork what be the department do to simplify and combine those application to make life easy for pensioner 
 we be already do a lot to simplify the process it now take minute on average to complete an online form and of people apply online or over the phone however the hon lady be completely right to highlight the fact that we must do more include by simplify the form we continue to keep that under review and i be always interested in idea about how we can go far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when the government scrap universal entitlement to the winter fuel payment they say that all people eligible for it would get it through pension credit we now know that that do not happen they have get few than new pensioner enrol more than quarter of a of the poor pensioner have miss out on vital support this winter so will the minister tell we whether that be the plan all along to save money at the expense of the poor pensioner or will he admit that he have completely fail in his duty towards the poor elderly people in our society 
 the lesson i have learn be from the last government who put up pensioner poverty year after year it increase by over the course of the last government this government have run a pension credit take up campaign that have see an increase in application since july compare with the same period last year and more award compare with that period that be what a government do their job look like 
 that be more award than in the same period last year but people be eligible that be a pathetic achievement and the government have spend million of pound on advertise this we still have thousand of people wait for their winter fuel payment and the winter be over so it be a little late for the government ’s next advertising plan the fact be that we still do not know who have miss out what the wait time for those payment be and what the effect have be on pensioner poverty or on hospital admission which have increase significantly for pensioner give the scandalous failure of their pension credit campaign will the government release all available datum on the impact of the winter fuel payment cut 
 we have already release significant datum on that and as i say datum be release just week ago show the unparalleled success of the campaign to drive up pension credit take up now we be concentrate on increase support for pensioner right across the board because the big disgrace of the last government be where they leave the health service that our old generation rely on we be turn that around day after day 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of jobcentre on economic growth 
 support everyone to find good meaningful work and help they to progress be vital for economic growth that include disabled people who want to work and contribute but who be let down by the current system jobcentre have a key role to play in that and through create a new job and career service we will help more people get into work and get on at work support our ambition for an employment rate 
 i be fortunate in my community that we have an above average number of to year old but when i be talk to the manager of the hatfield jobcentre just last week they say that the single big barrier to young people get into work be their mental health which a number of colleague have speak about in the chamber today can the minister say a little more about our objective of help young people into work do he agree that the only way we will succeed in grow the economy be by help those people overcome the barrier with their mental health 
 my hon friend be correct to highlight the importance of tackle economic inactivity in order to drive up economic growth this government understand the negative effect that unemployment can have on mental health particularly among young people which can impact future prospect the youth guarantee will help address barrier face by young people to ensure that they can access quality training opportunity and apprenticeship or help to find work boost their confidence and give they the very good chance of success in the workplace 
 a few week ago i visit salisbury jobcentre and i meet kirstie reakes and george thornley who be help i organise a job fair on   thursday may they could not have be more helpful their encyclopaedic knowledge of the local job market and business be impressive will the minister congratulate they and thank they for the help they be give i with the job fair in salisbury guildhall on   may will he also reflect on what incentive jobcentre could have to reach out to business and deepen their knowledge of local labour market 
 the right hon gentleman be correct to raise the issue of jobcentre reach out to local employer we know that we have a significant issue with whether the jobcentre be the vehicle of choice to advertise local job opportunity that be a long stand issue that we be keen to address i be delighted to congratulate his local jobcentre on the work it be do to promote the job fair 
 what assessment she have make of recent trend in level of unemployment 
 official unemployment currently sit at which be clearly much low than the historic high of in june however today ’s official unemployment level mask the legacy of the conservative recent period in office which see the number of people off sick rise to nearly concentrate in place with employment rate well below the national average create a vicious circle where people be force to leave the place they love for the chance of a career and where those who be leave do bad and bad that be why as part of our get britain working reform we be build a new job and career service that will be locally tailor and will help everyone find access to support to get a good meaningful job and to progress in work 
 compare with this time last year almost more people be on the claimant count in basildon and billericay almost of those be under how many more will have to be make unemployed before labour ministers listen to charity gps supermarket manufacturer and care provider they visit i in my constituency and say that labour need to think again about its catastrophic national insurance rise which before it even hit in april be already cost the job of my constituent 
 we have a significant reform plan to make sure that we tailor jobcentre support towards the need of employer because there be still a significant number of vacancy out there that young people should be make the most of to start their career and progress in life that be why we have a new employer strategy so that the department for work and pensions can serve business properly 
 disabled people often face additional barrier when try to get back into work do the minister acknowledge that rather than freeze or cut their benefit we will need to invest in those people to help they back into work and to sustain they there 
 yes i do agree we see potential in every single person in the country and many of those who have be write off and leave on the scrapheap deserve a much well pathway back into work 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle fraud in the welfare system by serious and organised criminal gang 
 the department work collaboratively with other departments and with law enforcement agency on investigation of benefit fraud carry out by organise criminal gang new power in the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill which be mention early by the minister for employment will strengthen our ability to tackle organise crime by modernise and enhance our investigation power grant dwp official power of search and seizure and ensure that those who defraud the public sector face appropriate consequence 
 i welcome the new power in the fraud bill and note the huge increase in pension credit fraud in recent year can the minister explain how capital fraud and fraud in which recipient stay out of the country for long than the rule require which together account for of all pension credit fraud will be target under the new rule 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue the eligibility verification measure in the new bill will do just that provide a crucial data feed to help we identify fraud that relate to pension credit as well as to universal credit and employment and support allowance this will flag up claimant who be potentially in breach of eligibility under capital and abroad criterion so that we can start to lower the unacceptable level of fraud and protect the public purse 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of the pension triple lock on pensioner in north durham constituency 
 our commitment to the triple lock throughout this parliament mean that spending on the state pension be set to rise by £ a year individual be set to see increase of up to £ a year benefit pensioner in north durham and people in britain as a whole 
 i welcome the fact that the government be not only protect the triple lock for every pensioner in the country but tackle the big problem for pensioner by uprating pension credit by more than the rate of inflation encourage a high take up of pension credit and substantially increase funding for our nhs can the minister tell i how many pensioner in north durham currently claim pension credit and how many be entitle to it but do not claim it and could benefit from this increase 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of the increase in pension credit that will take place in just a few week time and i can tell he that about people be claim pension credit in north durham he be also right to mention the more than £ that the government be invest in the nhs the unacceptable state of the health service be the big betrayal of old generation by the conservative party and we be go to change that 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of unemployment in stoke on trent 
 in the year to september of working age people be unemployed in stoke on trent but as i say early that often mask big problem relate to economic inactivity frequently cause by ill health we propose to join up work health and skill support and to ensure   that local area throughout england have get britain working plan so that every part of the country have a plan to grow 
 it be clear that the government be make a serious attempt to remove the barrier prevent people with mental health condition from enter work may i issue an invitation to the minister and commend to she the work of the combine healthcare trust in stoke on trent and its peer support mentor these be people who have overcome mental health challenge and now work with other people struggle with their own mental health to build confidence and opportunity whatever plan the government introduce work of this kind should be central to it and i think that if they come to see it they would be very impressed 
 i would love to come to stoke—[interruption there be so many football relate joke that i could make at this point but i will not trouble the house i would love to come to stoke and not just on a wet tuesday night 
 my hon friend make the case for exactly the strategy that underpin our reform which be to join up health and work support i have see in my own constituency the power of peer mentor for mental health condition and i would love to come and see the brilliant work that my hon friend have describe 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the welfare system in support disabled people into work 
 many disabled people want to work but be write off and fail by the last government our work aspiration survey of health and disability claimant find that a want to work at some point in the future if their health improve or the right job be available and say that they would work now if they get the right support this government will ensure that disabled people who can work have the same right and chance to work as everybody else because that principle of equality be what this labour government be for 
 christopher a resident of talke in my constituency be badly let down by a flawed pip assessment that lack basic humanity and empathy with report of welfare reform in the medium he be now deeply worried about what the future hold what step will be take to ensure that people like christopher be treat with fairness and dignity and give the support that they need 
 i say to my hon friend and his constituent that treat people with dignity and respect be absolutely at the heart of this government ’s plan have be a constituency mp for long year under the conservatives i know that there will always be people who can not work because of the severity of their disability or illness but i also meet day in day out disabled people who be deny the chance to work for many different reason that be what we want to put right to ensure that the social security system be there for those who need it and not just now but for year to come 
 as the secretary of state look at reform be she consider the pip reassessment process for people whose condition will not get any well would it not be sensible to relieve they of the burden of that reassessment process unless they wish to be reassess that would be less distressing for they it would save money in the system and it would allow people who do need reassessment to be reassess fast 
 i agree with a lot of what the right hon gentleman say patience be never my great virtue but i ask he and the house to be patient and to look at the full proposal which we will put forward imminently 
 what step her department be take to support care leaver into employment 
 the department support care leaver aged to through an extensive range of intervention to help they into employment for example care leaver who start an apprenticeship be signpost to a £ bursary from their training provider and they can still receive universal credit if they be on a low income more broadly under the new youth guarantee all young people age to in england include care leaver will have access to support to enter employment education or training opportunity 
 some of care experienced young people be not in education employment or training time the average rate and that be cost the uk over £ a year in lose tax revenue alone we can not achieve the ambition of get britain work unless we unlock the potential of this amazing group of young people do ministers agree that we need to take bold imaginative action to radically improve the number go into work 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct to highlight those statistic the number of care leaver not in education employment or training be absolutely unacceptable and he will be stun to hear that i be in full agreement with he 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this week be sign language week and my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability will be speak in the backbench business debate to mark sign language week on thursday 
 this week be also neurodiversity celebration week neurodivergent people face particular barrier to employment with less than in in work everyone deserve the chance to fulfil their potential so we recently launch a new independent panel to advise we on these issue the expert on the panel include neurodivergent people themselves will present their recommendation to we later this year and i very much look forward to their finding 
 last week i visit the crumbs project in my constituency crumbs provide training for people with disability and mental health condition to get the professional skill they need to go into the hospitality industry and the personal skill they need to live independently and of its trainee move into employment give the secretary of state ’s commitment to bring people with long term health condition and disability back into work what more support can she give to successful programme such as crumbs 
 i welcome the work that crumbs be do in my hon friend ’s constituency i want to ensure not only that we overhaul our jobcentre have a new youth guarantee and join up work health and skill support through our get britain working plan but crucially that our jobcentre and other work closely with organisation such as crumbs because only by work together will we get the right support to help people on the pathway to work and to success 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we hear yesterday that the cabinet have not yet see the welfare plan that the right hon lady be apparently due to announce tomorrow give all the medium briefing the apprehension of disabled people and the grow number of people not work none of we would want to see that delay can she assure we that she have get collective agreement so that she can announce her plan here in this chamber tomorrow 
 the hon lady will have to show a little patience she talk about plan but we have see she and the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon mel stride make claim in various newspaper about their plan but there never be a plan the former chancellor   the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt actually admit that during the election when he say that the number have already be score the only thing that the previous government ever put forward be rule illegal by the court they have year to put this right this government will act 
 i listen hard to the right hon lady ’s answer but give everything i hear i still do not think she have the support of cabinet colleague with less than hour to go it be a no 
 there be never a good time for million of people to be out of work but as the world get more dangerous we can afford neither the benefit bill nor the waste of human potential give the opposition of the right hon lady ’s party to welfare reform can she assure i that her plan reform will grasp the nettle and bring the benefit bill down 
 that from a member of a government who leave in working age people on a sickness and disability benefit in young people not in education employment or training and people out of work due to long term sickness that be terrible for they for their life chance income and health and terrible for taxpayer who be pay for an ever spiral bill for the cost of failure unlike the conservative government who write people off and   then blame they to get a cheap headline we will take decisive action get people into work and get this country on a pathway to success 
 the number of young people not in education training or work be disproportionately high in area such as hartlepool something the conservative party do nothing about in year how will the secretary of state ensure   that opportunity for young people reach every part of our country 
 we will never get this country grow again unless we provide good job hope and opportunity in every part of the country include my hon friend ’s constituency he know that his region have of the high level of people not in education employment or training our youth guarantee will ensure that every young person be earn or learning and i look forward to work with he to deliver that on the ground 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 will the secretary of state confirm that those people in receipt of disability benefit who profoundly can not work will not face a cut in their benefit 
 i say to the hon gentleman just as my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability have say that we know there will always be people who can not work because of the nature of their disability or health condition and those people will be protect 
 for many people in dartford be give the opportunity to learn new skill would open the door to work particularly with the prospect of new infrastructure project such as the low thames cross on the horizon can the secretary of state reassure i that she be work with the education secretary to give all young people a route into good work 
 yes we be not only work together closely to expand the number of apprenticeship for young people but look at change the rule so that they do not always have to have the basic gcse math and english to get a new foundation apprenticeship i think we need to go far by work closely with school on friday in my own constituency i visit a school that be look closely at the risk factor for become neet not in education employment or training which be where we really need to take action 
 the secretary of state co chair the child poverty taskforce will she confirm that its brief will be very wide range include look at child in poverty in disperse rural community such as mine but also take practical step to tackle poverty among migrant child whose parent have no recourse to public fund 
 absolutely the child poverty strategy be look widely at how we can increase people ’s income include through work reduce cost ensure family    be more financially resilient look at issue like debt and saving and give all child the good start in life no matter their background or where they live 
 will the minister provide an update on the jobsplus pilot and what assessment have be give to its future roll out include widen it to include suffolk coastal 
 jobsplus pilot be launch in july and be help to address employment barrier for the resident of social housing community we plan to publish our initial evaluation in the summer which will help we to understand more about how this type of innovative community lead employment might support our vision to get britain work i look forward to work with all member especially my hon friend on the next step for this project 
 there be many fantastic organisation across bromsgrove and the village include legacy martial arts the basement project and the scout which do fantastic work to support young people the work do by the committed individual behind those organisation bolster the confidence skill and mental health of young people will the minister join i in thank those organisation for the work they do across my constituency will she outline what support be available to those organisation to support they in the valuable work they do 
 i absolutely join the hon member in thank all the organisation he mention if he could link they up with his local jobcentre we can help make the connection between young people who have suffer disadvantage and that really positive community support that be available for they in his constituency that would be very helpful 
 nearly in young people in the uk be not in education employment or training that be an year high give that slough be the youth capital of britain what be the government do to ensure that young people there have the opportunity to build the successful career and future that they so fully deserve 
 as my hon friend mention there be important opportunity in slough that the young people grow up there need to be able to take advantage of that be why we launch our youth guarantee as part of our plan to get britain work it will be there for to year old again i encourage my hon friend to work with his local jobcentre in slough as we improve the support available for young people 
 my constituent sarah leave an abusive relationship but after she apply for maintenance her ex partner deny parentage put the child through dna test delayed matter claim special expense and then declare nil earning despite have just buy a house with a mortgage all accept with no investigation he be now be ask to pay back his arrear of thousand of pound at £ per month what be be do to review   the burden of proof on income to support parent and child who be be financially abuse even after they have leave relationship 
 as the hon lady may know the department recently consult on a range of proposal for future improvement to the child maintenance service such as how we can protect people from financial abuse and well support victim of domestic abuse i be obviously not familiar with the specific of the case she reference but i would be more than happy to follow up if she write to i about it 
 pension credit claim as we have hear have increase by and i commend the minister and the department for make that happen as well as citizens advice in stroud and bureaux throughout the country however there be people who earn just above that limit and live in poverty i wonder whether when a fiscal situation arise the government will review the cap and indeed the gradient of this benefit 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight both the progress that have be make and the hard work of the voluntary sector include citizen advice bureaux across the country we must continue recent progress and we shall certainly do so i would like to highlight that our support for pensioner go far wide include the increase to the state pension and to the level of pension credit as my hon friend mention in just a few week time 
 at a constituency meeting last week i be tell that small business be start to ask employee to go self employ as they can not otherwise keep role open because of forthcoming national insurance contribution rise and extra employment law will the department watch out for this trend in its datum in case it be not the government ’s intention to make worker less secure with these new taxis and more regulation 
 since we take office we have publish research report datum and other bit of information that the department for work and pensions have previously be sit on the hon lady can rest assure that we monitor employment trend and be keen to ensure that the dwp be far more transparent about datum than it   have be 
 my constituent heidi recently move off benefit and back into work only to find she be earn less than when she be on benefit meanwhile my constituent tyrone be blind autistic and have cerebral palsy and although he be an aspiring dj may struggle to find permanent work what step be the minister take to ensure that we take a balanced approach support those who can not work with protection dignity and security while ensure that those who can go back   into work 
 my hon friend set out exactly the balance that we need to strike with our plan proper employment support on the hand which have not be available    in the past and deal with work disincentive in the current system on the other when he see the proposal shortly i think he will welcome the measure we be plan 
 can the minister reassure people who have have an amputation or have schizophrenia terminal cancer or uncontrolled epilepsy that tomorrow ’s announcement will not mean a cut in their social security 
 as we have already make clear today we be absolutely determined to protect those who need to be protect in the proposal we be bring forward i think the hon lady will welcome and be reassure by the proposal when she see they 
 there be currently thousand of disabled child and adult across the country include in hyndburn and haslingden who can not access their childhood tax fund how be the minister work to address this issue with the ministry of justice to help family to gain quick and easy access to these fund will he give further consideration to increase the scope of the dwp appointee scheme to cover child tax fund and junior individual saving account up to £ 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s interest in this subject which she and i have meet to discuss she be absolutely right there should be no barrier to young people and their family access these fund the ministry of justice have make some progress already i do not think the answer will be alter the dwp appointee scheme but there will be further progress to make thing easy 
 what be the minister ’s estimate for the number of pensioner who would qualify for pension credit but have not apply in north durham 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question the department for work and pensions do not produce datum at a constituency level but i will tell he the answer to his question at a national level much low than it be before this government come into office 
 support people back into work be not only the right thing to do for the uk economy but the fair and compassionate thing to do for people stick in the welfare system however over the past few day a significant number of people have contact my constituency office with profound concern about what they have hear and read in the press do the minister agree that by remove the culture of fear and create a nurture environment we can help people back into work and give they the support they need not just to survive but to thrive 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we be determined to provide proper support which exist in the past but disappear after we want to provide that support again because so many people would thrive if they have it at the moment there   be people out of work on health and disability ground who would love to be in a job if they just have the support we will provide it 
 for week the government ’s active trailing of welfare cut have generate genuine fear disabled people in brighton pavilion be write to i in terror will the secretary of state apologise for this and reassure the public that benefit change will not take place this calendar year or without parliamentary vote in this house 
 i recognise that there have be a good deal of anxiety and i regret that but there will not be long to wait the proposal will soon become clear the hon lady will welcome a great deal of the change that we want to make 
 as a human right city york believe that disabled people should be at the heart of all decision making how have disabled people form the minister ’s view in make these change have they be at the heart of the decision making 
 my hon friend be right our manifesto have a firm commitment that the view and voice of disabled people should be at the heart of everything that we do over the past week i have have discussion with a number of disabled people ’s fora when we come forward with our proposal shortly we will consult extensively with disabled people and their organisation about the right way forward 
 the government announce billion of cut to the department then over recent day minister have make u turn after u turn and in the medium round over the weekend be spin out of control be there anything meaningful leave to announce from the secretary of state ’s original welfare plan 
 the conservative party which leave a broken welfare system that be fail the people who depend on it and taxpayer have year to put it right we know what their legacy be hon member will see the proposal soon but we will not shy away from the decision that we believe be right to give opportunity to people who can work security for those who can not and to get the welfare bill on a sustainable footing 
 today ’s telegraph have do a right hatchet job on the most socially deprive ward in my constituency the people of the east marsh be sick and tired of journalist take a day trip to write their poverty porn story about people who be proud and keen to play their part in society in every way that they can they have seek to pit old people against young people highlight the neet record the young people in that ward be as keen to work as anyone else but they need the job to do it what discussion be the secretary of state have about that 
 there will be no great representative for her constituent than my hon friend who rightly say that they want the right chance choice and support to work as anyone else do that be why we be create   good job in every part of the country through our modern industrial strategy we be improve the quality of work and make work pay through our employment rights bill our get britain working plan will give the work skill and 
 order it be topical question i have a few member still get in 
 it be right that the welfare system support those with disability however do the secretary of state agree that social medium influencer who be teach people to game the motability system in order to get free vehicle be a disgrace if so what do she intend to do about it 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that this issue fall under the umbrella of wide fraud we inherit an appalling level of fraud in the welfare system under the previous government our fraud bill go some way to tackle that as part of a broad package of £ the large ever package for tackle fraud 
 give that nearly half of family in poverty have a disabled member and that without pip an additional disabled household could be push into poverty   i be concerned that the rumour cut will not help people into work but instead drive they far into destitution what assurance can the minister give i that the voice of disabled people have be hear and reflect on in the upcoming green paper 
 i give my hon friend a firm assurance that not only have we be listen but we shall continue to listen once the proposal have be publish 
 i have previously urge the secretary of state to liaise with the department for communities in northern ireland over its pitiful pursuit of benefit fraud in the same vein be the minister aware that of the new vehicle register in northern ireland last year be under the motability scheme be that not indicative of appalling abuse of that scheme will he raise with the department for communities what it be do about that 
 the motability scheme be highly value by disabled people around the uk if the hon and learn gentleman have example of misuse of that scheme i would very much like to see they but it be   a scheme that be greatly prize right across the house   i think he would discover that if he talk to other member about it 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make a statement on the sentencing council ’s publication of community and custodial sentence guideline 
 the sentencing council be independent of parliament and government the council decide on its own priority and workplan for produce guideline 
 the sentencing council consult the previous government on a revise version of the imposition guideline which include new guidance on pre sentence report that consultation run from november to february the previous government respond to the consultation on the guideline on   february the former sentencing minister   the hon member for orpington gareth bacon who be now the shadow transport secretary write to the chair of the sentencing council thank he for the revision to the guideline in particular he thank the council for full guidance on the circumstance in which court should request a pre sentence report 
 the lord chancellor be clear about her discontent with the guideline when it be publish it be our view that there should not be differential treatment before the law the house will be pleased to hear that the lord chancellor meet the chair of the sentencing council last week and the discussion be constructive it be agree that the lord chancellor will set out her position more fully in writing which the sentencing council will consider before the guideline be due to come into effect 
 in just day new tier sentencing rule will come into force these sentencing rule will infect our ancient justice system with the virus of identity politic divide fellow citizen on the basis of their skin colour and religion the rule will ride roughshod over the rule of law and destroy confidence in our criminal justice system the stake be high but the justice secretary seem clueless in fact she be not even here have the department conduct an assessment of the additional pre sentence report that will be require and the impact of that on the probation service give that it be already work above capacity be it consider provide the probation service with additional resource to cope with the extra demand do it expect the additional pre sentence report to lead to further delay in our court 
 i ask these question because not only do these new rule violate the most foundational principle of equality before the law but they also create immense pressure on the criminal justice system if the justice secretary want to stop tier justice she would have support my bill on friday she would have use her power of appointment to sack the individual who draft the rule time be run out and so be confidence in the sentencing council frankly the public be lose confidence in the justice secretary and her ministers too 
 i can not escape the conclusion that the justice secretary actually support these tier sentencing rule why because she support a group that call the criminal system institutionally racist her representative walk through the tier guidance and approve it and she   refuse to legislate to block the guidance come into force or to take any sanction against the member of the sentencing council that draft it if there be thing we know about labour government it be that they always end in tear this time it be a tier justice secretary pursue tier justice all to suck up to her boss tier keir 
 there be thing that we know about labour government they always have to clear up the mess leave by conservative government that be what the lord chancellor be do at the moment she be clear up the mess leave by the previous government the clog up the court the overflowing prison and the overwork probation service 
 get back to the fact of the case the lord chancellor meet the sentencing council last thursday and have a constructive discussion it be agree that she will set out her position more fully in writing which the sentencing council will then consider before the guidance be due to come into effect this be serious government not audition for government the conservatives be not only consult they welcome these guideline when they be in office the former minister for sentencing write a letter of welcome to the sentencing council set this out on   february there be a process in place now that need to be allow to play out we will not pre empt that process 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the sentencing council be it should not need say a non political body whose guideline be carefully draft and widely consult on these guideline receive positive response from the justice committee under its previous chair and from the previous government they do not require that a pre sentence report be order they do not limit who should be the subject of such a report and they do not tie the hand of the sentencer do my hon friend agree that by drag the sentencing council into the political arena without good cause the shadow justice secretary degrade both the sentencing council and himself 
 my hon friend the chair of the select committee make a good point about the way in which the shadow justice secretary conduct himself the important thing be that the lord chancellor have a constructive meeting with the chair of the sentencing council and there be now a process in place to address this issue 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i would like to think that all in this house believe in equality under the law in sentencing matter and otherwise but it be clear that tier justice have exist in our country have be govern by tier tories who think they could get away with illegal no party while the rest of we be tell to stay at home tier tories such as the shadow justice secretary who unlawfully approve a development for his donor and tier tories who have pummel our prison and crash our court leave victim to pay the price can the minister tell we   how he will reform sentencing in england and wales to protect the victim and survivor so let down by the conservatives 
 the hon member be perfectly right to underline the importance of equality before the law he give i the opportunity to give a plug to the independent review of sentencing be conduct by david gauke with an independent panel which will address the issue that he have raise 
 do my hon friend agree that if there be a tier justice system it be not the claim by the conservatives but it be certainly that be create by they where victim of crime be let down by delay where working class community see justice delay and deny and where the reality remain that black and ethnic minority defendant be disproportionately sentence do he agree that instead of play political game with sentencing we should focus on deliver real justice ensure that every decision make in our court be base on evidence not culture war or headline in right wing rag 
 my hon friend be right to contrast the approach of the soundbite from the shadow justice secretary with the justice secretary ’s approach of roll up her sleeve and get on with the job of sort out the mess leave in our prison probation service and court 
 just to be constructive for a moment and to try to get a bit of consensus surely no be suggest that anybody in parliament want to restrict the power of judge and their traditional right to sentence people accord to their own light all we be question be whether a quango like the sentencing council should try to stack the deck against certain group all we be say be that judge should impose sentence irrespective of people ’s race colour or whatever 
 the father of the house and my constituency neighbour bring a constructive note and i agree with exactly what he say we have an independent judiciary that we should let get on with the job 
 as a former magistrate i have be personally involve in sentencing decision and have rely on and can attest to the importance of pre sentencing report give as much information about an offender as possible before decide an appropriate sentence use properly they can cut reoffende rate do the minister agree that pre sentencing report should therefore be available for all offender and that access should not be determine by an offender ’s ethnicity culture or faith 
 my hon friend be exactly right that pre sentence report play an important role and we ought to applaud the work that the probation service and other do in prepare those report she be exactly right to point to how effective they be in help with sentencing 
 the minister be right to stress the independence of the sentencing council but would he accept that he can not criticise the shadow secretary of state for have a view on these draft guideline when the secretary of state herself do exactly that i also ask he to consider in this debate the real purpose of a pre sentence report it be there to give more information about an offender but it also enable a judge to impose a non custodial sentence if they believe that be the appropriate course it be hard for a sentencer to do that unless someone have be assess as suitable for a community penalty whatever the right and wrong of this debate be it not important that the sentencing council make clear that what be important in decide whether to ask for a pre sentence report be whether that extra information be need and not anything else include protect characteristic 
 that be exactly what the lord chancellor be say 
 do the minister agree that there be a fatal flaw in the case of the shadow justice secretary his party work for month to develop the very guideline about which they now complain do the minister far agree that rather than desperately score an own goal for his party the right hon member should get behind this government ’s reform to clear up the mess leave by the conservatives 
 to be fair to the conservatives they do not work on the guideline but they be consult on they and they do respond to they in a positive way 
 i note the comment by the chair of the sentencing council lord justice william davis who say that both labour and conservative ministers or their representative have know about the plan since and do not object while i be disappointed that the government be only act reactively now do the minister not agree that the shadow secretary of state have no shame and that it be hard to take his faux outrage seriously when this be just another audition for tory leader 
 the hon lady have say what everybody else in this house and outside it be think 
 do the minister agree that the conservatives have some explain to do give that the sentencing council ’s consultation on the guideline that recommend differ approach for those from an ethnic minority background be undertake during the previous government that the previous government be a statutory consultee and that it be welcome by the government at the time 
 my hon friend be exactly right the previous government be fully involve in the consultation and not only be they fully involve but they welcome it 
 come to this fresh as without a legal background it seem to i that there be matter here of very great importance that ought to be properly debate by this house   do the minister agree that this be yet another classic example of where the much vaunted separation of power be likely to interfere with the process 
 this be the consecutive week in which we have discuss this in the house we discuss it in the lord chancellor ’s statement we discuss it at justice question last week and we be discuss it again today 
 i thank the minister for his response it have already be mention that pre sentencing report be important for judge however do he agree that pre sentencing report should be available for all offender and that their availability should not be determine by an offender ’s ethnicity culture or faith far to what   the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde   say we also have a tier probation system under the last government 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend ’s point 
 do the sentencing council understand that with these guideline it be totally out of touch with the mood of the british people totally out of touch with the mood of the government and totally out of touch with the mood of the house and therefore why will it not agree to delay these guideline until they have be properly debate in this house 
 to be fair the chair of the sentencing council meet the lord chancellor last week and it be a constructive meeting he be await a letter from the lord chancellor which he promise the sentencing council will consider and respond to before   april 
 as a former local authority lead for youth justice i see at hand how important pre sentencing report can be in shape effective and progressive outcome in justice however it can not be right that access to they be determine by factor such as race and religion i applaud the justice team for make such a strong and robust response to the sentencing council ’s guidance so far can the minister assure i that unlike the last government who be clearly asleep at the wheel during the consultation we remain willing to take whatever action be need to uphold this important principle 
 i agree with my hon friend that the last government appear to have be asleep at the wheel rediscover their mojo only once they be in opposition 
 last week the prime minister announce that he be abolish nhs england to make sure the nhs be bring back under democratic control will the minister be lobby the prime minister to abolish the sentencing council to make sure sentencing be bring back under democratic control 
 i thank the former common sense minister for her question 
 you would not understand common sense 
 if the right hon lady stop gabbling and listen i will attempt to answer her question 
 i think the right hon lady be get a little ahead of herself there be a process in place and there have be a constructive meeting with the sentencing council a letter be be send to the sentencing council and the sentencing council will respond 
 i do not believe the shadow secretary of state believe that the law be currently apply equally and free of structural bias but give the unfortunate politicisation of all this do the minister now back the chair of the sentencing council who say that the state should not determine the sentence impose on an individual offender and that sentence guideline of any kind if they be to be dictate in any way by minister would breach an important principle 
 certain thing be a matter of policy and they be for the government and for parliament we have have a constructive meeting with the sentencing council a letter be go to the sentencing council and the sentencing council will respond we totally respect the independence of our judiciary 
 just the other week the lord chancellor make it clear that she do not agree with the direction in which the sentencing council be go and i think we all hope that her meeting with the sentencing council will produce result however if they do not will the minister commit to work across party i think there be a real commitment on the opposition benches to work with he to bring forward emergency legislation if that be require 
 i thank the right hon member for the constructive tone of his question i refer he to the point about our not want to get ahead of ourselves we need to allow the process to go forward and to respect the sentencing council ’s role in it we will address thing when we need to address they 
 we be in the bizarre position where the body that advise judge on how to judge may decide to go to court for a ruling on whether ministers have the power to tell judge what to do what preparation have the minister ’s department make for that possibility 
 i be afraid that i be become a bit repetitive there be a desire from opposition members to rush ahead and i have great respect for that—[interruption well you have year and what do you do in they interruption sorry mr speaker not you opposition members be try to rush ahead we will take thing steadily at the right pace with proper respect 
 on a point of great importance to the lord chancellor she be reduce to ask the sentencing council to change its mind the former minister for common sense be right there be a lesson here for all parliamentarian about the way we delegate power to quangos that then come up with solution that we clearly find repulsive 
 there be a constructive meeting if the right hon member have be in it i do not think he would have see it as somebody ask there be a constructive exchange of view and there be a proper process in place which i be confident will come up with the right answer 
 it be obviously ridiculous that the justice secretary be on her knee before a quango ask it to respect the principle of equality before the law but this be not the only example the judicial college ’s equal treatment handbook say 
 to treat some person equally we must treat they differently 
 will the minister condemn that logic and say no we must not treat defendant differently because of their race or religion 
 the government do not believe that there should be differential treatment before the law the lord chancellor have be very clear about that the equal treatment bench book to which the hon member allude be write by and for the judge minister have no involvement whatsoever in its content 
 do the minister agree with i and many of my hon friend that policy decision by unelected non departmental body such as the sentencing council be erode public confidence in our democratic institution will he commit to scrap such body so that policy be always make by ministers who be directly accountable to this house 
 policy decision should always be make by this house the hon member be absolutely correct about that the background to where we be today be that the sentencing council consult the government of the day member of whom be now on the opposition benches the member of that government be asleep at the wheel now it be down to this government yet again to pick up the piece they leave for we and sort out their mess 
 my constituent be confused about the justice secretary ’s position she say she believe that these sentencing guideline be wrong in principle and that they amount to differential treatment before the law but she be in government she have the power and the tool at her disposal to stop this and change it why have she not do so 
 i have try to explain this and i will explain it once more the justice secretary the lord chancellor have be extremely clear that she believe in equality before the law and she be not happy with the guideline that be why she write as soon as they be publish unlike conservative members who have sight of they early in the consultation they go far than ignore they they respond to they in a very positive way 
 order i know you like to think that in order to keep talk a bit—[interruption of we be go to sit down it be not go to be i minister there be other thing to do and point of order to follow 
 the minister be an honourable man and i have to ask a question on behalf of the victim if he do not mind he will understand that any reform of sentencing must have victim at its heart for most victim their concern be not the ethnicity of the perpetrator but the severity of the crime and the last impact on their life many victim today will feel that the sentencing guideline play politic with justice how can victim be assure that justice will mean time serve for crime commit and will not be base on ethnicity justice be blind and so must sentencing be 
 the hon gentleman will not be surprised to learn that i agree with he the victim minister my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones be sit next to i we take victim very seriously that be why there be a victim representative on the sentencing review panel we need to make sure that victim be at the centre of whatever we do i have meet too many victim already in this role and every time i meet they it be very difficult a little difficult for i but hugely difficult for they because they live this 
 it seem like every week we be back here deal with culture war 
 order be that a reflection on i grant the urgent question i be begin to feel that it be aim at i we have this urgent question today because i think it be appropriate not because we have it every week right let ’s have somebody else 
 judge by the lack of action it appear that the justice secretary be comfortable with change that she have describe as tier come into effect in just week we have hear that she be unhappy if she really be can the minister tell the house and the country what the secretary of state be do other than hold cordial and cosy meeting to prevent tier justice 
 the lord chancellor have make her position clear she immediately meet the sentencing council and she be write to it again to set out her concern and the sentencing council have commit to respond to they quickly 
 the minister complain about have to explain the government ’s position but why can he not just explain to we why the secretary of state have not fix this issue yet it seem that there have be a meeting but she have not even write a letter in the last week explain what she want to happen that be why i thank you very much indeed mr speaker for grant this urgent question again the minister have not actually fix the problem that we be all talk about 
 the consultation be hold under the previous government who not only express no concern but welcome what the sentencing council be do immediately on see the guideline as draft the lord chancellor act to sort out the mess leave by the conservative party 
 the minister say that the situation be completely clear so i feel like a bit of an idiot for ask for more clarification but i will anyway pre sentencing report be allow to take in further background on the life of offender from an 
 ethnic minority cultural minority and/or faith minority community 
 what be the definition of a cultural minority and be our veteran consider a cultural minority 
 the hon member read out a phrase that be welcome by the previous government but that the lord chancellor be object to and talk to the sentencing council about 
 on wednesday i challenge the prime minister directly on tier justice and give he the opportunity to confirm that he would back the shadow justice secretary ’s bill to stop this in its track in his attempt to scramble out of give that commitment he say something which have be repeat today that the previous government be consult on and welcome the guidance however the sentencing council have already put in writing that the wording be different and so would lead to a materially different outcome the government fail to take the opportunity that the shadow justice secretary present they with to block this change be the prime minister right in what he say or be the sentencing council right they can not both be 
 the letter the previous government write to the sentencing council during the consultation be clear the previous government be not just consult they welcome the guidance the initial version of the guidance include reference to specific cohort of offender include ethnic minority 
 on a point of order mr speaker in his response to the urgent question the minister have repeatedly tell the house that the previous government approve the guideline in particular he besmirch the name of the former sentencing minister my hon friend   the member for orpington gareth bacon what the minister say to the house today be wrong on page paragraph of the sentencing council ’s letter of   march   to the justice secretary it make it perfectly clear that the guideline publish under this government be materially different from those consider by the prior government in fact the minister ’s official be present at the meeting of the sentencing council at which this version of the guideline be sign off will he take the opportunity to correct the record i be afraid that he have mislead the house not once not twice but on numerous occasion today and that be quite wrong 
 order nobody mislead the house the right hon gentleman mean inadvertently mislead the house 
 i do hope it be inadvertent mr speaker 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i do not believe that i inadvertently mislead the house 
 with permission i shall make a statement about last week ’s meeting of g7 foreign ministers we meet at a pivotal moment some member of this house may have doubt that we could find common ground and some of our global competitor may have hop that we would fail but after hour of talk we be unite britain unite with our ally to make our citizen more secure national security be a foundation of this government ’s plan for change and we be lead from the front 
 the override priority be of course ukraine last week in jeddah the united states and ukraine reach a common position a ceasefire offer be now on the table and american weapon and intelligence be flow once again this demonstrate what this house have always know to be true under president zelensky ’s leadership ukraine be serious about peace sincere in its effort to pursue a just and lasting end to this appalling war and unrelenting in its determination to ensure that ukraine remain democratic free strong and prosperous 
 at the g7 the uk and our ally be unite in our unwavering support for ukraine ’s defence of its freedom unite in support for ukraine ’s pursuit for peace and unite on what be require to make that happen now it be putin who stand in the spotlight putin who must answer and putin who must choose be you serious mr putin about peace will you stop the fighting or will you drag your foot and play game and pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummel ukraine my warning to mr putin be this if you be serious prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now 
 on whether putin will deliver i must tell the house that i see no sign yet that he will the g7 meeting help we ready the tool to get russia to negotiate seriously we be not wait for the kremlin if it reject a ceasefire we have more card that we can play we can all see the impact that the g7 ’s unprecedented sanction have have on russia ’s falter economy social spending be down and inflation and interest rate be sky high there can be no let up in our effort in canada we discuss where we can go far to target russia ’s energy and defence sector far squeeze its oil revenue and use frozen russian asset
