 i thank the minister for his response there be a willingness to meet net commitment from business all over the united kingdom   of great britain and northern ireland so would the minister be prepared to introduce a scheme whereby small business can access funding to implement infrastructure change in their business to help they achieve net and will this be available to all part of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 the hon member raise a very important point it be something that we look at all the time and certainly we have have discussion on the matter we already have programme in place include the £ that we distribute through the british business bank that support nation and region fund some of that will certainly help business to access finance to decarbonise we look at those measure all the time and we be happy to work with he on future programme that we might roll out 
 i call the shadow minister 
 small and medium sized enterprise be a vital part of a thrive global economy yet of british sme say that they lack the time or resource to sell internationally they be be hinder by complex regulation insufficient access to funding and inadequate government guidance that be why labour have launch the small business export taskforce with the federation of small businesses to listen to business need and address they head on what be the minister do to support hard work sme in navigate the government ’s complex web of regulatory requirement and help unleash this untapped entrepreneurial potential 
 we agree with the hon gentleman on the ambition but he be probably behind the game a little in term of what we be actually do not least in the free trade agreement that we have agree include the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership that be come down the track i hope that he will be supportive of that agreement he have probably also never hear of the export support service the international trade adviser and the export champion all of which help our sme export to other part of the word 
 i call george freeman 
 may i take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the secretary of state—[interruption sorry question

 will the secretary of state and her team pay much more attention to the science and innovation possibility in the hydrogen sector that is hydrogen energy and power this be something we be good at and the research be there we need to be there quickly before the chinese dominate the market 
 i gently say that the hon gentleman should pay attention to the hydrogen strategy which show we be lean forward and ensure that we can capture the investment de risk any of the testing and ensure that intellectual property can be commercialise here in the uk we of course see hydrogen in the mix in our future energy spectrum 
 what assessment her department have make of the implication for her policy of trend in the level of operating cost for small and medium sized enterprise 
 the government have take action to help sme deal with cost of living pressure include freeze fuel duty maintain the 5p cut for a further year introduce the energy bill discount scheme and reverse the national insurance rise in the autumn statement the chancellor announce   a substantial business rate package to support the uk ’s small business worth £ over the next year 
 notwithstanding what the minister say i be still frequently be approach by small and medium sized enterprise in edinburgh west that be struggle to meet soar energy cost stave off inflation and deal with brexit red tape the number of scottish sme in financial distress be up accord to research and those be formerly strong stable and well manage business they have a huge impact on employment in tourism which be of our main industry will the minister tell i what more the department will do to reassure business in my constituency and elsewhere and whether he will ask the chancellor to do more in the forthcoming budget to help they 
 the hon lady raise important point of course the chancellor can do nothing if the scottish government do not pass on our support to scotland which they have not do for business rate i know that that be out of her hand but it be a point she may want to raise with the scottish government the average pub in scotland be £ bad off a year than its english counterpart because they have not pass through that rate support the average restaurant or guest house be £ bad off than its english counterpart and closure rate in scotland be high than in england 
 i call the shadow minister 
 business closure now exceed new business opening with business across the uk closing in the high since record begin this week the financial times report that more than business be on the verge of collapse former prime minister johnson use an expletive to describe his party ’s commitment to business his successor well and truly deliver on that commitment by crash the economy be it not time the government put business out of their misery by call a general election so that the country can get back to business 
 on this side of the house we be for business because we be from business and we understand the need of business 
 so be we 
 that be an interesting point that the hon gentleman make from a sedentary position the actual number of closure although of course we be concern about increase be below pre pandemic average but nevertheless we have step in to help by freeze fuel duty maintain the 5p cut and announce £ of business rate support all to help our sme closure rate be low in england than in labour- run wales

 the uk be a lead advocate for human right around the world when we have concern on human right they be raise directly with partner government include at ministerial level and that include india trade negotiation with india be continue to build on our £ trading relationship and get well access to consumer 
 i thank the minister for his answer but an industry risk analysis dataset show that india rank among the bad perform country for human right abuse across a host of key industry my question be a specific and i would like an answer please have the government consult human right monitor body and expert and be the government actively consider the impact of this deal on human right abuse in india 
 i congratulate the hon and learn lady on her recent election as chair of the joint committee on human rights the uk engage regularly with the indian government and other government around the world bilaterally and multilaterally where we have concern on human right we raise they directly with the partner government include at ministerial level 
 i must say though that i be not entirely sure that whatever we do on human right will make any difference to whether the snp will support this trade deal it be not only fan of free trade agreement who have notice we have all notice that the snp have never support any trade deal negotiate by either the eu or the uk it have abstain on japan and singapore and have be against canada australia and south korea and even against ukraine interruption 
 do not tempt i you be do well i call the snp spokesperson 
 i would like to give the minister another chance because that be pretty dismal stuff even by his standard india have of the poor human right record in the world when it come to child labour to give the minister an opportunity to get we to a position where we could potentially support a deal will he explain how ministers and the government be engage with negotiator in india to tackle child labour there and to ensure that the united kingdom do not become complicit in that exploitation 
 of course the uk have a very proud record on labour standard and on raise these issue with counterpart at all level lord ahmad be in india just a couple of week ago raise specific human right issue include a case that the snp have raise frequently the government be proud of our record on labour protection and have be clear that an fta with india do not come at the expense of labour standard but may i refer the hon gentleman back to the rhetorical question when will the snp ever support a trade deal with anybody 
 minister you know it be not your responsibility to ask the question it be for other to ask you the question come on you know well than that as an ex chair of the conservative party 
 what step her department be take to help protect supply chain in the context of the houthi attack in the persian gulf 
 what step her department be take to help protect supply chain in the context of the disruption to trade in the red sea 
 more than of global shipping traffic pass through the red sea make it of the most important strategic waterway in the world overall a whopping of global trade volume use this trade route and my department be monitor the impact of event in the red sea closely i be previously the shipping minister and now i be the minister for advanced manufacturing so i know that this be important to industry 
 we be work to equip uk business with the tool they need to deal with global supply chain issue just last week i publish the world ’s ever critical import and supply chain strategy in collaboration with industry the strategy include make the uk government the centre of excellence for supply chain analysis and risk assessment support our status as the world ’s large manufacturer this will help uk business to build secure and reliable supply chain which be vital to the uk ’s economy national security and the delivery of our essential service 
 i be sure the hon gentleman do not need to ask a question now with all you have read out come on sir michael 
 i will think of mr speaker as my hon friend have say we be the large manufacturer in the world and where be the centre of manufacturing it be of course the west midland what advice be my hon friend give to people such as andy street about what can be do to support business in the west midland to overcome what i hope be a temporary difficulty 
 my hon friend have hit so many marker in that question he be absolutely right that the west midland and birmingham in particular be the heart of advanced manufacturing i suggest that the mayor catch up on supply chain reporting i be more than happy to sit down and talk to he about that we have work with industry include in the automotive sector to ensure that supply chain can be as flexible and resilient as possible of course there be concern about extend route from that part of the world into europe but as i mention early we be the country in the world to produce a strategy work with industry to ensure that the uk continue to provide the datum that it need 
 order come on i call nicola richards 
 at a time when we be begin to see inflation fall recent development in the red sea be extremely concerning not just in term of security but   because of the huge cost to shipping my constituent do not want an increase in price as a result of the terror attack can the minister build on the excellent answer she give to my hon friend   the member for lichfield michael fabricant   by reassure business in my constituency that we will do all we can to maintain the flow of good to and from the uk 
 absolutely the uk will always stand up for the freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade we take threat to shipping vessel in the red sea extremely seriously my hon friend be right to note that fundamentally there have be an increase in cost potential include a increase in freight rate which be why we have produce a strategy and why we have a council that will continue to work with industry to ensure that supply chain be resilient and the situation have the small possible impact on our economy 
 what step her department be take to support business in rural area 
 the government provide extensive business support for all business include those in rural area as a member of parliament for a rural constituency i be keenly aware of the difficulty that apply specifically to rural business because of their location with other departments we focus on access to energy and we work with the department for education on apprenticeship we also have the british business bank ’s recovery loan scheme and the start up loans company which improve access to finance to help business to invest and grow i believe that that package help rural business 
 the secretary of state will be aware that the sutherland spaceport could be a fantastic boost for local business equally float offshore wind in the north sea present opportunity for the wick and scrabster harbour to underpin that we need the transport infrastructure the public service obligation for wick airport run out in march this year with no word from the scottish government on whether it will be continue it would be a fatal blow if not and then there be the abject failure to invest in the a9 promise after promise after promise have be break what advice do she have for i 
 i would ask the hon gentleman to speak to the snp lead scottish government who be responsible for much of that investment it be a real shame that the snp government do not care about rural business or small business in scotland office for national statistics figure show that scotland lose more than business last year and they be mainly the small business employ up to people however i take his point about infrastructure we have to look at that on a uk wide basis and i be prepared to look in a little more detail at what my department can do to support he 
 i think that my right hon friend be do a great job for rural business however the met office which be under her   stewardship be responsible for provide wind forecast which be particularly important give that the orwell bridge be close recently i would like there to be more transparency and specifically for the met office to publish the wind speed on its app so that there be transparency for all business and the bridge be not close unnecessarily 
 that sound like a significant issue however i be pleased to say that the met office be the responsibility not of my department but of the department for science innovation and technology we can raise the matter with dsit colleague to ensure that they look at it as quicky possible 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the welsh government on the adequacy of government support for small business in north wales 
 i regularly meet ministers from the devolve administrations through inter ministerial fora to discuss a range of policy issue sme across wales have access to a range of uk government service to help they to grow and thrive the uk government also recently announce that we will appoint new international trade adviser in wales to provide tailor support for welsh sme exporter to take advantage of new export opportunity 
 the labour welsh government be reduce rate relief for the hospitality sector from to in april follow that announcement monmouthshire county council which be also labour run call on its colleague to maintain support at the same rate as in england business owner have criticise the welsh government say that it would be deeply unfair but the outgoing minister have reject their call and a number of hospitality business have already close their door this year will the minister join i in urge the welsh government to maintain the support that business need instead of cut their foot from under they just because welsh labour can not manage a budget 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right the welsh labour government need to start support business and to maintain the relief rate as we be in england the welsh government have also cut the budget of business wales from £ to £ figure from ukhospitality show that the average pub in wales will be £ bad off as a result compare with england for the average restaurant that figure will be £ and for the average hotel it will be £ i do not know who will be in charge of labour in wales but it be about time that it start to back welsh business as the uk government do 
 what recent step her department have take to help increase foreign direct investment into north northamptonshire 
 the department for business and trade have do a lot to bring foreign direct investment into the uk just last november we raise £ at our global investment summit specifically for north northamptonshire my hon friend will be pleased to know that his constituent can take advantage of the dbt national and regional investment team which work with local partner to provide support for foreign investor who wish to invest and set up in the region 
 recent inward investment into the kettering constituency include the ball corporation from the us build europe ’s large and most modern aluminium drink can manufacture plant in burton latimer create new job will my right hon friend congratulate and thank ball for its confidence and investment in north northamptonshire ’s manufacturing economy and encourage other to see kettering with its superb connectivity and motivated workforce as an ideal location for further investment 
 i be extremely pleased to be able to do so i congratulate and thank ball corporation for place its investment in kettering that be exactly the sort of investment that we want to see all around the uk it be the levelling up agenda writ large i also thank all the official in my department but especially my ministers who travel all around the world include to the us to promote the uk we never talk this country down we let people know that this be a great place to do business and we be see the benefit of that strategy 
 when she plan to bring forward legislative proposal to exonerate the remain sub postmaster with criminal conviction relate to the failure of the post office horizon system 
 on   january we announce the government ’s intention to bring forward legislation within week to overturn the conviction of all those convict in england or wales on the basis of post office evidence during the horizon scandal i meet the justice secretary only this week to make sure that those plan be on track and we hope to bring forward that legislation as soon as possible 
 do the minister have an estimate of how many conviction be make during the horizon pilot will he confirm that those conviction will be include in the legislation give that they be not make use horizon datum 
 we do not know that number yet but we be very concerned about people who use the pilot version of horizon and be potentially subject to similar abuse we do believe they fall under similar compensation scheme and there be no reason why they would not be cover by the legislation to overturn conviction 
 for the legislation to work postmaster have to come forward when i ask of my constituent this weekend why they have not come to i soon they say it be because they have sign a non disclosure agreement but also because they have have to sign the official secrets act i think that be so bonker that i do not believe it until i read page of nick wallis ’s book which say that postmaster do have to sign the official secrets act if that mad policy be still go on will the minister bring it to an end will he tell postmaster all over the country that they be completely at liberty to talk to their mps about any aspect of the post office 
 i thank my right hon friend for all the work he have do in this area i understand that the requirement to sign the official secrets act relate to the confidentiality of mail it do not relate to the confidentiality of issue regard mistreatment by post office ltd. my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise that point and i will certainly raise it with post office ltd but i can confirm that that would not prevent somebody from speak out include to their member of parliament 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the minister know that we be willing to work with the government on a way to exonerate the sub postmaster and get they compensation as quickly as possible the proposal will have to be imperfect but they represent a clear option for resolve this terrible issue as a way to ensure safeguard against any potential future misuse of precedent could cross party agreement be establish as an essential provision for the exercise of power of this kind 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the constructive way he have engage with we on this issue i know that the justice secretary speak to the leader of the opposition this week on this very matter and we be very keen to engage with the hon gentleman too he be right to say the solution be imperfect we believe it be the least bad option but of course we will engage with he and make sure that he feel the legislation be in the right place 
 i be grateful to the minister for that answer and i hope that exchange give some reassurance to all colleague in the house will he confirm that all prosecution that arise from the horizon pilot scheme will now also be include in the exoneration give that although people be technically prosecute without official horizon datum it be very much the same issue 
 again the hon gentleman raise a very important point similar to make early the circumstance be similar so we feel there be no reason to exclude people who have be convict in similar circumstance again i be happy to work with he on that issue 
 what recent assessment she have make of the principal barrier to trade for importer 
 the government be commit to break down barrier to trade through our ambitious programme of free trade agreement in august last year the government announce the border target operating model which will simplify border process for both import and export these change base on smart use of datum and technology will put in place new security and biosecurity control while ensure they be as simple as possible for business to comply with 
 the time delay border check will come into effect very soon but those deal with plant and animal health product be seriously worried about potential delay indeed the chair of the horticultural trades association have point out that the process of import a petunia from the netherlands have already increase from to step and he warn that the 
 new border be a disaster wait to happen 
 what be the minister do to ensure that we will have a plentiful supply of import red rose for valentine ’s day especially for all those conservative on the other side who love each other so much 
 i be feel the hon gentleman ’s love this morning mr speaker 
 we have consult very widely on the border target operating model we have put in a lot of time and effort we have do a lot of consultation we have be run webinar and put out leaflet to make sure that business be aware and the introduction of the model will of course be stag 
 the hon gentleman need to be careful about what labour ’s plan will be this week the eu ambassador to london reveal the fact that labour ’s desire for a food and veterinary agreement be likely to lead to close dynamic alignment between london and brussels in the future which be directly against his party leader ’s state policy of no dynamic alignment 
 what step her department be take to encourage sub postmaster who be affect by the failure of the post office horizon system to claim compensation 
 what step her department be take to encourage sub postmaster who be affect by the failure of the post office horizon system to claim compensation 
 over £ have be pay to victim we encourage anyone impact to use the compensation scheme available we have already publish the detail of the up front £ fix sum offer for group litigation order postmaster on the gov.uk website create a new claim form and write to all eligible member of the glo scheme to explain the offer far 
 the post office horizon scandal have shock the nation my constituent kym ledgar receive a settlement under the historical shortfall scheme which   do not take into account the enormous stress the extra work in try to balance the book the damage to her reputation and the price she and her family pay in lose income have have to make up the shortfall herself do the minister agree that we need to acknowledge the wide cost of the post office ’s appalling behaviour will he meet i to discuss how those who accept an offer under the historical shortfall scheme may now receive compensation that truly reflect the impact that the post office ’s conduct over decade have have on their life 
 i apologise on behalf of the government to kym ledgar for what she have be through it be absolutely our intention that everybody get full and fair compensation and that be not only for financial loss but for non pecuniary loss we have take a number of step to ensure that the compensation be fair and deliver swiftly include by establish the independent advisory board on which the noble lord arbuthnot sit we will continue to work with the board and consider what further action be require but yes i would of course be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these matter far 
 the post office horizon scandal have make clear to we all what happen when whistleblower be ignore or silence do my hon friend agree that as well as ensure that victim be properly compensate we need well legislation to protect whistleblower as the government ’s whistleblowe framework review draw to a close will he meet i to discuss how the outcome of the review can be use to support the whistleblowing bill that i present to the house yesterday 
 i thank my hon friend for all her work at point we be co chair of the all party group for whistleblowing and she do a tremendous job in raise this issue time and again in the house we be currently review the effectiveness of the whistleblowing framework in meet its intended objective every scandal that i have talk about in this house over the year from the back benches and the front benches have come to light because of whistleblower who be hugely important we be review that frame- work the research for the review be near completion the government will set out the next step in due course and yes of course i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that 
 i too have a constituent who although she be thankfully not prosecute be force over a period of more than a decade to pay back thousand of pound every year and it amount to a figure sum as   the hon member for stoke on trent central jo gideon   say this be not just about that pecuniary loss this be about the impact on my constituent ’s family i will not go into her personal detail but they take a real hit and i wish she have come forward to i soon i meet she a couple of week ago and it really have wreck her life she have not yet have any compensation through the shortfall scheme so i urge the minister to ensure that such people be properly compensate 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to raise that point yes the compensation scheme be there to compensate and provide redress for financial loss   but also quite rightly for personal loss loss of reputation impact on health those kind of matter there be route open to compensation the £ fix sum award which be pretty much an immediate payment or someone can go for a full assessment of loss which take into account all those matter interim payment be also available we have pay out £ in total across the scheme i be happy to help the hon lady with that specific case and we be look to try to expedite the payment of full and fair compensation to all individual i be work on a daily basis to try to do that 
 what step her department be take to help tackle late payment to small and medium sized business 
 the government be commit to tackle late payment that be why we launch the prompt payment and cash flow review which be publish alongside the autumn statement the review include amend payment performance reporting requirement for large business and provide the small business commissioner with more power to investigate late payment 
 small business be the backbone of our economy but unfortunately late payment continue to blight the ability of small business to trade with an average of £ a year be lose unfortunately that be on the increase with a increase in i appreciate what the minister say about another review i think we have a few year ago but what specific action be the government take to address this appalling abuse of power which be contribute to small business go under a year 
 the hon lady be right to raise this issue and early i set out specific action such as give the small business commissioner more power and produce league table we work closely with the good business pay campaign which produce league table on this issue and name and sham the people responsible be important the government be lead the way and from april firm bid for government contract worth more than £ will have to demonstrate that they pay their invoice within an average of day tighten to day in april and to day in the come year 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the chancellor of the exchequer on take fiscal step to help support the steel industry 
 the chancellor and i meet regularly and obviously we know and recognise the importance of the steel sector in the uk economy our commitment to the sector be clear and we will be invest more than £ in the port talbot site to ensure that   steelmaking continue in the uk without that investment the job at the port and the job in the supply chain would have be at risk 
 we be work with tata and we have set up a transition board the hon gentleman know about that because we both serve on it and we have provide more than £ of support for affected employee and the local economy last friday tata announce that it will provide an additional £ of support for employee face redundancy the option be steel- make no long continue at port talbot or the investment that we have provide 
 minister keep spin this line that tata steel be threaten to close down the port talbot work and walk away but they know that be an empty bluff because the cost of dismantle and remediate the port talbot steelwork be vast and utterly prohibitive against that backdrop let we be clear be it the case that no string be attach to the £ of taxpayer money that have be give to tata steel be that £ give by the prime minister to tata steel with a green light to make steelworker redundant 
 i would not want steelworker to think that we be not work together and the hon member and i work together and will be work together to ensure that steelworker be protect as much as possible i think it be extraordinary that the position he be now put forward be that it would have be well to risk the absolute loss of steelmaking in the uk and then allow the taxpayer to pick up the cost to manage the site 
 it be a bluff 
 i believe it far more preferential that we make the large investment ever in steelmaking to protect more than job at port talbot and the job in the supply chain—[interruption fundamentally we have steelmaking 
 order it might be well that that conversation be carry on outside rather than go on across the benches while the minister be reply 
 at the heart of our decision be thing continue steelmaking at port talbot and protect steelworker 
 we have recently hear from my right hon friend the secretary of state for defence how the west be face a pre war world will the minister ensure in her conversation with the treasury that it understand the vital strategic importance of a virgin steelmaking capability here in the uk 
 my hon friend have a huge amount of knowledge of the steel sector and be a huge champion for scunthorpe she know that we be work incredibly hard with the company in her constituency and we be wait for it to respond to the business plan go forward we know how important virgin steelmaking be   and we accept because technology have move on that go forward of all steel can be make in electric arc furnace 
 i call the shadow minister 
 mr speaker 
 the uk steel industry the trade union and labour be propose an industrial policy worthy of a serious industrial country 
 those be not my word but those of the world economic editor of the daily telegraph writing yesterday he also say that 
 the government ’s minimalist plan do just half the job leave the uk with a stunted tier industrial base the only g20 country lack a sovereign capability in weapon grade primary steel 
 he be right be n’t he 
 the £ that labour be propose have no plan behind it and we be not tell what hard worker across the country would have to pay to fill that black hole labour have ask for a transition to green steel it would want we to protect steelworker and obviously would want to protect advanced manufacturing in the uk customer want clean steel port talbot could no long function with its age blast furnace and our package will save job at port talbot 
 what step she be take to help support the growth of co operative and social enterprise 
 this week i speak to a conference attend by build society about how we can increase presence on the high street to help with access to cash and finance facility the government provide extensive business support to all business include social enterprise and co operative the british business bank ’s recovery loan scheme and start up loan improve access to finance to help those kind of business to invest and grow 
 co operative and social enterprise business provide a fairer way of do business involve member in great business decision and provide economic growth for local area however they be be hold back by financial and regulatory constraint will the government match the labour party ’s and the co operative party ’s ambition of commit to address those challenge and double the size of the co operative sector 
 personally i be a big fan of co operative movement and the regional mutual bank system in germany which i have speak about many time in this place of course the government support the co operative mutuals and friendly societies act which help to maintain the status of co operative social enterprise and co operative can also access support via the business support helpline as well as help through our website and our network of local growth hub 
 what step her department be take to ensure that regulator support economic growth 
 at the autumn statement we announce the decision to extend the growth duty to ofgem ofwat and ofcom alongside a series of reform to the duty to hold regulator to account for deliver growth in the sector they regulate we be also currently consult on proposal to strengthen the economic regulation of the energy water and telecom sector 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer but on retain eu law reform in the june to december reporting period there be only regulatory reform of note which be on wine marketing and working time calculation the rest be technical correction what step be she take to speed up reform of retain eu law to ensure that regulation work for business and enable growth 
 i be glad that my hon friend read the report that i send out this week on what we have be do however i disagree that only reform of note have be deliver we have repeal or reform more than measure the port services regulations which be not design with uk port in mind be an example we have also pass the financial services and markets act and the procurement act i remind he that that list be what we be use the schedule for and there be many other mechanism in the retain eu law programme to deliver on that road map so that we improve our economy and make it more competitive by make sure that our law be tailor to our economy 
 in support of economic growth   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss   cut £ from environment agency budget when she be at the department for environment food and rural affairs rather than bring economic growth that serve to bring sewage growth sewage discharge double between and i be delighted to hear yesterday that the government will adopt my water quality monitoring bill but will they also restore some of the cut environment agency funding to bring back power as well as duty 
 a spending review where we can look at these thing will be come up shortly but i really have to challenge much of what the hon gentleman say it be a misrepresentation to say that the issue go on with sewage be to do with the action of my right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss this government have be take reform through the environment act to improve the situation throughout multiple government include the in which his party the liberal democrats participate during the coalition so it be very wrong to make that case 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as secretary of state for business and trade i be committed to ensure the resilience of the uk ’s critical supply chain last week the government publish the critical imports and supply chains strategy to help uk business build secure and reliable supply chain our point action plan will help business to deal well with global supply chain issue from overcome bureaucratic barrier to deal with severe shock cause by event such as the pandemic russia ’s war in ukraine and the attack on the red sea that have threaten a key route for global trade dbt lead the development of the strategy which be shape by the experience of uk business i be delighted that representative of industry as well as key international partner join we at the strategy ’s launch at heathrow airport which be of course the uk ’s large import hub by value 
 mr speaker i wish you and the rest of the house a happy burns night for this evening be it not a scandal that the only way to get the great chieftain o the puddin race export to the united states be by send the vegetarian version hon member oh could not the secretary of state put that into her point action plan and get on and do something or do she want to risk forever be know as a cowran tim’rous beastie laughter 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his esoteric question we be continually remove barrier to us uk trade and we be trade with the us more than ever before if he have a specific example that i can help with so that he can enjoy his burns night i would appreciate it if he write to i and we will look at the matter in detail 
 with many bank close on high street the post office be pick up so much slack but in rural area the limit place on the amount of cash that can be pay in at the post office be have a real impact on business for instance pub have a lot of cash but can not pay it in because of the limit can the minister review that and ensure that the post office can take far great volume of cash from rural business 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his work on this matter which he and i have discuss on many occasion the limit be there to try to prevent money laundering but it be important that the check be proportionate i have raise their impact on a number of occasion with the financial conduct authority and uk finance there be more transparency now and they be work more effectively i know that the wonderful ingham ’s fish and chip shop in filey now experience few problem when it pay in money at its local post office there be a great opportunity not just for inghams fish and chip shop but for the post office banking framework to make that relationship more lucrative 
 i call the shadow minister 
 postal worker be the bedrock of our community but they be be force to work at unsustainable level something that sadly have not be recognise in ofcom ’s   report on the future of universal service obligation the input of postal worker be critical to a successful royal mail so please can we have confirmation that their view will be consider in any future decision 
 that would make perfect sense we read the ofcom report into the review of universal service obligation with interest our clear position be that we will retain a day service for our citizen and business but those view will be take into account 
 the secretary of state have often state her support for post brexit regulatory reform and divergence and do so again in answer to an early question be she in a position to deny report in   today that the government have pledge to introduce a requirement that all future regulatory change will be screen to ensure that extra barrier in the irish sea be not create that could be a significant impediment to divergence from eu law 
 i can not comment on the ongoing northern ireland political process to which i be not a participant however it be clear that we retain the ability to diverge i agree with my right hon friend that if we be to seize the benefit of brexit we need to find that comparative advantage over the eu in our regulation otherwise there would be no point i remind she that i be the business secretary who make sure that there be transparency rather than an invisible bonfire in what we be do on eu regulation i end the jurisdiction of the european court of justice on   january we have a comprehensive deregulation programme which i be push i understand her concern and i will speak to colleague across department to ensure that they be raise at the high level 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 will the secretary of state please confirm that this government have no plan to alter the legislation on the marketing of infant formula and other breastmilk substitute 
 the hon gentleman raise an interesting point i be very happy to write to he about it 
 royal mail customer will have welcome the minister ’s reassurance this week about rule out a reduction to the current day a week service however many customer already feel short change by what be often an inadequate service in their area do the minister agree that any propose change must protect the small business whose business model rely on the day service and customer right 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue the service have not be satisfactory and royal mail have be fin £ by ofcom as a result it have employ more postal worker to address those problem and we be see some improvement but he be right to raise the point about our day service be vital to business particularly those in the magazine and greeting card industry 
 what assessment have the minister make of the result of private sector trial in relation to the introduction of a day week will he meet i in due course to discuss the result of those trial 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question it be clearly up to business to decide if they want to trial a day week we have make no assessment of any result it be our belief that we should not run a stalinist economy where we tell private sector business how to operate their workforce and on what day of the week he may differ on that particular perspective but we have introduce important reform that help business work more flexibly include the flexible work change that be introduce recently 
 the gosport branch of asda be the in the uk to ballot for strike action employee cite issue include low staffing level health and safety and delay equal pay claim consider asda ’s importance to the uk food chain and employment across the country what power do the minister have to ensure that both worker and consumer be protect 
 my hon friend raise an very interesting point we have look at this particular situation with interest and will continue to monitor it clearly asda be a private company and it be up to it to decide how good to deploy its workforce but i be very happy to continue our conversation and i appreciate her engagement on this issue 
 a lot of concern have already be express in the house this week about the steel industry with the expansion of renewable across scotland and the rest of the uk there will be demand for the vital material require to build more wind turbine which may now need to be source from abroad will the secretary of state tell we what step will be take to try to provide the vital material for an important industry 
 it be really important for we to not misrepresent what be happen on steel our steel industry be not disappear our steel industry be evolve we will continue to have significant steelmaking capability in the uk include produce material for the industry the hon lady talk about but we should also remember that the change to port talbot be part of the decarbonisation that all opposition members have be ask for this be the big single emitter of carbon in the uk and this house vote to reach net by everything we be do be to ensure that we do that in a sustainable and sensible way 
 follow on from the question by my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft for the sake of clarity can the secretary of state confirm that it remain the government ’s position to ensure that the uk have the capacity to produce virgin steel here in the uk 
 the government maintain that we want to ensure that we keep steelmaking capability in the uk at the moment we import ore to make steel   when we talk about virgin steel many people assume there be no import in the supply chain but there still be even now and whatever change we make will require some import however we be make sure that our steel industry be more resilient than ever before at a time when it face oversupply from china and india that be the real problem face by the steel industry in all of western europe we do a lot with tariff measure such as steel safeguard

 obviously it be important to secure investment in mining in cornwall particularly the mining of lithium which will be critical for our car battery i certainly agree to be interrogate by the appg of which my hon friend be a powerful leader and i congratulate she on secure that investment in cornwall 
 could minister fix the illogical loophole face by pixipixel a lighting and camera hire firm in acton it supply the equipment for the series of a popular itv drama call grace which be set in brighton but because of ofcom rule about the imposing of regional spending on public service broadcaster it have now be ban and gazump by a company in manchester can this be sort out because 
 i call the secretary of state 
 it be have a punitive effect on business within the m25 
 order the secretary of state take advantage i do not want the hon lady to do exactly the same 
 i believe that this might be an issue for the department for culture media and sport but if the hon lady will write to i we can look at that specific case 
 i be grateful to the minister for work with i on the issue of button battery safety and grateful for the ongoing commitment of the work group that be set up in follow the tragic death of of my constituent harper lee fanthorpe and the campaign for harper lee ’s law will the minister meet i to discuss progress and in particular how the guideline draw up by the office for product safety and standards can be make compulsory so that more death and injury from button battery ingestion can be prevent

 ferguson marine the last remain shipyard on the low clyde be threaten by the way in which its current work be configure it badly require an order from calmac for small island ferry the issue of procurement be for the scottish government and their agency but will the minister ensure that no impediment no obstacle and no rule that be under her control will prevent the order from be give directly by the scottish government to ferguson marine if they so wish 
 i be more than happy to sit down with the hon member to discuss further his case but the override fact which he mention be that the decision sit with the scottish government in the uk we have the national shipbuilding office which provide a wraparound service not only to secure contract but to ensure that ship be build in uk shipyard 
 importer of short life item in my constituency such as seed potato and chill equine semen be worry    about impend import control will the minister meet i and business leader in north shropshire to discuss how they can continue their business in the face of these imminent problematic control 
 of course i shall be happy to meet the hon lady but let i remind she of what i say early the border operating model be introduce after extensive consultation with business lead by the department for environment food and rural affairs with the agrifood sector there have be plenty of opportunity for feedback from business but i shall be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss specific case 
 i be sure that the secretary of state share my desire to revitalise our fantastic local high street flitwick town council plan to do exactly that but it need support from the community ownership fund may i urge the secretary of state to look favourably on its forthcoming application 
 it be good to see the hon gentleman work so hard for his community the community ownership fund sit with the department for levelling up housing and communities but i be sure that if he make representation to those in the department they will be able to give he a more substantive answer 
 and the final short!—question come from barry sheerman 
 will the secretary of state look at the impact assessment of university the traditional university be fail to meet the standard of sustainable development research and manchester huddersfield and newcastle universities be do much well will the secretary of state look into that and push the other university to do well

 can she confirm that she will table a motion forthwith to ensure that lord cameron come to the bar of the house to answer question and statement as the committee recommend the next foreign commonwealth and development office question be on wednesday so the motion should be table before then 
 despite war in the middle east conflict in the red sea russia ’s ongoing illegal war in ukraine and the venezuelan threat to guyana the foreign office have fail to meaningfully update parliament on these international flashpoint it have offer only statement since november with mr speaker have to grant urgent question on these matter instead it be just not good enough 
 we have have week of ad hoc business statement to bring in emergency and urgent legislation the king ’s speech legislative programme announce just month ago have almost run out with all the unused parliamentary time there be no excuse for ministers not come to parliament or get on with their day job we have have another week of ministerial failure with secretary of state fail to show up there be no secretary of state to speak about steel either today or during the week which be insulting to the steelworker who face redundancy 
 the secretary of state for education do not show up either she have have no legislation for month yet the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in school shamble drag on and now we understand that the much need flagship childcare policy be in chaos can the leader of the house shed more light on this how many parent of year old who qualify and want to take up the offer of free childcare in april will not be able to access it and will the roll out to month old baby go ahead in september as promise minister seem unable to give those assurance and provider be clear that the government ’s flagship roll out be a sham 
 another week go by with a fail government who have run out of road be out of idea and be fail to deliver on their basic promise that be now the verdict of conservatives as well with the prime minister ’s own pollster have conclude that they be not 
 provide the bold decisive action require 
 and that

 let i turn to the hon lady ’s point she speak about the work the house of commons commission on which we both serve have be do on the exclusion of member of parliament who be consider to be a risk to other on the estate she will know because she be on the commission that we agree with the proposal that have be bring forward we be wait for a motion to be bring to we by the house that happen late last week and we will shortly table that motion for member to see and then bring it forward 
 the hon lady mention the work that the procedure committee have do on lord cameron the foreign secretary i thank its member for their work and the hon lady for the evidence she give to that inquiry we have receive that report this week and will shortly be respond to it i hear her plea to act before next wednesday but she should have say next tuesday because that be when the next fcdo question be 
 i join in what the hon lady say about the work that the jo cox foundation have do through the commission it be very important that we protect democracy we all know that democracy be under attack and civility in politic be incredibly important as be demonstrate as she say in the form of the late sir tony lloyd 
 in that spirit of the commission ’s recommendation let i deal with the charge that the hon lady have make against our record and that labour have level against our prime minister our prime minister be a man whose migrant parent make sacrifice to ensure that he could have a good start in life he work hard to make the good use of every opportunity he be afford he study hard he push himself he have many career option but he choose a life in public service represent god ’s own country he protect this nation and livelihood from the great financial and health crisis since the world war he have rise through hard work courage and determination to be this country ’s british asian prime minister 
 the prime minister have show global leadership on many challenge face this country he be a wonderful dad he give quietly to charity he run for his local hospice he be a cricket fanatic he still attend home game at the football club he support despite be prime minister and despite it be southampton he be a shareholder in community pub and patron of the leyburn brass band he do not just get britain he represent the good of great britain the great thing we have to offer the world include our value of hard work enterprise take personal responsibility and help other 
 he be in no way confused about where his duty lie people will not find he tax education or deny other the opportunity he have have vote against strengthen our border side with militant trade union against the public compromise our energy security or nuclear deterrent oppose the deportation of foreign criminal scratch his head about the monarchy duck difficult issue or support   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn if the leader of the opposition be a weathervane our prime minister be a signpost he know what he stand for he know where the country need to go he have a plan to get we there and that plan be work 
 further business will be announce in the usual way 
 that bring i to a slightly difficult problem bob blackman be mean to be represent the backbench business committee to tell we about its business but unfortunately he be not here so i now call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 i associate myself with the remark about holocaust memorial day i ask the house to note that tonight be burns night when we celebrate the work of scotland ’s great national bard 
 a new year a new tory civil war just what the uk need with talk of doom loop massacre and extinction if only members of the leader of the house ’s party have listen to she the last time she woo they for leadership she warn they that if they vote for the former chancellor as leader it would murder the party i know that the leader of the house be furiously busy with all her minister for clickbait responsibility those anti scottish article and sneer video do not write themselves but as her government grind punch drunk and exhausted to an election should we not debate some of the key legacy of the last year of tory rule 
 where should we start there be still the scandalously unresolved scandal such as infected blood the waspi woman women against state pension inequality campaign and post office horizon to name a very few but have the leader of the house have time to reflect on recent comment from sir michael marmot professor of public health at university college london he say that britain in be start to suffer from victorian disease again and that 
 britain have become a poor country with a few rich people it ’ bad to be poor in britain than in most other european country poor people in britain have a low income than slovenia 
 perhaps the leader of the house will cast her eye over the late joseph rowntree foundation report which say that more than in people be in   poverty in with about in very deep poverty that same year have she not manage to look at that yet that be unsurprising as the tories seem genuinely untroubled by poverty in the uk my colleague and i have ask they about it many time but their eye just glaze over comfortable i guess with the choice they have make as the pm have say 
 perhaps we should start our tory legacy debate with an emerge threat the electoral commission chair warn recently that the government ’ strict new rule on voter id risk exclude certain voter group and leave the conservative party open to the charge of bias i and many other have think for some time that this be simply an attempt at voter suppression from the government so do the leader of the house agree with an erstwhile cabinet colleague that the new tory rule be simply as he put it an attempt at gerrymandering will she bring a debate on this important issue to the house before the next general election 
 what a bunch of rotter we be with our anti scottish article it appear that the hon lady be plan to follow in the footstep of many a great antipodean election guru by use a brilliant new strategy of equate criticism of the snp ’s performance with criticism of scotland itself the latter be a landmass of approximately square mile populate by brilliant creative stoic people the former be a ramshackle separatist movement full of people who have turn maladministration into an art form 
 there be tiny flaw in this new political tactic from the snp if we conservative dislike scotland so much for some reason the hon lady never get round to explain why on earth would we strive so hard to keep it part of the union of the united kingdom why would this conservative government give scotland the large funding settlement it have ever have why would we have offer its citizen who be wait for nhs treatment additional help and option which the scottish government turn down 
 if i want to do scotland down i would join donate and campaign for the snp to whose member i would point out that the trailblazer for bring back victorian disease to britain be glasgow watch the hon lady ’s inaction and that of her party be like watch your much love neighbourhood be clobber by a bunch of gangster let we call they the hole in the budget gang hit business take your cash make your life a misery and keep the local police force very busy this new political strategy from the snp like everything else that it do will fail 
 i call the father of the house 
 will my right hon friend ask the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to make a statement next week on the instruction to the advocate for his department at the holocaust memorial bill select committee yesterday on a number of occasion the lead advocate say that the design have not be award to sir david adjaye or that he be not the architect

 some time ago the scottish government refuse an instruction from the information commissioner to publish write evidence from the hamilton inquiry into the conduct of the former minister nicola sturgeon last month i attend the court of session hearing at which the scottish government be humiliate at great public expense in their attempt to reject the request despite a unanimous ruling against they by the high civil court in scotland the scottish government still refuse to release that information that extraordinary behaviour would appear to be in breach of the ministerial code the civil service code and indeed the rule of law may i ask the leader of the house whether the rule of law in scotland be at risk and whether we can have a debate and a statement on this matter 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this matter and the disturbing issue surround it although there be a debate about whether the court decision be bind or be bind in a particular way we consider it to be a matter of accountability to the scottish parliament i be sure that the scottish parliament will be ask question of their government in relation to those very serious matter which my right hon friend have raise today 
 may i inform the leader of the house that we already have a holocaust memorial centre at the university of huddersfield at the heart of huddersfield all members hope that the new holocaust memorial centre at the heart of westminster will happen soon be i right in believe that an illustrious ancestor of her raymond postgate write a book call the common people be she aware that common people in my constituency and up and down the country be be dreadfully exploit via rachmanite landlord they be be give a miserable life with rack renting or let every room in the house as a bedroom what be go on in the rented sector be a scandal may we have a debate on that 
 i thank the hon gentleman i learn something new every session i shall have to investigate the half of his question but he be absolutely right   to raise the plight of tenant who either be in unsuitable accommodation or be be exploit by their landlord the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have do an enormous amount of work on that issue both on build quality and ensure that tenant be protect and i shall ensure that he have hear what the hon gentleman have say 
 energy national policy statement have a significant impact on my constituent i be grateful to my right hon friend ’s official and her parliamentary private secretary for find some information in advance i know that the statement be lay before parliament on   november and it be then declare in a write ministerial statement that they have be approve by parliament although i have return to the back benches after many year i remember that the government in the past lay a resolution before the house and i participate in that debate on   july i do not believe we have have a debate on these particular statement so i would be grateful even if we have go past the legal deadline if my right hon friend find time for 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise that question the secretary of state for energy security and net make a write ministerial statement on   november   present the revise energy national policy statement for parliamentary approval she deposit copy of all those document in the libraries of both houses and they be available on gov.uk she also send a letter to all hon member on   january   highlight the scrutiny period of the nps follow the expiry period of day no objection be receive and the secretary of state designate they on   january i fully appreciate that while all the i ’s have be dot and the t ’s cross my right hon friend and other members may feel they have not have the chance to discuss or offer their opinion on they she know how to apply for a debate but i will certainly ensure that the secretary of state have hear her concern 
 i be pleased to hear this week that the uk government have recognise the funding pressure on local council in england and confirm that there will be barnett consequential however we in scotland can only hope and as a keen follower of the problem that we have with the scottish government the leader of the house will be aware that it be probably a forlorn hope that the scottish government will use the consequential to cover funding gap in our local council and speed up repair to mould and damp in social housing which be become a critical problem in edinburgh we have a housing crisis and even as we speak my council and other across scotland be try to figure out how to fill the gap that the scottish government have leave i be however disappoint that there be no clear mention in the statement about how the uk government would enforce measure in awaab ’s law to improve social housing may we have a statement on the step the government be take to enforce those new rule if only to provide a template for the scottish government on how can support local council 
 i think the hon lady for her question at the last oral question the levelling up secretary highlight that local authority have be give the chance to take of the receipt from right to buy and invest they in social housing we have provide a very good funding settlement to the scottish government at least more funding per head than the uk government spend on the same thing in other part of the uk but more often than not the scottish government do not pass that funding either to local authority or in the case of support for business to those business that be a very sorry state of affair if it could be rectify we would have a much well chance of deal with the issue she raise
